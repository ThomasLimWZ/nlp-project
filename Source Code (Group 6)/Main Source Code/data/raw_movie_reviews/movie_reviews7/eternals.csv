"7","/10","Underrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8549850/?ref_=tt_urv","breneff","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur71174029/?ref_=tt_urv","17 September 2022","I personally feel like this movie is very underrated. It's not as jokey or flashy as any of the other Marvel movies but that's kind of why I like it. It felt less like a superhero movie and more like an art film about gods and what it does to your psyche when you live for such a long time on the planet that's not yours.There's a lot of different diverse personalities in this and it shows interesting ways of how these characters and not only cope with their longevity but also take advantage of the world around them. Even though the characters seem wooden in the beginning of the movie as time goes on you start to at least in my opinion connect with them and their relationships to each other. I love the fact that the humor isn't over the top and one is there it's to help you understand the characters more instead of just being goofy for the sake of being goofy.The main point of the movie is basically about the passing of time and what it does to people. Hence the song played over the marvel logo being Time by Pink Floyd. As time goes on these characters change how not only how they feel about each other but humanity all together, for better or for worse.There are also twists in the movie that I did not expect that were pretty surprising. Without going into much detail I like the fact that all of these characters are kind of in the gray and aren't 100% good guys or bad guys. It feels more like a Snyder film in the sense that it's less about superheroes being quippy and trying to save the day and more about imperfect gods trying to figure out what there purpose is.To a lot of people this felt like a huge step backwards for the MCU. For me this was a refreshing change of pace for these movies.The only negatives that I will say is that I did not care at all about the romance between Ikaris and Sersi. There was absolutely zero chemistry between them. Also, personally, I can't stand Sprite. She is an insufferably selfish character she just came off as super annoying.","102 out of 137 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Eternal was the Runtime","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7540315/?ref_=tt_urv","view_and_review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3670492/?ref_=tt_urv","12 November 2021","I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute.","564 out of 846 found this helpful.

"7","/10","I don't understand the hate","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7868189/?ref_=tt_urv","justin-marshall5","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24195159/?ref_=tt_urv","15 February 2022","Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.","79 out of 116 found this helpful.

"","","Neither Intrigues Nor Entertains","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7756979/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","14 January 2022","The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.Co-written & directed by Chlo√© Zhao (The Rider & Nomadland), her latest effort opts for a slightly different path that at times avoids or escapes the familiar trappings of a standard Marvel fare but then its attempts to forge its own identity is executed with such blandness that there is no life to it. The film is devoid of the fun & fascinating qualities of its studio's finest works and neither its storytelling nor its ensemble compel us enough to give a damn.It is an ambitious undertaking no doubt that intends to explore a few interesting ideas but Zhao goes for it without working out the fundamentals first. She aims for the intimacy with surface-level digging into these superpowered beings but with there being no incentive for us to even bother, the emotions & warmth don't shine through. Add to that, the story is needlessly overlong, tediously paced, and is filled with characters without camaraderie with one another.Overall, Eternals is a dull, lifeless & forgettable addition to Marvel Studios canon and also happens to be one of their rarest gambles that doesn't pay off the desired dividends. While the diverse ensemble is a welcome move from the inclusivity standpoint, the actors are more or less wasted in their roles and aren't given anything interesting to leave their imprint upon. It remains to be seen how this chapter plays out in Marvel's Phase 4 plan but as a standalone entry, Eternals is mediocre at best.","150 out of 229 found this helpful.

Which is nonsense by the way. That is how the real world is. It does have its flaws but it's not nearly as bad as people rate it. These 2 & 3 ratings are nonsense. Those people who wrote those might want to try watching movies from a long ways back were they did put out some good movies but also put out tons of trash. This is most certainly not trash. It's pretty good. Decent humor, good action and a good story. Pacing and some of the dialogue is subpar. I will Also say that its run time is a bit much. I actually enjoyed this movie though and I'm very much not disappointed or think that it was a waste of time. It's a very unique take on the internals. I will say that Sercy and Icarus chemistry could've been better. It has its flaws but if you want to sit back and watch a unique interpretation of a comic book Then give it a shot.","51 out of 75 found this helpful.

It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises.

Multiple relatively unknown new characters and their dynamics, their stories spanning centuries.It was definitely not a typical Marvel fare that at least I'm acclimated with. Watching this movie, it didn't feel like it's an MCU movie. It was different, something unexpected.I do understand some people not liking this movie. I have some criticism too, like the editing in the beginning seemed a bit sloppy. And watching it in IMAX, the transition between aspect ratios was not smooth, very apparent and a bit distracting. The visuals on the other hand were amazing. Some of the action sequences were really good and were executed perfectly (like the usage of hand held camera during a fight scene between a deviant and Ikaris in Amazon).Overall, it felt nice to witness something very different from MCU. I am eager to see them try new things and take their world to different directions and keep it interesting and unpredictable.","31 out of 45 found this helpful.

Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chlo√© Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chlo√© Zhao didn't rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn't care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars.","420 out of 604 found this helpful.

Even though it's not fully explained for the Eternals, almost each character will get (a part of) their story explained. This takes time and some might consider this too long with a slow pace. However very necessary for the film.Could've used a little more action, but think upcoming film(s) will have more of that and maybe even some solo films?

I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless subplots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot I enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes are interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie. I hope the bad reception doesn't discourage them from being ambitious in the future. I'm afraid they might stick to playing it safe to avoid another underperformer.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars.(3 viewings, opening night IMAX 11/4/2021, IMAX 11/17/2021, 4/30/2023)","1,092 out of 1,817 found this helpful.

It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film.

However I was fairly invested in the story and the movie overall left a good taste.+
The movie has Great Cast. Almost all the actors did a great job and characters were memorable. My favorites are Sersi, Ikaris, Thena, Kingo, Phastos and Makkari. It's not like every single one of them has an arc or anything ... but they all do leave some impression and are likable characters.I really liked this movie's aesthetics, from the Deviants to superpowers. The music was nice and there are some beautiful shots throughout the film.I really liked the lore with the Celestials. That part had some cool visuals!I also liked the philosophical questions the heroes face in the story. Even though I felt like it could've been handled a little bit better.-
The first half could be boring tho. In fact, I have a strong feeling that a Lot of people are gonna find this movie boring. There aren't THAT much action. And most of the action scenes are Fine.The first act in particular has some time-jumps and it can feel a little bit messy.Even though I initially gave it a 7, I do have a feeling that the movie is gonna age poorly upon Rewatch and Rethinking... Just like Black Widow.There are many scenes that are supposed to be emotional. And some moments in the final act are indeed emotional. However, in the first act of the movie there are moments where you are supposed to feel something but you just can't. There are not enough development done so you are not feeling the necessary emotions...The Deviants looked cool but that's it. Nothing special about them.+
Back to positives.... I really liked Makkari, the depiction of her speed power is, IMO, better than that of MCU quicksilver and dceu flash. I really hope we see her speed force more.Overall, the movie does kinda feel different from the other MCU movies. Some parts are messsy or boring, but great cast, visuals and lore made this movie overall good.7/10

I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.The whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible 'inspirational' life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.It played like it was constructed from a ""making big budget films for dummies"" book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.Shoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn't hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I'm all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film's story was concerned.Slot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!My eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.I don't know quite where the problem was. Chlo√© Zhao's direction by committee choices? It wasn't all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who's character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.Then they started fighting each other, and they're Eternals and can't die, except when it's convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly.","88 out of 141 found this helpful.

Solid story line from beginning to end. However I do think that the movie would have done better had it been a stand alone movie & not part of the MCU, it being part of the MCU seems to make it more complicated & convoluted. This problem does seem to cause some plot holes that they try to cover or explain, but that's not truly enough for me. But on a good note, I do find the fighting very interesting to watch they seem to move different when you compare their style to that of Iron Man or Thor. In the end people can find problems in the characters , the plot or the message, just give it a chance & a watch.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I will add that I went into this movie not knowing much about who the eternals are and where exactly they fit into Marvel's giant universe.Let's start with the positives. Visually, it's one of the best looking films in the MCU with stunning action sequences. The characters are quite compelling for the most part and each of them bring a different flavour to the overall story. I'm very interested to see what the future holds for each of them as the film does enough to peak further interest. The acting is very very good. The challenge with these films that introduce multiple characters in one go, is that often things can feel clustered especially if the acting sucks. However, Marvel yet again has done a great job with the casting choices for each of these characters. In typical MCU fashion, the film also contained a few comedic moments which were well timed and didn't feel forced in any way.On the down side, the film suffered a bit with its overall story. Eternals deliberately tries to be an emotional story that emphasizes the uniqueness of humankind and why its worth saving. While the message is clear enough in the film, the problem is that its just difficult to truly feel the impact of the emotional moments with a new batch of characters and in the space of just 150 minutes. I feel like Eternals would've been better off initially as a Marvel series, giving viewers time to learn more about their place in the MCU and to better connect with each of the characters. That being said, I still think the director did a pretty solid job in putting together a film with so many diverse characters without it feeling overcrowded. If anything, I have more questions now then ever before which is not a bad thing going into this new Phase of the MCU.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's unfortunate that many ideas that make a lot of sense here have already been overused in many films before such as intricate holograms and sky battles.The acting is great. The natural source of the jokes means they land more effectively than the usual MCU 'quips' and a good part of this is down to Kingo and Karun. Set, costume and special effects are gorgeous.

Yes it's not perfect as if any Superhero movie was perfect. Too many new characters, a VERY abstract villain, silly flashbacks and the acting can feel too theatrical at times. But it has engaging characters, some funny scenes instead of continuous one liners and real emotional moments. It expands the story possibilities into a cosmic world and for once has something resembling a true love story.It was weirdly reminiscent of the good aspects of Twilight to me.People need to stop relying on RT critics numbers because this movie is far superior to many recent Marvel movie. Antman & the Wasp was a big low for me with boring new characters, the most insipid villain and barely any action. I hated Captain Marvel and its predictable twists and ugly action scenes, Black Widow was more generic than a Mission Impossible sequel and I thought the Falcon/ Winter soldier show was a total disaster of forced wokeness and pseudo political issues.Yes the Marvel movies we all expect are like Shang Chi: shiny action, wild chases, down to Earth characters with a joke a minute, OTT CGI of monsters or robots and a vague family drama we can all relate too. But I don't think Eternals is an accident, I think it offers an alternative and a more mellow adult vibe to the usual fairground rides...Sure it would have worked better as a Disney + TV show because you probably needed 5/6 hours to truly tell this story with a proper pace, understand the characters and feel the sense of what they went through during thousand of years rather than just jumping between flashbacks, character introductions and Deviants scenes until the clunky rushed climax.But I absolutely loved the effort. (plus I can't wait for Black Knight!)","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

Even the casting felt out of place, like anyone off the street can be made to look and act as a superhero. Jolie seemed bored. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were the only convincing performances. Even each Eternal's superpower was lame, and confusing what exactly they can do (except Madden with his X-Men eye power). The one girl was a deaf Flash? It took four to five writers to come up with this slow-paced 156 min Eternally long and boring nonsense? What a waste of a budget. It's a 6/10 from me.

Its a two and half hour film but doesn't seem to be boring. Yeah it's a slow movie as compared to other MCU films but that's what makes it unique. The slow parts are also very interesting as the conversation between the Eternals makes us understand a lot of stuff which is quite important in the story. The movie was shot and edited beautifully, the Deviants had flawless designs as well as when you see the celestials you know how giant and powerful they are. Cloe Zhao's direction was pretty good.Still having so many positive points, it's not the best Marvel movie. It felt sometimes very predictable, I missed a proper ending, it was like too smooth and when it ended I was like ""Okay, that's it?"" . Also one other problem is that they are completely different from other Marvel stuff. We haven't seen a single character once and we don't relate to them as much as we relate to Thor, Spiderman etc. And then Introducing not one but TEN Eternals at time, it didn't allow me to make them emotionally attached to me as much as it needed to be. But I can't think of a better way to do it. It was just a very little time to introduce that many characters. Also some decisions they made were like WHY? To me and also in my opinion it failed to show us how powerful the eternals are. On the other hand I feel Shang Chi did a pretty good job for it.I like Marvel doing other things than usual and taking risks, I would not call it an overall bad movie, it's pretty good but it has potential to get even better. I loved the fact that its not a superhero movie filled with action scenes but also focused on the drama part, where Marvel lacked in some previous films. As a Marvel fan I have my hope that Marvel will do it better next time but it's a pretty good job overall.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chlo√© Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!Eternals brings to our attention a lot of new and interesting information that will change the course of the Marvel universe. Chlo√© Zhao has created the most diverse MCU film to date - an emotionally epic one. The ensemble has great chemistry and everyone gets their moments to show off mastery. Their power sets are different and presented interestingly and beautifully.It has laughs, great surprises, twists and heart to go with the gigantic, crowded story it unpacks. There are some real-life questions that are brought to our attention - some people will like it, some not. I personally got zero problems with it, as a whole the movie is maybe one of the most matures in the MCU.At times it doesn't even feel like a ""next comicbook movie"", it's just a beautiful one, which will leave you hanging with some questions.Ramin Djawadi's score sounds amazing in all of the scenes, mixed with the fight, which are just epic and creative. I got no other words to express it.Easily this is one of the most important MCU movies for the future and you'll see why. I recommend that you do not be influenced by the rehearsals of people who purposefully hate the film, but look at the constructive things that are being written. It's not the best movie in the franchise, but it's a successfully taken risk, that will pay off in the years to come.My only minor problems are that some of the characters were built better than others, but also there are 10 new character that we see for first time. The other one is that the story jumps from one period to another one idea more than desired and I also understand, that the group is scattered around the world in the beginning of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that Eternals is a must for the big screen if you're a movie buff and a true Marvel fan.About the credit scenes...both are great, both will get you on the edge of your seat!","192 out of 337 found this helpful.

The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie since I have watched all the previous Marvel movies. A new era starts with this movie and we all have to be patient about it because time is needed for it to grow. Plenty of information came up and answered some of our questions regarding the Eternals and their purpose. ""Eternals"" surprised me since it was very different from what I expected but it was also interesting so, I am expecting the way that will continue it and what else it's going to present to us. The direction which was made by Chlo√© Zhao was good and she presented very well the main story behind Eternals but of course there is more information that needs to be presented. The interpretations of Gemma Chan who played as Sersi, Barry Keoghan who played as Druig, Lauren Ridloff who played as Makkari and Richard Madden who played as Icarus were very good.

The performance was amazing, visuals, were fantastic actions sequences were dope. Gemma Chan's is the real MVP of this movie, not gonna spoil anything but her character Sersi is G. O. A. T.Another standout performance was given by Kumail. Najiani and Richard Madden. Other actors did a really good job but these two were standout for me. Another great character was Harish Patel who plays Kingo's valet, that guy was really fun and I hope we see him more in MCU.The only con I felt was the sex scene which I felt was absolutely unnecessary but other than that, this movie is really good. It's highly entertaining. Just forget about the critics and watch it.","71 out of 117 found this helpful.

Obviously no ones used to change.There was some aspects of this movie that definitely weren't amazing. I'm not 100% convinced on any of the characters (whether that's due to acting, who they chose to play each character, or how they wrote the story), I think there's potential. Kit Harrington (although we didn't see much of him) did a great job and I have a feeling he may be another actor Marvel nailed on the head with casting. I think they did Lia McHugh (sprite) dirty in the writing of the character, but there's room for improvement.The first half had me a bit disappointed, but as the story continued I actually really enjoyed the movie. It's no easy task introducing this many new characters and new elements in one movie. It is opening so many different movies to the point that it may be overwhelming.

It had a good cast, an interesting premise, and of course was directed by Chloe Zhao, so I (and presumably many others) had hopes it could be something really good, and a breath of fresh air in the MCU.Having now seen it, I think the somewhat unenthusiastic critical reception is less because the movie's terrible, but more because it's disappointing. It ends up less than the sum of its parts, because most of the cast is solid, some visuals are really good, Zhao's style does shine through on occasion, and the music is overall quite good. Humour is a mixed bag but a good deal does work.The only thing that's pretty bad is the action- it's either the Eternals fighting big CGI monsters, or magical beings throwing magic at each other. It's just not exciting, especially when that's all you get action-wise, and so many of those scenes are shot in dimly lit, murky environments.Pacing is a mixed bag. The slower rhythm of the film works for a good deal of its runtime, but the last 45-60 minute drags like crazy. And it's not helped by the climax being so boring- I didn't used to have a problem with the frequently criticised ""over the top MCU third act CGI-fest"", but it's been very noticeable in all of Marvel's 2021 theatrical releases so far. They need to start doing a better job at ending their films.Writing wise, it may have helped to have at least some slight introduction to some of the characters in this in an earlier movie, or else had one main character really focused on. Jumping into such a big ensemble and developing them all in just one movie doesn't really work, and neither do the villains either, in the end (what little antagonists we get).As a stand-alone movie, it's not great, but it's worth giving some benefit of the doubt that things introduced here will have satisfying pay-offs down the line. Phase 4 of the MCU needs a direction to go in, or to build to, and Eternals may have given us a hint of that.There are a number of parts of this film that work, and it's only the action and some of the pacing that I'd call actually bad. But it is a disappointment, for sure.","64 out of 133 found this helpful.

Im not sure why Im finding these recent Marvel movies better that most of the last pre-end game ones. Maybe just because Im hearing less favourable things about them and going in with lower expectations. Or it's just a style I like personallyVery well told. Nice progression from the ancient history to the present. Very well paced.Creature effects were fantastic. Costumes were nice. The larger than life celestial effects were astounding. Nice relationship between Joli's character Thena and the other eternal who cares for her. Chan does a beautiful job with her character. And the mind controller fella (Druig?) was interesting to watch; both visually interesting and his demeanour was well suited to the role. But all characters were well developed for the screen time they had. Reminds me of the challenge of the first xmen movie which showed that larger groups of characters could be well handled and developed.Well acted by all. Not academy award performances, just generally quietly understated acting which fit their eternal lineage and charactersMy only grudge against this film is Disney's insistance that they all have a comedic section to the film. Felt very out of place in this film. Seems almost formulaic like they're trying to make every movie memorable to the under 8 age group. I almost docked a point for this, but they weren't too heavy handed. It's fine in some films.

This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer. The formula's starting to show its cracks and can't be used to introduce characters for uninitiated viewers like they did with The Avengers or Spider-Man (characters we now have collective knowledge on).The action's nice and big, but the characters don't change, the story feels like it needs 6-7 movies to play out properly, and the in-world logic kind of clashes with everything that happened before (these space-Gods can change little human conflicts in Mesopotamia' but not stop the Snap, Hiroshima or 9/11 because 'natural progress'). So yeah: the spectacle was nice but it didn't make up for the story being an overcooked yet wanting for further development outside of a lone 2 and ¬Ω hour movie introducing too many characters all at once.Eternals: doesn't feel like it's gonna have everlasting appeal in spite of the title. 2/5 stars.","67 out of 126 found this helpful.

Recognition is deserved because it touches on some interesting themes and provides light twists that break the ironclad Marvel mold. However, these themes are diluted by a cluttered story, and the twists (though uncommon for Marvel) are fairly standard for films overall. So, while Eternals has some relatively ambitious attempts, it still falls into classic pitfalls of franchise movies.The most fundamental flaw of Eternals is its unclear intentions. Is it creating a cohesive experience, or is it merely a stepping stone to expand a franchise? When the main protagonist (Gemma Chan) has neither characteristics nor an arc, the narrative at hand feels like an afterthought. Meanwhile, side characters are superfluous, the villain lacks pay off, and the tone/pacing are erratic. Furthermore, the themes of Eternals aren't fully explored. Ideas of autonomy, utilitarianism, and consciousness are introduced but, disappointingly, go nowhere. This lack of follow through applies to the filmmaking as well. Eternals has occasional visuals but is bogged down by CGI barf and bloated action. Ultimately, the movie reaches for respectable goals but fails to commit to a specific direction.Writing: 5/10

Eternals is very different from all the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, at the same time, it attempts to maintain the basic structure of its other recent films. The critics expected to see a basic Marvel movie, but they did not meet their full expectations. That makes Eternals difficult to please most Marvel fans. However, I can praise the film for a couple of things. The acting is good and I'm proud of Marvel for having diversity in its cast. The film score is gorgeous and doesn't sound like any other Marvel scores. The cinematography is excellent in many shots; however, a few shots in the movie involved using a green screen, and the cinematography didn't blend well with it. Another problem with the film is that most of the characterization is weak. Kit Harington's character is the most pointless of all characters in the film as he only appears for a few minutes at the beginning of the film and isn't seen again until the end. The post-credits scene showcases some information about his character that will be explored at some point in the MCU, but it felt like something that could've been saved for another movie. Despite being the biggest celebrity in the film, Angelina Jolie also didn't get enough screen time or character development. The screenplay is probably the most flawed screenplay of all MCU movies. It has too much exposition; the characters explain too much information instead of letting the movie show. I get that the film needed some explanations since many people are unfamiliar with the Eternals, but it could've been executed much better. There's also a lot of flashbacks in the film, most parts of which serve as filler. While it does help us learn more about the characters, there were still some bits that could've been cut. In fact, most of this film seems like it tried to cram so much about the Eternals into one movie instead of giving it all to us by dividing it into thirds like most Marvel trilogies. If that doesn't make sense to you, imagine for a minute that Marvel never existed, but suddenly a movie called Avengers: Infinity War comes out. That's exactly what Eternals feels like. I know Tony Stark once said, ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk,"" but that does not apply to the process of creating a movie franchise. With that said, Eternals is going to be challenging to build a trilogy upon. The end of this film does tease a sequel, but I can picture this planned series going down the path of the Divergent films. In other words, I find it hard to imagine the sequel(s) maintaining its audience. I would like to see the Eternals as a team appear in future Marvel movies, but if we're giving them their own movies, they'll have to take a different direction to stay consistent.","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

Though, I'd still give it a chance as I'm a big fan of the MCU. If it's bad, whatever, I didn't care for the Eternals in the comics anyway.So the movie starts off and during the first 30 minutes or so, I thought there was some pacing issues and I got a little worried that the critics were right, but once the movie settled, I was locked in. I found myself really enjoying the movie. I was then anticipating this moment where the movie falls off the rails to explain the reviews...but that moment never came for me. Actually, I found the movie continuing to get better. The story was growing on me, the characters were growing on me, the action was growing on me. Then the movie ended. I was completely confused what was wrong with the movie. I remember seeing some reviews saying they were bored. So knowing Chloe Zhao as a director, I thought maybe there wasn't much action or humor, but there was plenty of action and humor. The message and stakes of the movie was nice, and I thought it had good emotion to it. Now, I don't think it's a masterpiece, and there was a lot to take in, but I never found myself confused or uninterested. Maybe for the casual movie goer, it's a little too much superhero for them, but so are other MCU movies. I think Eternals might even be more Sci-Fi than most Marvel movies. Either way, the movie is a good time regardless of what critics say.I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact this movie is currently in the 50s on Rotten Tomatoes. To put it in perspective, Venom: Let There be Carnage has a 60%...I really just feel bad for the people that worked on this movie...they should be proud of it instead of seeing so many negative reviews.","36 out of 56 found this helpful.

Their powers come from the Celestials, godlike creatures that create stars and galaxies from scratch, who instructed the Eternals to help the humans fight off Deviants, but otherwise not interfere with human politics and war.A very clever little way of dodging the obvious questions of ""Why didn't they help the Avengers fight Thanos?"", but not clever enough to answer other questions like ""Where are the other numerous superheroes of the MCU during the events of this film?""I had the same problem with Shang Chi, but Shang Chi had the benefit of having a much more small scale and personal story, but Eternals is by design a massive story to tell in just one movie, and I don't think it quite delivers.I will give some compliments. Visually the film is stunning, the director Chloe Zhao, recently receiving several awards for her previous film Nomadland, shows off her talent for cinematography. Both the visual effects and nature photography are standouts, making this a high contender for best looking MCU movie, among the likes of Ragnarok and Doctor Strange. The characters and performances are overall great, some better than others. I loved the main character Sersi, her powers were cool and I found her very likeable. Eternals also deserves praise for having the first gay kiss in an MCU movie, although still made in such a way that they can cut it out of the film for certain audiences. The powers of the characters are overall pretty great and unique in terms of the MCU.Overall I think this film was fun but flawed. It does deserve criticism, and the editing was pretty bad at parts, but it doesn't deserve to be the lowest rated MCU movie. I hope that the MCU producers learn from their mistakes in this film and improve for upcoming projects with these characters.","48 out of 101 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7506049/?ref_=tt_urv","SAMTHEBESTEST","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50463365/?ref_=tt_urv","3 November 2021","Eternals (2021) :
Movie Review -Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it.MCU's recent projects have done great without theatrical release and notably, those came after 'Endgame'. 'Black Widow' and fresh fruit 'Shang Chi' earned back box office glory for them. I would have been happy to see them trying something nee after Endgan though. Something like what DC did with 'Joker'. Eternals does not depend on any such backdrop, it's a standalone product and maybe that's it will take some more time to create fan following. In the film, the Eternals, an immortal alien race, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. The screenplay here is not confusing at all but it is terribly slow. Marvel's Filmmaking may take a new turn from here as they have tried something calm this time, unlike super explosive narratives we saw in previous films. However, they couldn't try out something completely different from the trademark they carry which makes this film highly predictable.The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely not flawless but it isn't lame either. Creating a new universe for old fans might have put extra burden and that can be noticed in the film. It has those typical jokes carrying childish humour which you have left behind, 15 years ago. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. It slows down the vehicle anyway, almost to the level when you feel like having a little nap without taking those glasses off.Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. However, the performances aren't that great. Some characters don't even make any sense considering the kind of powers they have. Somewhere, the writing is also responsible for that. Indian fans, please do not melt when you see Indian faces but please laugh when they crack hilarious one-liners. Visually, Eternals is splendid. The IMAX experience makes it truly wonderful and appealing. Marvel's VFX team has provided them a much needed boost here.No doubts, the whole thing is long. Sometimes it feels like, is it gonna take MCU's Phase Five to reach the End? That eternal longing certainly hurts the film but rest assured, it's a standard Marvel Film. Chlo√© Zhao puts all the elements demanded by Marvel Fans while she deliberately ignores unnecessary dramatic scenes. Was she driving towards daily-soap pulp? I think yes. This is 2021 and you are still using 2011 cliches to add some gags in the film? Seriously? I mean the film is made only for new kids or what? Let the fans decide that. They don't care much about content anyways because if they had, Marvel would have moved on from money-spinners to classic cinema long time ago. Nevertheless, Eternals is a grand visual treat which deserves to be watched only and only in 3D. Yes, Marvel Fans can flock into theatres to scream out for the new superheroes this Diwali while others can skip it for their own good.RATING - 5/10*","401 out of 843 found this helpful.

This should have been a TV series.I came to this conclusion as I took in Eternals over several sittings, wishing that they'd fleshed things out more.The actors are stiff and aloof because they're playing immortal super beings who are stiff and aloof, if not jaded, without ever showing us how and why they get that way.Throughout the film the Eternals talk about the various falling outs and reconciliations they inflict upon each other over the ages.It would have been great to see some of these alliances and betrayals take place, and watch as their ideals get slowly eroded or modified.Instead, cast and crew had the unenviable task of jamming seven millennia of backstory into two and a half hours, in a way that at least made some sense. I concur with the reviewer who likened this compressed disappointment to Watchmen the movie.Eternals also squandered the potential to build up massive questions about death, remembrance, duty, and trade-offs.The art design theme of golden thread and circles, apparently based on astrolabes, is amazing. Scenes range from small and intimate to planetary. The pacing is often ponderous and somber. At these points, Eternals reminds me of a contemporaneous release: Villeneuve's Dune. However, I had more fun with Eternals as the Marvel habit of adding a wisecrack here and there stopped the dourness from getting boring.And unlike Dune, I think I would not have minded seeing more.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

To me, it feels more distinct than most of the studio's other fare, but it isn't as entertaining. As a whole, the thing just feels a bit flat. It's messy, overly portentous and filled with some pretty baffling choices. Chief among these is the decision to have one of its characters straight-up disappear from the finale for no real reason, only to rear his head again just before the piece comes to a close. The ending (which includes two post-credits stings) is incredibly disappointing, evoking the exact opposite of its intended effect. There are plenty of other plot problems, too. They pale in comparison to the fact that most of the movie just feels fairly lifeless, though. It's pretty dull, to be honest. That being said, it does have its merits. Firstly, the cast are all really good despite the fact that they don't have much to work with. Ma Dong-Seok (here credited as Don Lee) is the obvious highlight, though he's criminally underused. Secondly, there are a handful of scenes which start to properly explore the interesting concepts inherent to the heroes' long-lasting lifespans. Unsurprisingly, the best of these involve actual conflict between the core characters and portray each player's different outlook on their unique situation. Sadly, most characters lack chemistry with one another and often seem isolated from the other people that share the frame with them. They aren't allowed to properly come to life, which is one of the biggest reasons that the piece just isn't all that compelling; we have nobody to care about. This also means that the movie feels as though it lacks real stakes, even though it's literally the entire Earth that's in danger. Without a character to latch onto, we simply don't give a second thought to the humans our heroes are trying to save. However, the feature is visually pleasing overall. The cinematography is suitably 'epic' and the various locations are presented with bold colours and distinct architecture. There are also a couple of entertaining, if slightly intangible, action sequences. The best of these, which is also the best portion of the entire affair, is a mid-point battle set in a remote village. For the most part, though, even the set-pieces fall short of the mark. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. It has a strange structure, a sloppy story and generally just feels a bit off. It's far too long, yet somehow not long enough; it would've been much better served as a mini-series. It has its moments, but it just isn't all that good. 5/10.","49 out of 90 found this helpful.

The characters are written really badly and the story was a drag at times. The VFX was as good as any Marvels film but everything else was so bad that it doesn't deserve a watch especially the casting. Every single lead was bad. I can't digest Salma Hayek. She's the same person, talking like the same character for more than 2 decades with different clothes. Pathetic. Kunal nanjijkdjdhg should stop acting. I don't know if he is being realistic or sarcastic when he opens his mouth. I don't know if that little girl is actually little or a girl. There is no back story for the characters. I haven't read the comics, so I have no clue what I saw. Why not the next film have al chinese actors only because that's where marvels is headed to.Ikaris character taunts that he doesn't wear a cape when he is mistook for Superman but by watching this film it's clear that he isn't half as powerful as Superman. Why Kit Harrington? He had nothing to do in the entire film. 3-4 wasteful scenes and he was gone. He was better left at the Night's Watch. They could have introduced him in the sequel which I am not interested in. David Kaye's voice as Areshmi was horrible. I couldn't get the dialogues at all. Why hugely built or powerful characters need to have such thick voices? It's like they are grunting gibberish. As I said, pathetic casting. Anyway, Eternal means forever but these characters die like humans.If they could have written this as a series in mind, they could have explained each character and their back stories making us connect with them more, probably. Post Avengers, marvels looks like they are done and dusted.The problem for me began with my OTT - Disney+. The subtitles are either in Indonesian or Malay. Not in English. I had to switch the audio to two other languages at times to get the dialogue. Sometimes the BG music took over the dialogue and sometimes it's just not clear. There were no subtitles for what those non-English speakers were saying nor for that speech impaired girl's sign languages.","61 out of 116 found this helpful.

"7","/10","This Film Will Eternally Be Known As The Marvel Diverging Point","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7511382/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","5 November 2021","LIKES:The Comedy:
For once, the comedy is not the strongest element in a Marvel movie, not forcing too many jokes or elements to offset the direction this film took. However, it does not mean the movie does not have its comedic moments and I enjoyed a few good quips and running jokes that Zhao and her team wrote into the story. Kumail Nanjiani's blunt styles work well in this film at times and when bounced off of other characters sells the joke to much better levels. Brian Tyree Henry's sarcasm is right on point, utilizing emotion and comedic timing to great levels in order to get a good drive out and perhaps a little personality to his character. The winner of comedy though is Harish Patel whose role is simple, but works phenomenally in an Indian Buddy Hackett sort of way that was natural, fun, and relieved the darker moments of the movie. Again, it's not the wettest comedy, but it works.The New Direction at Times:
Eternals is delivering on the promise of being an alternative approach to the superhero film and trying to expand into artistic realms. Using a character focused role, Eternals removes the kid friendly filter to degrees to make a grittier Marvel film (aside from Deadpool and X-men) that starts to bare the mature teeth a little more. The movie is darker, addressing philosophical concepts about life, and converting it into a deeper story past the usual bad vs. Good guys. It works on levels and tries to keep you on your toes for the future of our heroes and this makes for a more intriguing concept than the usual predictable runs. The mature tone means caution in younger audience members, but it succeeds in adding new approaches to diversify the future of the series.The Action, Sometimes:
I won't say the action is the most exciting, but Eternals sort of takes the approach of the Netflix shows, where the realism sets in and the danger is real. This approach leads to more suspense at what the character's limits are, while also offering some more strategic warfare required to execute the Deviants. If you are a fan of seeing this style and dropping the 'theatrics"", then you'll be happy to see the magic toned in a different direction, trying to evolve the battles and the circumstances with it.The Story, to a part:
We know Zhao likes character building pieces and Eternals shows this in the presentation as a character piece over anything else. Mass integration of these personalities came to light and just how many elements each of these character had. Relationships are semi-dynamic amidst the team, and in this one movie explored a bit into many of them at what their approach to their mission was. It's some of these elements that again open the ""originality"" of this film in the universe and allows you to get some time exploring a potential favorite character past the usual splendor.The Cinematography:
While the special effects may be a little limited at times, the actual cinematography is well-done and deserving of applause from this reviewer. Elements from Dune leaked into this movie, with the scale of size differences really standing out. Emotional moments have great angles, the lighting and shading work super well to promote that darker atmosphere. Setting and sequences hold dynamic moments, and all the preparation sort of sells the feelings of the moment as they journey across the Earth searching for the keys to success. I think this may be the strongest element of storytelling to be honest, and seeing all these elements come together really helped set the scenes apart. A nice job on using the elements of NomadLand to this part of the Marvel Universe as it was very impressive for me.The Character Usage:
You know me and my obsession with using the characters to significant amounts for their inclusion in the big moments. Eternals had a lot of pressure for at least 10 characters to portray and for much of the film, they achieved that goal. Each of our gods contributes in meaningful ways for me, playing their part and progressing the story to qualify for being mentioned. Some of them are big on character centric moments and moral challenging questions. Others are the action elements who exist to give awesome fights as the tools to fight the Deviants. Several are comedic relief and the humanizing element of the film, trying to bring the superhero element back down to help with the struggles our cast faces. And others are indeed the combining glue of the movie and, with it, tie everything together in a rather cohesive package.DISLIKES:The Story Incompleteness:
Eternals new direction has promise, but it can't quite get all it wanted done in the 2.5 hours it had. Zhao is big on diving into her characters' stories and though she manages to touch on the elements and deliver enough of the punch needed to get the point across. However, several of these stories don't feel fully fleshed out, elements that are lacking build up and complete layouts at times feels rushed and blunt at times. This continues to occur over the course of the movie, with an ending that really has crammed elements and is deprived of the extra factor I like in my climactic endings. Certainly there are some theatrics, but a lot of things sort of crash together to wrap things up towards the finale.The Deviants:
A major element of this movie is the mystery of the aliens that serve the rivals to the Eternals in this cosmic game of chess. While the design is not bad, the utilization of these creatures and the mystery behind them is kind of blown over and misused on many levels. Really cool concepts get some great starts, but then drop flat, and near the end of the movie are nearly forgotten until BAM you are hit with the elements in a rapid manner. It's not that it wasn't cool at times, in fact it has the coolest move of the movie, but it's shoehorned in and lost to the giant scheme of the movie.The Action Scenes:
While there are some awesome fights to show off the power of teamwork, they also feel a bit shorthanded in the grand scheme of the movie. Many of the early fights are very quick, lasting only about three minutes before petering them out, while others are even shorter and limit the teamwork dynamic I like. Other times, the realism sort of gets in the way of the choreography I love, and I feel the punches were pulled to keep that darker element going to stick the artistic vision Zhao went for. Again, I don't hate the action sequences and find some moments I love, but the level of quality feels inconsistent like much of the movie. Even Thena's climactic fight holds some underwhelming moments, and given how much rode on it, that's not the best finale for me.The Pacing:
The biggest part about the movie that I feel was kind of the weakest element was the pacing in this movie. Eternals is not the slowest movie, but it's inconsistent for me as I watched things unfold. Flashbacks to past and then present are at times fun to see as they try to strategically give you information about how the Eternals got where they were going. However, other times, it just robs the movie of the momentum and could have been used in a different manner to really maximize everything in the film. It bled into the action moments for me, it led to uneven moments mentioned earlier, and I sort of feel resulted in the limited use of the Deviants as described. Zhao's artistic style was indeed a bold move, but I think she needed more time to really execute everything to the perfect level.The VERDICT:
Eternals was a bold direction and opens up for a much broader galaxy and artistic approach to offset the monotony of the Marvel series. Zhao's character centered story approach works for this movie, with all ten characters getting adequate screen time and involvement, as they attempt to take hold in your hearts and memory. It's got layers to the characters, with fantastic exploration of life's philosophy, and mapping out these heroes in manners that feel like a Greek Tragedy. Visual wise, the movie is astonishing in scale and spectrum, helping to really convey emotions and maximize all the disdain of the scenes. And the fact that there is a balance of comedy to not offset this mature direction gets points in my book for following the rules and not getting lost in the popular formula. However, the movie's new approach is not going to be for everyone, especially given how inconsistent it was for me at times and how much it bled into other components. The story has a lot of rushed and crammed elements, not enough to not complete the story, but sort of robbing the film of that full finish she can do. It's ties to the MCU are very limited, and the new path it sets offers the chance for new openings, but is a bit disappointing for those who look for all the connections they can instead of a new pathway to get lost in. For me though, the pacing is the weakest part of the film and it's cascade on the other parts of the movie are the undermining factors. Realistic action sometimes gets bogged down by shoehorned ideas, certain plot elements are lost and then quickly summed up, and the full on exploration of the characters still require more time and perhaps another movie to tell the full story she wanted. Still, not a bad entry into the universe and I will gran this film:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.","104 out of 238 found this helpful.

The execution, however, didn't end up loving up to its full potential. I think they tried to tell too many stories and ended up not focusing well on the main plot. I do hope that they utilize the actors such as Angelina Jolie in future in a better way. Having these characters in MCU gives me hope.

Hope, they improve in sequels.","189 out of 405 found this helpful.

In this movie we find out about the ancient race of superheros, who were the first ones on earth. They are acted by a pretty great group of actors including gemma chan and richard madden. All of them were good and no characters felt out of place. The cgi couldve been a little better and its evident that this movie is not as great as the other offerings, but it still is good at giving us a glimpse as to other characters that will come into the mcu and interact with other characters in secret walking. Overall an interesting and good marvel film, but not without the flaws.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's a modest attempt at shaking up the old MCU formula that admittedly has gotten stale as of late. It tries to be different, and it succeeds in that respect. Up until the very last minutes of the film, it didn't feel like an MCU movie at all. Which was refreshing, but it felt disconnected with the other MCU films. It tries to do too much. Essentially it's a poor mans Avengers. The story is rushed and since the characters are all new to us, it's hard to connect with them. The film does have good moments. There are fragments of a great movie in Eternals. Ultimately it just didn't quite fit together well enough. That being said it was entertaining enough to warrant a watch in the theater, and it does have large MCU implications. It's final post credit scene was the first one in a long time that got me excited. Overall it's a bottom tier MCU film, which makes it a pretty good superhero movie all things considered.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

They play ""The Eternals"" a group of immortal beings who have lived among humans for thousands of years and have been forced to re-unite to protect the earth from the evil alien species known as the Deviants.This movie represents a new chapter in the Marvel universe and is set after the major battles of the Avengers vs Thanos. The Eternals are instructed not to get involved in any human conflict unless Deviants are involved. They are a fresh new set of superheroes to continue the MCU.This film has divided opinion among critics but for me there were actually more positives than negatives. Chloe Zhao has gone from directing ""Nomadland"" to directing a Marvel movie which is quite a leap across genres. But she's done a good job. The cinematography and filmmaking style with a lot of background and scenery is one unique to her. And she has brought a slight indie vibe to the MCU. There was also of good humour and gaffs brought to this in particular from Kumail Nanjiani. The only real negative that stood out was the battle scenes as good as they were, were a bit samey and wasn't really anything new compared with earlier Marvel films.That said, it had enough depth and character development coupled with good humour and good visuals that it is worth a watch. I wouldn't say the same level as the better Avenger films but decent and I would watch the sequel. 7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Would be a bit complicated for some people.The cinematography and action sequences are pretty amazing, marvel never disappoint from that part. Although the CGI isn't as good.Kingo(played by Kumail Najiani) and Karun(played by Harish Patel) are just really funny and have such amazing a chemistry together. I wouldve liked to see more Angelina Jolie, a small role for a big actress. Sprite(played by Lia McHugh) annoyed me a bit but i think that was intended. For me marvel just wanted to represent every single grouo of people found on earth in one movie.Now story wise, they did a pretty good job introducing a good amount of new characters in one movie but that led to the story not being too deep. The post-credit scene very exciting.Overall a good movie but in my opinion, it would've been better if it was made into a Disney+ seires, although i know thats impossible because of how expensive the cast is. However, that would've given them more time to explore the characters and have a more organized story that would catch their audience without making them get bored for it being too long.Score: 7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Actually Eternals is probably the most unique and freshest installment in the MCU yet, with the whole film feels like a Zack Snyder film instead of another MCU film.I respect and like the fact that the story, the tone, characterisation, and underlying moral and philosophy questions are different than what we used to get from a MCU movie. Plus, this being a film from Chloe Zhao, the cinematography and the visual effects were fresh and outstanding.With that being said, the fact that it's being the most challenging and ambitious MCU film is also the reason for it's flaws. The pacings were off at times and the story got messy on the second and third parts. And to be honest, I think the Eternals line up is just too many. It will be better if they only focus on 5/6 Eternals instead of 10.Still, I respect the different route that it takes and the fact that at least it makes me feel that there could be new things to anticipate from a MCU film in the future.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

With the scale of their powers, I really didn't feel a sense of stakes in this movie. I'm having trouble seeing them tie in naturally with the new Avengers but maybe they don't need to.

In this case I definitely agree but wanted to add a review here just to push down the nay sayers who are giving it a 1 or 3.Without long winded explanations (like the movie) it's quite simple why you shouldn't listen to the low ratings for this one.5.0 out of 10
Was I entertained and interested in the story enough to watch the whole thing? Yes. That automatically puts it above 5 out of 10. Pure and simple.6.0 out of 10
Was it good enough to feel like it was worth the $15 at the cinema and engaging enough for me to have a heated debate about it after with my friends. Also yes. That automatically puts it above 6 out of 10. Easy.7.0 out of 10
Am I willing to go and see it again (at the cinema) and unquestionably recommend it to friends? Probably not. That means it definitely isn't above a 7. Makes sense.6.5 out of 10
Am I willing to give it another chance a few months later based on how likeable (some of) the characters are? Or how interesting the story was (even if it was very long with plenty of fluff)? I would say, on balance, yes. That, to me, puts it at 6.5. I hope some people agree with me on this because giving such a well crafted movie a 1 or 2 rating is really quite absurd.Anyway, I won't go into all the positives and negatives since others cleave covered it but the main thing I need to say is that the main fault if the movie is that they were intentionally trying to build an avengers style team but with absolutely no build up.This meant we were left with 8 or so backstories all crammed into a movie that should have focused (finally) on explaining the celestials in more detail other than what Ego told us in GOTG2. It was a rushed addition to the universe which isn't Marvel's style. A shame really considering how well they created the slow burner of phase 1/2/3/4.In short, the movie is good enough to watch again at some point, so it's a 6.5.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is an interesting film, that opens up a bunch of new storylines for future films.. but the film itself... I feel like it was a bit of a misfire.. which is very rare for Marvel... the film contains a lot of world building stuff to set up the Eternals storyline which requires an awful lot of flashbacks and back story... which hampers the forward momentum of the main story... The cast is decent, Gemma Chan does most of the heavy lifting.. but they really waste Angelina Jolie and especially Salma Hayek in the film.

I am greatful for that not because i am a fan of diversity but because such different features helped me differentiate and remember the cast and since they introduce about 8 new main characters it was neccasary to have them be instantly recognizable.Some of the new characters are genuinely interesting rounded characters and some are forgettable side characters. The deviants showcased in the trailer are uninteresting and do not do much besides facilitating action scenes.

I am a Marvel fan. Well, MCU fan that is. Read some of the comics when I was a kid, but became hooked after the first Iron Man movie.I have watched every MCU movie and series mulitple times. Except Eternals. Watched it in the theatre at release (as with every MCU movie) and thought to myself...Mjeeh. I've seem better.But today I decided to watch it again. And I loved it. It's, despite the pg-rating, actually a more mature movie in it's pace and storytelling. It's brilliant how it's actually a 'first' superhero movie where you get to know the heroes AND get the action too. Usualy it's one or the other. While it being a complete story, there was enough mystery left and cliffhangers that could set the stage for 'more MCU future' than just the next Eternals.And to all the people so concerned about wokeness... Marvel has been woke since long before it was even a thing. So don't het your pantys all twisted. Everytime there is a female or gay caracter. There's still enough stupid caracters left for you to relate to too.So if you're not part of the TikTok generation (where a movie longer than two hours is like 'forever') and come into this movie expecting a different pace than usual. It's actually one of the better Marvel movies :)","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

1. The fight scenes are entertaining, full of action and well choreographed.2. The special effects, as usual with Marvel films, are fantastic thus making sure the movie contains some semblance of realism.3. A few of the jokes land, mostly those that exist between Karun (Harish Patel) and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani).4. Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel have the best chemistry out of anyone which helps to elevate their humour.5. The cinematography is great and produces some really stunning shots.Cons:
1. Salma Hayek (Ajak) delivers an incredibly stale performance.2. The run-time is way too long. There are a plethora of useless sub-plots that go nowhere and they should have been axed, like the Deviant sub-plot.3. The logic permeating the film is largely wayward. For some strange reason only advanced beings are needed for the Eternals' masters, but then the Eternals aren't allowed to intervene when humans kill each other off.4. There are way too many characters. This means that not only is there little-to-no character development, but it also means that characters like Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo and Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) are given barely anything to do.5. Most of the humour falls flat on its face as it's inappropriately inserted and needlessly forced.6. There's way too much corny and regurgitated dialogue about how humans aren't perfect but they're worth saving.7. All of the romances are forced, they're laughably weak and are clearly there to pad out time.8. The transitions between the modern day and the past are far too jarring, and only seem included to dump exposition on the audience.","34 out of 65 found this helpful.

The movie tells the tale of Eternal beings sent to Earth to protect it from entities known as deviants. Once they rid the world of deviants they live relatively normal lives among the humans who are now able to flourish. However, when deviants return to the Earth's surface the Eternals will need to get back together to protect humanity and uncover why they've returned.This movie is directed by Chlo√© Zhao (Nomadland) and stars Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asian), Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider), Salma Hayek (Dusk till Dawn), Richard Madden (Game of Thrones), Kit Harington (Game of Thrones), Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Brian Tyree Henry (Hotel Artemis), Barry Keoghan (The Green Knight) and Bill Skarsg√•rd (IT).This was an extremely uneven movie. There are so many unique characters, elements and worthwhile conversations and topics. The CGI and action sequences are crisp and well done and the villain(s) are solid. There are also aspects of the storyline that dragged, characters that were painfully ripped off from the DC universe and decision made by key characters that make you slap your head and didn't feel realistic with the wisdom and perspectives of the Eternals.Overall this is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time. This also did not need to be almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long. I would score this a 5/10.","93 out of 197 found this helpful.

This was a beautiful epic from the Celestial opening, to the closing, off-screen dialogue.This. Film. Is. Grand! Any doubt as to whether the scale would feel enormous enough was crushed in moments and rode through the entire movie. You're faced with the very human flaws of godlike characters, that don't stray from being fragile, even while leveling landscapes. Power resonates in every aspect, but it's the nuanced performances that standout (huge props to Don Lee and Bryan Tyree Henry, specifically who supply steadfast heart throughout). Two and a half hours went by like a blip, with only minor notes given for a couple pacing issues, but pushing an ensemble cast that large has its hurdles. For the first time in a while the injection of humour doesn't seem forced, or childlike, in an MCU film, which rests squarely of the jacked shoulders of Kumail Nanjiani and the brilliantly human Harish Patel!Eternals hits like new mythology, and doesn't back off with gigantic reveals for the MCU, as well as offhanded resettings of the status quo. Put simply: Chlo√© Zhao gave you an epic, minus a few minor stumbles, that is undeniably beautiful, and will remind you what it means to feel small.","22 out of 34 found this helpful.

The directing by Chlo√© Zhao is very well-crafted, so is the photography and the whole aesthetic of each environment.The characters are loosely-based on the comic book versions they take inspiration from, even though only three are really developed and memorable: them being Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris and Angelina Jolie as Thena.Everything that happens feels genuine and natural, for the most part: the progression of the story, the conflict between characters as well as the sequences involving the Celestials.The pacing could have been handled in a different way. Sometimes, the movie gets too slow as it gets harder to connect to what's going on. Also the tone of the movie is not as cohesive as you would expect. The visual effects are spectacular during certain scenes, while are just okay during others.In the end, this movie manages to expand the cosmology of the MCU, thanks to its brilliant twists and turns, but is perhaps too dark and gloomy to be appreciated by the majority of the public. It's a blockbuster flick that works to a certain extent.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Too bad because this could have been a pretty good movie if the story had been told differently and in a more suspensfull manor.","54 out of 130 found this helpful.

Its tougher to do than you think and I would describe the execution as mixed. I did like most of the characters they offered up, they have mixed power sets and perspectives on the Celestials. Each of them are distinct and relatively fun to watch. It's one of the pleasures of a team movie, you get to ride along as they build comraderie and group chemistry. We get some time to spend with each of them and other than Athena and Gilgamesh's dynamic, none of it is particularly involving or compelling. It was a tall task and while Eternals didn't faceplant on developing the characters, it didn't stick the landing either.I was a little surprised about how big of a cast this project was able to put together. But Marvel has the money to write big cheques with many zeroes so that may have played a factor as well. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are the two actors with the most screen time and while they are both capable and charismatic performers, they're handcuffed by their characters. They're both a little wooden, I want to believe that they were directed to be that way to sell the unfeeling and godly nature of their characters but it made it more difficult to empathize with their struggle. I felt bad for Angelina Jolie, she showed up to work and she does a great job. Her character is also the most interesting on the team. But the movie has her alternate between fighting and freaking out and there's little room to show her range in between. Kumail Nanjiani provides the movie with some much needed levity but a lot of his material feels like retreads of Tony Stark's snarky one-liners and I just didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I also want to credit Brian Tyree Henry (his scene in 1945 is easily the most emotionally impactful in the movie), Ma Dong-Seok and Lia McHugh for their work in their supporting parts. I thought Salma Hayek and Barry Keoghan were interesting casting choices and they both play well against type.If you're going to check this out on the big screen, you're going to want some big action set pieces. Eternals doesn't reinvent the wheel but I did like a lot of the fight scenes. The different powers the group possesses are utilized well and while the Deviants are pretty generic, I did like how they adapted to the Eternals and became more difficult to fight as the movie went on. So from that angle, Eternals scratches that itch.There are plenty of things to praise in Eternals but there are just as many weaknesses. They put too much on this movie, there's so much setup and between the odd editing for the flashbacks and jumping back and forth between locations and different periods of time, Eternals feels unfocused. It's also just too long, you feel the 2.5 hr runtime and with how slack the pacing can get, I was definitely shifting around in my seat and checking my phone.I feel bad for Chloe Zhao and the Eternals creative team. Eternals is a passable superhero flick, the action scenes are solid, the cast is game and the effects look good. Everything should add up to a success here. But the movie is bloated, too exposition heavy and despite a diverse cast of characters, you can't really bond with them over their struggle. It just feels too derivative for Marvel and while that's understandable considering their longevity and the weight of the expectations, it doesn't make Eternals any better. I saw this with a couple of friends and one of them compared it to Green Lantern. I think its better than that effort but its fairly good match. Skip Eternals in the theatre but if you're a ride or die Marvel fan, check it out on Disney Plus.","29 out of 65 found this helpful.

The themes are much more dark and carry more emotional weight with them. Chloe Zhao's direction while I thought was great in this film and kept to her style, I just don't think it might fit in the MCU thought. It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 1/2 hour film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them. Performances and visuals were stunning though, very good looking film on the big screen. Dolby atmos surround sound delivers also adding immersive experience while watching. The action was a bit light I thought, but the scenes we get are again great visually and choreographed well. The final battle was a bit underwhelming I thought also. It would of worked better as a TV series maybe, but then the visual aspects would be under appreciated if seen on a TV and not a giant imax screen. But this film still adds more clues as to what may happen in the future of the MCU.","46 out of 114 found this helpful.

Druig could've been interesting, but he's made of pure cardboard just like everyone else.They make mistake after mistake, doing everything as slowly as possible. The presence of the deviants in the film has no impact whatsoever.The characters are just devices for virtue signaling. There's no reason to discuss what they are meant to represent, cause it's purely political and besides their intended messages they have no essence and are absolutely lifeless.In addition, all the film's attempts to tie the plot to ""human nature,"" to raise the questions of conflicts, overpopulation, and global warming are crushed by the pointlessness of the story itself and the uselessness of the ""characters."" I never thought Eternals would be the unlikely heroes since they are so indecisive and worthless it makes you wonder how did they even manage to succeed. Really makes you appreciate Tony Stark in Endgame, that was the spirit.At some point, the film slipped into Thor Ragnarok and started throwing up random comedy, but it was so bad I had more fun reading paid 10/10 this film's reviews on IMDB. Having Karun character in the film really added a lot, thanks.I don't know, it was so bad that I don't even want to dig into this movie.At least I ended up laughing at the silly Tommy Wiseau-level dialogue and actions at the end when random scenes replace one another without any meaning and everyone is acting on random minute-by-minute motivations.Surely something must have gone wrong during the production. The film flings too much into all directions, mixing random tones and ideas, supposedly dramatic scenes with supposedly funny ones. Some focus would've saved this, probably.Anyway, Eternals were plain bad. If you can survive in the sludge of boring pointless dialogue - you will be treated with hilariously bad writing and editing in the end.Should you watch it? I'd say - no. But if you can endure and not drop it in the first 30 minutes - you may have fun.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7509061/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2021","""Eternals"" is the third film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), it is the boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far.For over 7,000 years, the immortal aliens known as the ""Eternals"" have lived secretly among the human race in various places on Earth, watching as they have advanced throughout the course of history. A short time after half of all life was restored during the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", the Eternals each discover that an apocalyptic event known as the ""Emergence"" has begun, causing their ancient foes ""The Deviants"" to reawaken and attack the human population. With the very existence of humanity resting on their shoulders, the Eternals must now collectively reunite to prevent the destruction of everything they have all witnessed come into being.Considering how many years it's been around, the MCU hasn't pushed too many boundaries with the formula it has created. Almost all of them follow a typical template - introduce the hero, establish their significance, have them acquire their powers, make them fight and defeat the villain(s), and tease at their inclusion in future movies. Rinse and repeat. You could argue that there's no point in fixing what isn't broken but at the same time I've always wanted to see them try something new to shake things up a bit. ""Eternals"" happens to take a number of risks with its approach to origin stories and while not all of them succeeded, the ones that did show that there is hope this long running series won't stagnate creatively anytime soon.Rather than the usual everyman or everywoman who gain their superpowers later on, here the titular Eternals are actually omnipotent figures that have always had access to their godlike abilities. As a result, the film doesn't spend any time showing how they all reached their full potential, instead expecting us to accept their unique qualities right away. But this doesn't mean the characters aren't relatable at all, as they still experience the same type of problems as regular humans. In spite of their status as ageless beings, each of them display modern humanlike traits from time to time.For example, the character Sersi has an addiction to her smartphone, enamoured by the convenience of being able to take photos instantly. This is a believable attribute that an individual who looks as youthful as her would have in today's world, which adds some necessary depth to someone who has been alive for thousands of years. Little quirks like this remind the audience that it is possible to feel a connection to these characters without feeling too alienated by their otherworldly origins, and moments like that help distinguish the MCU from the early films of the DC Extended Universe.Coming hot of the tails of winning the Best Director Oscar for ""Nomadland"", Chloe Zhao here delivers a film that could be considered the complete opposite. Whereas ""Nomadland"" was a humble down-to-earth story about people surviving with what they had out on the road, ""Eternals"" instead takes the audience on a different type of journey - an effects-laden exploration of the mythology of heroes. Zhao likens each of the Eternals' interactions with humans to that of the ancient Greek and Roman gods with the impact they've left on mankind's progress throughout history, both positive and negative. Such examples include inventing ploughshares for farmers and later the atomic bomb to bring about the end of a major war. While I do appreciate this vastly different approach to what we're normally used to, the major problem here is that the film focuses too much on fleshing out each member of the Eternals.Since the film has an ensemble cast of more than ten lead characters instead of just one, most of the resulting runtime is unfortunately stuffed with bloated exposition about their overall relevance to the story. I understand the importance of developing each of the characters' individual personalities, but so much time is spent doing this that it causes the second act to drag on way longer than it should. Anyone who is expecting frequent action throughout will be disappointed as most of the best parts occur near the conclusion. Granted, there is a decent amount of emotional weight during this climactic finale, so it was partially worth sitting through the whole thing in the end.Out of all the Eternals, the only one that comes close to being the main protagonist would be Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has the ability to shapeshift any type of matter around her. She is easily the most likeable of the main cast, as she is the emotional glue that holds them all together. As for the rest, I also liked Richard Madden as Ikaris, who can fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, a Bollywood star who can fire energy beams out of his hands. To comment on every other member of the Eternals would take too much time so these three are the only ones I am going to single out here. Although his role is only a minor one, Kit Harrington's character Dane Whitman was amusing as the absent-minded boyfriend of Sersi. It's interesting to see two significant ""Game of Thrones"" actors like Madden and Harrington in the same film together, added by the fact that they each know someone homophonically named Sersi/Cersei.Though ""Eternals"" didn't achieve everything it was setting out to accomplish, it was still bold enough to deviate from the monotonous formula it has had set in stone over the past thirteen years. Naturally there will be many people who will hate this film for doing just that, and that is completely understandable, but personally I admire that it took risks instead of playing it safe as per usual. I don't think every other MCU film should follow suit as this may result in alienating too many hardcore fans, but hopefully this one will leave just enough of an impression to show that the series is capable of trying new things.I rate it 7/10.","64 out of 168 found this helpful.

This movie gives us great storyline with some of the most Beautiful shots. The Eternals gives us a big cast but the movie gives us one on one time with all of them so they all have character development. It's gives us some good CGI as well. There only problem I have with this is that it's super long. There are also lots of flashback scenes I didn't mind them but other may not like them so just a heads up. There is also some amazing cameos at the post credit scene that MCU fans will like.Gemma Chan plays the main character we follow the most though out the movie. She really does a good job playing a caring, kind and nice character. Richard Madden plays the role of Ikaris he really shows off his anger and his regret. Ma Dong-seok plays the best character of the movie being the funniest and the most understanding character of the movie. Angelina Jolie plays the character who suffers from a sort of memory lost can't really explain it without spoiling it. Barry Keoghan plays Druig the character who thinks that we should protect humanity at all cost and always goes against everyone's wishes. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays the main villain who looks really great with the CGI he uses but his villain is very underused in this movie and doesn't really come off as the main bad guy near the end of the movie. Kumail Nanjiani plays one of the funniest characters you really end of loving his character until the end where you are kinda disappointed in him. Lia McHugh plays the most annoying character I could not stand her she is always so against everyone and so negative. Salma Hayek doesn't get a lot of screen time unfortunately so she doesn't get to do a lot. Lauren Ridloff I think does an amazing job as her character and I hope we get to see more of her.

The film is a work of love and an homage to Marvel, both past and present, with an amazing story. Can't wait to see it on the home theatre. Directing, story telling and pacing were amazing. Kept grabbing my wife's hand throughout, and had to consciously release my fingers. I was curious how Angelina Jolie would do, and she brings everything home with Thena bringing balance with vulnerability of the ultimate warrior,looking forward to her appearances. I cared about all of the characters with their flaws, which made it seem all the more clear, they were a part of humanity, imprinted by those they were watching.","21 out of 33 found this helpful.

The visuals are hit and miss, occasionally being so dark and colorless it feels like a Zack Snyder film, but being really gorgeous at other times. The plot has some holes and some weird decisions by characters that don't seem to make any sense. None of the action scenes are particularly memorable. The pacing is too slow, but at the same time it feels like we don't spend enough time with the characters.But it does have something that all the other Marvel origin-stories don't - the courage to move away from the formula.The story simply develops in ways that are different to previous MCU origin stories. The pacing was different, the plot points were different, the entire style of storytelling was different - and while drifting away from the tried-and-proven formula definitely adds a whole lot of flaws, it also finally gives us a Marvel movie that feels fresh and different.For me - and especially after watching Shang Chi - seeing a Marvel movie where I genuinely don't know for certain what's gonna happen next was really fun, and that's enough for me to give it a positive score.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Chlo√© Zhao won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture and she is good at telling some kind of stories, but her lack of experience with superhero movies is noticeable. This film is painfully slow and definitely too long, because some storylines take too much screen time. There were basically 7000 years of plot to cover, but the screenplay focuses on some useless story lines, that do not have any kind of impact on the plot. It needs to be heavily cut down. Another thing that I found really annoying is that the movie tells multiple times that ""Eternals"" is part of the MCU, like the audience is composed of a bunch of kids that cannot connect the dots. Disney has been building this narrative universe for more than 10 years. People got the fact that every movie or TV show that Marvel Studios releases is part of it, no need to reiterate. There was a lot of potential, but they did not explore these characters enough and by the end of it, I feel like I barely knew them, so I was not attached to any of them. The acting felt really flat, despite having some class A actors such as Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. They were not at all convincing. I wonder who decided to hire Gemma Chang, because she portrays one of the most important characters, but she is the most unimpressive element of the cast.I liked how they developed the Celestials and Arishem. I see a lot of potential in this storyline and I hope that they will write an interesting plot for them. CGI is well done and fight scenes are a little bit different than the average Marvel movie, with tons of creative effects. Overall it looks good and also way better than the recently released ""Black Widow"". I think that the Deviant design was captivating and I enjoyed their evolution from primal creatures to sentient beings. It gave them a lot of depth and I wish that the movies could focus on this aspect more. There is a little bit of cheesy comedy, but I have to say I have really appreciated the DC references, and found it genuinely funny.If you are a Marvel fan and you are following the MCU, I guess that you need to watch this movie, in order to fully understand the future entries of the franchise, otherwise it is avoidable. If you have a Disney+ subscription, just wait for the release on the streaming service, no need to waste money going to the theatre, like I did. Underdeveloped plot and flat characters. Great CGI.","17 out of 30 found this helpful.

All said, while it is perhaps one of the most interesting movies in the franchise, it falls flat in presenting its story as fully fledged as it could have. There are concepts here that are very refreshing for a superhero movie to cover: the price of having god-like powers, the toll of destiny, and self-sacrifice and rebellion against a cause that is unjust.I really love the concept of the story. The Eternals are a group of beings that were created and sent to Earth with the task of protecting humans from another race known as the Deviants. We are given more exposition and backstory as the film goes on. There's some great mythological and cosmological story-telling that is unusual to see in the Marvel universe, and it's honestly refreshing to see the franchise go in this bold new philosophical direction. It leans a lot more heavily on science-fiction than the typical superhero genre. Which might be an explanation for the mixed fan reaction. This isn't your typical Marvel movie.The issue that I have with ""Eternals"" is that it seems to barely scrape the surface on any of these topics. It's mostly given to us through expository dialogue. They aren't running themes throughout the movie. The cast also seems too large at times. A two and a half hour run time isn't enough to give all ten Eternals enough time to shine. What's worse is that the main character of the movie, Sersi (Gemma Chan), is cardboard as well. She has nothing of a character, other than her relationship with Ikaris (Richard Madden). My favorite character is probably Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani). He's got some pretty funny jokes with his sidekick Karun (Harish Patel). It's a shame because he just dips out of the movie at some point.This whole movie is both very interesting and very disappointing at the same time. It had a lot of potential but it just doesn't deliver on some of the cool ideas that it floats around. The special effects and the cinematography are both excellent. It's got a high level of polish that you'd expect from a Marvel movie. I'd recommend this one more to science-fiction fans than fans of the traditional crime-fighting superhero.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

I was lucky enough to see Eternals on the 3rd of November, and it very quickly became one of my all-time favourite Marvel movies. For years, people have been crying out for Marvel to move away from the typical superhero 'formula' and Zhao definitely delivers. Eternals is a superhero movie that feels bigger than just a film. It has a depth that is missing in previous Marvel films and every aspect of the film is beautiful. The visuals are stunning, the cast is incredible and the chemistry between the main group of ten is obvious. The storyline is engaging and includes twists and turns that the audience won't see coming. Sure, it isn't as fast-moving as other superhero movies, but there are ten Eternals that need to be introduced enough for the audience to care about them and so that takes some time. However, it never feels boring and it never drags. The entire cast is incredible, but Barry Keoghan as Druig, Lia McHugh as Sprite and Lauren Ridloff as Mikkari deliver standout performances. Eternals is a breath of fresh air as it's different to your regular superhero movie, but still adds so much to the MCU and is so enjoyable. It is definitely not a movie to miss.","14 out of 21 found this helpful.

And her style is partially what makes this film feel like no other Marvel movie. Like most of her works, this movie feels realistic; partly due to the use of natural light and no slow motion. Making the lighting look natural makes otherwise absurd scenes look slightly more realistic.The use of appropriate visuals also make this movie look better-beautiful golden edges for each Eternal's superpower and grand, larger-than life visual effects for the Celestials. Every design from the costume to the sets are made to convey the film's tone of a grand epic.However, it does get chaotic. Even with its unique style and tone, it's still a Marvel film. A blockbuster with too many new characters and too much happening. The narrative that switches back from the past to present does help make the storytelling more interesting, but the audience still can't make true connections with the characters. The stiff dialogues and weak character motivations are also problems. But it is a film that's decent for what it is.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not perfect but there's a lot to love","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7530551/?ref_=tt_urv","MoviePeek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139667078/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2021","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a triumph, whether the superhero action blockbusters are to your taste or not, their creations have shaped the cinematic landscape for over a decade and continues to leave fans more eager for expansion than ever. Eternals is the latest entry in Marvel's phase four rollout and the 26th film in the franchise overall, that's not even including the juggernaut's expansion into television.Marvel is obviously popular, but not beyond criticism, and has often been accused (among other things) of being too conservative, and recycling their formula, creating safe and soulless films.Eternals tries something a little different, an epic superhero saga spanning thousands of years, featuring a cast of superpowered ancient beings that are about as relatable as Howard the Duck. It's also one of the longest movies in the franchise to date, stretching over two and a half hours, and featuring ten never before seen characters, which all must be developed and fully fleshed out. At the time of writing this review, the film has garnered mixed reviews, and it's clear that the film isn't for everyone. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Eternals, and despite some legitimate problems spattered throughout its considerable run time, the more time passes the more respect I have for the film and the bold and often brilliant choices it makes.Despite the high concept nature of the film, the plot itself is fairly straightforward. The Eternals have been sent to earth and are instructed to only interfere unless Deviants are involved. The Deviants in question are hulking grey wibbly-wobbly aliens that cause carnage and generally wreak havoc. After thousands of years of fighting these nasty boys, their task is seemingly complete, and the team goes their separate ways. However, flash forward to the present day and the unexpected and unexplained re-emergence of The Deviants causes the team to reform and uncover a mystery bigger than any of them could have ever imagined.Despite the large cast of characters, it's clear that Sersi, played by Gemma Chang is the protagonist of the story. She's the character with the most screen-time and is given the most to do. She has the power of matter transmutation and can turn something into something else. I was surprised by the application of her gift, and it presents some genuinely great moments and proved to be far more useful in a combat situation than I expected. In a world of smashy-crashy-punchy people, these are the kind of weird abilities more characters need. The film largely succeeds in balancing screen-time between the rest of The Eternals, with everyone getting something to do, and motivations that make sense. The first Avengers movie notoriously gave Hawkeye the short end of the straw, rest assured that this does not happen in Eternals.My favourite characters outside of Sersi, were Kingo, Druig, and Gilgamesh. Kingo provides plenty of laughs throughout the film and out of all the Eternals had the strongest connection to the people of Earth. Druig proved to be one of the more emotionally complex characters that I thought initially I would hate, but his motivations were ultimately relatable, and I found myself siding with him above all others. Finally, Gilgamesh used his limited screen-time to leave a big impression, adding laughs and heart to an otherwise epic film.Marvel's track record with villains is very hit and miss, Eternal's baddies The Deviants, are given some complexity and motivation, but ultimately it amounts to very little. This is my biggest gripe with the film, and I found them to be very underwhelming. First of all, I don't really care for the design of these space monsters, they don't look fun they look boring, and not for a moment did I believe they could actually exist. Where Thanos or the Skulls look like they could exist in the real world these grey blobs simply could not. Their leader or head honcho is a Deviant named Kro, and he is potentially the ugliest alien in recent memory. The film attempts to make him more than a hulking monster but come the finale it doesn't come together in a satisfying way, and he ends up being very forgettable.To be honest, The Deviants are my only real big criticism, and I found that the majority of the film worked for me. This truly is one of the most epic films Marvel has produced to date and I liked that about it. It was bold and beautiful. Sure, there are expositions dumps here and there and I really hope we don't start every film with a scrolling wall of text from here on in. There's a lot of mythology to unpack here, we are after all talking about the start of the Marvel Universe here.Directed by Chloe Zhao, she brings a different feel to Eternals from other entries in the franchise, with epic sweeping visas and a more serious tone. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, and mainstream audiences may reject its sense of grandeur and sci-fi craziness. For me at least Eternals was a pleasant surprise, and going in I tempered my expectations given the mixed reviews, but ultimately enjoyed the experience for the most part. Eternals succeeds mostly in exploring a new corner of the marvel universe, providing an epic tale that is truly unlike anything the franchise has done before. Featuring many complex and enjoyable characters, the film however fails to reach the peak of the genre due to its weak and muddled villains.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Although Black Widow and Shang-Chi are officially among the two starters, Eternals is the one that is most likely to give the feeling of a reboot. Chloe Zhao, the director who recently scored big at the Oscars with Nomadland, directs the story of ten god-like beings who, after centuries of inactivity, reunite for a fateful mission to defeat evil.Well, Marvel is gifting us with no less than 10(!) new characters after a decade of stories revolving around Iron-Man, Captain America and co. The Eternals, immortal almost alien-like superheroes, a close-knit ""family"" (they refer to themselves as such around five times in the film - Fast and Furious says hello), who split up after a relationship dispute over their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek). While I already have rough problems with some of the original Marvel protagonists, these are real charismatics compared to the Eternals. None, but really none of these newcomers have even the ring of an authentic personality. The Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and Brian Tyree Henry, known from Atlanta (Paper Boiii), as the technician Phastos, come closest to functioning at least as comic relief - though by no means in every scene. In general, the script relies far too much on cheap one liners and superficial running gags in the second act. The MCU team apparently doesn't trust today's cinema audience with anything more intellectual than a film producer who walks around with a camera and gets on the Eternals' nerves. Hilarious. Now that we have dealt with the ""bright spots"" of the film, we come to our glorious protagonists. Lovers Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) have about as much chemistry as a dog with a fire hydrant. Every time Madden looks at his ""lover"" with the same stoic look and says ""Sersei, I love you"", I wanted to pull my hood over my eyes. Nothing against cheesy love scenes. But in a film that takes itself so seriously, even including the first Marvel sex scene since Iron Man, and allows these characters such togetherness, it feels like they got stuck in the Parisian love tunnel. Additionally, the screenwriters allow themselves the cheek to include a completely terse love triangle between, and now ears tips, Sersei, Dane alias Jon Snow (Kit Harington graces us as an exposition character) and Rob Stark (who was played by Madden). Thank you for this brazen reminder Marvel.How Angelina Jolie is mocked in this film is the next item on the long list of shame. She runs around, is a supreme fighter and has epileptic seizures from time to time. Say what you will about this franchise, but every film so far has had some entertainment value. Eternals is two hours of lead-heavy action, has its characters line up three times for ten seconds to show how powerful they are and tries to be funny. At least the last act offers something like action worth watching and a final fight and twist worth mentioning. Plus, a superhero movie has never been so diverse (there are homosexual, deaf-mute and multicultural characters). But no, as talented as Chloe Zhao is, please stick to your indie films.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

I tried to go into it without any typical Pre Marvel expectations. Wow! Once I paid attention to the story and watched it a second time my mind was blown. It's a beautiful story with so many themes + metaphors. I myself was most touched by Gilgamesh's protective loving care of Thena. As well as Sersi in general as a mortal hearted + earth loving immortal.What she did for Sprite!? I needed them to do a little better for Ikaris's ending. It seemed. . too tidy + not in line with his character development.Even if it was to just see Chloe Zao's gorgeous naturalist style of shooting I would watch it a 4th time now. I mean the visuals alone made me SWOON. The cast, the costume design!If you only watched it once, give it another go with a more open mind. Try to go into it without expecting anything like Endgame. Also check out the BTS doc on Disney+ called, 'Assembled: The Making of The Eternals,' if you haven't already. I promise it will be worth it.CANNOT WAIT FOR MAHERSHALA IN BLADE!!!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"4","/10","MCU is making a huge mistake here...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7560296/?ref_=tt_urv","mistela67","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22008378/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2021","First, the Eternals is visually appeasing, funny at times, exciting at others, and tells a complex story. Yeah, and I sorta hated it.Why? Well, let me begin by saying that the first phases on the MCU were extremely effective. The finale, the battle with Thanos, was emotionally draining and satisfying because you honestly felt like you'd just completed a long, and tenuous journey with Iron Man, and Capt America and Thor and Dr. Strange, and everyone else. That feeling of fatigue; that emotional exhaustion, those are human traits. HUMAN. It's those human connections that drew us all into the MCU and made us kinda sorta relate to the original Avengers.With the exception of Thor (to an extent, get to that in a minute), the original heroes of the MCU were HUMAN. We could relate to them, which facilitated our bonding with them. Tony Stark was a smart, money loving playboy. Captain America was a devoted patriot and World War 2 vet. Black Widow was a hot female that could kick ass. Hawkeye was a family man. Falcon and War Machine were military veterans. Black Panther was an African prince. Scarlet Webb was a frightened, orphaned immigrant. Dr. Strange was a miserable alcoholic. The Hulk was an egghead, clumsy scientist. Spiderman was a New York teenager. Captain Marvel was a blond fighter pilot. Even Thor looked and behaved more like a regular guy than a God. The Avengers were you and I, regular people thrown into a chaotic and epic adventure. We grew with them, we cried with them. We fought, we lost, and we won with them. But we did all this knowing that they, like us, were vulnerable, anxious, afraid. We, like they, had anxieties and hardships. And triumphs. So when Thanos came along, he represented an oddity to our world. A true alien, stronger than us, a challenge, a test of our talents, our bravery, our vulnerability, our skills, everything we'd become over the years. And even then struggle and death, we prevailed.But this new phase of MCU doesn't allow for this human connection. Remember how awkward it was when Iron Man was learning how to fly, and how great it felt when he finally nailed it. Now, everyone in the MCU is either flying around like Superman on meth, or shooting raybeams and fireballs from their hands, or doing weird, godlike things. It doesn't seem organic, or home grown. It's not real anymore.Nobody is HUMAN.And I think that is where this new phase of MCU is going to struggle. The Eternals may look human, but they are not. They die, but not like us. They weren't even born. They didn't have to be secretly trained for several years, or pumped full of super serum, or enhanced, built in a multi million dollar lab. They just came out like they were. And because of that, there's really nothing that is relatable with them. And if we can't relate to them, we won't invest in them. Not like we did with Iron Man, or Spiderman. Or Captain America. Can you honestly say that you didn't tear up at least a little in either Infinity War of Endgame?Forgive my rant, but the Eternals represents everything that I don't want for my MCU. I want homegrown. I want characters I can relate to. I want to know that my heroes can actually bleed.Instead, I got a very expensive CGI video game, full of video game characters. Disappointing. Off soapbox now.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

And how deep, heartfelt connections are a decisive factor ; because love, in the end, is what matters and gives any life trajectory a more fulfilled feel... Even if this love takes you to your absolute demise, your existence will nonetheless have had a greater meaning and resonance with it...The movie tackles major philosophical themes ; and through the intimacy of its diverse characters, resonates on a higher plane... Each of The Eternals live a personal tragedy and have to face their doubts, dilemmas and demons, existential questions that go way further than anyone's perception... But as a connected family at its core, they also show the most admirable and moving aspects of what it means to be alive and aware of this incredible world around us...Probably the most gorgeous movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, virtuosically staged (congratulations to Chloe Zhao), every actor/actress fits his/her role perfectly, and they all deliver poignant performances. There are numerous deep emotional moments, in addition to all these striking epic sequences that obviously find their climax in the later parts of the movie (entwined with a heartbreaking dramaturgy that amplifies the emotional impact of it all). The score is a true gem and the entire production is a pure delight. Not a ""Space Opera"", but a ""Mythological Opera""...Definitely a Marvel movie that can't be compared to any other of the franchise...

Sometimes you have these movies, and you go outside and it feels like you enjoyed something, but also not really. It was all clear that the whole cast was pulled together to tick all the boxes of different kind of humans and representations out there (+ Angelina Jolie, she is a representation on her own)... I did like the fact it was not a typical Marvel movie... it had character developments, and typical human stories with jealousy and stubbornness in it... but it took away as well from the whole superhero magic. I'm very curious who this is going to turn out further... and how they will get introduced within the Marvel Universe, as they are all stubborn characters with their own will. The end of the movie... the end credit... that cameo? I mean?? People started to laugh in the cinema even. Let's not do this please! Eternals is a well made movie, but... do I wanna see it again like all the Other Marvel movies? I don't know yet honestly. I think I'm good.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Avengers were fine as mostly they were introduced with their own films. Guardians worked because it revolved around Starlord as a primary character and the other characters were sort of introduced in the periphery. But the Eternals tries to introduce them all in one go, and give a small piece of development before the action sequences, so you don't really get time to learn them and feel for their character.But apart from that its a pretty generic film, writing wise. It does have more of a DC vibe to it than most Marvel films. Good CGI, decent performances, but character development was off which lead to a somewhat disinterested viewing.","17 out of 40 found this helpful.

With that said, like the Inhumans, the Eternals cannot beat what Charles Xavier and his misfit crew put together.The Eternals do try too hard to stand-alone. I am looking for a lot of references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I did not get enough for my taste at all. Realistically, this is why I go to the theatre to see these movies.As a standalone, movie it was not half bad. It had a fantasy like story with many cool characters played by good actors. I did like how complex a lot of the characters were. I felt that the Eternals moved away a lot from the superhero genre, nothing in the movie is as cut and dry as most of these Superhero movies are when it comes to the main characters being heroes.Because of this, once again a marvel movie is missing a good villain. They could have used one. As cool, as the characters are they did a lot of talking. Some of the characters like Kingo and Phastos were interesting enough to want to hear their story. I wish this held true for everyone, but it did not. Plus, all the talking made for too many moments where I forgot what the purpose of their mission is.I am impressed with the visuals, especially the Celestials (who keep changing with every movie they appear in, right?). They were impressively big seeing them on the big screen. I do not know if this was Chole Zhao's first rodeo when it comes to special effects but she definitely did not fall intio the same mistakes that the Russo brothers and Ryan Coolger mad on their first marvel movie outing.That is about it, however. It was not enough of a marvel movie to watch it on the big screen like the others with other people as into it as I am (cause no one else seem to be). I'm glad I saw it on the big screen cause the visuals were impressive but we are getting to the point in which I don't know who these marvel superheroes are and its changing my interest (Although in fairness I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy where before seeing the movie and they won me over far better).","98 out of 291 found this helpful.

I loved everything about the fight scenes, from the choreographies to the technology and powers. The soundtrack is a bit confusing sometimes, it alternates beautiful pieces of music to melodies that sound disconnected. I don't know how to feel about it. The characters are likeable and diverse. The jokes are sometimes a bit too much. The LGBTQ+ representation is a breath of fresh air in a franchise such as Marvel. I liked that the main character is not one of the big names in the cast. Still, I feel like they could have used Angelina Jolie more. I was also a bit disappointed that Kit Harington didn't have as much screen time as one might deduce from the trailer. Overall I think the story was very clear despite the multiple flashbacks, and I'm relieved that I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I missed something or had questions left unanswered. I would have liked the film to be just a little shorter with some adjustments to the pacing. The two post-credit scenes are very exciting!","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

This was a comic line that I wasn't familiar with. It did look like they used mythology so that pulled my interest. This was a movie that I watched in parts while feeding my newborn daughter, Mackenzie, as well.We follow a group known as the celestials. They're led by Ajak (Salma Hayek). She is told where to go and what their missions are by Arishem (voiced by David Kaye). We see as she came to Earth with her team of Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok). They arrive to save humanity from an ancient enemy known as the Deviants.The movie will then jump from the present where Sersi and Sprite live together in London. Sprite looks like a child, despite being alive for thousands of years. Sersi works at a museum and seeing Dane Whitman (Kit Harington). The celestials believe they've defeated the Deviants, but they're back. They also seem to be stronger. Sersi along with Sprite and Ikaris need to get the group back together again, since they've all went their separate ways on Earth. There is a dark truth behind everything though.That should be a good enough recap and introduction to characters. Where I want to delve a bit deeper with is what I love about this. This movie is showing the truth that most mythology and religion on Earth all stem back to Mesopotamia. Even stories from the bible are modeled from myths back then. This claims that Sprite made up the story about Ikaris which we know Icarus who flew too close to the sun. Thena is Athena in Greek mythology. Gilgamesh is a hero from Mesopotamian lore. I loved how they worked this into the backstory here.Despite all the goodwill this builds with what I like about the incorporated history, this struggled to keep my interest. I think part of it is that this group is too powerful so it doesn't translate as well to screen. We see that they can die. There is at least one who does. The struggle between the forces just didn't hold my attention. I also knew that what they were giving as the overarching bad outcome wouldn't happen so there is that.What is also a shame about me connecting here is that we have a great cast. Chan is good as our lead. It is fun to see Madden and Harington from Game of Thrones here. I knew Ridloff from The Walking Dead. They're all good here. I also liked Jolie, Hayek, Nanjiani, McHugh, Henry, Keoghan and Dong-seok. That's not to mention that we have Bill Skarsg√•rd, Harry Styles and even Patton Oswalt. There is a strong cast.The only other things to say would be with the filmmaking. This is shot well. I'll give credit to the cinematography. This is a CGI-fest, but like most comic book movies, I do come to expect that. It has that Disney money so it looks good there. This is a popcorn, action movie that I come to expect from Marvel. I'd recommend it if you're working through the MCU for sure. I just don't love it.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The film spends most of it's time in 2021, but has plenty of flashbacks over the previous millennia.As they're not mainstream heroes, they all seem to have a generic power, with no-one being too special. As with all ensemble casts, not everyone gets much screen-time and it takes a while to figure out who does what and how they fit in. For the record, Ajak (Hayek) is the leader, with Sersi (Chan; the heart of the film) and Ikaris (Madden) essentially acting as the leads/love interests. The next most screen-time goes to Sprite (McHugh, the ""kid"") and Kingo (Nanjiani, a little comedic relief). Then there's Thena (Jolie, barely used), Phastos (Tyree Henry), Makkari (Ridloff), Druig (Keoghan, such a punchable face) and Gilgamesh (Dong-seok). Once you figure out who's who, it's basically over!There's not really a ""big bad guy"" as such, and the whole Celestials thing is pretty laughable, but if you go with it, there's still quite a bit that doesn't really come together until the end. The final 30min or so is pretty exciting, but there's certainly a sizeable lull in the middle. It certainly has it's moments, with some good CGI, but the stakes never seem quite as high as they should and the tone is often a bit too dour, with not as much fun and effervescence as I'd expect. The post-credits scenes create more questions for the next set of films to answer.","42 out of 117 found this helpful.

I think the pace was fine, the story starts quickly without too much introduction. At no point it felt slow or boring to me, there are no notable filler scenes and everything is there for something or for the characters' development, there is always something new to discover, a surprise or a twist. I actually wanted to go to the bathroom when it started and went until the very end because I was so hooked on the plot lol. Wasn't expecting it but it has a lot of action, although it works really well with the story and doesn't feel unnecessary.It definitely falls outside the Marvel formula, it has a different and much more mature tone without childish jokes, although it's still funny and made me laugh (and my theater) several times. It's normal to forget that you are watching an MCU movie, it happened to me most part of the movie. It may not be to everyone's taste but at least for me and my friends who watched it was pretty good.It's a thought provoking movie, it doesn't tell you what is right or who the villain is, it's up to you from the perspective you want to take. Still considered the story is very clear and not confusing. I think what stands out the most is characters' development, they all are interesting and relatable, they have flaws.I also didn't pay much attention to it because I was hooked on the story but it's visually stunning. The cast is perfect and they are very talented, every scene looks natural, and without question Chloe Zhao's direction is great.

The visuals are stunning, the storylline is okay and continues the trend of expanding the Marvel universe. However, it does feel like a duology crammed into one film with a LOT of exposition. The trailer gave the impression of doing a good job balancing the past of the eternals and the present but the execution lacked soul. It lacked the energy of an avengers level, star studded, big budget CGI type movie, however the third act did a good job with that. While the threat seemed very real and magnanimous, it lacked in engaging the audience as much as i had hoped. The biggest let down is the underutilisation of the use of powers. It really feels like even the Avengers could defeat them whereas in reality they are far more powerful. Here's a quick spoiler-free rundown of the plus points and down points of the characters:
Madden's Ikaris is powerful and it shows, however his full potential is not really explored. And yes, Superman from DC would easily defeat him, no cap.Jolie's Thena and Dong-Seok's Gilgamesh have really engaging action sequences but lacks the soul of an Eternal.Chan's Sersei has been executed really well where her true potential is explored throughout the film.Henry's Phastos' real potential is explored and is a treat to watch.Hayek's Ajak is a let down.McHugh's Sprite takes you through an emotional journey and has been executed pretty well.Ridloff's Marraki steals the show when she appears and is really powerful.Nanjiani's Kingo is a well executed character who also serves as a comic relief along with Patel's Karun but is a let down in the third act.Keoghan's Druig is by far my favourite character in the movie. Although he is no match for most of the characters in combat scenario, he is a really well executed character and will make you root for him.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

This isn't entertainingly bad but is so meh you'll wonder why it was ever made. This was the first time during a movie I actually saw people walk out of the theater in the middle and never return.What did eternals do right? The cg was gorgeous, some of the outer space shots were some of the nicest cg I've ever seen...... and that's it.What did eternals do wrong? The Story, nothing exceptional and told poorly. The eternals first come across as basically rat catchers fighting really big rats. The twists in the story really don't improve on this level of blandness. The main characters were mostly flat and lifeless, even the two love interests felt as if they had no affection or attraction for each other. The side characters came across as the most interesting parts of the story and they only showed up briefly. Character growth was both forced (character thinks a in flashback, now thinks b but no reason given) and non-existent (both a and b are basically the same thing anyways) at the same time. I've heard people say this would do better as a series, maybe it would, but it wasn't. The choreography was also pretty boring, feeling more like watching two old men with flashlights shining them at each other until one of them falls down with just enough variety to show that the characters have different skills, not a single fight felt entertaining or strategic, just sort of there to sandwich the parts where the characters have to speak in an attempt to stop you from realizing how boring everything they said was.It reminded me most of the inhumans tv series, but the inhumans was still better than this in that it had stronger overall cast. Eternals was not quite crap but if it wasn't mcu there would be no one really wanting to see it, not the worst thing I saw in 2021, just the second worst. Even Aquaman was more interesting to watch. There was no sense of fun anywhere in the movie and I hope they will just let the eternals disappear and put their resources towards better projects.","38 out of 78 found this helpful.

But from the beginning to the post-credit nonsense (which even hardcore comics fans may have to hit the Net to understand)... this plot just plods along.This film is jump-the-shark ridiculous (okay, maybe a little interesting, but really?). The Eternals themselves are absolutely nothing like what comic book readers would have expected, and the overall product is just droll. Some individuals may love it... but the ratings overall aren't showing a lotta love.By the end of the film I was so sick of gold-wire special effects I wanted to barf rainbows.Yay for the short-ish character in the post-credits. (No spoilers here.) An old favorite of mine and portrayed pretty well.The Eternals themselves were seriously unimpressive. ""Immortals"" who would actually be killed (apparently) by any crook with an Uzi simply aren't all that impressive. They can take being bashed halfway across a continent but can be stabbed with a knife? Really?Yet another disappointment from a long-anticipated film. I know it's difficult to forecast how a movie is going to come across in the end, but sometimes I have to wonder if Marvel ever puts these scripts through a limited multi-interest fan group to see if the film stands a chance. ""Dude, this script sux"" could go a long way in preventing such films from ever hitting the market.The ultimate question (the one that always tips the scale): Would I watch it again? Definitely not.

This is a matured superhero movie with a tint of DC style storytelling.","27 out of 46 found this helpful.

As to that, I have some serious doubts. Yes, the movie looks awesome, the CGI is amazing, and the action sequences are thrilling. But what I missed was the feeling of being drawn into the narrative, of being involved with the characters and their stories, of real urgency for all the goings on.What did not help was the extremely complicated main story, and also the fact that there were just too many characters to have to relate to, which was pretty hard, even in two and a half hours, so as a result their backgrounds mostly stayed vague or even unfathomable. What didn't help either were those long stretches of endless talking, it brought the movie time and again to an almost standstill.Some of the actors seemed strangely misplaced as intended god-like super-hero (Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff, Kumail Nanjiani), others were hardly convincing (like Angelina Jolie) or didn't even seem to try (like Richard Madden, who apparently thought that his character constantly had to look and act grim and stone-faced!). My real favorites by the way were Gemma Chan as Sersi and Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh.I understood from the ending, that there are many eventful things to come in the next sequel(s), so maybe I have to consider this first movie more as a preliminary introduction. But if by introduction you think of getting gradually enlightened in the main story, it failed.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

With Iron Man movies, Tony started out as self obsessed, ego-maniac but during the course of these movies Tony has several life changing events (becoming accountable the weapons he builds, almost dying from Palladium, suffering from PTSD) which changes him and I feel for him and find myself rooting for him. In the Captain American movies, when Dr. Erskine makes Steve Rogers promise that whatever happens with the super soldier transformation, that he will stay who he is, not a perfect soldier but a good man, to which Steve holds up his glass and says ""to the little guys"". And when Steve doesn't give up on Bucky through Captain American The Winter Soldier and in Civil War, we can't help getting emotionally attached. In Thor, he too starts off as Odin tells him you are a vain, greedy, cruel boy and then changes during the course of the movie and gives his life to save the town, we get choked up with emotion for him. These are the big three, all the other characters Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Starlord, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hulk, Bucky, Groot, Gamora, Rhody, Coulson, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Quick Silver, Falcon, Loki, Mantis, Drax, Vision, Wasp, Rocket and on and on, we all loved them. But with the Eternals, I was not emotional invested in any of them, their limited back story didn't have me rooting for any of them except maybe Gilgamesh. I left the theater without the emotional high I am usually accustomed to after seeing a Marvel movie, but rather eh.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is no realism to the action. No stakes to the drama. It's cheap plastic entertainment. Thankfully, there were some human moments that shined through. Gemma Chan is lovely. The gay was fun. Sprite too. Richard Madden was a bit joyless. Angelina was stiff. (It would have been amazing if they cast an older actress as Thena - especially since she seemed to have alzheimers. Imagine Sharon Stone in the role - would have worked on many levels). Overall - this was too cumbersome and turgid a movie to have fun with. Like an Avengers movie that skipped the phase one set up and had to cram it all in in one movie.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Even though it's not fully explained for the Eternals, almost each character will get (a part of) their story explained. This takes time and some might consider this too long with a slow pace. However very necessary for the film.Could've used a little more action, but think upcoming film(s) will have more of thet and maybe even some solo films? It definitely leaves an open window for (a lot) more and the movie was interesting enough to leave you with questions you want to have answered!PS. Keep seated during the credits for the two addition scenes. You want to see more after this.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Firstly I don't care about these (MCU) films anymore whatsoever, thought it would be better after ""Endgame"" to just stop the franchise. Why do they need to keep making films..............oh yeah for money.........my bad I just remembered. If I'm being honest I have been in the minority for a long time, the MCU to me is very hit and miss............although I never thought they could miss this poorly.Lets try and talk about some positives first. Let me think here Mmmm.......... Gemma Chan was trying very hard to at least give some resemblance of a good performance however with this script its almost impossible. She carried the film well and did standout so congrats to her, its not her fault this film is bad. Also Angelina Jolie......*sigh*......for years there have been rumours that she had turned down offers to appear in ""comic book"" films. This is the one that she picked! For me she is the best part of the film, which isn't saying much, however her performance throughout is good and her character is slightly interesting. She deserved a better film!!!The rest of the cast, I cant really remember. A few of them were really annoying and bland. Not very memorable whatsoever.Sadly though there is going to be a certain section of society that will hate this film regardless of seeing it or for its actual issues. I do like the very bold attempt and showing probably the most diverse cast of characters in a film I think I've seen period. Chloe Zhao and Kevin Feige should be applauded for doing this and hopefully with some luck this will become so normal that we won't have to talk about it or bring it up. The diversity of the film is not its problem !! For me its issues are far far worse then that!!Story!!! My god is this story bland, boring, unoriginal, overly complicated, cliche, laughable and just all over the place. I don't think I've seen many films from Marvel, under the Disney umbrella, that have been as messy as this one. From my point of view this film has too many characters and plot points going on for its own good. Introducing a lot of brand new information to the audience for the first time...........its a lot to take in. Sadly the film does not pull it off whatsoever!!To me this film is a brand new modern state of the art skyscraper but with the foundations of three old wooden chair legs. The film may look good from the outside, have a good cast and decent special effects however its (foundation) story and place in this universe does not make one bit of sense.Its obvious to me that they rushed this into production, its even more surprising considering the fact this film was delayed a year for covid. ""Eternals"" should have been split up into multiple films, that way the story and characters could have had more time to be fleshed out. However with a 2hr 30 min runtime, this film feels like an eternity already.30% out 100 this film is bad at its core. Two decent performances, some ok character interaction. However its surrounded by a dull, boring and unoriginal rushed story that is all over the place. If you loved this film great, good for you.........this film have major issues for me, its sadly though in 2021 not the thing thats gonna be talked about.","77 out of 172 found this helpful.

Since I knew that this film was meant to be slightly different to the others. Leaving the theatre, I felt a bit disheartened that I couldn't quite connect with the characters as much as I wanted to.It's inevitable with such a large A-list cast, that they would all have to divide up the screen-time & make sure each character was given enough spotlight.However, I found that even with Cersei & Ikaris claiming most of the screen time, I still couldn't find myself rooting for their relationship because I wasn't taken on that journey of how their relationship developed. Sure, there were a few montages to show they were inlove & Ikaris watching Cersei braid a little girls hair and smile lovingly at her but that really was it. Just short moments of them staring at eachother & smiling.That wasn't enough for me to really feel a connection & care for them.Infact, I found myself caring for Thena & Gilgamesh aswell as Makkari & Druig, more.The concept of their familial relationship that stemmed from the Avengers family, didn't have the same impact. We have been taken on a 10 year journey already, revolving around the Avengers & how they all fought each other and then united together.I understand that Marvel was trying to portray the Eternals as this broken up family whom once were very much united & that we should care. But I found myself wishing that they had separated Eternals into part 1 & part 2. Part 1 focussing on the Eternals & how they came to be and them in their first 5000 centuries being a close family & eventually at the end of part 1, them having to split ways. Then Part 2 them having to find eachother again & save the universe, etc.Although longer than the usual MCU runtime, 2 & 1/2 hours wasn't enough to invoke a strong emotion from me because there was too much ground to cover that they weren't able to go into depth with many things.Overall, it felt a bit lacklustre. I really tried hard to love it. Perhaps in my second watch, I will feel differently.If you're reading reviews to decide whether it's worth watching, please don't be put off by the more negative reviews. Just go into the cinema with broad mindset. I still enjoyed the movie just not as much as I wanted to.There are plenty of twists, deaths & the two post-credit scenes are very much impactful to the future of MCU.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has way too many flashbacks that spoon feed us a story that doesn't have a point. There's way so many characters that the movie doesn't have enough time to flesh out... any of them. At no point do you believe these characters have spent thousands of years together, they lack chemistry. That's due to stale dialogue but also bad writing. A lot of the characters are so bland or absent for a lot of the movie that i literally dont care if the villains win when they fight. Plus it's a marvel movie so the pending doom feels saturday morning cartoonish and inconsequential. The premise of the movie is interesting but its bogged down by two other plots that dont need to be in the movie. The whole plot of the movie revolves around the characters moral struggle with their role as protectors of the earth, but some of the most interesting characters in the movie... dissappear for 70% of the movie. Some of the characters dissapear and theres never an explanation for why they chose to sit out. This movie shoulda stayed on disney +. This movie tries to do too many things at once. It's trying to be an origin story, fit in multiple seperate villains all with separate motivations, the individual stories of EIGHT eternals and tries to make it all a part of the mcu and a story about morality and an action movie. And it doesn't do ANY of those things well. This is an unfocused, badly written movie that doesn't know what it wants to be, let alone how to execute that. This movie is 2 and half hours long but it feels like 6.","38 out of 79 found this helpful.

However, I was deeply surprised and saddened to hear the negative responses to this movie from critics, and some casual audience members too, but tried to ignore them after hearing from quite a few fans to not listen to the critics.First of all, this movie had a lot to live up to considering the introduction to many new characters and forming the way for future MCU projects, and unfortunately, I think it crumbled over the pressure.Starting off positively, the CGI in this film is fantastic, and I think it's some of the best CGI we've seen in the MCU since Doctor Strange. And the cinematography was also incredible; one shot in particular that stuck with me was a shot of Barry Keough's Druig walking down an exterior staircase, with flames and the moon in the background, but what more could you expect with Chloe Zhao having such a big role in the film. And the action, while admittedly infrequent, is spectacular. The opening scene of the movie is a team style action sequence with all of the Eternals, and it was easily a standout in the film, I'd consider it one of the best opening scenes in an MCU movie to date. I couldn't resist mentioning the diverse cast that this film offers; which will definitely mean a lot to some viewers. Another thing I loved was the clear and exhilarating display of all of the characters' power range, which I always love seeing in a superhero movie, especially when there is a team of heroes like the Eternals. Seeing a huge display of awesome powers really makes me enjoy a superhero flick more; which is one of the reasons I enjoyed Dark Phoenix (2019), as they showed all of the X-Men's powers in a really creative way. My favourite character of the film is Lauren Ridloff's Makkari, whose powers I thought were displayed well in particular. In recent years, we've been used to seeing speedy superheroes in slo-mo when they use their powers, and don't get me wrong, Quicksilver's scenes in the X-Men universe are breathtaking, but I really enjoyed seeing Makkari running with the camera keeping up with her, no slo-mo involved. I really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff in The Walking Dead as Connie, and I hope we see more TWD actors come to the MCU, perhaps Norman Reedus as Ghost Rider..However, this movie is maybe the most complex film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, which some people may enjoy and some people may not. I honestly am not a fan of overly complex films; which is why I don't like Inception or Tenet as much as most people. I didn't find this film hugely complex, but it's long runtime and many new characters became overwhelming for me, and it might be for some others too. I know I mentioned that the CGI was great in the film, but in the Mid-Credit scene where two new characters are introduced, the CGI is not great in the slightest, and probably the worst since Black Panther's final battle. Some of the characters don't get much spotlight at all, including Angelina Jolie's Thena and Barry Keough's Druig, which is a shame as when they are on screen they both give incredible performances, as does the rest of the cast. Also, I'm not entirely sure if there's a true villain to this story, you could argue that the Deviants are the villains, but if that's the case, they aren't going to be memorable at all, as only one of them can actually speak, whom is voiced by Bill Skarsgard. Finally, the cameo/introduction to a new character at the end may leave many angry, largely to do with the casting, and I personally thought it was very out of place, but we'll see where that character leads to.Overall, Eternals is a pretty forgettable and controversial addition to the MCU, with some high highs and some low lows. I will look forward to seeing these characters again but not many of them stuck with me at all. I'm more excited to watch the projects set up and teased by this film than rewatching this film as a whole. Still worth a watch for any Marvel fan.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has so many characters to be introduced in one movie which is quite complex for us to understand each one and the relationship between them.2. It's sooooo long and boring as we're watching these new characters that we're not used to3. It should've had more of that ""superhero"" feeling of other movies, this movie is different but not in a good way .. it has more focus on drama than action, the story is not that enjoyable, there are many scenes that had more time than it deserved which makes it quite boring and dull.Overall, any superhero movie should always focus on what it really matters for being a superhero movie, not so many characters, clear ambitions for every character that really make sense, more action and intense, interesting story that fits the longevity of the movie, not focusing too much on drama, romance, politics, adult contents ( whether it's LGBTQ or not, sex scenes ) or any other aspect that is not a main aspect of superhero movies ( not only for eternals or mcu films but for all superhero movies ).","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

But why would that be a bad thing? It's bringing a breath of fresh air to the MCU. The whole cast is bringing a good performance, there are many beautiful shots, camera work is good as well and the music by Ramin Dadjawi is unlike any Marvel soundtrack we've had before. Yes, the story isn't the MCU mainstream that we already know, but that's within the best thing about the movie. Also there are some twists that you don't see coming(provided you don't know the exact leak) which causes some conflicts among the Eternals.The negative points:
-CGI. In like 2/3 of the movie the CGI is actually looking pretty good, but there are also a LOT of scenes(especially in the last act) where the visuals look really horrible, so that you wonder if you're watching an animated movie.-final: yes of course, after a movie with a story that is something new and creative we have to make a big CGI-puke where the world needs to end again, we are not spared from it. A pity
charakters: !maybe a really really small spoiler! Some charakters that were great announced with their names totally fall by their wayside. One really popular actor has no scene in the whole movie from which there wasn't at least an extract in the trailers. Again....., a pity
But all over all it's still a really good movie you should experience on a big screen, because that is, what it was made for.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

We now have Gemma Chan, who played a Kree in Captain Marvel, in the role of a peaceful Eternal. (It's not forbidden to use the same actor twice in the same canon, but you might confuse the geeks and/or generate an avoidable slew of ""theories"".)The most important question on your mind right now is probably: Wait, what's an Eternal? And how have I missed that there's a new Marvel Studios movie out?Indeed, Eternals seems to have the Marvel geeks mildly enthused at best (I'll include myself here if ""pretty decent knowledge"" counts as being a Marvel geek, even if I've had mixed reactions towards the MCU). This may be because this feels like a more generic MCU prequel, focusing squarely on a particular character or group. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the MCU, we have the aftermath of Thanos' ""snap"" and boy is sh-t getting freaky!We've had Wanda Maximoff creating a pocket dimension wherein other universes appeared to ""bleed through"", which, even though it was a fake-out, led to exploring different timelines within the MCU we all know and then seemingly getting into PREVIOUS big-screen Marvel universes, judging from what we know of the next Spider-Man movie -- which, yes, is set to star both the Maguire and Garfield versions of the web-slinger (don't get me started on the Morbius trailer). Eternals? Yawn.Okay, on to some actual new review content: From what I've understood of Marvel Comics lore, the Eternals are the people of Thanos (who's also a ""Titan"" but I guess that's more to do with migration) and since that villain needs to be upstaged, the only possibility is Galactus, but we don't even get a tease for him here. Another thing that would make sense, now that we're getting real cosmic, is a follow-up on Guardians of the Galaxy's tease for Adam Warlock but no cigar. The Eternals themselves don't have much marquee value and the trailers have done little to make anyone but the hardcore Marvel simps especially hopeful.What this means, as I'm sure you've noticed, is that the Usual Journalists have had to bend over even further backwards than normal to make this film seem remotely exciting. I've seen reviews that grasp at all the straws they can find to paint this bland, bloated video game-looking garbage as great filmmaking (even when the reviews praise nothing in particular), and writers of the same ilk have had to REALLY doll out the ""firsts"" -- first gay superhero, first deaf superhero, first *insert race* superhero, first MCU sex scene (the first Iron Man begs to differ), and so on. Did you think all those sexist Black Widow haters were bad? Well, just you wait. You're all kinds of -phobe if you don't like this one!We learn that these Eternals have watched over humankind for thousands of years, including years where they definitely could've lent a hand in defeating the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, or indeed Thanos. We do learn that they were instructed by the all-powerful Celestials to only interfere if ""Deviants"" are involved. We learn all kinds of things, but don't really wind up liking anyone, nor do we get to see anything that sets these powerful, humanoid aliens apart from most of the other powerful, humanoid aliens we've seen in the MCU -- apart from when they generate swirly gold that looks kind of cool. One of them even borrows a trick from Loki.The cast is rich, to be sure, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani (whose ""Bollywood"" scenes constitute a highlight), Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, and Harry Styles as Thanos' brother Starfox (and yes, the Mad Titan's sibling looked like a boyband twink in the comics too). These actors do fine, but their assignment is to play generic comic-book characters in a generic MCU film that I'm forgetting more and more as I'm writing this -- aside from a few truly cringeworthy jokes and bizarre references to DC Comics.At least we're getting Blade soon, apparently.","120 out of 281 found this helpful.

See this film is totally different from the previous 25 films in the MCU. It's a shift towards something else, a different mythos. Chloe Zhao (if you have seen her earlier films) makes a certain kind of cinema. Seeing Eternals it feels she was given a good amount of creative control. The film might feel slow in the 1st half because of the immense world building it has to do with so many characters and myths involved. It still does it reasonably well. It's very unlike a traditional Marvel film with the cheek in tongue humor and a formulaic approach to film making which works incredibly well. The film has a lot to cover in 150 mins, and I felt it did cover everything to some extent but still left me wanting for more.The film has glorious visuals, it's just a feast for the eyes. The film takes you around the globe in different times, in different empires as it walks through the history of Eternals while. It's just cool to watch knowing what all the Eternals did from the start of mankind. Was pretty excited to see the GOT boys Richard and Kit, and they don't disappoint. It was eerie watching them say 'I love you Sersi""(Those who know, know). Angelina Jolie was breathtaking to watch, I simply couldn't take my eyes off her. Yet again Marvel Villain dissapoints me, as the Deviants don't have any character to them as they simply are like beasts. Post credit scenes are cool and give a great insight on the future. I'm psyched for the next chapter in the MCU gallore as they explore more amazing characters I grew up reading. Sure this wouldn't rank in my top 5 Mcu movies, but Eternals is not as bad as the reviews have made it sound. An absolute must watch for a Marvel fan.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story is told in a very non-linear way which was a big chance to take, but works well.At the end of the day, Eternals left me interested and ready for what more Marvel has coming.

(not mentioning the very obvious LGBTQ+ hate spread)There is a lot to juggle in this movie but for the most part, everything was handled brilliantly and was not as polluted as many say it is but that could also simply come down to how much you know about the MCU. The movie is eternity above others in the MCU compared to how emotional it is, it has many deep, spiritual ideas and views about it which require people to be open-minded. The humor is also amazing but doesn't elude the common problem of Marvel movies of misplacing humor and jokes or packing it in where it's not needed. Finally the action and cinematography is astounding and breath-taking, the visuals of this movie cannot be compared to any other Marvel one because they are simply on another level, whether it is a awe-inspiring sunset shot or an exhilarating action sequence, everything was done beautifully. The powers of everyone were shown on screen in full-scale and every single Eternal had their own moment to shine.So watch and decide for yourself how much you like this movie! It's not bad by any means and I would say it's absolutely amazing but that could also be because I went into the movie with substantial MCU knowledge which is way above average compared to the casual watcher who are also the ones who seem to be bombarding the movie with horrible reviews. My comprehension of the ideas of the MCU could also be why I was so amazed by every little thing that happened in the movie which of course had led me to writing this 10* review.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Infinity war, End game and a few other movies in the previous series certainly delivered a lot of stories and emotions. There are one or two things Marvel can learn from DC as much there is a lot that DC movies can learn from Marvel. Comics do time to time require more depth, emotion and elaborated stories than just pure action and adventure.Eternals can't be Iron man style - let's agree on that point. Anyone, who has read some of the Eternals comics series would know this... it has more story and history than just pure action fun.Eternal is not without its faults but we need more of these in Marvel !!! Well done.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It wasn't terrible, just mediocre. Lets start with the pros, I thought that the movie was fairly funny, the usual brand of Marvel comedy, and while the reviews made the run time seem daunting I thought it was fairly well paced.Still, there are quite a few negatives, my main being that it felt like a lot of wasted potential. Never before has a Marvel film been juggling so many different themes and characters at the same time and without getting into spoilers I think some of the ideas were fascinating, the problem is that while juggling so many characters it was difficult for Chloe Zhao, the director, to ever really fully explore any of them. The villains of the film, the deviants, begin off incredibly bland but, small spoiler here, they start stealing the powers of eternals and using them to evolve. This was a great idea which was never explored, one deviant gained the two most boring powers and never really did anything with them before dying. The cast is decent but I never connected with any of them, I had heard good things about the cinematography but to be honest it felt kind of lacklustre as well. The music was forgettable and the villains boring. There were loads of great ideas at play here (the majority of which I can't mention without major spoilers) but in the end none of them really came to fruition, if you're a die hard Marvel fan like me it isn't as bad as the reviews have said but if you are a casual viewer you may as well skip this one and just google the post credits scenes. 6/10.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This is so incredibly rare in Hollywood, where most attempts at ""diversity"" is forced and out of touch. This is no easy feat and deserves recognition. The movie is also less formulaic and mindlessly entertaining, and contains more mature themes with deeper philosophical questions, moral ambiguity, complex relationships, and drama. All great breaking the mould for a Marvel film.However, some of the script is painfully cheesy, the characters lack chemistry (except a certain brooding ""teenager"" and speedster), and so many key characters are simply used as plot devices then tossed aside. Not to mention awkward video-game-esque fight scenes and unrealistic CGI. Great casting, ok directing, & poor dialogue. Overall not a waste of time, but compared to the great chemistry of Spider-Man, action of Shang Chi, and masterpieces like Endgame... this film doesn't measure up.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

You would think that Marvel would have the wisdom to learn from DC's mistakes, but instead, we see many of these same errors cropping up in Eternals (2021). Perhaps this is a side-effect of an extremely intertwined cinematic universe that requires each player in a larger multi-movie arc to receive an ""origin story"" movie before being brought into a larger cast of characters (much like Shang-chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)).Part of what made Justice League fail was how it introduced too many characters at once. In Eternals, there's a group of superheroes whose numbers rival later Avengers casts, but with no time to get to know any of them significantly well in an already long runtime. That the Snyder cut of Justice League spent four hours to remedy this indicates the problem here. Furthermore, Eternals feels disconnected from the MCU. They could have easily connected a few moments to Infinity War (2018) but glossed over these plot holes without so much as a shrug.I will give Marvel credit for trying something a little more artistic here. Choosing Chloe Zhao-of Best Picture-winning Nomadland (2020) fame-to helm this project was a bold move. The spacious visuals almost feel alien despite these events taking place on Earth. The scale of the action demands this approach, which works well considering how easily they can be ignored in other MCU movies to come. And while some might fault this movie for being ""inclusive,"" I appreciated how such a diverse set of people weren't so homogenous as to remove any internal group friction or drama-which would definitely be present with so many cultures represented here.An ambitious project that didn't learn from its competitors, I give Eternals 3.0 stars out of 5.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its not the worst but nothing i would show someone to draw them into my comic movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

G. superhero team the Avengers. The Avengers ascended to their heights because the actual team up was built upon with the introduction and development of the individual characters before cramming them together. With 6 films in 4 years the build up to The Avengers was unparalleled up to that point.Now ,seemingly, in an attempt to reverse engineer a superhero franchise we leap right past a mear 7000 years to find the audience having to get the abridged version of character development. Yeah sure, effort was made to establish some humanity in The Eternals by pairing them off but it feels a bit forced. Kevin Feige has yet to foul up so I'll take The Eternals as anything but half-cocked. Perhaps with the ever growing slate of MCU mini series on Disney+ maybe we will get to see some better explanation as to what they were all up to for all that time...at least since Babylon. ü§î","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film follows a group of immortal beings known as the Eternals, who have been living among humans for thousands of years in secret. When a new threat emerges that could destroy the world, the Eternals must come together to protect humanity.One of the film's strengths is its impressive visuals. The director Chloe Zhao has created a beautiful and immersive world, with stunning landscapes and breathtaking special effects. The film also boasts an impressive cast, with standout performances from Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, and Kumail Nanjiani.However, the film's ambition may also be its downfall. With a large ensemble cast and a complex mythology to explore, the film can feel overstuffed and convoluted at times. The pacing is also uneven, with the first half of the film feeling slow and exposition-heavy.Another issue with the film is its lack of clear stakes. While the threat to the world is certainly significant, it doesn't feel as urgent or immediate as some of the other threats in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As a result, the climax of the film can feel somewhat anticlimactic.Overall, Marvel's Eternals is a visually stunning and ambitious superhero movie that may not be for everyone. While the film has its strengths, including a talented cast and impressive visuals, its convoluted plot and lack of clear stakes may leave some viewers feeling underwhelmed. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a promising start for a new team of heroes.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Eternals moves the storytelling along in a more cosmic sense, but it was a mixed bag result.So, does The Eternals deserve the worse ratings in MCU history along with being worse than the worse of DC's offerings? Not really. It is easily better than at least several MCU movies.The plot is very ambitious to tell in a movie format, but it is pretty straightforward. Time jumps are clearly labelled and necessary for character development as we track these characters over 7,000 years. If you're confused by an obviously labelled time jump, you have other problems to deal with. The protagonists are compelling but there are too many of them for an origin story. The story is more mature with less humor than other MCU offerings, so this might turn you off by it. But, ultimately, it is a story about humanity and what it means to be human and somehow be influenced by it (or not) even if you're immortal.The cinematography is gorgeous, but it doesn't always work well with CGI, especially in darker settings. I feel the the use of Stagecraft (how they film Mandalorian) would've been a better fit for this movie. I would even say that the story of The Eternals would've been better served as a Disney+ show.I enjoyed the movie for what it is: an MCU origin story that introduces us to new heroes, how they are influenced by humanity, and the bigger perspective of how the cosmic side of the MCU fits in. The Eternals is going to be divisive but, fortunately, there are no cringe-worthy ""Martha"" moments to face palm over.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I dozed off for a good 15 minutes and I'm not sure what I missed because when I opened my eyes I was still up on what was going on. Now I know that people are defending bad reviews by saying that we are being homophobic or do not appreciate a hero with a disability. Nope! I didn't mind that at all. Sitting with my grandson while to male heros kissed didn't much bother me. I mean that's pretty well mainstream nowadays. Really the only issue I had with the deaf hero was the fact that my grandson can't read the subtitles fast enough to know what was going on and I wasn't going to bother other watchers reading it to him. The fact is the movie was just plain bad. I honestly thought I was watching a DC movie. Little to no character build up, a plot that was never really 100% understood and one of the most anti climactic endings I have seen since the Blair witch project. I wanted so badly to like it as I told my grandson that this is THE movie in Marvel's next phase and will set the foundation to future movies. I hope I am wrong there. I thought to myself afterwards that it was like if you never seen a marvel movie and started with the first avengers. Not only do I not know any character back stories, whose side they are on and the powers they possess. It just seemed like any of them can do anything. I know that's not true because one guy enjoyed shooting Lazer out his eyes like cyclops but another could do the same with what I think was his fingertips. I don't know, maybe Zach Snyder can jump in and do a ""justice league "" move on it. I hate so so much that I hated this movie. But I fear that Marvel may have jumped the shark with this one.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie struggles with being part of a much larger universe, at times feeling like it should be just a stand alone, but with jarring references to the universe that feel out of place, forced, and often make little sense to that universe. There's no real, central villain, which makes it feel like several little movies that got mashed together. The visuals are as impressive as always, but the fights are boring, the plot is muddled, and by the last 30 minutes I just felt like it should have been over already. None of the characters are particularly interesting either, which is disappointing given the diversity of the powers, personalities, and even actors.I did think the internal reflection of one of the eternals at seeing the consequences of his own meddling in human affairs was really interesting, and provided at least some explanation for the Eternals choice to remain adherent to their non-intervention rule, but it is brief, left unexplored, and frankly feels like it was an after thought.The comedy doesn't land well either.Frankly, this is surprising given director Chlo√© Zhao's otherwise phenomenal quality of work. If her name weren't in the credits, I'd never have believed this mess was her work.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

To begin, this is NOT your MCU/Avengers movie that you're used to. We know through the first 3 phases that there are cosmic influences and powers beyond our imagination but we've been experiencing these stories mainly on Earth with characters that everyone has known, in reality, for decades growing up. Now Disney/MCU is going where no man, except Captain Marvel, has gone before.There are some pros and cons to this film, which I will say is the most visually stunning MCU picture yet. So I am going to try to use generalities instead of movie specifics so not to spoil.Pros: As I said above, incredibly striking cinematography, this film was built for large home theaters and IMAX to fully engulf your experience. Larger than life! The cast was excellent... anytime you can pull favorites like Hayek and Jolie and they are fine with taking more of a backseat to the rest of the younger cast... I always appreciate that. As a history buff I appreciate the walkthrough of the ETERNALS life here on Earth and how it interwove with history... there's a lot of story to unpack, could've easily made this 3 movies and character built more effectively but I think the MCUniverse is fixing to explode with heroes and villains and Disney just couldn't spend that kind of time on each character within. Also want to give a big shout out to the levity in this film, mild but well timed!Cons: the story is choppy at times so you really have to pay attention to what era you are in. Really would like to have seen expansion toward the beginning and focused on the Deviants a little more but again, time to build characters is never easy and this could've been a 6 hour film. I do NOT appreciate a sex scene in my superhero movies, do NOT! It was mild in comparison to other PG-13 and R movies but be mindful bringing younger kids to the cinema. I understand that love is a central theme but I don't have to physically see it manifest to know that. There is a gay couple with an adopted child in the film so parents do with that information what you will. I wanted more story from the mains but I think some of that will come with time, and seeing it again.All in all, really enjoyed it. The movie doesn't follow the story line from the comics at all but it's like book adaptations, it's just impossible to navigate books effectively to movies and you feel you get the same experience. Don't listen to the negative reviews on here, go make your own opinion of this next phase... it's not Shang-Chi but thank God it's not Brie Larson as Captain Marvel either... horrible casting on that one, Disney!","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

Lots of hope, humanity and diversity in the script however despite promising elements it just struggled for connection and impact. For ancient beings they weren't too bright, still however there was a lot to like, I feel a series would have provided the much needed room for its potential.

There's a few things to bear in mind when going to see it.Firstly it runs for 2hrs 37mins, which is long by any standards. This is something many seem shocked by, so prepare yourself. Secondly if you're looking for the classic MCU trope of a barrage of jokes, this isn't for you. Not that there aren't any it's just not constant.That being said this film is a brilliant piece of cinema. It also does something revolutionary within Marvel films which is usually to ruin heartfelt moments (Endgame excluded). Throughout the movie there are points where the characters show pain and sadness that aren't immediately destroyed with a throwaway joke. And there's actually consequences, no resurrections this time. Its a more mature film with some deeper thoughts, if you want them of course they're not necessary. Don't let this put you off there's heaps of action and plenty of funny moments. This film just invites you to think a rarity in most cinema today not just the MCU, which is clearly not for everyone.It is baffling that some have called this unemotional as this film has more heart than we've seen in most of the MCU. With 10 main characters this is by no means easy. But each character builds different connections with one another showing compassion and conflict just like a dysfunctional or just a real family. After this it's a wonder there's any time left for a plot at all. On top of this the cast is brilliantly diverse bringing a huge sense of unity that feels effortless. It must be remembered that on other large cast films like the avengers each character has been set up prior with several films prior. Might it have been more successful as a 10 part series, perhaps, but the immense scale and visual beauty is like nothing else.The graphics and sets are incredible, leaving green screen behind where possible. Chlo√© Zhao and the crew behind the scenes have created a feast for the eyes and it cannot be understated. There are countless wow moments which is hard these days with the mass of visual stimulation out there. And the action similarly doesn't disappoint. Each character has a unique ability with visuals to match which we haven't seen before.Overall this film is bold and not for everyone. At the end of the day it's a comic book movie and like the comics themselves they appeal to different people, which is good. And it's fair enough if it's not for you. What's sad is some of the negativity that comes out. Not every film reaches you sure, but it's not as heartless and boring as people make out. Its can be more meaningful if you want it to be or just a story about a family who've been together a long time. The cast and crew have clearly put alot of love and hope into this film and they should be immensely proud with what they've created. If anything I'm a fan.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

And despite the fact that many people loved the MCU as a couple of buff guys and over-sexualised women, the transition the MCU is going through is inevitable, as a franchise that has supported generations, and quite frankly awesome.Besides from the stunning visuals and deep undertones Chloe Zhao certainly packs in enough fight scenes as possibly needed. Each eternal represents a unique power, connected through their source of cosmic energy. This variability allows for exhilarating fight scenes that are arguably more interesting than a couple of punches, kicks and the stray flying weapon. The love stories are quaint and meaningful, and certainly don't take up too much of the run time.Overall, the new age of maturity and deeper concepts seen in this movie is most definitely something to look forward to in Phase 4!","43 out of 80 found this helpful.

Sadly, the story itself is a terrible, poorly conceived mess hampered considerably by largely dull characters who you just want to slap, particularly Gemma Chan, the ostensible lead and Angelina Jolie, who both seems to regret having signed on. Others do better with a reasonable turn from Richard Madden and even better performances, and crucially much needed fun from Brian Tyree Henry and Harish Patel.The set pieces with expected top notch special effects are goodly on the eye, but this doesn't compensate for a daft story and uninteresting characters.","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

There are many things that were pretty decent for this film, but it all fell apart in the end with yet another disappointing third act. Ironically, this film was also directed by the same person who did arguably the best film of 2020, Nomadland.The first problem with this film was the final battle, which felt more like a small skirmish. The theme of this battle was supposed to be an epic Civil War between the Eternals, but it just turned into yet another anticlimactic Good vs Evil fight. The characters are very interesting, but like the Force Awakens, they just become less interesting since there is nothing to care about.The deviants aren't well executed, either. Their origin is very interesting and it's shown very well, but the way they are executed bothers me. They don't become more than just another CGI villain. They're not even better than most of the villains in the MCU, possibly the worst. The only good thing about them is their visuals, which are similar to the mimics from Edge, but nowhere near their level.In conclusion, Eternals feels like a triumph on the surface. But the deeper you go, the more you realize that the only good thing about this film are it's actors and it's effects. At least they tried.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its not a fantastic epic like Infinity War or Endgame. Its not as fast paced as other MCU movies and there are a lot of talking sections. However, even with all this I left the cinema satisfied with what I saw.I urge anyone who's not seen this movie to hold judgement and make the decision for themselves and not be led by crittic reviews and YouTube videos. There are some ridiculous titles praising the films 'failure' which is sad. Watch Chris Stuckmans review of The Last Duel as he hits the nail on the head in that video.Eternals lays out the foundations to future movies and D+ shows. It introduces new characters that I look forward to seeing more of in the upcoming films and shows.Hold out for the end credit scenes as both are great.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I still went and watched the movie. And I thought this movie was ok. It wasn't awful or terribly negative, etc...etc.. No. This is not true and it's ridiculous. In my opinion, this movie was ok and it had a good start, it's not equal to, or like the other MCU movies. It's pretty different because it's refreshing and its origins are new. People need to understand this. The reason why I say it was ok is because I don't like movies that have stories with flashback scenes. I admit I hate flashback scenes, but it also depends on the story. For example, in the movie Titanic, the movie had flashback scenes there weren't that many. The movie began with an old woman describing her story about her experiences and what happened on the Titanic. Then the flashback scene took us back to when she was young on the Titanic. It's just a one-time flashback and it continued to the end. That's the type of flashback that I like. There are not too many flashbacks, with many characters in the movie, Eternals. It's easy for me to fall asleep and it is boring. But this is just my opinion. Also, the movie is pretty long with a lot of dialogue. The amount of dialogue should be cut. I think this movie was good with the storyline, cinematography, and it had awesome special effects. Also, I really like this movie because it had a lot of diversity. That's basically it, and I give it a 7 out of 10 stars. This movie will return for part 2. I hope it will better than part 1. By the way, don't leave because the movie has two post credits in the end. You will happy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Avengers relied on scores of set-up movies to introduce characters and meandering, lengthy buddy capers for the team-up storylines. By the end(game), they couldn't continue in the same vein any longer. Eternals has a different approach. Slower, more meaningful dialogue and richer world building. It's an enjoyable journey is many ways, bogged down by a constants tension between heavy mythology and comedy one liners, the latter betraying the meddling hands of studio execs and too many script passes. I hope they make another one, in this format there are questions to pursue. A welcome relief from a 9-movie lead up to another over-edited destruction of downtown Manhattan.

The film is directed and part written by Chlo√© Zhao, the director of The Rider and Nomadland.The film is about a group of aliens called Eternals, who have been protecting humanity from evil creatures called Deviants since the beginning. Since the defeat of this evil, the Eternals have remained hidden on Earth without further affecting the lives of humanity, but after an unexpected tragedy, the Eternals must spring back into action to investigate this tragedy. Most are sure that this can only mean that the Deviants return to Earth.With this film, Chlo√© Zhao and fellow screenwriters introduce a new group of creatures to the Marvel film series. Due to the large unfamiliarity of this group and the fact that the co-screenwriters are at the beginning of their careers, this film may seem unclear to people who are otherwise unfamiliar with the Eternals. The reason that they only now appear in the film series also seems a bit forced and the film is also very separate from the rest of the Marvel film series. Only a few characters from the film series are mentioned by name, making this film almost as connected as the Marvel Netflix series.The story can also be tricky to follow, as it often jumps from the present to the past to give some brief explanations about certain things that come up later in the film. Furthermore, the Eternals observe humanity more and sometimes give their assessment. Chlo√© Zhao seems to have done this so that as a viewer you also get a kind of history lesson about the good and bad sides of humanity. In this way the film loses its entertaining side and it almost comes across as a kind of argument. The film also lacks real suspense, as this only comes when suddenly and Deviant shows up to cause some chaos. Marvel producer Kevin Feige may have been a little dazzled with arranging for Chlo√© Zhao as director after she broke into the film world last year after winning two Oscars. Chlo√© Zhao manages to capture a few scenes nicely, but these are the scenes that were filmed on location. Other scenes shot in the film studio seem less believable. The green screen is often clearly visible here, which makes the film lose its credibility. The CGI used for transferring the Deviants or the superpowers of the Eternals is often also clearly visible. These beings and powers do not always come across as credible. This film is the 26th film in the Marvel film series, which makes it special that after so many films, the effects suddenly seem to be less compared to most other films in the series. The film is also not necessary to see in 3D, because there are only a few scenes in which this effect can be seen.Due to the size of the film cast, the acting comes across as nice, but nobody really gets the chance to come across clearly as the main character of the film. All characters with their own powers and difficult names are difficult for the viewer to remember. At the end of the movie you don't know exactly who each character was and what they could do. Most characters are remembered more thanks to the actor who plays the character. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani remain the most remembered for their fame, despite the fact that these big names didn't even get the most time in the film.","95 out of 228 found this helpful.

All those low ratings because it is slow paced, only shows that people who like superhero movies have forgotten how it is at the beginning after watching known characters for so long. They were expeting another Avengers movie. The slower rythm is necessary to let us know the characters/heroes that we are meeting for the first time.Zhao's style is much different than the Russo's brothers, it is somber but still beautiful. The characters are great, it has some humor, like any other Marvel movie.But, I strongly believe that the Eternals movie should have been divided into 2. The first one to introduce the characters and their internal struggles through out time, making us relate more to them and care about their fate. The second one beginning the moment that they separate until today with all the action and etc...

It had the potential to truly break new grounds in comic book storytelling but instead got crushed under the weight of the inter connected nature of MCU. Should have been a dualogy or a Disney+ mini series. Apart from the spectacular visual presentation, this shockingly dull and uninspired tale of immortal beings coming together to save the world is a least interesting version of the Justice League and Avengers movies.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

I haven't read the source material (just got the Neil Gaiman miniseries of Eternals, will get to reading that soon), and haven't seen the director's previous Oscar-Winning film (Nomadland) or any of her previous films.And yet, despite having no expectations for Phase 4, I still think this is the most disappointing film of 2021, even more so than Black Widow.I should mention that this film tries to be different from the other films in the way that it's shot (more practical sets, shooting on location, less green screen) and honestly, it looks beautiful. I honestly want Marvel to keep going down this route.Ramin Djawadi's score is pretty good and unique and it's so nice to see Iron Man's composer reunite with the MCU. I would have preferred Alexandre Desplat but Djawadi score makes for an epic listen.The writing sucks. It's one of the most boring films I've seen; compared to Valerian and Jupiter Ascending, it's not bad but it comes really close. The characters feel one-note, they don't have that much depth to them, and they're not well developed; to the point where I can't remember a single character from this film compared to other perfect MCU Ensemble Films like Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 or Avengers 1. This might be due to the film having too many protagonists in it. You could have cut some of them out of the film and left them for later films and nothing much would have been lost.The acting is the dullest in the entire MCU. All of the actors felt like they brought no personality or chemistry to the table whatsoever and none of their performances felt memorable; it's even worse than Brie Larson in Captain Marvel. I don't know if they were miscast, were give bad direction, were given a terrible script or all of the above but fact still remains that they were completely unnmemmorable and wasted in this film. The only ones that felt like they were at least trying were Barry Keoghan, Bryan Tyree Henry, Kit Harrington (who isn't even in the film that much), Richard Madden, Lauren Ridloff and even Bill Skarsgard (who voices Kro); these actors felt like they had emotions apart from dull surprise.The pacing is also different from the other MCU films as it's much slower and more contemplative. Unfortunately, that also harms the film unintentionally as nothing much happens in both action scenes and quieter moments. Scenes also feel like they're just stitched together with no connection to the next scene tying them together, making for some pretty bad editing.1/10 with one extra star for the visuals. Oh well, next.","25 out of 52 found this helpful.

It wants to be a cool indie film while also maintaining its MCU comedy-blockbuster sensibilities. I will say that this works in many spots throughout the film, but there are also plenty where big philosophical debates detour into typical CGI action with jarring effect.The cast is massive and feels somewhat underutilized. Salma Hayek is very miscast and Angelina Jolie's casting feels wasted as she isn't given much to do. Gemma Chan is fine, but I'm not sure she's blockbuster-leading material. Part of it is her character, which is not super interesting and has things just happen around her. There are simply too many characters and actors for everyone to get their shine. This probably would've worked better as a Disney+ show given the overwhelming amount of new world-building.Another issue is most of the movie is them just getting the band back together. With an already long film, devoting a large chunk of it to reintroducing characters is confounding. The story does have some real intrigue and thoughtful moments though. I found myself fairly engaged throughout, only occasionally looking at the time.Eternals is a big swing from Marvel and while this doesn't have homerun power, they make some decent contact.","13 out of 39 found this helpful.

I won't even be touching on those because there was nothing in it that felt out of place or made the movie not work.What does work is the visuals and the aesthetic. This does not look like a typical Marvel movie and that's all for the better. The fans have been saying that the stand alone films were becoming the same and too formulaic, so here we go. As far as structure goes it does not fit the same 3 act structure that many others follow. The character development is significantly more developed than many other films with far less characters.Overall, it works. There are some nitpicking things like comedic timing not as flush as some other films. And run time but Marvel doesn't treat it's fans like idiots. Sure they could cut the runtime by 10 minutes but none of the ""extra "" stuff felt boring or shoehorned in. And cutting for the sake of cutting isn't necessary this far into the MCU.So, the movie is good. Well shot. Well written. And the story and characters never felt out of place in the current universe. I can see these characters doing a lot more in upcoming projects. And exploring more of them and the possibilities of their powers sounds very good to me.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Imperfect, Solid MCU Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7513420/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","5 November 2021","After over a decade of movies and the beginning of television wiggling its way into this universe as well, The Marvel Cinematic Universe is simply one of the most impressive franchises of all time. That's not to say it's the best franchise of all time, just incredibly ambitious without stumbling very often. Eternals is the first film in a very long time, to be this ambitious in introducing this many characters at once. Yes, this is a downside to the film overall, but I really enjoyed watching it. From the terrific direction to the beautiful look and feel, here's why I think Eternals is worth your time, even if you might be someone who won't like it as much as I did.To put it as simply as possible, there are beings known as Celestials. The Celestials are responsible for the creation of all living things in the Universe. Using these powers thousands of years ago, they created a small race known as Eternals. They were placed in our Universe to oversee human existence and only interfere with any conflicts if creatures known as Deviants ever were to arise. Thousands of years later, in the present day, something has awoken them. Needing to get the band back together, this film is purely about the reassemblance of the Eternals in order to stop this looming threat.That description may seem like it makes for a super exciting time at the movies, but please don't go into the film expecting non-stop action like Avengers: Infinity War. This is a film that takes its time, flashing back and forth, teaching you the backstory of these characters so that you care about the consequences moving forward. Chloe Zhao's direction here is very much her style and it's very apparent that she was given the freedom of bringing her tone to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The strongest point of this film is the fact that everyone is likeable. Everyone is given just enough time to make an impact, even though I think more time with each of these characters would've helped it a lot more.Leading up to The Avengers back in 2012, we had films that developed each of the core characters first. This is a film that was trying to bring a team together with far less time and far more characters to boot. It's nearly three hours long, but there are times when it honestly feels like a couple more hours could've helped it. I'm starting to think this story would've worked much better as a Disney+ series that's still connected to this world, but I understand that the ideas presented here were necessary to be seen by a larger audience. This was a huge problem I had with the film, but that aside, I still really liked it.My issue with the characters would've been a lot greater, however, if it wasn't for all of the performers making me care about them. Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan were probably the biggest standouts to me, all providing a bit more depth than the rest of the cast, but everyone brought their A-Game here and it showed on-screen. On top of the great cast, there are spectacular visuals that are unlike those from other Marvel films. Yes, the CGI creatures and things of that nature are all still present here, but the CGI backgrounds and landscapes all felt very real this time. I really enjoyed the attention to detail when it came to that.In the end, Eternals both feels like a traditional Marvel Cinematic Universe film while also doing things that this franchise hasn't done before. The drab tone, slow pacing, and overall ""Epic"" feel (especially with its runtime) all worked incredibly well for me. I just wish this story had more time to breathe, even with being nearly three hours. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a necessary watch, given the ramifications, this will likely have on the franchise as a whole. As big as this movie feels, I think it only scratched the surface. It's far from perfect, but even with its flaws, this movie really worked for me. Eternals is now playing in theatres and I think it's worth seeing.","23 out of 83 found this helpful.

This is not a typical MCU film. When you're going to watch this film you should know this. When the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie came in 2014 a lot of people skipped that film, called it boring, said skipping this film won't make a difference. There are bunch of new characters that they don't care about and never heard of. That's not a good film. Blah blah. 4 years later ""Avengers Infinity Wars"" came with the prime villain ""Thanos"" who was first explored in details in the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). I know Thanos first appeared in the post credits of og Avengers (2012) and later on Avengers: Age of Ultron (2014). But those films didn't really show him, his purpose and his character truly. After watching infinity war people went back and saw the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" again and they liked it. Because all these years later, they know those characters and they're emotionally connected to them. So they understood its purpose.Well, kinda similar stuff is happening in Eternals. People don't know these characters. This is their first appearance in the MCU. And there are a lot of character development to cover in one film. The story was not bad. Obviously the story is not complete in this film. This movie is there just to introduce you to those characters. This is a huge universe with a lot of characters. So it's essential to let you know about every individual so that whenever they appear in a blockbuster film you don't get to say what the hell? Who's this? How's he doing the stuffs he's doing here.This movie is not supposed to have a avengers level threat. Matter of fact it still had a huge threat that they dealt with which might not be that much important to you for the time being. Because this type of threat was never shown in this way in MCU before.Think of Spider-Man: Homcoming, that film was to introduce you to the MCU Spider-Man. He's a child, he behaves like child even during serious fight. That movie wasn't supposed to have a ""Thanos"" level villain. That was supposed to have a small low profile villain. Which it had. But you liked it. Why? Because you already know Spider-Man for decades now. And Spider-Man in MCU was bigger news than the movie itself. Well, Eternals are new (not really but newly introduced) to this universe.In my opinion the movie was played at just the right speed to make you accustomed to each and every single new characters. And then show you the real purpose of those characters, then go to an ending which is actually a new beginning. May be some years later you'll find a new villain who was first portrayed in this film to become the next big one. Honestly, this film is all about character development. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. They just became part of a universe which is already big enough. They needed an entry point. This film is the entry point. They'll play a bigger role in the next ones. And trust me, that time you will be loving it, 'cause it'll be direct Marvel action and you already knew them. Overall, I really like the film. Is it the best film marvel ever made? No. Is the worst? Absolutely not.If you want to go to the theatre expecting you're gonna see some serious marvel action, you're obviously gonna be disappointed. 'Cause you must know before going that this film is not made for that. It's your introduction to Eternals. The bill comes due.My Rating: (7.5-8)/10Don't listen to critics and the people who's trying to make themselves look good by going with the negative media coverage this film got before release. This is not at all a bad film at all. It's just it's different. It's supposed to be different.If you think character development doesn't worth your time, then don't go for it. I saw 4-5 people sitting beside me who left the theater halfway through the film because it seemed unworthy of their time. And I completely understand that. You can skip as well if it's not your thing.

the judge celestial is acting just like the judge celestial in the comics and with a great prespective great cgi and great voice work he does look very manacing also like a celestial should.I could talk on the good stuff for houres but the movie does have flawsso what was the downside of this ?Well,
1. For me biggest is they intreduce a LOT of new things to the marvel universe.I mean... i dont think they follow the main avengers or relating to the avengers at all in this movie its all completely new stuff
also when u have a world with 5 or 8 even superheroes its great they are important
but once u add to this world
eternals / celestials / divients / avengers / superman ?! I mean wtfb/ maybe in the future xmen
its a bit too much...
too much storylines to follow that dont combine so much with one another.Also i dont understand in loki tv show there is a new villan in the end of it
in wondavision she becomes sort of different in the end.In here you got all the thing with the celestials
i mean...we didnt even got to spiderman and already we have so much new villans and storys
i really hope doctor strange wil fix it in 1 year.Another issue i had with this movie is
yes...where where the celstials when thenos wiped half the world.(if they intreduce superman even as a side joke here...then you could ask where was superman also....it never ends)
but ok they address it in this movie a lot of times.But
Where was the avengers when the s$&@t in this movie went down ?Its like they dont want to see each other or something ..in general i really really liked this movie
it has its flaws some bigger once some dont make sense
but literelt every movie has flaws even 10/10 ones.I loved it a lot and do think it deserve to be watched in cinemas.Im not going to remember it in 1month
but i had an amazing time in the cinemas
and cant wait until i see the rest if their storyline.You should def. Watch it.","23 out of 41 found this helpful.

It has a phenomenal cast, a talented director and excellent source material. Unfortunately, the end result was far from perfection. I don't hate this film. I don't think that it deserves to be the only ""rotten"" film in the MCU (Captain Marvel, Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3 are far worse). That being said, there is way too much going on in way too short of time (and the film was nearly 2 1/2 hours!)My problem, walking away from the film, is that I did not care about any of the characters.It was difficult to connect and relate to these beings who had lived for 7,000 years (at least on earth) and are nearly indestructible. On top of it all, they lacked any real personality. Even Kumail Nanjiani, who I think is hilarious, and Gemma Chan, who I think is brilliant, struggled to bring real emotion to the screen.The ""end of the world"" plot device is tiresome. It was introduced too quickly, resolved too easily and there wasn't any real risk.I am glad that Marvel is taking risks and not just putting out cookie-cutter films. I would like to see these characters pop up in other MCU entries so that they can develop true personalities. However, this is a film that turned convoluted and didn't pay off in my eyes.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was also leery because I was not a fan of Nomadland, and was worried if Chloe Zhao was the right director for this type of movie. That concern also seemed justified as the film (though beautiful) had a number of slow plodding moments, didn't have the greatest acting performances, and got lost in massive exposition dumps that over-explained every single detail of the plot. Perhaps the most frustrating part is that her style of film-making is totally incongruous to the battle sequences that are clearly handled by a different team (and have probably been in development before Zhao was even hired to work on the movie.) This isn't a film vwith a singular vision that has been executed from start to finish, and it just makes me wonder why the decision was made to put a director like Chloe Zhao in the driver's seat based on her past films.Yet, despite the fact that Eternals is easily my least-favorite MCU film to date, I still enjoyed it to some degree. I eventually got invested in the characters, and liked their different arcs throughout the film. What I kept thinking while watching the movie is that even in a lackluster effort, this is still a better Justice League movie than anything DC has managed to make. That comparison isn't just in my mind either, because both Batman and Superman get name-checked in this film, and there are a lot of correlations between the famous members of the Justice League and these Eternals. It's almost like some script-writer was openly thumbing their nose at Zack Snyder and saying ""here's how you really do it."" There were some great moments in the movie, and I liked that they actually took some different paths with this story than you might expect, even addressing a handful of complaints that have been levied against MCU movies in the past. It is still flawed, it is the MCU movie I will rewatch the least, and it is not a direction I want them to pursue in the future. But I wasn't completely mad at Eternals, which is more than I expected when I sat down to watch it.","18 out of 65 found this helpful.

I thought it was an interesting stylistic experiment for the MCU and it actually paid off. The slow pace, heady themes and naturalistic locations all made the film feel more dramatic and heavy rather than cheesy entertainment like the other Marvel films. The scope of the story was very well established with a cosmic historical timeline. Each Eternal had their own unique characterisation and backstory and I definitely felt the family dynamic. Karun was a great addition to keep things light.However, there was too much to cover in one film. While it keeps up a deft juggling act between the past and present, the film somehow felt too long and yet not long enough given the material it had to show. It should have been a miniseries to truly immerse us in the backstories like the romance between Sersi and Ikaris. There were other disappointments as well. The Deviants were a rather forgettable villains and the intelligent one was a wasted opportunity. The backstory of the Deviant's plan doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The combat abilities of the Eternals don't seem very impressive given their cosmic significance.It's not the worst movie in the Marvel catalogue by any means, but it's a long way from the top tier as well.","9 out of 28 found this helpful.

One that has gotten some pretty negative reviews before it came out. I am not a believer in the internet determining my opinion on a film but it definitely can affect my expectations. I knew virtually nothing about Eternals. Not a fan of the comic so this was my first exposure to the story and characters.Eternals is about a group of immortal beings with superhuman powers that have lived on earth among us for thousands of years. Supposedly they are on earth to defend humanity against The Deviants. Their evil counterparts. The film is very much like The Avengers in that it tries to give most of the characters their moments. It is a big cast so I won't go into each characters but there are some standouts. Gemma Chan plays Sersi. Another chatacter that liked was Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. He us an inventor that is supposedly responsible for some inventions that he regrets such as the Atomic Bomb. The other characters are ok but one of the films weaknesses is that like most MCU films is that some characters seem to be in the film for comic relief. In the first hour I was not into the film. I was think that it
may definitely be the worst Marvel film I've seen. It felt slow and even though there was really high stakes in the story it seemed too jokey to take seriously. It even felt like a spoof at times. One other thing s the film goes back and forth in time to tells it's story. Between present day and thousands of years in the past. This style of storytelling works for me at times but here it was distracting. The film is directed by Chlo√© Zhao. A highly celebrated director of last year's Best Picture Nomadland. She has a great visual style and even though the action scenes are well done, they aren't much better than most MCU films. The difference here is that there are some heavier themes she deals with in the film. The problem is that it us so jokey at times that it diminished the more serious themes. This film is being sold as a very different take on a comic book film in the MCU. I do agree that it is a little different it pretty much like most other of the MCU films. It's not different enough but it dies try to distinguish itself at times.I'm glad to say that it wasn't the bomb that some were saying it was but I would say it's hit and miss. But it did grow on me a bit in the end.Grade: C+","14 out of 49 found this helpful.

Then the mighty cast is so perfect to watch that it'll made your day. Then comes the action sequences which is good but it can be better. Bad points starts from it's Storyline, Director should've more focused on the storyline rather than the conversation and emotional connection of the characters. Screenplay is not so good because in the mid of the movie you feel bored with the conversations that the characters having in the movie. The movie is also slow paced which is good for the character building but not good for the mcu movie. Apart from this movie can definitely cut to 10-20 mins because so much conversation and group connection won't be required as much as in the movie. Rest of it all good you can definitely watch one time with it's beautiful vfx, star cast and the action sequences...","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The Marvel franchise is dead in the water, with the new movies having little to offer except the same old origin story formula. Everything else about these films just gets worse. The CGI gets louder and more obnoxious, the writing gets worse, the plot holes get bigger and without Robert Downey Jr or Chris Pratt, there is a major lack of charisma that hasn't been bridged.The marvel movies feel like a TV show past its prime. Everyone knows it has nowhere to go, but they still watch it out of habit.Eternals is possibly the worst of this year's 3 Marvel films, and that's saying something. Primarily because it feels so bloated. Black Widow at least had a semi decent first act.","70 out of 170 found this helpful.

I had not watched Eternals due to the 6.3 rating assuming it must be as bad as Thor: Love and Thunder (same score), which hard for me to take as I felt it was so disrespectful to Thor and Stan Lee's memory.However, I was pleasantly surprised by Eternals! I was not at all bored. The story was great, the characters interesting and the graphics and action really good. I had not heard of The Eternals beforehand so looked up some of the main beings and background from the original 1970s comics. This helped me to understand what was going on too. The plot is typical of the of the Fantastic Four comics I read when I was younger. Cosmic entity / celestial being comes to destroy Earth, heroes try to save the day...not sure what more people are looking for here? I remember the Silver Surfer simply talking Galactus out of devouring Earth... Less exciting than the finish here...but it worked!Anyway, I think it was good and am looking forward to Harry Styles getting involved in the next one...","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Although it is about gods, the theme is human nature, and the most prominent is love. Zhao Ting tried to talk about all the cross-sections of human nature. In addition, there were too many characters. Everyone had to stand up (giving everyone a shining point), and various myths and legends should be involved to push the plot forward (the plot is in the comics). There are enough reversals in the Wei Universe), and pave the way for the future of the Marvel Universe. The amount of information is huge, and Zhao Ting also took pictures of it very beautifully. So it feels to me that the pace is very fast. It seems that I only watched it for 1 and a half hours in 2 and a half hours. And there are laughs and tears. Unfortunately, the space for the director to play is limited. Marvel may not be the best, but it is likely that Zhao Ting is the worst. Thinking of it, a sentence can be used at the end of the plot ""when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind""","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is the 26th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and it is directed by Chlo√© Zhao, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. The film follows a group of immortal aliens who have been living on Earth for thousands of years, hiding their powers and identities. After an unexpected tragedy forces them out of the shadows, they must reunite to face their ancient enemies, the Deviants.I think the film is a visually stunning and ambitious addition to the MCU. I liked how it explored themes such as identity, diversity, love and morality through its ensemble cast. I also appreciated Zhao's direction and cinematography that gave the film a unique and epic feel.

For a start, the film felt way too long, some parts dragged and there was just so much going on. It felt non-stop yet still managed to feel slow in parts. There were also so many plots constantly evolving that it made it difficult to fully appreciate any one given moment.The first half of the film was definitely more enjoyable for me than the latter half, though I do massively respect that they have at least tried to do something different here and not follow the MCU formula that so many follow.Pros:
The Cast were awesome and all round i'd say the acting was pretty good.Plenty of likeable characters.Fight scenes were enjoyable.Some beautiful shots throughout.Cons:
No real solid villain.Pacing was up & down and tbh... kinda off.Kind of killed off some of the more likeable characters?

"7","/10","Underrated MCU film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8940169/?ref_=tt_urv","dakotadickenson-83457","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur161212279/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2023","Eternals is by far one of the more different films of the MCU. The film follows a group of immoral beings known as The Eternals that have been living in the shadows on Earth for centuries whose only known purpose is to battle evil beings known as Deviants. After each of them decide to go separate ways thinking they completed their mission, they're forced to reunite once more to fight against Deviants unlike anything they have ever fought before as well as saving the planet from extinction. As far as the movie itself goes, it was definitely a different take on MCU hero's that are all different in their own ways. The story mostly follows Sersi played by Gemma Chan who also appeared as another character known as Doctor Minerva in Captain Marvel who I found was even better in this film than in Captain Marvel. The character I felt stood out the most was Richard Madden's Ikaris. His character development throughout was on point and is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Angelina Jolie as Thena was another highlight of the film as being one of the strongest and powerful of the Eternals and the way she captures it is astonishing. Barry Keoghan's Druig and Lauren Ridloff's Makkari was definitely the best as far as chemistry between two characters in this film goes and their scenes together were some of my favorite. Salma Hayek's Ajax as the leader of the Eternals was great too. I wished we would of gotten a little more of her character than what we got. The character I felt was most frustrating and annoying throughout was Lia McHugh's Sprite. This film honestly probably would of been perfectly fine without her, but I also see why her character needed to be included in the film and I'm not blaming the actress at all, it's the source material given to her that wasn't always the best and didn't sit right with me. Another thing that I felt wasn't as best as far as source material goes is the relationship between Ikaris and Sersi as I didn't feel what I felt us as audiences is supposed to feel when two characters like that are in love. The film is also dragged out a little longer than it should have been and I felt some scenes weren't really necessary to the movie. The rest of the cast that includes Brian Tyree Henry's Phasto's, Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo, and Ma Dong-seok's Gilgamesh we're also great additions to the cast. Overall, The Eternals was a great addition in my opinion to the MCU that may not be as memorable or perfect, but stands out in a way of its own, while it's introducing us to some of the new hero's of the MCU. Rating 7.5/10.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

NOT a SUPERHERO film, but something on a different plane.Unfortunately, this probably will put off ""Fan-boys"" who want ""more of the same"" (more Avengers, more Thanos, more F/X smashy-smashy, fight-fight) and ETERNALS just isn't intended to be that.Your first clue that this film is trying to be something else is the choice of Director - recent Oscar Winner Chloe Zhao (NOMADLAND), known for her personal stories and interesting visuals. She brings that sensibility to this film and it (mostly), though it is the type of Cinematic style that works best in low-res (like an independent film like Nomadland) rather than large IMAX Comic-book film event films.The movie itself is entertaining...enough. It is, necessarily, slow at the beginning as Zhao needs to set up these characters and the realm that they are playing on (and orient the audience as to how this fits with the AVENGERS:ENDGAME of it all). There are 10 (yes, TEN) Eternals to introduce along with ancillary characters, so the film has to take some time to gather steam.And...it gathers steam, not in the action sequences (which are serviceable) but in the characters and the character interactions and this is where the film really works for me.Gemma Chan (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) and Richard Madden (Rob Stark on GAME OF THRONES) are, basically, the lead characters as their relationship takes center stage for most of the film - and these 2 (especially Chan) holds the screen well, which is tough to do since there are so many characters - and so much other things going on.The real hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, IMHO, is the Casting Director who, time-after-time, plucks relative unknowns and throws them into parts that they are perfectly cast for...Salma Hayak (leader of Eternals, Ajak), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) all fit their parts well, with the relationship between Makkari and Druig being particularly interesting.Speaking of interesting relationships, Ma Dong-seok (so good in the Korean Zombie flick TRAIN TO BUSAN) as Gilgamesh almost steals the screen from MOVIE STAR Angelina Jolie's Thena...almost. Jolie is a MOVIE STAR that just walks onto the screen and commands your attention - and she is perfectly cast as Thena. It is a very smart use of her talents...and her personae as a MOVIE STAR and works very well.Finally, it took awhile for the film to figure out what to do with Kumail Nanjiani's character of Kingo (and Nanjiani's tremendous comedic talents), but, eventually, they do figure it out - but not entirely - which is really the problem with this film. It ALMOST figures out the formula to make this huge, broad, galactic film very personal, but doesn't quite get there.I liked, but didn't LOVE, ETERNALS. I applaud what this film tries to do and I am fine with where it went and was entertained by it. If this is the first part of a journey, then I am anxious to see where ETERNALS goes from here. If this is a ""one-off"" film, then it doesn't, quite, work well enough.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","16 out of 65 found this helpful.

It was equally bizarre to take Kingo, a Japanese character, defined by his samurai armour and fighting style and turn him into an Indian Bollywood actor, I mean come on. Utterly ridiculous.The movie was just slow, with easily an hour that could have been left on the cutting room floor. With a storyline that just didn't really draw the audience in. Everything about the storyline was predictable and well, bland. Can see why this is such a low rated movie and why people aren't bothered about a sequel.Also, just soo many basic mistakes. The Sahara 7,000 years ago was grass covered, with trees and lakes. Why they showed it as a desert was bizarre. Makkari using the wristwatch sign before watches had been invented? How did not one writer say, er that doesn't make sense. And the police sirens making a weird noise?

These people can't think outside the consensus of their 'tribe', and it's mostly sad.If you stumble on this review stranded amongst all the hate filled nonsense, I would suggest you give this movie a chance and approach open minded.The pacing of this film is entirely unique and doesn't rely on MCU's typical boilerplate pattern that has been done to death already. This is a fresh take in the MCU and it isn't even a superhero movie, but an exploration of humanity. It doesn't follow superheroes, and instead focuses on immortal observers as they struggle with their opinions on humanity and their own identities that have been molded by it.Again, not a perfect execution by far, but certainly not a bad movie.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Somehow it so happened that in recent years the introduction of more and more new characters does not lead the Cinematic universe somewhere to new heights. Rather, on the contrary. It is for this reason that I took the first trailer of ""Eternal"" with some skepticism. However, the second video impressed me greatly, and I changed my status in relation to this project to ""expect"". And after watching it, time passed. The picture at first seemed quite beautiful and interesting, but there is no feeling of a pleasant aftertaste, the desire to review the film, as it happens with really memorable films. I conclude for myself that the effect of watching in the cinema has disappeared, which means that the real emotions about the film are actually different than they seemed to me immediately after watching the picture.The creators of the vast Universe once again introduce the audience to a whole new world of heroes, which they are trying to weave into an already existing world. As with previous ""Captain Marvel"" type paintings, the feeling of artificial introduction of these creatures, which for some reason have never really appeared for a couple of dozen projects, does not leave. Of course, the reason for this is explained to us in the film, but it looks somehow unconvincing.The two races are fighting against each other, while not getting involved in the conflicts of the Avengers and the like, thereby giving the opportunity for the development of civilization on their own. It looks a little attractive, especially when ""behind"" such a universal conflict with Thanos, which led to a click that erased half of all living things. Frankly a weak move by the screenwriters.Another problem that has become quite obvious for large-scale projects of the Film Universe is the introduction of a dozen new heroes at once, with whom you will have to get acquainted within the framework of a two-and-a-half-hour project. It is difficult. It is difficult to get into everyone and understand the motivation of a particular hero. What is missing is the meaningful approach that Kevin Feige used to have, when each project introduced us to a small number of characters, and then a joint crossover was made. This plan worked. But obviously the pace of development of the Cinematic universe is increasing, and therefore, within the framework of one project, we are immediately presented with a whole team.We must pay tribute to the creators. Given this situation, the viewer is not lost among the mass of heroes. That's because they have their own unique personalities, charismatic, and a famous cast does its job when you see famous actors on the screen and can remember the characters in their performance simply because you know Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie or the guys from ""Game of Thrones"" Kit Harington and Richard Madden well. Gemma Chan and bright Kumail Nanjiani, Barry Keoghan and Leah McHugh are also remembered in the project.It is impossible not to mention the impressive Celestials, a race of cosmic gods who have already flashed before in the Cinematic Universe and presented themselves as something terrifying. Here you can see what power they have and how they can use the Land for their own purposes.The film is very beautiful. You can't take that away. The visual range is amazing. But as it has been known for a long time - it has not been possible to ""leave"" only at the expense of the picture for a couple of decades. The viewer is used to the maximum possibilities of the beauty of computer graphics and the ability of the directors to make a beautiful frame. Therefore, it is not this that is evaluated in the film as the main thing, but still the story itself, the development of the plot and, of course, the play of the actors.""Eternal"", in my opinion, is a passing project, an attempt by the franchise to try a new approach again, and the seemingly obvious continuation is now in question due to the small success of the picture. And it's sad. Attempts by Kevin Feige and the company to experiment began to throw the general universe from side to side, thereby dispelling the general direction. Even the most ardent fans of the franchise are beginning to get confused in an increasing number of new heroes. Perhaps it's worth going back to the basics. Because the audience is already beginning to feel a sense of nostalgia for the old heroes, say, the original Avengers. And this is a clear signal that something is wrong with modern paintings.7 out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But ETERNALS now claims the 1st position in it. The movie doesn't seem like an MCU movie....and we all are aware that the solo superhero mcu movies are little off and slow in their narration like Captain America, Captain marvel, Thor....so yeah it was a big gamble with this one too because for the the first time mcu has introduced a group of superheros together in a big budgeted movie like ETERNALS. So they have to build up each and every character upto some extent so that the audience can connect with them so that did tale some time and made the movie little slow or ypu can say off otherwise,beautiful direction from Chloe zao.

Its different from others yet feels the same. Though the explanation of why they weren't involved more and helped more is lacking. You get more emotionally invested in the characters than you've been in the past MCU. There's more intimacy than a standard MCU movie which is a lotüòÇ but it's nice to see that the movie doesn't hide it. Much more representation, a LGBTQ character introduced ( I think it's the first in any major superhero universe, correct me if I'm wrong), we also got a character who is specially-abled.I will definitely recommend it to someone who is tired of the usual MCU troupes and want something fresh, and anyone who loves the old formula don't worry you will have more than enough of that too.MCU is turning a new leaf, let's support them and see where it leads us.Thanks for reading.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A lot of the characters were both likable and unlikable. Sprite (or something) stood there with a ""rbf"" the entire film, which sounds rude because the actor's a kid, but like I don't know how else to describe it. Kingo was just so annoying and many of his jokes just didn't hit their mark. I honestly liked his sidekick documentarian so much more. Cersei was just kind of there and didn't really resonate much with me outside of plot convenience.And then there were the more likable characters. Phastos was great and fun, but we didn't get much from him. Same with Ajak, who was really important, emotional, and great, but she wasn't really present in a lot of the film.I found that the more I liked a character, the less screen time they had.Now to get to the better parts. The cinematography, as said earlier, and the second two acts really immersed me into the story. The fight scenes started off okay, but really picked up pacing, and drove some emotional impact forward during each sequence. It was really great. Not to mention also the amazing visuals of the celestials. Wow, they made me feel so small and weak, and made such a powerful presence on screen. And Ikaris, such a cool and understandable character.I felt like I couldn't choose a side in setting up the finale because both sides felt reasonable to an extent. And the deviants always looked pretty cool and had an interesting build up to a very intense finale.Again, a very mixed film, with some of the best and worst from Marvel. I think I'm giving it a 4/5 because I know that the future can have some potentially amazing storytelling thanks to Chloe Zhao. And also the positives absolutely annihilated the negative aspects of this film. Definitely do recommend it, but please keep an open mind.Long story short, this feels like Marvel's ""The Last Jedi"" and I'm here for it. Gonna divide a lot of people, but stands fairly well on its own.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

My only feedback is that I wanted more and the development was too quick at times as there felt to be so much more to know in around half of the cast.I think if this film didn't have the typical expectations from marvel abs the trailers showed that this was more abstract (think like the joker movie and how he fits into DC) it would've been better understood.All round totally worth the cinema experience, great cast and a tase of the world Zhao envisioned.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

The clues each movie leaves behind after the credits end, it's sort of like the calm before the 2nd big storm and General Feige is brewing something massive again like he did in Endgame.Honestly, I can't wait to see what the next chapter of phase 4 will be about.

Everything in this film is well crafted, with great sensibility and dedication from Oscar winner director Chlo√© Zhao. All the characters, from Kingo's human butler to the celestial overlord Arishem, are magnificently and deeply developed, and we can clearly understand the pains of these people. And of course, how can we not talk about the cinematography and visuals of this film? Zhao didn't mess around here, she brought the most stunningly beautiful film in the entire MCU. I would like to point out how the inclusion in this film is the most truthful and well-executed of the genre. All in all, even with the few flaws in the film, Chlo√© Zhao has brought the most heartwarming, honest, different and greatest film from the studio. Honestly, this is what I would like to keep watching in the MCU, more intense and insightful films with different viewpoints. There is a certain strangeness to it but a necessary change. It's time to embrace the new in this universe. Eternals is clearly the turning point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and we are definitely moving towards a more diverse, different, and certainly very wonderful MCU.","39 out of 76 found this helpful.

How do you not interfere when half the galaxy is wiped out. Same with Captain Marvel, who doesn't appear to help the avengers until the last movie, seriously Nick Fury didn't think it was important to call her when the sky's opened up and Loki tried to take it over or Ultron is about to district the earth by dropping Sacovia from the sky.

Both are technically well-crafted and beautiful films done on an epic scale featuring diversely interesting casts. Both cover vast amounts of space and time in attempts at worldbuilding for future sequels. And both share an emptiness on the page that keeps them from surviving anywhere past their runtimes. It's a shame that prestigious filmmakers like Chlo√© Zhao and Denis Villeneuve chose to make their least interesting films at the same time.But before I reveal my hand too early, let's back things up to the beginning of time, literally. ""In the beginning...,"" reads the opening crawl, a Celestial by the name of Arishem created the universe and all living things that inhabit it. Like the story in the Bible, this god was not perfect, as he created a monstrous race known as the ""Deviants"" that threatened the natural order of life. To right his wrong, Arishem created the ""Eternals"" to wipe out the Deviants and bring peace. For 7,000 years the Eternals have been Earth's watchful protectors, subtly guiding humanity to what it is today.But Arishem's imperfection begins to sow seeds of doubt within the Eternals. That doubt leads them to discover the real reason they have been dispatched to this planet, which is to prepare it for the ""emergence"" that would bring about the end of humanity. Do the Eternals go against their maker by preventing his grand plan, or do they sacrifice billions for the idea of the greater good?Just on paper, ""Eternals"" is Marvel's biggest feature to date in terms of scope and possibility. About a dozen new characters are introduced, all with unique powers. There's one with super speed, one that can control minds, and another that flies around and shoots laser beams out of his eyes like Superman (a reference made more times than you would think within the film).Marvel has always had a gift when it comes to casting their famed superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. Being cast as Iron Man was seen as an unnecessary gamble, and more eyebrows were raised when unknowns Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were cast as Thor and Loki, respectively. Just two months ago, Simu Liu proved all the doubters wrong with his terrific turn as Shang-Chi.But while all those risks have paid off, this large bet doesn't bring back the expected return on investment. A few names, like Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and Angelina Jolie are either miscast or not good enough for their roles. And for those that are good, such as Gemma Chan as Sersi and Richard Madden as Ikaris, their characters are too flat to inspire anything memorable about them except their names and what powers they have.But there are a few wins within this cast that should be championed, such as the first hearing-impaired superhero in Makkari, and the first openly gay couple in Phastos and Ben. There's also the first Marvel sex scene, lasting all of eight seconds. While celebration should be in order, these inclusionary acts are still baby steps for the Mouse House, who have always embodied the urban dictionary term of ""passive progressive.""""Eternals"" is also the most interesting Marvel movie on a purely technical level. That's not to say it's the best, but that it's different in a refreshing way. Zhao, newly armed with Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, makes the most radical departure from the plastic formula that has engulfed this franchise for the better part of its life. Along with DP Ben Davis (who also shot the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" as well as ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Captain Marvel"") Zhao leans for a desaturated, naturalistic look, similar to that of her previous features. The plains of South Dakota and the jungles of the Amazon are filled with beauty as she always seems to find and harness the magic hourBut those moments of visual originality are brief and sporadic. Once the special effects and action set pieces inevitably barge their back way in, it's back to business as usual.This bait-and-switch act begs the question: If even the most independent-minded filmmaker like Zhao can't break free from the corporate chains, who can? It's a question that I don't want to think about, as the answer is the one I fear the most: nobody can. That gloominess I feel may not be shared by those that have stayed loyal to this rewarding franchise. For those that came into this clinging on to the last bits of hope that someone could shake things up, this movie may very well be the death knell to that. But at the end of the day, did I truly expect anything different in Marvel's 26th entry?","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

The fact this SUPERHERO MOVIE is getting bashed like it was supposed to be the next Scorsese is a testament both to the Marvel Hype Engine (please leave my Instagram alone Marvel. I get it. Your movie's out.) and to the actual greatness of this movie.Having to give critique I'd say maybe chill out with all the posing; standing like that in real life all the time would certainly lead to chronic back trouble, even eternally-speaking. And I wanna say it was rushed but that can't be in a movie so long...But I mean c'mon people. This movie was huge and it was small. Poignant and refreshing. I've never seen Zhao's other work but this is very obviously DIFFERENT in the way that James Gunn's Guardians were/are DIFFERENT. Something in the way. The tapestry of it. The tactility of the movie, if you feel me. And yes, It told an amazing story but just as importantly for the MCU, it'll be a basis for all the future stories.I hope all y'all's BS'n don't ruin Chloe's chances at a comeback: I for one, am STOKED for the next Eternals and THE BLACK KNIGHT.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie has an interesting storyline, but it doesn't really deliver it very well. I feel like it was a little stale at times, but also left so many unanswered questions. I feel like the end would have had catastrophic consequences, but everyone is walking around normally like nothing at all happened. Unless it somehow ties into Spider-Man: No Way Home at that same moment (but I don't think it can , given what we see on the news at the end), it just doesn't make sense.I did like that each member of the team offered something different. I could say more, but I feel like the more I think about it and come up with more confused questions, the less I would rate this movie. I will just leave it at that. It just doesn't REALLY fit, and I hope Eternals 2 will at least show how they fit into the Marvel universe.Good god, please do not start adding sex scenes to Marvel movies. It adds absolutely nothing and, honestly, left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. Are people so dense that they cannot stop thinking about sex for one moment in every aspect of their life that they just need it be absolutely everywhere? I am not that person. While I do want my superheroes to grow and feel, it's easy to see people fall in love without the added awkward sex scene. Just...no.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, the depth of emotion helps to balance out the jagged storytelling in this new tangent in the MCU narrative. The focus on character, group relationships, and emotional complexity brings the film to life.They are Earth's protectors from a distant planet who have lived among humanity for millennia. They do, however, make repeated references to Thanos's destruction of half of all life in the universe.The Eternals are everlasting beings from Olympia. The Celestials sent them to Earth to protect humanity against marauding alien predators. The opening crawl of the film traces them all the way back to the beginning of time. There are hints as to how existing plotlines may progress.Sersi, an ancient antiquities specialist at London's Natural History Museum, is played by Gemma Chan. Richard Madden plays Ikaris, a fighter with the ability to fly and eyes that fire destroyer beams. Salma Hayek plays Ajak, a spiritual guide who can create a golden sphere through which she can interact directly with their Celestial creator, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye). The script, written by Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, merely uses the comic as a starting point.Kumail Nanjiani plays Kingo, a man who can shape firebombs with his own hands and throw them in battle. There's much to keep you interested in the Eternals' blend of companionship, conflict, and rivalry. The straightforward depiction of a loving LGBT family marks a watershed moment for Marvel. Jolie plays Thena, a warrior with the ability to create and transform filigreed golden swords and spears at will. Ikaris, Sersi, and Sprite, who stand in for Peter, Wendy, and Tinkerbell, have an important relationship. The film benefits greatly in terms of texture from the diverse location work.The images have an enormous sweep and depict the Eternals as inhabitants of a familiar world. The action is often performed against physically imposing backdrops, with little reliance on greenscreen trickery. There's no getting around the traditional flaws of a long run length or a dense oversupply of plot. At the very least, the film ranks among the most interesting and creative chapters in the MCU canon.","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

By the 1970s Kirby wanted total control as writer, artist and editor for his newest ideas. Without oversight, Kirby weakness as a writer was his Achilles heel. His The Eternals, deriving ideas from Chariots of the Gods and 2001:A Space Odyssey, created a pantheon of Super-gods (Celestials) and the super-human Eternals and Deviants. The story didn't make much sense then, and it still doesn't even now.The film does little to sort out the nonsense.

Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, Richard Madden looks very similar to Sebastian Stan/Bucky, and they could've easily casted someone else to play his role.The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore.","9 out of 39 found this helpful.

Remove the characters and add an epic soundtrack (also lacking) and just show scenery there might be something there.","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

Well, dialogues don't live up to the movie for sure, on the other hand, the whole concept (and the undeniable borrowing from the DC Universe) works just as the actors.Even Angeline Jolie turned to be a good choice and Salma Hayek luckily wasn't too much. True, the lesser known actors are carrying the show instead of the leads but that's totally ok and enjoyable.The Eternals has 4 major parts and the pacing makes the long running time easy to watch.It is definitely not the common ""Marvel movie"" - that formula was exhausted long ago. If one pays attention everything makes sense - sometimes good to think of a story and put the puzzle together; being said it's not a mindless action orgy, although the action segments are well crafted.The soundtrack is a good addition, not taking the attention away from what is important.If not a few scenes, this could have been a great standalone sci-fi/fantasy/tale, too.Have an open-mind and just enjoy something new, fresh and good.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

It doesn't particularly feel like an MCU movie, which is a good thing. It has its own distinct flare while managing to stay away from the cookie-cutter movies that they've cranked out for so long. For this, the film deserves credit. It tries to be something more introspective, something that tries to be something more than a regular superhero movie, to varying degrees of success.The idea of superheroes questioning their purpose here has been done before, but it was done well here. Them being torn between loyalty to Arishem and their love for Earth is nothing new, but it resulted in the movie lacking a proper villain, which was welcome in a franchise where not only are villains hit or miss, but where the ideas of heroism and villainy are very black and white. Even in Civil War, Zemo was still there as an unquestionable villain. Here, there is a case to be made for anyone to be right. The scenes with Druig trying to take control were interesting conceptually, another idea of duty as opposed to personal belief. The general introspective nature of the film isn't perfect, but it's good for what it is. It has pacing issues, that's for certain. It is very exposition-heavy, but it immerses the audience in its world to the point where it's not too bad. The film's score was epic, by Ramin Djwadi, adding to the dozens of Game of Thrones connections this movie has.The characters feel like cheap dollar store versions of more popular characters. Sersi was dollar store Wonder Woman, Ikarus is dollar store Superman, Phastos is dollar store Cyborg (or his dad, more accurately), Sprite is dollar store Loki (although she reminds me more of Morgana from Persona 5), Makkari is dollar store Flash/Quicksilver, and others were just kind of bland. You could write Gilgamesh and Makkari out of this movie and it would be the same. Klingo was a good comic relief, although there are some cringey moments. It's still Marvel humor, but it's on the better end of Marvel humor. Thena... I don't know what to make of. Conceptually interesting, but I'm not sure about Angelina Jolie being cast as her.The direction of Chloe Zhao was something that drew a lot of attention. As the reigning Best Director winner, there's quite a bit of pressure. She was a good choice for direction. Its quiet moments, the very thing Zhao specializes in yet the antithesis of what Marvel stands for, were mostly handled well, and they didn't detract from its action sequences. And with this, she has established herself as someone who can be both director as artist (Nomadland), and director as entertainer (Eternals). Some of the shots, both CGI and not, in the movie were incredible, something that Zhao specializes in. Babylon was gorgeous. The scenes of nature are too. Arishem was fascinating to look at.I want to love this movie. As it stands, I can't. This would've been far better off as a TV show. That way, it would have more time to expand on the things it couldn't fit into its runtime and strengthening the bonds between the characters and the characters themselves. If it keeps its interesting concepts, incredible visuals, introspective, nature, and epic score, it would possibly be the best of the Marvel shows. Unfortunately though, this is what we got, for better or for worse. It's not the worst MCU movie. It's better than Dark World, Captain Marvel, heck even Black Widow.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

It doesn't rush this (which is good) but after the initial action sequence it is a bit flat.There is humour, though it is fitful and feels a little forced at times. The actors are all good, but some of the dialogue feels a little stilted and the love affair between Richard Madden's Ikaris and Gemma Chan's Sersi lacks sparkle. Her scenes with Kit Harrington have much more chemistry.The film is beautifully shot.Set design and aesthetics were excellent, with a stunning set piece outside the Ishtar gate in Babylon. (Btw go see that if you are ever in Berlin .it's in the same museum as the Pergamon).The second half ramps the stakes up properly and has more action, drama and threat as well as a satisfying denouement .I went in half expecting a mess like a DC Justice League but this is a better movie than that.The main weakness of the film is that it inhabits the MCU. There are only a couple of references to Thanos and the snap but they beg more questions than they answer.Unsurprisingly there will be a sequel and I'd go see that too.Btw there are two end credit scenes . Both worth waiting for .Overall though itcs not bad. I'd give it a 7/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

So many comments here are about wooden or lifeless performances. They were expecting another colorful, eccentric ensemble like the Avengers.Either these viewers lacked an open mind /fresh palate, or the movie didn't do well enough to communicate and reinforce the nature of the Eternals.I never read the comics, but from what I understood, Eternals preceded humans and were almost akin to deities. I felt it very fitting that most acted in a somber matter, as if above human trifles. (Kumail's Eternal was sufficient to provide some comic relief.)
I also loved their exploration into the value of human life itself. Nothing super profound, but still a decent dose of philosophy & ethics.Though both are somewhat about MCU deities, this is nothing like the Thor series. It's good to have some differentiation, and the occasional slow-burn is quite welcome in my opinion. I don't need humor around every corner to keep my attention, as much as I loved Ragnarok.Visuals and action sequences are more than adequate. Scenes involving Makkari and Thena were all satisfying and impactful.My advice to anyone reading this before watching the movie, is to just forget the Avengers for a second, and remember that the characters on screen aren't playing humans or super heroes. They are playing deities that have lived forever and seen the entire human history. It's in the darn title, ""Eternals.""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But is there the fa? The film splits in two. The first hour a bit slow, but this is not a problem, the first act sins in presenting the characters by characterizing them well and only 3/4 of them. The action scenes are thrown at random to make the film more compelling. The first part is rejected, then the plot changes direction and becomes much more exciting showing twists and spectacular fights. The most characterized characters always remain the same. With some practically useless Eternals that only serve to make a scene. The soundtrack is quite passive. The special effects in some situations are beautiful, in others they are messy. The direction is good but it does not emerge so much. Overall it's a mid-chart movie of all Marvel movies but it tries to differentiate itself from its old siblings.No, It's not a movie winning Oscar.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Frankly, the trailers were abysmal. The feature was anything but in my opinion. I was surprised in the best way. Introducing that many new characters at the same time in one movie is obviously a challenge, but I feel they managed to pull it off quite well.The film cast well known stars like Hayek and Jolie, but doesn't rely on them to carry the movie. It does however use flashbacks as an anchor and progression point to push the scenes forward, and at times add a twist or two. But it wouldn't be a Marvel film without some lightheartedness in it, using Kumail Nanjiani for some of the comic relief, which he naturally exhumes.The visuals are absolutely stunning, from the vast landscapes, space, the powers and monsters. The antagonist(s) were one of the vague areas the trailers did not want to advertise, to which I don't truly understand why, but letting that go and watching the movie has me wanting more.Two post credit scenes, both of which have a reveal, followed by a tease, because of course. They aren't bad, but the second shows less than I'd have liked. But that could just be me.The characters are full, they are fun, and they are unique in who they are in this Marvel universe. I come out of the theater excited to see what comes next.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

I appreciate the attempt at being a slower, more melodramatic compared to the other MCU films. Lots of time characters are just sitting or standing around and talking and lots of it. The only thing that kept me from getting really bored was the occasional fight sequences they'd throw in. I'm not saying I need all action and no substance, but the dialog between the characters was uninteresting, and nothing was really grabbing me emotionally. That brings me to my next issue, I personally know nothing about the Eternals, I went into this film completely blind hoping that maybe the film can help introduce these new characters to me. Unfortunately, that also failed in my eyes. I left the movie knowing only what each character's abilities are, and a few of their names. I was driving home from the theater and I couldn't remember all of their names. That's how forgettable the characters and character development was for me. Also, there was no need for this film to be almost three hours long. Why does every Marvel film have to be near three hours long, some actually reach three hours, but that was the Avengers film which I can understand because they have to cram so much story, characters, and information in such a short period of time, however the Russo brothers did a much better job at delivering and executing those things. Chloe Zhao has shown she is a very gifted filmmaker with Nomadland, but apparently she had plenty of creative control, so I have to criticize Zhao for the overall execution of the character development, and too much exposition. However, I do really appreciate the execution of the action and fighting sequences especially having to do with the Deviants. There was one in particular towards the middle of the film that I was having a good time with. Some of the background shots are absolutely breathtaking, and the cinematography was beautiful as well. These things are so strongly executed that they almost outweigh the negatives I mentioned earlier. But as it stands, it is a mediocre film with bad character development, uninteresting interaction between characters, too much exposition, and too long of a running time; but also has exceptional fight sequences, breathtaking backgrounds, beautiful cinematography, and the score are all that make this film what it is. Therefore I reward it with a solid 7.2/10.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

The premise of the film documents the story of thousand year old powered individuals and their fight against their sworn enemies The Deviants.Main Character
Gemma Chan plays Sersi and she is the main character here and she is fine. Chan does an effective job in the role and she is just a decent character. She is by no means the best Marvel lead protagonist but considering this is a real ensemble cast she fits in very effectively. Richard Madden plays Ikaris and I thought he was great, it took me time to get on board with his character but he really starts to thrive as the film progresses and you learn more about him and his motivations makes him stand out from the rest of The Eternals.Supporting Characters
Angelina Jolie plays Thena and I thought she was effective here. She is basically the films Wonder Woman and thus has some good action scenes but she has an interesting character that is somewhat developed and obviously Jolie can pull this off well. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are more of the comic relief and they are really good at it and they are just fun additions to the cast. Lauren Ridloff is really good too and she is really important as the first deaf actress to play a superhero and it feels like an important moment here. Barry Keoghan as Druig is a really effective character, he plays it really well and I really liked the twists and turns that were given to his character. Salma Hayek & Kit Harrington are also good in their smaller roles here and I kind of wish we could have spent more time with Harrington in particular.Story
The individual stories for each member of The Eternals are well done, Ikaris, Thena and Druig in particular have really good arcs and make them interesting characters. The whole romance dynamic between Ikaris and Sersi is also really well done too and made it a romance that I actually cared about in The MCU. It has nuance in its storytelling and the motivations of different groups and people is well handled and made me care. But this film has a few too many characters in it and it does slow down the story telling, I also thought the whole ending sequence was a bit lacklustre and fails to deliver completely on the epic levels it should have.Script
The script has some chuckle worthy moments and some complexity too it when it comes to a few of its characters. But it falls short of doing enough to really make you care about the overall situation, it seems so large scale but at times the dialogue is rigid and it digs its heels in, especially in the past scenes.Style
The film looks brilliant. The CGI is breathtaking and the action scenes are fantastically made and flow incredibly well. The film is 2 and a half hours and it didn't feel too long for me and it felt like an appropriate length. But the pacing of the film gets let down due to its editing of the plot, it jumps all over time periods and it feels very choppy which did make the film feel disjointed with its feeling.Overall
Overall, Eternals is a good film. It has a hard job of introducing so many new characters and story elements to an established universe, it has issues but overall I saw this as a pretty positive experience.Overall - 7/10.","9 out of 45 found this helpful.

However the wokeness in this movie never feels forced and it's even logical once you've seen the movie. So please do not skip on this flick because of that.What we get is a visually stunning movie with great locations and amazing CGI (like most of the Marvel films). The actors all have proven themselves in various other projects but the dialogue could have been better sometimes. The actors are limited by the writing and it shows.I didn't find it confusing, it's all explained nicely but you have to connect the dots yourself. Personally I prefer this over being treated like a toddler. Yes you have to process a lot sometimes in a long movie but it's better than half a movie and a two year wait. I actually want to watch it again because of this.What really got me excited was the original plot, it's not all black or white. The ""good"" guys have a dark side and the ""bad"" guys have a motivation you can understand.This is still a popcorn movie but maybe one of the most grown up Marvel movies this far. We still get the usual humor and action but this is an origin movie that introduces us to the new group in our beloved universe, so don't expect an epic ending but a quality set up for the next phase.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

I loved the extensive use of on-location shoots and the very well-done VFX that blended with their natural surroundings.

The films story, plot, characters, and performances are all phenomenal the only issue with it is there's too much, and it's our first time with any of these people. For a film like ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" which also contains a lot but we've seen them before and the stakes are quite low it's an easier ride. With this film, it's the first time many of these actors, characters, writers, and filmmakers have entered the MCU and while it's without a doubt thrilling and fun, the movie feels it's length and can leave some unfamiliar with the Eternals feeling bored (however I was ecstatic.) I'm excited to see where these characters go in the future and I hope Chloe Zhao is invited back to the table to tell another chapter, as I feel she has some ownership over these characters much like James Gunn to the Guardians. I almost wish the film were told in two parts as it is very similar to Dune in some ways, but take what we can get. Is this the worst of the MCU not by a long shot and it's crazy to see the Rotten score after viewing it, but I can't say I don't understand where some are coming from. If you're a fan of Marvel and are ready for some new characters, Shang-Chi might have been more your speed, but Eternals satisfies in ways that are very beautiful and deserve to be seen.","6 out of 27 found this helpful.

""Nothing. Just the Screams of My Deep Disappointment""Chlo√© Zhao's Eternals is indisputably ambitious, definitely had lots of potentials, and it may as well be regarded as the new stepping stone for the Comic-book features, still, the true spirit of Marvel's conclusive identity is sorely neglected here. MCU has been around for roughly two decades now, they have gone through some rigorous undertakings in the past, had to put up with lots of risks. Yet for me, they never renounced their charisma or their distinctive presence.Eternals might be the first time I beg to differ!Now, being unique isn't necessarily a bad thing. Especially, if you have a set purpose and a strong-willed attitude, nothing would stop you from being yourself. However, Eternals doesn't seem to have any of those qualities. When you think about the events that have unfolded up to the present time, their very existence poses some serious questions and doubts.Just think about it, In a normal scenario, with such incredible powers, and an unprecedented authority over the universe, this stature alone should grant them the title of invincibles and would set them (Eternals) apart from everyone else, right? But that didn't happen? Did it? Guess why?It's simple, they never earned the right to their titles. At least, not in this MCU's timeline. (Hardcore Comic-book fans may differ). It appears as if their powers have been rather gifted than rightfully obtained. Unlike the Avengers or any of the prominent figures who have been a part of this cinematic universe; we didn't see the ups and downs of their lives, we haven't had the privilege to be a part of their uprising. Thus, these powerful beings fail to bring out any sort of feelings in us. I believe, relevancy is crucial when it comes to Superhero fantasy tales.People love Superheroes not just because of their magical powers, it's also because of what they symbolize, because of who they truly are from the inside. Eternals did have an intriguing set of Characters, with all kinds of stupendous abilities one could dream of; however, it's the humane touch that they are heavily deprived of.Although, I must show some acknowledgement towards its outer appearance. Congrats to Miss Zhao, she has managed to put together one of the most beautiful looking Marvel films to date. Even more so applaudable when you consider the fact that this is her first time taking on a big project and that too of such a staggering scale. The incredible score and the gigantic sets have only elevated her excellence. Had the Writing been bounteous, things would have been much different.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Because of these and several other factors such as the film's editing, ""Eternals"" ends up in fact out of line with all the MCU films and takes it to a new era, with more seriousness, drama, unforced representation and less humor, in addition to working very well what it proposes, which is expansion and detailing of the Cosmic side of Marvel universe.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

I know it's difficult to introduce many characters at once, but I don't think this is the best.Unlike existing Marvel movies, it seems to be compared to DC movies due to the directing style of characters and directors with ""supernatural"" abilities, but it does not seem to be as contemplative as DC.The depth of the characters' agony, trauma, and philosophical questions feels shallow and does not convey smoothly.In addition, the limits of the characteristics and abilities of the characters are not properly set, so I can't attach my mind to any character.Also, except for Angelina Jolie, most of them are not famous actors, and I think Angelina Jolie should be at the center.However, that part was not seen in Jolie's role.It's not a matter of Jolie's acting, but it's not easy to balance because it's made of characters that are mentally distracting in the first place, and in addition, it seems that the director has never made such various characters' chemistry before.The chemistry with the character Ma Dong-seok is also quite unfortunate.The relationship between the two seems very important, but I was surprised that they were treated too shallowly.I think I can make more use of the humor in the middle, but it was a pity that I couldn't.It seems to be divided into an audience who is quite disappointed in the movie and an introduction to a new Marvel Hero movie, but I'm close to the former.It's not just because it's different from the fun existing Marvel movies, but the movie itself felt clumsy.Perhaps the director's ability was inappropriate to deal with narratives and movies of this scale. If the movie had not been labeled Marvel, it would have been criticized more.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The heroes are no longer humans or demigods, they are now gods whose missions are from a higher plane than the human one.It is a film that seeks to explain and introduce a whole new universe while telling a story, which results in the film at times overwhelming the viewer with a huge amount of background information in a very short time as you try to understand the main story.Still, it's one of the best Marvel films of recent times, especially thanks to the cast and direction, and shows that Marvel knows how to make more serious films that work very well as superhero movies. Finally, the pacing at times is not smooth and it gets bogged down in a succession of facts that are only mentioned afterwards and it is assumed that the characters already know them.PS- the best scenes of a superhero in super speed that have ever been made, they give a real sense of speed.PS2- Criticism of the ""political agenda"" and other nonsense is ridiculous and unfounded.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie doesn't feel like an MCU movie and to me that is very refreshing. Takes on more of a serious tone without a cheesy joke to remind you it's an MCU film. The action sequences I thought were well done with the type of enemies they were fighting. Good cast and even scenes with good acting that felt like realistic raw emotion. I think this film gets dislikes because certain things are shown and some people probably aren't that open minded or prepared for it. It's 2021 grow up. For the length of the film I think they crammed in as much as they could but I wouldn't have minded maybe another half hour since we were just introduced to these characters. That might be the biggest gripe on the film but then again once you watch it you'll realize it's not really necessary either. Go watch it and gather your own opinion.

Other than that, there are some major flaws. I think that Bill Skarsgard is brilliant at playing villains (as we saw in IT) and seeing him play such an under-developed and plane character in this movie disappointed me. I don't think that I am the only person who thinks he should be re-cast.

Chloe Zhao in my opinion is worthy to continue this series and has truly shined once again with such a heavy task on her Director plate. The Eternals themselves are layered and have their own desires and needs themselves and you will appreciate them all in their own way and feel you've taken a journey with them, the audience I was with seemed to enjoy every bit of it. The dialogue around this movie has been vile, especially by certain YouTube channels I will not mention but rest assured, the diversity here is not in your face and no is here for ""representation"" sake.

Storytelling and worldbuilding were awesome. Paired with never seen before visuals for both quiet scenes and action scenes. You can indeed argue that some dialogue were repeating and not truly necessary, but for the main characters, Ikaris and Scersi, the deepdive into their world via dialogue is inevitable. It is a lengthy movie we're casuals got a lot to unpack. In fact, you encounter 8 characters plus a minor love interest plus several historical scenes, which needs to digest at first, but it is in my opinion very well done and presented.

It did open up the MCU even more with some impressive characters and and how they come to be and also opening up new potential movie ideas. But I don't want to give to much away.The only reason why I give ""Eternals"" a 6.5/10 and not a lower one was because of how it opened up the MCU, so that you have a good idea of what's to come in future films. If it wasn't for that, I would've given it a 5/10. I'm quite disappointed with the story and action, and that's why. I think Marvel Studios was trying something and unfortunately it just didn't work.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Almost everything about this is trash; the script is trash, the story is trash, the cinematography is typically boring Marvel trash, and holy crap Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. These two CAN NOT ACT for the LIFE of them in this movie.But first, the positive.I did like Kumail Nanjiani. He and Harish Patel do deliver some funny one liners throughout the film so I commemorate them for bringing some humour to the film. I liked Lia Mchugh and Bryan Tyree Henry too - both acted pretty well and I think Marvel did it good by introducing a gay couple without making a massive fuss over it.And lastly, the action choreography was pretty good.Anyway, Gemma Chang and Madden 2k21 CAN NOT act FOR THE LIFE OF THEM. While I can't speak for their vocal delivery since I watched this in the spanish dub (which is always awful, by the way) they dont have any variation in facial expression like whatsoever. THEIR FACES BARELY CHANGE FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE. The only thing Gemma Chan can do somewhat decently is cry on command. That is literally it.Barry Keoghan had a really poor performance in this film, but I really think that's down to the script more than anything else; I know this guy can act from his performance in Dunkirk for example but here watching him act was just a giant wtf happened moment.Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie had really boring performances - and about Angelina Jolie, i literally thought she was meant to be crippled or something because during the scene where they were all eating right after she rembered (üòá) she did not say a single fucking line and all she did was laugh at a few things. The way the shots were edited in that scene simply told me she was not quite there mentally - then in the next few scenes she starts talking normally like she didn't just sit there and laugh at random things a scene before? Like bruh.Ma Dong-Seok, another actor I KNOW is good, also delivers a subpar performance here. Lauren Ridloff, while she has facial expressions, they're a little over the top sometimes and mad forced. Also, her and Barry's character's romance was so sudden and forced it just made me think the scriptwriter just wanted to have as many characters paired up as possible.Now then, the CG. The babylon fight scene while well done (action wise) it also looked straight out of a video game. The camera movements were too quick and too smooth at the same time and the wendigo-looking Deviants looked fake as fuck. Plus, the colour saturation for the Babylonian walls was way too pronounced, just brough the whole scene down even further. Another iffy CG thing was the troll thing during the post credits scene where Starfox is introduced. It also looked fake as fuck.Otherwise the CGI was the boring standard you expect from Marvel.Overall, this movie was one of the worst of the year (nothing will beat 'Karen') and Marvel's worst movie yet. From the very beginning, when they had TEXT scrolling along explaining the lore Star Wars-style, I was already thinking ""man, fat L to that opening."" (Not to mention the fat L the movie took after the first fight scene was over and they were all 'bonding' with the mesopotamians, that's what told me Gemma Chang can not act). I'll rewatch this later but in English so I can see how their vocal delivery is as I cannot gauge how it is from the ever shitty Spanish dub.2/10.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

The visuals and cinematography is breathtaking to watch, the action is pretty good, a lot of interesting lore and history dealing with the celestials and the universe in general, some great end credits scenes, good direction from Chloe zhao, and fantastic scenes of characters interacting either for comedy or drama (my favorite scene involves druig not being able to save people from genocide). However, it is not a perfect film. While all the actors do their best and all give great performances (standouts are kumail nanjiani, don lee, Brian tyree Henry, and Angelina Jolie for me) the characters are not given much development and as a result I care less for (there were some I did care for but not many), the villains suck, some actors are wasted (selma Hayek and bill skarsgard especially), so many emotional moments (except one with don and Angelina) I felt nothing for, tries to do way too much in one movie, and while some of the twists sound cool on paper in execution the motivations to why they happen are not developed well so they don't have the impact they should. Far from the worst mcu movie and not even close to the worst comic book movie ever made, just a pretty good film with some undeniable flaws.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest.Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film.It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 hour 30min film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them.Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chlo√© Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!Personal favourites are Thena and Gilgamesh.I still recommend people to watch it, but don't go in with high expectations.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The trailer didn't do it for me when it first came out, so I didn't care so much as to go check it out in the theatre as I usually do with any other Superhero movie. But now that the movie is available on streaming, I decided to give it a shot.Eternals was a painfully long movie to sit through. It is almsot 150 minutes of a story that progresses without any noteable development to get us invested in what's happening. I truly appreciate the scope of director Chloe Zhao's vision and the way in which she attempted to translate it on screen, but the execution of it through a very disorienting storytelling format makes all of that appear very shallow. There are too many characters to care about and none of them give us any particular reason to except for that they are the main characters. The threats they face don't seem very threatening and the movie despite its world-ending stakes never feels serious.Eternals. While not a good movie, is not a bad one either. There is nothing too dumb about it as is with some of Marvel's worst entries (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, Captain Marvel, Shang Chi...), but it still wasn't interesting enough to keep the audience engaged. The visuals were breathtaking, but that's all it has going for it, which isn't enough to redeem Eternals from being a bore.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But how at least three characters changed side back and forth made the story messy and less believable for me and ruined much of the movie for me. The bollywoodstyle and far to feminine ""comic relief"" ""Kingo"" just felt cringeworthy to me.Considering the playtime of ca.2.5 hours, I felt that not much was really told about each of the eternals to explain why they acted as they did. Yes, some explanations were made, but they seemed forced and superficial. And considering how long the Eternals had been together on earth, they seemed to know each other incredibly poorly!And as usual lately: Superhero movies and series have become FAR to entangled with each other! There is at least one reference in this movie that you probably will not understand if you have missed at least one of the previous movies!

However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time.Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" is very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better.There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations though so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. 9/10 and I highly recommend.","129 out of 294 found this helpful.

Marvel movies deserve attention. Despite the low rating, I really liked the film, more than two hours flew by unnoticed, and there was not a single minute of boredom. I didn't regret going. For fans of simple action movies, I think it will be boring, but for fans of heroism, comics, it should go with a bang!Pretty decent storyline, very unique. Of course, we are talking about saving the world. The story seemed intriguing. Pleasantly pleased with the cast. I won't tell you everything, otherwise you won't be interested. I recommend watching it on a wide screen. Excellent special effects, the film is large-scale, spectacular and dynamic.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Shang Chi was a hit, Black widow a miss, Eternals unfortunately a miss too.I had my doubts when it started with paragraphs of onscreen text. No film should explain the story with text, the film should do this. Which it did a few minutes later anyway.It's so long for no reason, they could have easily lost an hour without loosing content or story. Some of the acting was great and others poor like the child Eternal. The writing/ directing was just lifeless and just not compelling in anyway.The editing seemed poor as well. I am sitting in a dark cinema and one scene will be so dark I can just about see what's happening. Then it will just cut to an outside shot with the sun glaring in from behind a character. Not just once but constantly throughout the film, just dark then overly bright then dark again.Effects were good but why should they not be in this day and age. Apart from the end credit scene with the dwarf guy, his cgi was some student quality stuff.To sum it up it was just quite dull and some what uneventful for all the potential it had. The bad evolving alien could have been so good but was just passed off like nothing and forgotten about.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

But it didn't work in this movie, I didn't believe it for a second, it felt forced and didn't add anything to the story.I also thought the ending was rather abrupt, it seemingly came out of nowhere.The director probably learned a lot making this movie, but I doubt she'll be directing the sequel.

"1","/10","The Worst Marvel Movie Ever Made","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7555861/?ref_=tt_urv","DrVankman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur59927693/?ref_=tt_urv","17 November 2021","It is not a good idea to read any reviews before watching the film, however, it seems that only a deaf person has not heard that Eternals did not like either the critics or the audience. What we have so far: the Oscar winner Chloe Zhao was set as the Director to make a new Marvel's installment so maybe that's would be nothing strange in her techniques, if it was something different from superheroes movies, because shooting a potential superheroes blockbuster and making auteur films are completely different things. This time, it did not work to cross two genres, which simply could not please either the Marvel audience who wanted to have fun, or the Zhao audience who wanted to think.The Eternals bring up a topic that has been dealt with rather closely in the last two Avengers, only there is a serious flaw in the current film's approach to this issue. No matter how barbaric the methods of Thanos were, there was something to think about in The Avengers. Eternals do not touch upon the issues of overpopulation or anything else realistic, for some reason everything in the movie presented as a given, and this requirement stumbles over the usual logic: cruelty and violence do not and cannot lie at the top of everything , which means that what the conventional antihero of the Eternals demands is absolutely false.In addition Eternals are over saturated with different ideas and thoughts. Here is the idea of the common good without war, based on deprivation of will. And here is the instant realization: the lack of free will leads to a halt in evolution. Here is an obvious thought about the nature of humanity, but immediately forgotten. The topic of man and humanity has not been revealed in any way, although in the case of immortal aliens it suggests itself. Here, in the words of some heroes, there is a hint of reasoning about evolution, and, moreover, in relation not only to people, as if it had never happened. There are a lot of such things in Eternals Chloe Zhao obviously wanted to talk about a million topics, but even the large chronometers did not allow her to do it with dignity.The story itself is very careless with their heroes: although, in fact, the creators approached the formal characteristics of the team thoroughly and chose representatives of all races, cultures and physical characteristics, the heroes themselves didn't become heroes, remaining only hints at them. Each of the heroes has lived a long life - seven thousand years - however, in the film, no one has any convincing background, as if there were no eternal ones at all. We don't know how they lived before, we do not know how and how they live now - thank you if someone has at least a hint of a profession or a family. Numerous excursions into history don't help in any way to understand and learn their history, which does not have a logical conclusion. The Eternals are trying to reveal a whole bunch of heroes at a time, which, as in the case of the theatrical Justice League, is not particularly successful.The plot is Eternally chaotic, inconsistent and in addition boring and lack of details. This film could be safely cut into three parts: there are several episodes in the picture, perfect for a couple of spectacular endings. If Eternals were a trilogy, the tragic scenes would have been perceived accordingly, and the culmination would have been more intense. Eternals are thrown not only from thought to thought, but also in time: here and a million years BC, and Babylon, and much more. However, these throws don't serve the plot: they are needed only for the next action scenes. Maybe it would have looked better, like a quiet philosophical fantasy, and there was no need to torment the director with scenes unusual for her for the amusement of the audience. Speaking of battles, it is perplexing that the Eternals are shown individually so vulnerable. This is strange, because in their 7 thousand years they were stronger than everyone else, but suddenly not.Some people will appreciate a new appearance of Lauren Ridloff from The Walking Dead as Makkari, but it's not helped the movie a lot as the appearance of such a famous persons like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and everyone's pretty annoying characters from Game of Thrones. Also note the dubiousness of such a hero like Ikaris who looks like a mocking parody of combination of DC Superman and The Boys Homelander.Following the new rules of Hollywood, Marvel is trying to add a new topic - making one of the eternal the first open gay character in the MCU. However, looks like the audience didn't particularly appreciate such a novelty. The involvement of the character and his nature seems like was gotten from some amateur LGBT film, for festivals specializing and not directly from an expensive blockbuster of a large studio. The filmmakers will blame one-star reviews for unwillingness to embrace LGBT society, but not bad plot, poor script, and directorial work.I wouldn't say that Chloe Zhao is bad director, but this particular just film showed us that the great talent of some director is throw away millions into garbage as the film itself is an experimental attempt by Disney to do something new on an old foundation. The movie tries to exploit the most popular themes in modern popular culture, but it does it so clumsily and uncertainly that towards the end it begins to look like a bad parody of superhero films, and not like a multimillion-dollar blockbuster by one of the leading studios on the market. Who knows, maybe it would work as a trilogy or even better a Disney Plus TV series, but not this mediocre trash, where everything is stuck together with cuts from different plots in such a way that the reasons of the narrative and the motives of the characters were lost before the viewer had time to understand and follow the storyline.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

First off, making it as a short series instead would have made for better character development. Also, I hated that characters were still being given extended introductions well into the first hour, but since it gets revealed that their memories before being on Earth weren't real, what was the point of drawing out their backstories? Unto the romance, Gilgamesh and Thena were a more believable couple than Ikaris and Sersi (honestly those two main characters were such a bore and I wished they explored the other characters I was way more interested in)Now, I've gotten over the main stuff but I still want to get out random stuff that bothers me.Anyways, I guess that's enough complaints for now and unto the good things! I absolutely love the Eternals' costume design, the cinematography is incredible and I wish I had seen it in theaters instead of on the Disney+ app. It has its problems but I don't think it deserves all the horrible ratings it received because there's worse things out there like The Dark World, Captain Marvel, Loki and The Incredible Hulk (pls don't come for me these are just the ones I felt feel flat). It was a decent continuation of the introduction to celestials from GoTG2. Thena's weapon was pretty cool. The final end credit was good but it kind of says a lot that it was the part that made feel the most hyped for the future of the MCU.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately some of them went under utilized. The villains in the film were the least interesting part. They were just there. There was a constant changing of who the Eternals would have to fight that despite having a clear goal, rooting for them to succeed was not something the audiences would be compelled to do so. The end scenes were even absurd. The film is really different In a way that it feels more mature and slow paced but unfortunately that didn't serve it well. On the whole, Eternals isn't really a bad film, it's enjoyable on its own but certainly not on par with the rest of MCU films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This prologue segways into Time by Pink Floyd, the second time time the band has been utilized in the Marvel canon; and while the usage of popular classics has grown to cringe-inducing levels in the past several years, this fits both thematically and somewhat ironically. You truly feel that Time passes throughout the story as we follow ten cosmic beings who must face their destiny in saving Earth from their dastardly counterparts that resemble the aliens from A Quiet Place.It's suffice to say that the premise and first few minutes can immediately engage our audience even if the rest of the film isn't the sum of its parts. It's already apparent that Eternals may just be the most divisive MCU installment since Thor: The Dark World, but no need to worry: Eternals eclipses the latter in just about every sense. It isn't just that it brings sections of the universe full circle, it's that it utilizes Zhao's direction in its near three-hour runtime, and we can make even more sense of her overnight success from Nomadland. I was quite surprised by how much maturity has been brought to the universe, coming off the heels of Avengers: Endgame. In some ways this is a return to form to the early days of Iron Man when the creative forces that be were still trying to find their identity in the grand scheme of things, and Eternals on its own succeeded in many ways.Zhao bridges the B-movie allure of many modern super efforts (especially in its costumes) with her prestigious background- and its crowning achievement to be sung in many reviews will be Ben Davis's cinematography. What many will tell you about some of the genre hall-of fame films is where they illuminate the brightest is their ability to make you forget you're watching a superhero film, whether it'd be in writing or aesthetics. Eternals most certainly wins in the latter with its naturalistic locations, sightful evocations of isolation, storm clouds, you name it. One can most certainly believe the press notes of her influence from Terrence Malick. The battle sequences and effects are as appealing as some of Marvel's best films, and in some cases even more brutal.The Marvel Cinematic Universe may be diverse in characters and varying genres throughout the years; but none have transcended the supercapes genre like only a select few have. Sadly, even Eternals' geek roots are too obvious, and much of that comes from Marvel's usual brand of hit-and miss humor. It's understandable that in a generation of irony, many fans will want these movies breaded and buttered in self-deprecation and ""I know I'm watching a blockbuster"" mechanics; but here the results are uneven though thankfully not to Thor: The Dark World status eye-brow raising. One moment that comes close to that is during the climax and a decision with a character arc that partly amounts to a punchline.Despite some tonal deficiencies, one issue that certain critics have brought up, the runtime, is thankfully not much to differ. Instead of a breakneck speed, Zhao's direction takes its time to make every one of us care about the Eternals. So much so that a character tragedy is carefully concealed and makes way for much needed third-act tension.Like many other TV stars, Gemma Chan is one who had trouble translating her small-screen bed of roses to a silver one. Now she's played not one but two MCU characters (double-dipping in the comic book field is quite the trend amongst popular actors these days), and her turn as Sersi should be proof that she can lend herself to dramatic leads in the future. Her chemistry with Richard Madden's Ikaris is part of what makes them the ones who carry the cast on their shoulders; Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani are all engaging and funny to varying results. Let's also not forget seasoned actresses Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie. The former makes the most of her limited screentime, and Mrs. Jolie is up there with our two leads as Thena. Fans will await for her return in a future installment.Eternals is at least half a leap forward for its respective universe in terms of maturity; a giant one in aesthetic, craftsmanship and representation; and a lateral move for Chlo√© Zhao's career. In a world of apples and oranges, prestigious films and blockbusters, she's another example of that you can commit to both. And let's also lay to rest the rumors of Disney bribing critics; recent Rotten Tomatoes history has showcased Dumbo, The Rise of Skywalker and Eternals- I can name more.RATING: 3 out of 4 stars.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

In addition to Marvel Studios' generally good track record, you have quite the ensemble of talented performers in the cast and an acclaimed director like Chloe Zhao at the helm, who earlier in the year of release won an Academy Award for the much-liked Nomadland.The story is a mess, tonal shifts occur frequently scene-by-scene, doing a disservice to the themes it's trying to present to the viewer. The root of the film's problems lie in the choice of director - Chloe Zhao is not known for spectacle-fueled entertainments (Which is fine, several filmmakers who have worked for Marvel Studios did not originate from major studio pictures, either, but their storytelling sensibilities made them fit for the stories being told), with films that are often made to feel dream-like, and meditative. These strengths can work for a different set of characters in the Marvel universe, but not really so for a property like the Eternals.Another problem is the misplacement in the timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - This is a movie that could've have fit somewhere between Infinity War and Endgame (maybe), but right now it feels like an afterthought.The cast all do their best with what they are working with, but the material doesn't give them enough to deliver anything particularly memorable with; Lia McHugh and Kumail Nanjiani, whose characters are probably the most interesting and entertaining of the cast, to be honest.Could have been great, but alas.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Endgame showed audiences that a bunch of heroes could share the screen as long as we cared about them and they had their own point and purpose. Eternals attempts to do the same, but in it's 2 and a half hour runtime they don't manage to give their heroes enough character development, beyond the droning exposition, to equal The Avengers. The end result is a cinematic version of the old saying, ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". The plot and pacing are quite convoluted at times, and I, as well as many other MCU fans are growing wise and weary of these ""Everything is at stake, and yet nothing is really at stake"" plot lines. The acting and direction were great. Cinematography was great. But we've seen these action sequences done a lot better. We've seen these villains better done in the Hellboy franchise. The music of this film was not iconic. In the end, I was bored. My butt was sore from all that sitting, and I left the theater not really caring about what I had just watched. Most marvel films see me out of the cinema with a smile on my face, eagerly discussing what I just witnessed. Not this time, sadly.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The way the narrative addresses various discussions such as the evolution of humanity, representation and diversity, makes the film very different from the most of the films","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8253291/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2022","In the film, we follow a group of ten super-powered beings who came to Earth on a specific mission, given by the Celestial Arishem (voice of David Kaye): to end the threat of the Deviant monsters and, in the process, help humanity evolve without get involved in their conflicts. They arrive in the world at the dawn of human civilization and, over time, become immersed in the planet's culture, clinging to and mixing with their prot√©g√©s.The lack of tone change, rampant fanservice, and the immense need to connect everything in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) was generating a lot of friction between fans, producers and even movie lovers, raising some important questions, for example: is it still worth following this shared universe? And the movies/series need to be all connected or couldn't they be more independent?Therefore, Eternals came with the promise of giving a greater freshness to this saturated universe, mainly by counting on Chlo√© Zhao at the head of the project. The director and screenwriter won two Oscars for Nomadland, for best picture and best director. In fact, Kevin Feige, executive producer at Marvel, allowed Zhao to work with a lot of freedom. Despite still being a 'Marvel product', Eternals already positively differentiates itself by counting on the director's creative vision, which is wide open in all aspects of the film.For this mixture of astronaut gods, Gnosticism and superheroes to work, Zhao chose to put the brakes on the action so that we could get to know each of the new protagonists in depth, how they relate to each other and how they see the world they live in - the which is essential for us to connect to the story. It just takes patience that the MCU has never demanded from its audience. And the big point is that fights every 10 minutes or that unbridled rush are not needed around here. It's a story about relationships and how that's the most human thing about us-even if it comes from near-divine beings. As much as the slower pace is very different from the formula that Marvel has presented us for almost a decade, the result is one of the most interesting stories in this universe.The most important thing in Eternals is its characters. What makes the movie truly captivating is the dynamics of Marvel's gods. Setting up an origin story with several protagonists is no easy task, especially when no character is really known to the public. And the great merit of Eternals is to be able to present and develop each one of these immortal beings, dedicating a good part of the script so that we get to know, become affectionate and understand each member of the group, their personality and their way of seeing the world.With a team of many heroes, Eternals has a large and diverse cast (perhaps the most varied in the history of the genre) and also irregular, which is normal when it comes to different personalities, ages and different genres. This is how we see Sersi's (Gemma Chan) passion for humanity, Kingo's (Kumail Nanjiani) narcissism and the Goblin's (Lia McHugh) frustration with her own nature. Each of the new heroes is portrayed with a unique personality that sets them apart from the rest, and they are all equally interesting and captivating. Everyone has their highlight moment, mixing well the typical Marvel humor with the particularities of each one. They all work well on their own and are even better together. Even Richard Madden's Ikaris is a great character, despite the actor's limited performance.One of the main challenges of the script is to reconcile the wide range of characters - and the strong cast. Not just highlighting and developing each one, but making them relevant to the story. Does the film succeed? So-so. There are characters with little screen time and others appearing too much. Even more, you could feel the lack of depth in the central characters. Although the film presents interesting contexts and backgrounds for everyone, the personalities follow very simple archetypes, something that creates the impression that these heroes are just ""more of the same"". However, it doesn't necessarily mean something bad. Overall, the dynamic between the members works well. They have chemistry with each other and are charismatic most of the time.And those character dynamics are key to making the whole story work. The real tension of the script isn't in how the group will defeat the Deviants or save the world, but how their different ways of looking at humanity and the mission they've been given clash - and for those conflicts to work, the people need to care about all ten eternals, which the movie does very well. But, as said, it takes time for all these relationships to be explored - and that's where Eternals hits the brakes on what we're used to seeing in the MCU. So, instead of having several action sequences that give the plot a celerity and a sense of urgency, the film is dedicated to showing the relationship between Ikaris and Sersi, to justify the mutual admiration of Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) and explain why Druig (Barry Keoghan) disagrees with his brothers' methods.The narrative is linear, but it alternates between the present day and important moments in human history, going back and forth in flashbacks. In this way, at the same time that we follow the trajectory of the heroes in getting together, we see what led them to be in this situation. Definitely, the film breaks several standards set by Marvel. It cares a lot more about telling a story than inflating the MCU even more with references and warnings about upcoming movies.However, the influence of Marvel is still present, unfortunately in a negative way. There are characters needlessly out of tune, which only serve to bring comic relief. Not that it's bad, most of the funny scenes work, but it totally breaks the rhythm and many are no longer taken seriously. Furthermore, there are many inconsistencies that are difficult to swallow, especially involving the reasons why Deviants exist. The impression left at the end is that the alien beings only have the purpose of composing action scenes.Yes, there are some problems in ""Eternals"", such as digital effects that are not impressive, some arms of the story that are not that interesting, secondary characters that don't arouse any feelings, a semi-villain poorly explored and, above all, a feeling that that story doesn't take place in the Marvel movie universe. Despite the script having some notable holes, and the film's duration being excessively long, it still delivers a good, engaging story that brings a freshness that Marvel so badly needed. Thanks to Chlo√© Zhao, Eternals is one of the films with the most personality in this universe. It is remarkable how great the direction of scenes and actors are. The director brings her naturalistic perspective to filming, valuing every detail to the fullest. All the combat choreography is very well done, taking advantage of both the abilities of each of the eternals and the visual impact they offer to compose scenes that are really impactful.With stunning scenes filmed in real locations, Eternals is a very beautiful film both in terms of looks and in the message of union and love that it conveys to viewers. The soundtrack is noteworthy and completes the epic setting, emphasizing emotional moments and punctuating other scenes to amplify the effect of what is happening on screen. Another peculiar point is that, despite the soberer and contemplative tone than we are used to in the MCU, the long is not afraid to make references either to other Disney franchises or even to characters from the ""competitor"" DC Comics, responding in the can to fan-asked questions like ""Why didn't the Eternals help in the fight against Thanos"" and more. It's interesting to see a direct, honest and wide-open answer on the big screen.In addition, the way the narrative addresses various discussions such as the evolution of humanity, representation and diversity, makes the film very different from more banal productions that lead nowhere - as is the case with several feature films of the genre. Although Eternals still has several slips, it delivers a solid story that works very well for making us care about those illustrious strangers. The whole dynamic of these gods is what sustains the plot and makes the twists and conflicts have the necessary weight both to impact us and to design what is to come in the future of the cinematic universe.It was a tremendous success to bring someone like Chlo√© Zhao, who brought identity, body and soul to a project that had everything to go wrong. Even with Marvel intervening to connect the film to its cinematic universe, the director and screenwriter's vision was essential for us to have a good story, without having to get so attached to the MCU. Now, it remains to be seen if Marvel will continue to bring in Zhao and other professionals as good as they do because that's exactly what their films need, directors who bring personality traits to their films. The shadow created by Avengers: Endgame is still a problem for this Phase 4. The public's expectation and anxiety for something as great as a monster that Marvel itself created and that now seems to struggle to tame. However, audiences are sure to find Eternals one of the most interesting things the MCU has offered in a long time.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yes, the movie is long, but not boring; it takes the time it needs to establish this story. 'Eternals' is definitely more catered towards adults, and is actually a sign of Marvel maturing.I suspect why some people may have not liked it, but to each their own.

Many of skills, strange damage... i was wanna try to understand powerful each of characters but i couldn't.Let's begin to speak about positive moments.at first - great squad of actors. Secondly really good work by animation, effects, montage teams. And so happy to saw Angelina Jolie again she was stunning as usual. The movie make strange feel, all the time i thought about relationships between the characters, but i didn't know what i'm waiting in the end of the movie. In the end i'm surrendered. And else, too hard to look at actors that were filming to Games of Throne, now and forever these guys relates only with Games of Throne, it just my opinion.That text was create with google.translate and one guy who stady english.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

If they didn't made reference about the Avengers, anyone watching Eternals would have thought it's a complete different universe. It does not feel like a super hero movie for sure. More like a movie where people with superpowers fight each other. I don't think any kids going to watch Eternals will ask their parents to buy any of the Eternals costumes for the next Halloween. None of these Heroes stand out. They don't inspire people and they're not relatable in a way to feel like a role model for people.

While it wasn't horrendous, it certainly wasn't great.The MCU has been fantastic up to this point. While the films had us travelling around the universe the previous twenty-five films always felt grounded with some rhyme or reason to events and circumstances.Both literally and figuratively this film always felt like it was up in the air. Nothing felt constant and the fluidity dropped off several times during flashback events. And while the origins of these hero's was somewhat explained it didn't feel natural. The characters felt out of place in the world and lacked an emotional connection.A few positives to the film though was that it looked visually stunning. It worked well with IMAX enhanced. The music blended well to attempt to give some sort of connection to the film. Perhaps the best part of the film, though it felt somewhat like a list being checked off, was the diversity of characters. I think people will find that they connect with a least one character on some sort of level.In the end I just didn't feel anything for this film. It felt like it could exist, but not in the MCU as we know it. I'd rather new characters be introduced into the more Avengers aspect than to be in the aspect of ""Eternals"".Almost at the end of this twenty-seven film journey. Lucky for me ""No Way Home"" is still showing in IMAX theatres so I shall take advantage of that.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Okay.Let me explain.I feel like this movie should have been a series, because - as many people have already said before me - it focuses not on the story, but on the characters. This movie is a character drama, which is nice and interesting - IF you 1. Know and 2. Like the characters. That's not the case here. The movie is reeally long, but at the same time, too short: too long, because there are empty, boring parts, too-long expositions, and short, because we don't have time to get to know these characters. It caused a lot of uncomfortable moments for me, because there were a few emotionally heavy scenes, where I felt basically nothing, thinking ""jeesh, that happened, I should be upset"".The story is quite simple, and honestly, kinda boring. I understand that the MCU wants us to love Earth and People in general, but it's getting increasingly difficult to stomach the ""oh, I must save the planet because I love it"" explanation for everything. It can't be the real motivation behind every single character. There was a nice twist towards the end of the movie, which I didn't expect, so that was at least worth it.The music is forgettable and bland, and the actors? Guys, we have some really BIG names here, but I swear, it looked like they either decided to pretend to not know how to act, or to overdo it to a ridiculous level. It just wasn't believable or authentic at all.Some people say that this is the most beautiful MCU movie - well, in my personal opinion, it's not. It has some nice and inspiring CGI moments, but also some embarrassingly bad ones, too.One last thing: the movie jumps between action sequences (which are OK) and weird, boring parts with my personal (not) favourites: flat jokes, long ""we're standing in a line to pose as superheroes"" expositions, and rom-com-like, (not) romantic moments between actors who don't have any chemistry (or facial expressions!) at all.So. I understand that the director wanted to do something different, and it's different, all right, but it could have been so, so much better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I can say that this movie contains a lot of very interesting, clever and novel ideas. This had the basic materials to be something special, instead it is a mess. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed. I don't think I have ever seen so much potential wasted. Dull characters, a weak script, confusing flashbacks and flash forwards, and absolutely lame and cringeworthy attempts to inject humor. This movie is a mess. True, if you manage to get through the first 30 minutes without switching off, it does get better though and by the end you might even care about what happens, even if you don't care about any of the characters. This film goes for around 155 minutes, which seems really excessive. It wouldn't have though, if the story had been told well. Time would have flown by. Instead it drags. Quite obviously this is an important movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like another movie with the same importance though, Captain Marvel, this is a dud. The thing is, the after credit scenes suggest a sequel to this is intended. The sequels better be better than this. New writers and director would help.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Personally I think the costumes or hero uniforms if you will seem to be getting more comic book like which can be good or bad depending. The problem is while Marvel enjoyed a long run of well paced films that managed to flow so well between action scenes, humor, or interesting dialogue that seemed to start to come to an end with Captain Marvel and continues with the Eternals. The writing simply isn't good, and the dialogue just doesn't flow. The action scenes are good as usual, but I found myself wanting the scenes in between to just end to get to the next action scene. If they want the success of the Avengers again Marvel needs to consider moving some funds from the special effects budget and hire writers who's goal is to make a good film and have the talent to make it so.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action, story, dialogue, acting, editing...if it could be felt on screen it was going to go wrong. I was shocked when halfway through the movie i realized there was still another hour and a half to go. The movie drags and forces you to sit through some of the dullest dialogue and delivery. Plot holes and ridiculous reasonings make the movie incomprehensible at some stages. With action scenes that you don't care about because you can't really care about the characters. That's if you can see anything because so much of the scenes were shot like Kit and Richard brought the lighting crew from Game of Thrones.There are some fun jokes and visually stunning shots but these are few and far between. The only positive takeaways I could muster was the scope of the film was refreshing and the ideas were promising. But the execution was sorely lacking and felt hollow.Overall Eternals lacks in all the areas that counts and tries to make up for it in the diversity aspect of its casting. Representation will only carry you so far, and if your film lacks substance that's not going to be very far.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It had everything going for it from the cast, the teasing of there return and expansions on them with some cameos at the end (No I'm not talking about the main guy but the other guy who came with him, some sort of lilaputchian I think). But the movie tries to introduce 10 characters at once and only makes me care about maybe 5 at most. Although I thought that the deaths of some characters were sudden and took me off guard. The main problem really is that fact that I don't necessarily like the characters. I felt nothing for people like Ajax or Ikaris even though they were extremely crucial to the plot. These problems really stick out from me enjoying the movies visuals and scale (which is massive and does fit the movie even though some parts are a bit jarring). But the fact that I just don't care about most of the eternals really made me not care for the plot, such as how the world of captain marvel is great but Carol isn't (But better than most of these guys). The only thing I haven't really talked about the action sequences and I have only one thing to say, why Chloe Zhao to direct this. They're ok, just like Nomadland (On the same greatness level, don't think that Nomadland is an action packed thrill ride). This is a heavy superhero fighting movie that really doesn't fit the director, even though she is great and definitely deserves her two academy awards, it just shouldn't have been her movie. In conclusion, I do prefer Nomadland (for me low 7/10) to this but I don't think eternals too bad. But I think that the fact I liked the marvel studios titles (I love Pink Floyd's 'Time') more than almost all the scenes does say something. But I'd say if you're an avid MCU fan I would still go and see it, and stick around for the two post credit scenes for the cameos I mentioned earlier (just ignore the actor cameo in the first not the second(It is just a voice in the second though so don't get you're hopes up to much)). Overall it's a middle tier 6/10. Just a bit worse than Thor.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie has plot twists I would've never guessed! You think you know how the story will continue and boom another plot twist and you know nothing again. At some points it can get a bit confusing but you can follow the Story at every point.I won and lost with that movie but I absolutely adored it.Critics said they missed the action it was too much storytelling but that's just not fair. Not every movie needs constantly fighting sequences. The movie lives from the storytelling you understand and start to like the eternals because of it. This kind of storytelling gives them a heart. You need the beginning and the whole story to feel something for them. Imagine to just get thrown into a story without knowing anything. You would be lost. I respect why some people say it can get a bit too long sometimes or kinda ""messy"" but we always needed the background story of our hero's to love them. The mcu would be nothing without background story's and the beginning of ours hero's and how they even had the chance to become our hero's.Go in there open minded for something new and you won't be disappointed.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then Nanjiani and Ma were also pretty 'meh' for skill.Beyond the acting, the story had two big blemishes that degraded this movie: pretty much everything with Kingo in it, from his stupid humor to his stupid superpower, and the totally cringe and unconvincing love story between Sersi and Ikaris. I swear I could notice Gemma Chan trying to resist or pull back when Richard was pulling her closer to initiate intimacy, it was horrible to watch.The general ""universe-scale"" events were pretty good though, for those alone I would watch a sequel, but I did not come out of this satisfied that I spent cinema ticket money on it, I'm definitely skipping the cinema next time and waiting for the sequel to get on streaming platforms.Hey, at least now we know of a second way (after GoT) to misspell the name of Greek goddess Circe.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a 200+ million budget film of course it's not going to be horrible, the lowest rating acceptable would be about a 6/7, with the reasoning being that it's not anyones cup of tea but this really isn't that bad of a movie. It's just not what marvel regularly brings us, and I can understand the reasoning for not liking what they brought us. Try to receive the movie with some cup of tea, as it really isn't a bad movie. Don't ruin the rating by rating it with a 1. Because it really isn't a movie deserving of a 1 star rating.And do we not appreciate the performance of the great actors in this movie and the amazing plot twists that nobody expected. The end credit scenes were although short truly amazing as well.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

It's a movie that suffers from serious pacing problems that are further compounded by boring characters.The decision to shoot using primarily natural light is a creative gamble that ultimately hurts the film because better lighting is needed to elevate many scenes and to provide that contrast between exterior and interior shots. The film is drab, even though some of the visuals are truly breathtaking.Also, the flipping between different eras and characters is not well done by the writers at all and many characters or ""emotional moments"" pay the price for it. It's hard to care about the story because something feels like it's missing, and everything feels too subtle and nuanced to make an impact.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film is way different comparing it to other marvel films. Zhao is aiming high for more of a compelling dramatic tension with the characters and great cinematography shots. And visual effects. The film does struggle with its pacing which can make it feel a little slow.What worked?The plot is great. The story gets bigger in the mcu. Showing Eternals which are immortal beings that have lived for 5000 years. Living among humans. While there agenda is protecting humans from deviants. There is more to the plot which gives it a twist about the Eternals hidden agenda. And a third act twist which a villain rises and divides and fights against the eternals. The idea of a celestial being born and needing to demolish worlds is an epic and thrilling direction.The cast ensemble is huge and all worked great with there characters. Gemma Chan did great as Sersei. Richard Madden is great. Along with Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Kit Harrington. In the movie, the Eternals did a great job working as a team. Every character stood out. Jolie and Ridloff were awesome. Kit Harrington has a small brief role. There is a seed planted for a much bigger part for him in the mcu world.The cinematography, music score, production settings, and visual effects are all great and worth watching. It does feel like watching a big budget artsy film with a superhero theme. The film does have a long epic run time which gives it enough time for it to develop the characters. Lots of flash backs through the centuries. While they try to find each other on Earth. The film spends most of the time with Ikaris and Sersei trying to locate the other Eternals on Earth. So they can preparing for an upcoming doom.The action sequences were good. Chloe Zhao played it too safe and avoided overdoing it which makes the movie feeling a little quieter compared to other mcu movies. A few good action scenes. And a climatic fight trying to slow the villain down to save the world.What did not work?Eternals is slow moving with its pacing. It does have a pacing issue which sets up for an exciting adventure and a epic showdown. It gets slowed down with too many expositions with the characters that the script slows down.Overall, Eternals is epic, it is beautifully shot and done with a great cast ensemble, and a story that is taking mcu to a direction that has yet to be explored. Even with the slow pacing, it is still one enjoyable ride.There are two credit scenes, one mid credit which introduces a new character, and a post credit scene which hints for a characters fate for future movies.","183 out of 442 found this helpful.

If you are like that, I would say you probably need at least a little Marvel appreciation if you are considering watching this.For those reviewers griping about its length, the film is an ensemble piece, with a bunch of characters who didn't already have their own films, so I feel those complaints are illogical. For the Marvel-aires, this is a movie more akin to the first Guardians of the Galaxy which also broke the two-hour barrier. I had not previously read either that nor the Kirby basis for this film, but I imagine here the hasty mish-mash of myth and duh-duh-DAH moments comes a lot from the pages of origin.Granted this film is far more human than GoG, lacking a smart-alec raccoon and a talking stick with catch phrase shtick. This is less a comic, and more of a family affair, and unlike many superhero films where the film hinges upon a misguided and mean Dad figure, here Salma Hayak is a forgiving martyr of a mom eternal. As a result the film opts for more compassion and less jocular camaraderie.That said it for me it did start out feeling a little bit like a Twitch broadcast of young gamers in love. Batting eyelashes while battling orcs aka Deviants. And sure there is a diversity training aspect to the film, but inclusion is a good thing, and honestly it is not done so clunkily here. Again, I am a fan of Zhao.Ultimately this film is about making a big, and potentially horrible sacrifice for more widespread benefit down the line. And I trust that will pay off with Zhao earning financial freedom for pursuing more work like her previous, outstanding films. Films that seem to be in touch with an America, that often immigrants see more clearly and value more deeply than we the People.Here saving the world if not the universe etc, feels a little bit beyond Zhao's strike zone, but in a way, the film is all about that Paper, Boi. (I'm also an Atlanta fan).Hmmmm, if I read correctly Emily Zhao's next film is (yet another) reboot of Dracula? That gives me a little pause...as I am of an age where smaller films usually feel bigger.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They are an offshoot of humanity known as Homo immortalis, created by the enigmatic alien Celestials to defend Earth with their superhuman powers and abilities. Their primary adversaries are the Deviants, who share a similar origin and pose a regular threat to humanity.So that is generally what this movie is about. Much of it takes place in present day, at a number of places on Earth. But the first 45 minutes or so show the Eternals at various points in history, usually in battles to protect Earthlings. At an appropriate point the Eternals find out the real reason they are protecting Earthlings and a new challenge presents itself.As one might imagine there is lots of CG action and glancing at the closing credits we see literally hundreds of digital artists involved. It is long, right near 2 1/2 hours, but so interesting that it doesn't seem quite that long.(I wonder how many viewers actually watched the very last 75-second scene that ends the movie right AFTER all the credits? Where the mortal opens a box and is confronted with a magical sword? Probably setting up for the sequel.)My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. It has a quite good sound track, it gave our powered subwoofer a good workout.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not the worst MCU film, neither the best","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7523211/?ref_=tt_urv","Come-and-Review","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53645293/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2021","The answer to the question that most are asking, following the huge internet buzz that resulted from the release of critics ratings, is this: it is definitely far from being the worst MCU film, but as a MCU film, it's not the most memorable one, even if, thanks to Zhao, visually and storyline-wise it is one of the most distinct Marvel films.Zhao's film balances rather safely between being a film belonging to the MCU system and being a Zhao film. There are minor elements of Zhao's cinematic poetics that permain. Even if Zhao's touch is palpable, what prevails is the dimension of the film as a MCU film.In an almost unprecedented fashion, Eternals is non-linear in its story structure, one of its many perks. The issue in the first 40 minutes of the movie is that the flashback scenes prove to be more interesting than the main storyline. It feels almost as if this parallel storyline could have been expanded in a more interesting full feature film. Eventually, threads are connected and the non-linear structure becomes interconnected enough to justify the unification of the subjects in one single film, but the ""present day"" storyline lacks coherence in some aspects.Ultimately, the biggest issue of Eternals is inherently linked to it being an MCU film. The Marvel signature approach, that demystifies superhero characters and turns them into comic figures, flawed and human, hardly works well for a set of god-like entities with millenary lifespan that have guided the early evolution of mankind, such as the Eternals.In terms of MCU lore, Eternals brought forward a vast area of expansion, that if implemented well, might possibly lead to new directions for the franchise. Weighing the pros and cons, Eternals leans more towards the postive, but its flaws prevents it from utmost greatness.(full review on comeandreview)","3 out of 22 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not as bad as most reviews make it seem, but certainly a movie with flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7522595/?ref_=tt_urv","lucaslw-93145","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100390004/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2021","The top review as I'm writing this is some dude panning this film, claiming to be a ""Marvel Zombie"" and challenging readers to check his review history to verify and lend credibility to himself as a trustworthy critic of all things Marvel. I took a look through his posting history and uhh.. didn't like Shang Chi, didn't like Captain Marvel (on account of the actress being too leftist?), thought Iron Man 3 and Avengers Age of Ultron were the examples of movies ""back when Marvel was good"". Anyways, I thought this dude (user: sidfargas) is a good encapsulation of the type of person who thought this movie was garbage. Not that the movie is phenomenal, but the critique is overblown, often by those who prefer their movies and studios without an diversity or risk-taking.Anyways, onto the actual review. Couple of positives, couple of negatives. Overall a decent film. In the company of Phase 4 Marvel movies, I'd say this is behind Shang-Chi and ahead of Black Widow (though the gap between this and Shang-Chi is far greater than the gap between this and Black Widow).Lets start with the positives: Visual design is very good in this movie (great CG directing from the ILM team, props to them and Chloe Zhao for that aspect). Very attractive cast, good job guys. 3rd act conflict didn't feel trite like a typical formulaic Marvel CGI army fight, due largely to the nature of the conflict shifting and the movie evenly distributing CGI sequences throughout the duration of the movie. Felt similar to the resolution of WandaVision. Angelina Jolie is a top tier actress in here. Richard Madden plays a very interesting character, and the rest of the cast have solid chemistry. Also, fantastic plot devices (SPOILER AHEAD IN THESE PARENTHESIS, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE AND PLAN TO: There were like 2 major twists in the film, and I didn't see either of them coming. Good job on the story telling part of that, I was pleasantly surprised)Now the negatives: script writing felt a little strange. Some dialogue was really on the nose, motifs were repeated out loud rather than left for the audience to discover, comedic relief, while mostly very solid, was a little too constant. Pacing in the interpersonal relationships was rushed, largely in part to fitting 10+ new ""main"" characters into a 2.5 hr movie is no easy task. The stakes were large and the power scaling of the entire MCU is now very strange as a result.I think the sum of it is: Eternals was a very ambitious project in size and scale. Typically, Marvel is very good about exceeding apprehensive expectations to larger than life film-making and storytelling challenges (Guardians of the Galaxy, Civil War, Endgame, hell even the OG Iron Man), but this time, they really did bite off a bit more than they could chew. I think the dialogue was too weak and the interpersonal relationships to uncomfortably shallow for this to be marked as a narrative success by Marvel. In all, a decent watch, but with the talent invested in this movie, I hope to see major improvements in the next installments of whatever comes next for the Eternals.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

After seeing the mass criticism of ""Eternals,"" I did expect to enjoy the film from an audience standpoint, just not a critical one. But, ever since I left the theater, I've been scratching my head trying to figure out why this film has been so bombarded with negative reviews.For starters, the film dives into some remarkably deep topics that I haven't seen in many movies, especially nothing from the MCU. Most deep conversations and emotional connections in cinema deal with love, death or discrimination. Eternals manages to pull in the audience's attention by showing us the beauty of life as we know it, something director Chlo√© Zhao does amazingly. The film doesn't feel like an MCU episode, and I'm honestly glad it didn't. THIS is where Marvel begins branching out to create beautiful new ideas.Something that really stood out to me was Thena's arc. Yes, it was well written, but we mainly have Angelina Jolie to thank for Thena's emotional rollercoaster. Jolie proves once again just how well she can put on a preformance, and thus Thena's journey ends up being one of the most beautiful parts of the film. Likewise, you could make a case for almost any of the Eternals to end up as your favorite.Perhaps the film's one flaw, being a little more humor than necessary, holds it back from being a 10/10 addition to Marvel, but even those humorous moments add a lively atmosphere to the scenes.There isn't much more I can say without spoiling any major plot points, but as of my first viewing, I'm quite shocked at how beautiful, tragic and well done this film is. I'm disappointed to see the negative reception it's received.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Yet for all of its inclusivity points, all of its beauty and gold (lost and lots of gold) the script absolutely sucked.The incessant globe trotting and flashbacks didn't help either.

The magnitude of Eternals is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU so far, but it also results in a film that just has too much on its plate.

It's shallow, offers a truly brain-damaged script and is convoluted to the max. The insulting part is that Marvel inadvertently lays waste to the entire Marvel Universe through the insane implications of this film. It goes so far cosmic and over-the-top that it practically tries to nullify everything from Captain America to Tony Stark to the concepts of real world religion. It has grandiose ideas and is ambitious but has absolutely no idea on how to deliver on ANY concepts touched upon. The result is an almost three hour disjointed movie that manages to develop nothing and no one. Not one relationship actually registers and not one character stands tall.Delusional fanboys may be trying to cover for it because of misplaced loyalty or else some want to excuse genuinely awful cinema because of ""diversity"" casting. Using that as a shield to try and protect or promote Marvel's worst concoction is just sad. Marvel Studios has seemingly lost their way but maybe true word of mouth and under-performing box office will snap someone back to their senses. Get Sersi back. Actually use Dane Whitman as the Black Knight. Flush EVERY other character from this putrid movie and move on to better things, Marvel.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

At first, the number of characters left me disengaged because I didn't know who these characters were personally.I found myself fighting to like these new characters; it felt like I was being introduced to a step-sibling, unlike the previous Marvel installments where most of the characters are known and graciously established into my heart.Unfortunately, the film doesn't seem to differentiate the characters enough for me to find them too enjoyable. Although they are very diverse, I found them progressive and not forced in ethnicity, personality traits, and identities.I liked the comical relief. The action scenes were intentional, forceful, and amusing as each character has unique combat. I also felt like I had a keen sense of catching plenty of Easter eggs and references to other universes like Star Wars.The climax action scene intensified at the perfect time, fuelling my imagination toward the idea of what was to come next left. I am geeked for what is to come next.Verdict:
Eternals is an enjoyable film. It is introducing us to a whole new aspect of Marvel. Compared to some of the other marvel films **cough, cough Black Widow lol ** this fairs well. Some comedy flirts at love and sets us up for so much more to come.Does it take me to paradise?

"6","/10","Grand in ambition, but emotional inert in execution. Eternals is one of the lesser entries in the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9003532/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","19 April 2023","For the past 7,000 years, a race of extraterrestrial beings known as Eternals have lived on Earth at the direction of Arishem (David Kaye) who has tasked the Eternals with fighting creatures known as Deviants which feed on intelligent life. While supposedly the last Deviant was killed 500 years ago, the Eternals continue to live on Earth until otherwise dictated by Arishem. When Eternals Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia Mchugh) are attacked by a Deviant bearing powers similar to an Eternal, they are joined in the fight by fellow Eternal and Sersi's former lover Ikaris (Richard Madden) and drive it away. With the Deviants returning, the group set off to find the rest of their fellow Eternals beginning with their leader Prime Eternal Ajak (Salma Hayek), but find she has been killed leaving them in a race against time.Eternals is an adaptation of the Marvel characters of the same name created in 1976 by Jack Kirby. In the early 70s, Kirby briefly left Marvel to work at DC where he developed his initially planned closed ended miniseries The New Gods which had its original definitive ending canned and DC would use the New Gods several times thereafter. Upon his return to Marvel, Kirby created the Eternals in order to explore similar themes and ideas presented in the New Gods. Eternals was announced as part of Marvel Studios development slate for phase four and was assigned writer/director Chloe Zhao after having previously been in the running for the Black Widow movie. Upon release, Eternals was a modest performer for an MCU title making $400 million against a $200 million budget, but critically the film became the lowest rated MCU title to be released. I don't think this is the worst MCU film as there are other entries I disliked more than this, but it does share company with some of the more middling entries in the MCU.To start off on a positive note, in terms of visuals and atmosphere Eternals does feel like a unique entry in the MCU as there is a genuine attempt by Chloe Zhao to take high concept Kirby creations like the Eternals and play them seriously. During the opening five minutes with the scrolling text, eerie and ethereal Ramin Djawadi soundtrack, and production and costume design, it felt very much like Eternals was trying to harken back to stylistic sensibilities of the 1970s seen in the likes of John Boorman or Alejandro Jodorowsky's films that seemed like it would complement such material. But then after that five minutes you begin to see cracks form in the foundation as the movie very awkwardly sets up the romance between Gemma Chan's Sersi and Richard Madden's Ikaris that just feels off especially when coupled with some pretty clunky dialogue. Honestly the Sersi/Ikaris romance is maybe a few notches above what we saw in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Eternals tries to establish this 7,000 year saga for these characters and their relationships that have a quasi familial quality to them, but the connections between the characters feel very muted despite being played by good actors with the grandiosity of the sets and visuals often making the rather thin characters feel lost among the shuffle. Frankly the strongest relationship in the film is probably the buddy dynamic setup between Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo and Harish Patel as Kingo's valet Karun. Brian Tyree Henry's Phastos gets some mileage out of the happy life he's made for himself, his husband and son, but Eternals often feels like there's promise in the supporting cast while the least interesting characters are fronting the story. The movie also moves at a ridiculously slow pace and if the characters had more dimension to them, that would be fine, but the main characters are so thin and the Deviants are mostly mindless beasts until one of them gains sentience and speaks with Bill Skarsgard's voice but to my knowledge is never given a name.I honestly struggled to enjoy Eternals and it felt like the same level of ""in one ear and out the other"" that I associate with entries like Age of Ultron and Thor: The Dark World. I really wish I enjoyed Eternals as much as I enjoyed the scope and certain visuals, but it's a film that with very limited exceptions left me feeling indifferent to what was going on despite literal world shaking stakes.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The design though, especially of the Deviants, is debatable, and someone may find it too generic.Why only five stars at first ? - I felt that the script/direction/cut and casting were not enough elaborated for a major production like that. I had the impresson, that Gemma Chan as Sersi, as much as I loved her in Humans and other roles, was not convincingly placed/depicted here. Kit Harington as her lover was introduced and then forgotten for nearly the whole movie, though he could have accompanied Sersei instead of that Indian sidekick (for instance). And Angelina Jolie, who can bear entire movies easily, was missing in so many ways, I was really disappointed that she was even cast here. Then, to point out a major failure, how could this be a MCU universe story without any participation from the extremely powerful beings of that realm who defied Thanos (which is mentioned in the movie). But ok, to integrate them somehow, maybe the movie would have to last four hours.Why then a higher rating ? - The story may be foreseeable to a degree, but in the end, it fits. It is about evolving (even as a 'fancy robot'), about deviating from established rules denying the ruler's infallibility. It is about questioning God (who, in this case, even admits mistakes and benevolent lies). Or, at a lower scale, questioning the King/President/Employer. Who sees you only as a tool to support his (?) design on a grand scale. Which is, I think, loosely comparable to bioengineering in our world, where you put little agents on a mission to fight bacteria and viruses so that the whole organism can survive.Aside of the family, love, and beauty and great potential litany, this, and the outcome of Ikaris' fate (great acting by the way here from Richard Madden) made me raise my verdict.A postscript: There is mentioned a 'sex scene' in the movie. But it is just a love scene that totally makes sense and is, even from a puritan point of view, not inappropriate. We live in 2021, not 1851, and the target audience (PG-13) of this movie for sure does know about sex.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I've read the all the Eternals books enough to know how much of a task it was to pull this off onscreen and the director did a really really good job.If you've not seen it yet and don't know the backstory I suggest you just simply enjoy the story presented because it finally opens up the cosmic universe.I hope the future of the MCU gets even more stupendous because I definitely want to be taken there when I watch these films.I didn't expect to like many of the characters onscreen but they all worked for me as a fan of the books.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's slower paced, more muted, more mature (in parts), and thankfully, lacking the ""comedy"" of the other Marvel movies. Zhao's cinematography is really nice too, even if the action scenes are lacking a punch. Action is clearly not her forte.I also really liked the historical scenes, maybe it's just me, but they were amongst the most colourful and interesting scenes in the movie.The Bad: But, this movie is overall quite bad. It's way too long and simultaneously, doesn't explain anything. It's stuffed with actors playing characters I didn't really understand or connect with all. There were just too many people and the movie ends up spending too much time juggling them, without creating a compelling narrative.These people never really feel like a ""family,"" despite the constant reminders that they're supposed to be. Despite this supposedly being a ""character driven"" movie, we never get a true sense of the group's dynamics or history. Which is ironic, given how much time we spend on introducing these lifeless characters.This movie also attempts to spice up the dull narrative about the world ending via giant aliens with philosophical musings about the Eternals' relationship with humanity. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly interesting discussion. OBVIOUSLY, the Eternals should (and would) side with humanity over their absenteee alien father who most of them have never spoken to, right?Worst of all, the characters don't seem to organically arrive at the ideological positions they end up taking. Nor is it ever explained why their powers are distinct...or why Arishem even cares if they intervene in support of humanity. Again, owing to an unbalanced, weird narrative that is constantly introducing characters, we never get answers to these questions. Not to mention an extremely undercooked villains and tired CG alien dogs as the main threat which seem...I don't know...creatures that could be handled by contemporary armies? They didn't really explain why these creatures MUST be destroyed by the Eternals.The Ugly: How is their a deaf Eternal? Seriously, why would Arishem do this? And how is speaking American Sign Language and pointing to her wrist - to indicate time - in 5th century Mesopotamia? How can a person - Sprite - who has lived for literally billions of years - speak Spanish so poorly? (I laughed so hard at this scene, I'm sorry). Why does Earth feel completely devoid of life? Why do the Eternals seem so disconnected from everything going on?It's one of those movies that Marvel wanted to be taken seriously...but it's far too stupid for that. Let's just forget this one ever happened, okay?","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

Amongst the Eternals team of good guys are people who are good, people who seem good but are secretly bad, people who are bad for good reasons and people who are good for bad reasons, and are driven by self-obsession and choosing to appear good to grow their egos. While there are plenty of good/evil revelations, it's not always in service of the plot that these characters are the way that they are (i.e. Morally grey), it's just what this movie chooses to do: to present natural human relationships and tensions amongst characters who are not at all human, and I think it achieves this very well. It takes an hour to establish it, but it does so successfully, which already places it a million miles away from the constant black and white, good-evil dichotomy that almost all previous MCU films opt for.That first hour it spends mulling over characters, I didn't find it flat or dull as a lot of reviewers have said. I enjoyed seeing the Eternals romp around the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan during Hernan Cortez' invasion, telling the Epic of Gilgamesh to people inside the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, it was really riveting stuff to see these unusual and not often shown histories portrayed through the mega-blockbuster CGI billion dollar budget lens of the Comic Book Movie. I found that much more exciting than the usual MCU flying laser fights in the sky that people seem to love so much.There's plenty of the latter in this still (laser fights in the sky) and there's plenty of horrible CGI as well, but for every design flaw or jarring bad effect, there's a breathtaker just around the corner. Eternals loses its gentle momentum at the start of the third act, but for a minute it was a resilient, off-kilter alternative history science fiction with an ensemble cast that really walked on its own two feet, and that's incredibly tough for an unknown entity in a mass production franchise. Especially one that opts to throw out the rule book like this movie does.It's interesting seeing Zhao take on this type of stuff after her surprise hit with Nomadland (also a listless and free spirited film) and I found Eternals to be an interesting addition to her so far decent filmography, and a very interesting addition to the MCU. There is clearly no fear to shake things up with the franchise, which will be the key to its continued longevity. I respect that, and even though I've largely disliked the post-Infinity War phase, Eternals has made me feel excited for what's to come.I wish more people enjoyed this film, I would hate to see more formulaic origin movies like Shang-Chi, or to see the MCU tumble into becoming a joyless member-berry, nostalgia bait machine.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Its concept is genuinely intriguing, and there's so much for the movie to explore...and it just doesn't. It misses the mark almost constantly. The characters are undeveloped, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden's chemistry is very poor and they give unusually flat performances (given that they are wonderful actors). Angelina Jolie's character, Thena, is one of the better characters, which is absolutely due in part to Jolie's commanding screen presence. But even she feels underwritten. There are some emotional beats in the film that I feel just aren't impactful. The movie works best when the team is together and working off their chemistry with each other, but there is unfortunately not a whole lot of that and a whole lot more exposition. The script, by the way, is awful. It is completely devoid of nuance. The dialogue is the most cliche, uninteresting dialogue you could possibly imagine. It's kind of tragic, because the whole cast is really giving it their all with the performances, but the screenplay is genuinely such a mess that it undermines the actors' performances. This movie should have been better. There are worse superhero movies, but this is among the ones I don't have much interest in watching again. Venom is a terrible film, but at least I can have fun with it. I can't really say the same for Eternals. It's too poorly-paced and too long.

After reading so many negative reviews and hearing so many criticisms, I thought it would be a waste of time and money. But I decided to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. Eternals is not your typical Marvel movie, and that's what makes it so awesome.The film introduces us to a group of ancient aliens who have been living on Earth for thousands of years, protecting humanity from the Deviants, monstrous creatures created by the Celestials, cosmic beings who also created the Eternals. The film spans across different eras and locations, showing us how the Eternals influenced history and culture, and how they developed their own relationships and conflicts.The film has a diverse and talented cast, each of them bringing their own charm and personality to their roles. The film explores themes such as identity, purpose, love, faith, and morality, and how they affect the choices and actions of the characters. The film also has some stunning visuals and effects, especially when it comes to the powers and designs of the Eternals and the Celestials. The film also has some humor and action, but not as much as other Marvel movies, which might disappoint some fans.Eternals is a bold and ambitious film, and it might not be for everyone. But I think it is a refreshing and unique addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it deserves more praise and recognition. It is by far my second favorite Marvel movie, after Thor: Ragnarok, which is also a fun and colorful adventure. If you are looking for something different and epic, I highly recommend you to watch Eternals.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Eternals was fine, it's the audience who is lacking.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7813808/?ref_=tt_urv","vh8686","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2363335/?ref_=tt_urv","30 January 2022","So the big complaint for audiences I think is that Eternals is boring and not as fun as other Marvel films. Probably the reason that the critics didn't like it is, well it's a Marvel film. The director's attempt to make more of an art house comic book movie does feel flat, but the cognitive dissonance is due to the nature of the director's style and the franchise she was taking on, the two are waves cancelling each other out.To say that this isn't the best Marvel film, who could disagree, but to say it's the worst and rate it so... I think that's a mere matter of inflating expectations. As the MCU goes on it will find most of the films introducing characters requiring a higher marker to please. There are only so many ways to structure an origin story in new and exciting ways.One of the things that seems to be a no-no with audiences is that this film takes itself seriously. It has the occasional obligatory Marvel type self-aware humor thrown in, sure but that has become a tired gimmick if you ask me. Marvel movies are afraid to strip away their tongue-in-cheek witicisms, like a cynical, pseudo-intellectual teenager afraid to show emotion or vulnerability. Take away the wisecracking side comments and suddenly Marvel looks more like DC (Zack Snyders Justice League is crap by the way but somehow that's rated higher on IMDb)Story wise, the Eternals' only mistake is that it doesn't lull the audience into a sense of ""this is just for fun"" for a few long hours before turning up the tonal gravity. It's true, Eternals is never really fun to watch, but then again neither is Schindler's List. So maybe what Eternals needs is to go all in with R-rated action and drama to make it more like Zack Snyder's Watchmen (His best if you ask me) but alas, Disney.Now visually this is one of Marvels best works when you discount the CGI characters. Audiences and critics tend not to care about the photography in a film, but to me that alone raises Eternals above many of those that fans adore the most. Here there are more shadows and Picasso blues to give it a beautiful melancholy. Everything is framed to allow the environment to be felt, almost like a Terrance Malick film so even if you're turned off by some of the brighter Asian/Bollywood type scenes and costumes, there's still a lot of that rugged western cinema to take in.Really, it might come down to the pan-earth diversity in the cast as the reason why some people don't like it. The people are represented here which, yes Disney is obviously pushing for more inclusive casting and culturally centered films, but unlike with the new Star Wars movies, this fits well here. Characters are spread out all over the planet... it'd be weird if all looked the same. How would you tell them apart? It doesn't fell like diversifying just for the sake of diversifying.Anyhow, certainly not the best but certainly not the worst and still worth your time to see.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Very dense indeed and very much a mixed bag.VFX is top notch the Celestials are cool. The Deviants were a big issue in the film. The film had a ""OH LOOK A MONSTER! LETS KILL IT!"" kind of approach to it. When it's revealed that they got some motive, it's very abrupt and executed without too much thought. I can somewhat forgive this as the film has to juggle ten characters, so I did expect the villains to be an afterthought, but they could have been more.The cast is pretty good, director Chloe Zhao and the writers do a good job balancing the entire cast. Not one of them felt left out, and to their best abilities try to develop them properly. Here are my stand-outs:Don Lee (Ma Dong-seok) as Gilgamesh gets a shoutout as the first Korean superhero on screen. Yes, this is because I'm Korean. Also I liked the banter he had with Angelina Jolie's Thena. It was the only relationship between the team where I felt it came off a bit more genuine than most.Richard Madden as Ikaris does a good job playing it straight without it feeling boring. The entire time he's on screen, you get the sense that something is on his mind and it makes you wonder what he's thinking.Lia McHugh as Sprite also impressed me as she is basically an Eternal who physically looks young, but Lia as a young actor does a great job portraying Sprite as if she is a bitter old soul.Barry Koeghan as Druig also impressed me. The film also plays with the idea if he's either on the side of good or bad.I respect the MCU's bold move to swing big. I can see what their approach to this film was. It reminded me of Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS, but instead of the perspective of the humans, we get it in the perspective of the engineers(or in this case, the Eternals).I'm going to sound somewhat hypocritical, as I do appreciate that they tried to be different and made big swings with a lot of high concepts and some thought provoking ideals, but at the end of the day it all felt pretentious and overly sentimental with some syrupy moments throughout.Lots of exposition too. ALSO, the plot felt very similar, if not almost identical to GOTG VOL. 2. It kinda felt as if they were disregarding what happened, but let me remind you that Ego the living planet in VOL. 2 played by Kurt Russell is a Celestial and Star-Lord inherited some of those gifts, which explains why he held on to an infinity stone and didn't die.In conclusion, I found myself thinking throughout the film ""wow they're going in this direction, this is cool and I love and respect these choices"" but it is ultimately weighted down by its structural flaws, bland villains, some twists you can see coming a mile away, and its overly sentimental tone.6/10.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie tells, but doesn't show, quite a bit, and that makes it difficult to relate to quite a few of the characters. The movie tries to cover so much ground that, on a first pass, it felt like I couldn't keep up, but then on a rewatch, it was hard to get through. Honestly, it felt more like a DC movie.I think this would have been better as a Disney plus series because there are so many in the group to get to know, and the Eternals, unlike the Avengers, come as a unit. With the Avengers, you could deal with each character's backstory (except for Black Widow and Hawkeye.................) before the ensemble film and so you had some connection to the characters and could be more invested in the movie, plus the movie didn't have to introduce you to the characters AND tell a story at the same time. The Eternals though, you can't really separate them and have a movie about Sersi, for example. But then the movie is trying to accomplish intro'g the characters and telling a story and it's too much in a short span of time.The way the movie goes, you barely get to know some of them before certain things happen. And then I honestly had so many questions like - why did so-and-so act like that, or care about that, or whatever? There was so much on the motivations of the characters that was missing.The richest parts of the film were usually interactions between some of the Eternals (Makkari and Druig! Gilgamesh and Thena! Sersi and Thena!) and also the visuals, as well as parts of the final fight.We'll see where this leads in the future.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story/plot is great, it's epic, and the production values are Tier 1. However, and this is why people are complaining so much, directory Chloe Zhao just isn't that experienced. This is her second feature-length film besides the tepid ""Nomadland"" and frankly it was just too ambitious to think she could swing it. Her interpretation is that ""Eternals"" are basically super-humans - with all the frailties and faults of humans, instead of a separate race of beings that you'd imagine would hopefully be more cosmically focused than so earth focused and a lot more mature/evolved. It just trivializes the epic nature of the story to have such powerful beings vulnerable to love, hate, anger, bias, and betrayal. And a short note about the climax, ugh, basically an unrealistic deus ex, a real disappointment.

There's 11 new characters here being introduced in a 2.5 hour film!!I do think however now that we ""know"" the characters and some of the background it could make for an incredible series of films. ..especially as I'm a huge fan of the cosmic storylines (GOTG is still the best!).So 7 out of 10 as it gave us some good foundations for the future...just too much in 1 film!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't particularly love her Nomadland as far as a general movie but I was blown away by the direction and the cinematography and I was really curious to see what she could have done with a Marvel movie. Unfortunately her touch is hardly found in Eternals. Yes there are some instances in which it can be seen and they are gorgeous but for the most part I felt like the movie could have been directed by a whatever decent director that the result would have been the same and so I was a little disappointed. But this problem is only mine, linked to my expectations. The real issue with the movie is that it tries to tell too much in a much shorter time than needed and the result is pretty superficial and generic. At least it isn't boring even if lengthy and this allows to watch it without wanting to stop but it gave me nothing and I think it is hardly rewatchable. What a pity since this movie had a lot of potential even in the themes that are interesting but only mentioned and not explored, a real wasted opportunity. Hope that Marvel recovers quickly from this latest bad streak.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The entire film was interesting and the multitude of characters somehow managed to be developed pretty well, given the time constraints to do so.Eternals was funny, exciting, engaging, emotionally moving, and relatable.

Pains me to admit it because it feels like the first truly risk taking MCU flick they've made in the franchise's history but I must concede that sadly, despite the commendable ambition of the project, none of the highs present throughout culminate to form anything substantial enough to outweigh the multitude of lows... And thus, it's a total, lacklustre disappointment.The main flaw stems from the fact that Oscar winning Chlo√© Zhao's direction is (somehow) genuinely appalling in this. Yes, she has remarkably inventive vision & a truly great eye for an aesthetically pleasing, naturalistic shot but as for her basic storytelling abilities? Weak. It's incoherent, poorly structured & badly paced.Of course, I'm obviously not doubting her talent. Merely making an observation that as an auteur (normally responsible for shooting indies), I don't think she was personally well suited to blockbuster filmmaking & hence, shouldn't have been involved with helming this - as it's clearly not something she's capable of adapting to / pulling off successfully.Her movie just drags. There's an insufficient amount of dialogue in the introductory sequence, very little connective tissue to bridge the gaps between set pieces & the lines that actors are given to say on screen are written atrociously & clich√©d as hell. Not to mention, she fails to get particularly memorable performances out of any of her actors & makes the unfathomable mistake of including an expository CGI PowerPoint presentation with an overly long monologue to explain the plot mid way through - as if that's a satisfactory way to convey information to a viewing audience?Everything simply relies heavily on the outstanding style / gorgeous designs to compensate for the complete lack of substance. There's no denying the impressiveness of the visual quality of the filmmaking (cinematography, set design & VFX) because I can't think of a single other Marvel outing that's looked THIS unique & distinctive but regardless, that's all it has to offer. It's surface level & hollow.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

On one hand there are an awful lot of scenes that are little more then exposition to try and help us understand who the Eternals are, but on the other hand it feels like these scenes needed to be much more in depth in order to help flesh out the characters.Whilst watching the film I couldn't help but feel that Marvel should have either taken the approach that they did with Guardians of the Galaxy by watching the team develop in a more self contained story that gives each character a chance to grow. Either that or release this as a Disney + series where each character gets an episode where their development is the main focus. The storyline for this film is just too big for a new entry and would have served better for a sequel, especially given that these are z-lister comic book characters with no mainstream exposure and therefore a fully fleshed out origin is essential.That's not to say this is a bad film. It's still watchable with plenty entertaining action to make up for the parts that do drag and visually it's one of the best looking MCU films to date, but I was continually left with the feeling that there was a lot of wasted potential here.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The amount of CGI put into it is insane, but there's no faults to it. There are quite a lot of characters to cover, and the whole ""getting the band back together"" feel is kind of nice for a Marvel movie. The performances from each actor make sure you get the right feel for the character, and they're genuinely quite a bit of fun. Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, and Lauren Ridloff really take the cake in my opinion. Their characters stand out in giving us bursts of excitement throughout the movie. While the movie itself is a little slow, there are scenes that really made me feel rewarded for watching. But, sadly, the end credits are really the thing to look forward to outside of a few great scenes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Probably. But who has read it? Does it offer exciting revelation to MCU canon and leave viewers wanting more? NO. Is it slow-paced? Yes. Is it action-packed? No. Is the material internally consistent with it's on world-building? NO. Are there too many contrivances? YES.All of these issues make for a lackluster, eye-rolling experience, but not so bad that I regrated watching.It felt like the writers had too many creative constraints for them to work with: 1) Eternals should be active in human affairs throughout history, but also should be unknown and hidden in present day; 2) Eternals shouldn't know their overlord's real goals because that would make them unsympathetic; 3) and Eternals couldn't grow as characters over 7,000 years, but must remain relatively dumb, motivated by basic, teenage human emotion. Marvel has a serious issue with developing good stories that expanding it's mythology, and Eternals puts this front and center.My advice would be to start with the villain's intents, goals, and his lack of empathy for good. This would be very similar to how Peter Jackson used Saruman in the Two Towers. Instead, we get a rehash of Watchmen, Wandavision, or Captain Marvel.This movie was a huge wasted opportunity and a disappointment, but I still deserves a C. 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Eternals has a lot of ambition and unique stories to tell, which leads to Zhao using exposition whenever possible including an opening crawl that gives you further insight into the world.We follow the Eternals from Mesopotamia and before to modern day as we see their impacts throughout history and how they shaped human existence and advancement throughout. The first half of the film is spent hopping from one timeline to another, with jarring stops in the present day where a neccessary armageddon is steadily approaching.In the flashbacks, Zhao hurriedly takes us through the Eternals' arrival on Earth, how a few instantly fell in love with humans while others were frustrated by their greed and violence.The characters are mostly half-written, inspiring barely any affection and emotion from our side. But at least it looks beautiful as the vast story unfolds in front of your eyes. For Eternals, Zhao brought on board cinematographer Ben Davis, who has previously worked in five other MCU films. She also brings in her own love for the golden hour, dusk and landscape shots, wedging in the setting sun wherever she can.The film looks gorgeous, packs in a ton of interesting ideas, character introspections and the general superhero gist. But despite all of its flamboyance and grandeuer, its weak character development, stoic performances from most of the cast,unfunny humour, and the obvious pandering to DIVERSE audiences lets the Eternals completely down especially by the end.Zhao seems uninterested in action and thus the sequences come across flat as well, Angelina Jolie is easily the best actress but has little to do and Salma Hayek as Ajak is wasted. The most screen time goes to Gemma Chan who plays Sersi. She is perhaps the most one note actress I have seen which is really detrimental as the film relies on her and Ikaris's(another Eternal) romance, her eventual hero's journey as in the end she is the one who carries out justice.Their romance which even includes a sex scene(first in the MCU) but their general lack of chemistry renders it all emotionally hollow, devoid of uniqueness and personality.There are a few other Eternals(Phastos,Druig,Sprite and Kingo) and all of them have great ideas for their characters which are just cruised past without exploring their depths and meaning.Thus we are left with a film which has too much to offer for its own good. For it sacrifices its characters and glosses past them by the end of the film to hurriedly remind you with its credits sequences that the next one will be great.This is perhaps a notch above or two above the last MCU release, Black Widow. Unlike that lazy, uninspired snoozefest, Eternals did aim for a lot, however was very unsuccessful in delivering on most of the fronts. A lot could have been better but I guess it isn't the worst.At the end Eternals is watchable and yet perhaps skippable, for its lenghty runtime and uninspiring characters don't warrant anything precious from our side.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Some of the characters made a lot of questionable choices, I am not sure what the writers were thinking. This made some characters not likeable at all. Also it must have been tough for the director to make choices in the cutting room because there were too many arcs and not all of them could be realised.

"6","/10","A good movie, but it's rarely a fun movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7793078/?ref_=tt_urv","dmansel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123353548/?ref_=tt_urv","23 January 2022","Due to the events of Avengers: Endgame, the snap that brought about the return of half the universe's population kick starts the emergence: the awakening of a new Celestial, the gods of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Eternals, an immortal race of beings created by the Celestials, unite to protect humanity from their longstanding foes, the Deviants.Directed by Chloe Zhao, Eternals is easily the most mature film the in MCU catalog. Intercourse in a comic book movie aside, the theme of sacrifice versus duty is the main sticking point of the story. The plot stumbles a bit under its own weight, and while Zhao is free of any narrative restraints (with no other movies to set up or feed into besides its own sequel), the exposition is at times muddled and slightly confusing. The population of Earth has been threatened multiple times, either to be subjugated by the likes of Loki or the Red Skull, wiped off the map by Ultron, or just reduced 50% by Thanos. Eternals, however, is the first time in an MCU movie the Earth itself is at risk as our heroes work to thwart the Deviants. The Celestials, powerful beings who created the universe, promote an endless cycle of creating new life through death and with that brings the central conflict of the movie, which I'll not spoil here.While the Avengers managed to mostly get standalone films to introduce them to the universe before assembling them in the 2012 blockbuster, Eternals is forced to do all of its character introductions and development in one film, which is difficult considering the source material is relatively unknown to the general audience. While it's unfortunate that some characters inevitably suffered for the development of others, the diverse cast of talented actors and actresses amassed makes for a nice reminder that heroes can come in all colors, ages, shapes, and sizes.Starring an eclectic cast of actors and actresses, our main focus is placed on Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. Chan, known for this being her second role in the MCU (her first being a small role in Captain Marvel), easily shoulders the weight of being the lead actress, and she rises to the challenge. Charming, beautiful, and empathetical towards humans, Chan's Sersi serves as the logical character for the audience to latch onto. Richard Madden, forever cemented as Robb Stark on HBO's A Game of Thrones, plays Ikaris, the most powerful Superman-like Eternal. While Sersi has a firm connection with the people of Earth, Ikaris is more emotionally detached, and that difference between the two of them plays throughout the film's runtime. The will-they-won't-they story is bolstered by the fact that Chan and Madden have great chemistry on screen together.Apart from them, the rest of the cast are more than up to the task of playing their near immortal characters. While Salma Hyek is intermittent throughout the film, her presence and impact reverberates throughout the rest of the characters and Hayek's performance lends the right amount of depth and weight needed for the role. In the film for a hair's breath of time, but still worthy of mentioning, is Harish Patel as Karun, Kingo's manager. Karun is the only human the audience sees in constant contact with the Eternals and thanks to Patel's charm and humor, the character serves as a reminder to the audience of what the team is fighting for.The Academy Award winning Chloe Zhao is fairly restrained here, having to work under the Marvel Studios regime of filmmaking, but there's still signs of brilliance in well composed shots and intriguing action sequences. While the technical work doesn't reach the levels of her previous film Nomadland, Eternals is still visually interesting. Cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel) brings a different eye to this movie than in his previous MCU collaborations. The color palette is more muted here, as if the more adult themes presented necessitated the banishment of bright, bombastic colors. The movie is aided by composer Ramin Djawadi's score, which soars at times, complimenting the emotional journey the principle cast embarks upon.Overall, Eternals' millennia-spanning ambition doesn't quite reach its grasp. With its more somber tone and moral complexity, it's a film that stands out like a sore thumb from the more bright and colorful MCU films we've seen to date. Solid performances from both Gemma Chan and Richard Madden anchors the movie, while Zhao's direction is steady and competent. While it takes a bit to get the story rolling, its 157 minute runtime could use a bit of judicious editing to present a slimmer, more lean film. When it boils to steam, it comes down to this: Eternals is a good movie, but it's rarely a fun movie. Eternals hits theaters November 5th.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But the general consensus for reviews on many aggregate websites are painfully misrepresent how good this film is. The special effects are exceptional, and Zhao's decision to film on-location gives the film a layer of authenticity that isn't found in a lot of Marvel films. The acting is very good, particularly Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. The cast has great chemistry, and is much more diverse than what is typical even now in the film industry, which I don't doubt is a factor in the film's surprisingly low ratings. The depiction a deaf character is well handled, as is Marvel's first on-screen queer relationship.That's not to say that there aren't significant issues with Eternals. Its very long, the second-longest Marvel film, behind Endgame, and the pacing does drag in places.Additionally, Eternals deals with a lot of comic book lore which can't really be left out of the film considering that most people watching this film won't have read the comic books. Eternals tends to dump a lot of lore in conversations which often feel rather forced, and for me, the way that the exposition was handles was by far my least favourite part about Eternals.Eternals is still worth a watch. It feels a lot less like any MCU film i've seen, which is interesting in itself, even if it's not what you look for in your entertainment. I might even say that at times it feels more like a DC film than anything Marvel has produced before.If you are, as I was, quite aware of the ways that Eternals falls short as a piece of cinema, it's still entertaining, visually stunning, and at times very moving, and it sets up some interesting concepts for the future of the MCU. Frankly, the fact that it's currently lower-rated than both the incredible hulk and Thor: The Dark World is ridiculous. It's orders of magnitude better than both those films, so don't let the mediocre rating dissuade you from giving Eternals a shot.Even if it's not the best film i've ever seen, it's still solid entertainment.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The mythology and story stand a chance of being legitimately interesting, and the implications of the central dilemma the film sets up are kind of frightening and overwhelming.So why isn't this really good? It's tempting to blame the acting. On my most recent re-watching of a lot of the other MCU films, I was struck by the fact that often the most engaging scenes were not the action ones. Rather, the character drama is actually what I think sets those films apart and makes a lot of them good films in spite of their superficial bombast. In contrast, *none* of the personal drama is compelling, in spite of some serious attempts to pull at our heart strings. Seems natural to say that the cast simply failed at really selling this stuff. But with a cast this large, and a cast where we have some genuine talent like Barry Keoghan, does it seem likely that they'd *all* fail so badly? It's certainly possible. Maybe many of them were simply not right for their parts.Usually when this happens I tend to blame the writing, and I do think that is largely the problem here. We simply don't get enough time with these people to care about them. The other MCU films had a lot of time to set up the relationships that matter, and so the emotional stakes are generally higher. Here, we basically just met all these people.With regard to the action scenes, some of them are pretty impressive. The aesthetic of the Eternals' costume and weapon design is pretty neat, and there's an element of visual freshness here in both that design and some of the choreography. It's a shame that the dramatic glue in between those scenes really fails to hold the film together.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Eternals isn¬¥t like the comics (who cares) and not the worst MCU film but still towards the bottom. Basically Dune 2021 x what critics accuse MoS of being. Cut 25 minutes, loose the random remnants of MCU ""humor"" and the forced exposition, give the cast and Deviants more intriguing looks, give the Deviants more scenes where they aren¬¥t CGI rage monsters and there would have been something here. Neil Gainman failed to give this IP a hook in the 00s and the same goes for its creator Jack Kirby in the 80s so I¬¥ll continue waiting for a New Gods show or movie. Especially if Zack Snyder¬¥s take is used who has a similar approach to Chlo√© Zhao when it comes to Supergods. Zhao pulls her punches though, unlike him. Snyder¬¥s controversial vision found a mass audience in the end. I can¬¥t see that here and the Disney producers are already doing damage control in the press.The Eternals is almost a good movie.

They live side by side with the humans and hide from their identities. A tragedy befell them that forced them out into their true identities. This time, they must fight the ancient enemies of mankind, the Deviants.Eternals is one of the films that features 10 characters at once or presents the story of another group of superheroes after the Avengers. Bringing 10 characters at once is certainly a challenge for Marvel and Chloe Zhao to bring the story of each Eternals character. As a result, the 10 characters are able to be performed well and interestingly. Moreover, there is one character who was introduced to become a hero in the future of the Marvel universe. Eternals has a story plot that is carried in a complex and dense manner, yet remains neat in its execution. Stories are built with a slow tempo to give time and space in conveying and describing the conflict that is being built. The film is so dense in building stories and conflicts. Although the focus seems to be on the characters Sersi and Ikaris, all superheroes have good roles with stunning action from each character. It's a pity to see Gilgamesh and Ajak who have to die and have not shown their strength on a large scale. The existence of Deviants, who is one of the main enemies, also doesn't talk too much in this film so the impression of making Deviants a scapegoat is not significant.In addition to presenting the story of 10 good superheroes, Chloe Zhao also did not forget to provide good visuals in this film. The film appears so clear and feels calm. Shot good pictures and not much camera movement is distracting. The costume design also feels good and cool with colors that are not too bright but give a fierce feel. Featuring a cast lineup that looks cool and satisfying. It's unfortunate that this film features scenes that contain LGBT elements. It's quite unpleasant to look at.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

""Interesting"" is the keyword for the feature, which takes a long time to get emotional (unlike other Marvel Studios films), but impresses audiences in a calmer way by presenting the vast power of each of the group's members. Super heroes with a wonderful CGI that gives beauty to the film. But don't get confused, it would be unfair to say that Eternals is bad for its slower tone, something different from other films in the franchise. The story is intriguing, enigmatic and holds the viewer to the screen, but the fights full of mystical powers and magic take time to get relevance to the plot and, when they do, they don't show all the giant power that the group of Eternals possess. Regardless of how calm the film is, it's impossible to say that it's serious and dark like the DC Extender Universe features, as some critics have pointed out, as it has a few puns and a certain comedic tone, even if it sometimes comes out of the blue. Eternals is a beautiful film and it deals very well with the issue of diversity, especially with Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), an openly gay character, and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who is hearing impaired and wonderfully well produced, but can seem calm. Too much for Marvel Studios. Chlo√© Zhao did a beautiful job, something totally different from anything seen on the MCU, regardless of whether it's good or bad...","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Why would a race of eternal beings include one that is deaf? 7000 years of life experience and no super power to compensate for that? Why is an Indian character played by a Pakistani?

For me, some laugh out aloud moments.The reveal about the fate of the earth was also an interesting ScI-fi idea. The process of the creation of new life vs the preservation of those we love. Not a new sacrificial concept but it's worthy to see it fleshed out on this cosmic scale.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I know the duration takes too long and dull because the director clearly wanted to give each characters proper time to shine, and there's 10 main characters so pretty understandable. The storyline has high stakes but too dry and not thrilling enough.But on the good side, the conflict was very unusual, not MCU's story template, nobody's here really a hero or good guys but also the villains aren't truly villains. I don't know is it a good thing or not but none of the main characters are really stand out, everyone kind of equal. The cinematography was very beautiful, the action package was nice.

Because my English is not good. The text is expressed with translation software. The About movie expects too much and disappoints. The film has enough time to narrate but because the pace is too slow. It's basically impossible to describe each role in more detail. When the character chooses which side. The sudden blackening is too abrupt. Thena's character was described as strong but didn't see the expected play out. The picture of finally preventing success reminds me of the picture of Evangelion. The ending part will make people look forward to how the next episode will develop. Only the ending of the whole play is what makes people look forward to it! ? Of course I think the director wants to give the audience a different Marvel movie. However, the last film of the Gold Award director was very different from the Marvel theme. I was worried about whether the movie was too literary.

The pacing of this movie hurts the story and tone due to the fact it moves a mile a minute. Watching the film and looking at your timer you feel every 20-30 mins could have been a full episode, and you'll notice it on first play through. There's just so much to explore and Eternals moves at a pace to great for its own good.Cinematography was A1 and arguably the best the MCU has seen to date. Additionally, the whole cast nailed their roles, even the shorter ""personal"" scenes (expanding on development moments in a series).Overall, Eternals is a spectacle to view but one with flaws. I truly believe the film needed a 6 hour run time treatment through a series. Doing so would have create a stronger emotional bond to the characters while adding weight to important scenes that was not there due to lack of development.Really hope we see more from the eternals going forward because as a long time reader they have boundless potential!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, I just could not get into this movie. Maybe they tried too hard to character build, or too hard to show diversity. Dont get me wrong, I love that they tried to include everyone from each race, as well as having someone who is deaf, and they even a gay character. All of that effort I could appreciate, though those efforts seemed to fall a little flat by making the main character a stronger super hero who is white, as well as the goddess of war who also is white. Still overall not my issue with this movie as it was a decent attempt to include us all.My issues are with how boring the movie was and how much they overdid and drug out the boring parts. Also, all the glowing magical stuff which never bothered me before, finally also went too far. This movie was like the old really bad DC movies that tried too hard and fell flat. It totally missed the Marvel magic recipe for me. I did have to give it another try by seeing it twice, as I did doze off a few times my first visit. Seeing it twice was every worse and even more hokey then it was when I slept through parts of it. I'm guessing Marvel will make up for it with the next one, as we should not need 2 hours of getting to know everyone next time.The CG of course was pretty good, a bit too much magic and glowing hocus pocus. But it was OK and did have some excitement to it. Still, they tried too hard, I think. I actually started to feel sorry for marvel.Although disappointed in this movie, I still cant put my finger on all the things in this movie that bothered me. Too many to list maybe? As even the jokes were not quite the same and did not always have the perfect timing as in previous marvel movies. I feel like if Marvel continues down this road, the magic and secret recipe it once had will fade away and it will be DC, who will then be on top.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

They have forgotten how the ensemble introduction of the Fantastic Four bombed - twice. We cannot decide who to trust, who we want to succeed and who we should mourn when we are faced with so many choices with so little screen-time.Such an incredible pool of acting talent that could produce nothing deep with the Eternals. The very nature of being alive for thousands of years means losing the element of urgency, and apparently chemistry. We weren't able to identify with being eternal and the couple of humans we meet were so accepting (probably to save time) that they were also void of emotion and intensity.

This finally brings a breath of fresh air. At times, it even reminds me a little of the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. Of course they are very different movies, but both felt like a mature and thoughtful adventure that has ambition of being more than just a simple superhero recipe.Admittedly there are problems with pacing and character building. Thena being a particularly weak one for me, which may have been caused by my heightened expectations of Angelina Jolie's superhero debut.Right now, I think Marvel needs movies like this to move forward. Honestly, after the ultimate climax of End Game, can they really keep going with the old universe and same old formula? It has already started to get boring and way too bland. I didn't particularly enjoy Shangchi for this very reason. It was too familiar with only a thin layer of Asian skin and 'culture'.Overall, I think Eternals deserves to be seen and to be continued. It is only the first experiment. Hopefully future projects of similar scale and style will become more refined, and thus truly redefine the superhero genre.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's service is the delivery - the acting, editing, cinematography, CGI, direction sound etc. It's food is the story - a lot more straightforward, but it also needs atmosphere. This is the murkier zone where as viewers we care and become invested in the outcomes. Like a restaurant this zone of atmosphere is also dependent upon the delivery and the films food, its story.On paper, Eternals ticks these boxes - the actors do their stuff and the film is delivered extremely slickly. As an epic and classic heroes story - it should also work - but somehow just falls short of really creating the appropriate atmosphere - for me anyway - and I like these epic adventure tails, but this one felt a bit hollow and failed to get me really involved and invested.I suspect some of that has to do with the insistence to continually lighten things up with its joking throwaway one liners - that at times given what is going on are inappropriate and release too much pressure from the story and the gravity of the predicament that the movie is attempting to convey. But it's not entirely that - I think it's also partly because of the somewhat disjointed method of revealing the story - the edits and timeline cuts. There's also the classic aspect of 'show don't tell'. Eternals does a lot of telling, in fact it's a very dialogue driven movie - and for this reason won't really be enjoyed by kids (not the younger ones at least).I suspect that Eternals would greatly benefit from a Zak Snyder Justice League type recut.At the end of the day though, it's entertaining but doesn't quite 'zing' that last few percent to elevate it into great status - enjoyable nonetheless. Should have been an 8 or 9 - but I'm giving it a 7.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I judge this film accordingly.What we learn in this movie is clearly going to be important for the path forward within the MCU, so it needs to be watched. But watching it was a bit of a chore.The movie spends a looong time giving us the backstory to the Eternals role as they were placed on Earth 7000 years ago. A LOT. We're talking 45 minutes of flashback from thousands of years ago.But unfortunately, instead of coloring the characters, making them relatable, giving them personal goals and challenges and making us care whether or not they can overcome them, its all just visually stimulating history-channel material. When you don't feel for the characters, so much falls flat and becomes dialogue that simply becomes informative, and not compelling.The actions scenes are fun, and very well made. Several quite spectacular scenes occasionally redeems the watchability. But they are so far apart that it doesnt even come close to making me want to watch this again. And that becomes the case when the actions scenes are the only part worth re-watching, which itself is a bit sad.The movie kinda does the dual bad-guy thing, with one bad guy getting a very solid build up, and the other sort of on the sideline until the end. The actual interesting bad guy story arc (with a build up) is very abruptly finished off, while the other takes over. Im sorry, but this is just so unsatisfying, and I dont understand what the writers were thinking about here.I really wanted this movie to be great. Its story, as said, is something you need to know if you want to stay up to speed with the MCU, but with so much plain information-talking, backstory that feels mandatory to watch but does nothing for the build-up, and cool action scenes miles apart, I think this could become the first of all MCU movies that I will only watch once. It's not the worst of the lot (*cough* Iron Man 2), but it would still be the most painful to rewatch.I don't want to rate this out of frustration, so I give it a 6. A 6,5 perhaps, but that's not an option IMDB gives us.All in all, this movie is like a story told where the storyteller needs to explain a bunch of terms and backstory before he can actually tell it, and then failing to make all the pre-explanations feel worth the time it took to listen. But as said, all that information will surely be useful later; it just didnt do much to make this particular story very interesting.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had high expectations of this mostly because of chlo√© zhao and the trailer which showed simply the most stunning visuals a marvel movie has ever shown and to be honest i was genuinely blown away. The visuals obviously are stunning and so well done but the story as well is nicely thought out and interesting and the movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and surprised me. I also have to emphasize the connection to the general history the story depicts which is just so interesting to see. I literally only have good things to say so i might be biased but this in my opinion is so worth it folks and i genuinely enjoyed it from the first minute to the end. Keep in mind however that this obviously is quite different from most mcu films so if you go into this expecting you know blockbuster superhero stuff well you probably won't get that.","19 out of 38 found this helpful.

The VFX were average though not that bad. For those who can see the lobbies who fund and/or influence these movies, it must be apparent that there was more focus on being inclusive of 1) Some set of minorities and 2) Women. This is not problematic and earlier Marvel movies have done this very well: Meaning-that the being inclusive part did not spoil the plot not did unnecessary garbage get included under the name of being inclusive.However, Chloe Zhao the Chinese film maker either independently or under the influence of CCP or related lobbies, it seems, spent unnecessary time and effort in portraying a people of certain nation/race, who sent the CCP into a shock by bloodying China's face in a border skirmish, in poor light. Perhaps the film would have come out a little better if the focus was on the presentation of the film rather than racial stereo-typing.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

In fact I really liked it. The story and writing isn't great. But what makes this a really enjoyable movie, is the acting, the visual effects, and the fact it dives deeper into long Marvel comic book lore. What's even more surprising I feel about this movie are the actors. I'd figure people like Angelina Jolie or Selma Hayek would play the characters to get the main focus, but I like how this movie gives them more a supporting role. Which I think is a good move, since as great as Selma and Angelina are as leading ladies, they still manage to still be great as supporting characters. What I really liked (also) is nothing in this movie felt phoned in or like the actors where sleep walking through a performance. Some might call the performances ""dull"" or ""boring"" or just flat out ""awful"", however i don't see that, i see exactally what i was expecting from a movie, about cosmic aliens, who obviously don't have the same emotional range like everyone else. But when any of the actors have to just act with their body language or facial expersions, it feels really honest and powerful. Everyone is honest and gives plenty of subtle passion and reserved energy, which is the sign of a good actor. But as I stated, the writing in this film isn't great. A lot of it involves non-leaner story elements having to do with big revelation (the kind you see in game of thrones). Basically its broken into two different movies, one that's backstory, and the other has to do with the main story. But I understand why Marvel did this. As it sets up the eventual introduction of the X-Men and mutants into the MCU, since the Eternals are a major part to the back story of the mutants origins. All in all this movie is good. And I believe all the problems in this movie will be redeemed in a potential sequel, because clearly this movie establishes plenty of great potential.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Certainly the movie has a few flaws - sometimes with the special effects, sometimes with the acting of certain actor, sometimes with the dialog. - they are few and can easily be ignored. Still its far better than many other marvel movies. It has quite an intriguing storyline, some strong character building, a very nice emotional touch, also gravity. This could be better of course - but still i loved it and will be among my favorite marvel movies.Personally, I always feel adding unnecessary humor and jokes completely destroys the urgency of a situation - ultimately the movie. Movies like shang-chi, aquaman have great action sequence. But what they mostly lack is that i cannot 'feel' those movies. Completely losing oneself inside the story is what a movie should be. There are many marvel and dc (except snyder's) movies that i never watch more than once bcz they dont offer nothing but cgi and pointless jokes. Eternals tried to be much different in that aspect.And those who complaining about the runtime, when u're introducing 10 characters in a single movie - u should expect that would take time do it properly. And chloe jhao did it nicely. Loving and understanding the characters is what gives a movie a 'memory'.","30 out of 65 found this helpful.

I will say visually it is pretty nice but honestly nothing I haven't seen before. It's like mash up of all the past marvel movies. It felt like they just took the leftover ideas and visuals and costumes of everything from Dr. Strange to Black Panther to X-Men and tried to serve it as a 5 course meal in 2 hours and 37 mins.Half of the actors did a great job with what they were given but they couldn't make up for the other lifetime movie performances and super bad script. It all felt rushed and disjointed and the humor was trying way too hard to be like Dr. Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy but completely missed the mark because it's been done before and much better.I did appreciate the diversity and some of the symbolism but it was like being forced to take overly sugared cough syrup. The added gay family is also applauded. But yeah this feels like a shiny glossy regurgitation of great movies we have already seen and a waste of such great talent.Oh and Kit Harrington (of all people) saying I love you Sersi was too much.

They included elements related to a various cultures and nations to lure people into the cinemas, and it didn't work at all for the movie. The story is so incoherent that it just keep on switching from one direction to another.Especially scenes of Kumail Nanjiani are so laughable, I felt like I am watching a B grade inane comedy movie rather than a superhero movie. Sometimes these scenes were so cringeworthy and stupid, I just wanted to leave the theatre in the middle.Overall, I would rate this movie between 4-5 only because I like the spectacular sceneries and CGI in the film, the way Ikaris shoots pure laser beam from his eyes, and of course because of Angelina Jolie.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

A huge number of different characters and events taking place. However, cinema and the public demand epicness and grandiosity, and therefore trumps immediately come into play: the conversation about Celestials has been going on since the beginning of the second phase, but they really appeared to the world only now.

I've seen better CGI in movies made before 2010. Dialogues, character building and story structure is better in any Michael Bay movie but he at least compensates for it in action, suspense and epic scenes and shots.I have no idea about what message or ideology this movie was suppose to the audience consider. I've seen deeper social criticism in Michael and Webb ""are we the baddies"" comedy scene. Was this movie a comedy, adventure or sci fi? I don't know and frankly I don't care.Who were the characters? What was their purpose and drive? I don't know. I never connected to any character or got any interest in the story. This movie just moved from one McGuffin quest to another. I've seen better story structure in 80's video games.What bothered me the most was how much of a nothing this movie was. It was bad indeed but it wasn't bad enough for me to enjoy how bad it was. Everything was bad, don't get me wrong, but not epic bad so it's good like Cats or The Room. The movie failed to fail.Please Marvel, you have many good movies, please don't repeat anything like this ever again.

First, I found the backstory to be super intriguing, and it really captured my imagination. Second, the visuals are superbly done, and the fighting sequences deliver big. Last, 2-3 of the actors deliver really good performances and had interesting stories.The Bad:
First, the movie was too long. I felt like I was watching a gratuitous ""director's cut"" with a director that felt like every little boring scene just had to be included. This should have been 30 minutes shorter. Second, outside of 2-3 actors, the others were both poorly cast and delivered performances that annoyed me at times. Last, they followed way too many storylines. The movie loses focus and made me want to fast forward to get back to the main plot.I lay these issues at the Casting Crew, Director and Editor's feet. The Director should have made the actors do scenes properly and with higher quality acting. The editor should have cut WAY MORE out of the film. The Casters should have thought more about inter-character chemistry.6/10.

Eternals on the other hand tackles more vague themes that majority of the Marvel fanbase finds boring. Besides all that, the movie is actually well written and directed. Characters are original and actors have done a pretty neat job. Musical score is just okay I guess but it goes along well.

I usually do but the trailers just didn't sell me and the characters themselves I have no knowledge about it to care. Then the reviews came out and it was very negative. This was the final nail in the coffin for me. The premise is ""The Eternals, a race of immortal beings with superhuman powers who have secretly lived on Earth for thousands of years, reunite to battle the evil Deviants"". So are the reviews correct or is this movie actually better than the reception it was given?The most obvious praise is the visuals. MCU movies tend to be pretty dull looking for the most part. There are a few such as the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok where the visuals do have more impact. In Eternals, the visuals are gorgeous! A lot of the shots are incredibly vibrant and stunning. Even when it is just a shot of them standing around, it looks more picturesque than anything Marvel has done before. The CGI was also astonishingly good. The CGI of the Eternals power was great, the enemy Deviant design and CGI was great, plus the Celestials were amazing in scale and scope. Eternals also explores some interesting themes about humanity that I do like.There are also some really great action sequences in the film. The forest action sequence is memorable as it has a cool Superman-like fight scene. The final fight is also quite great too with how the abilities of the Eternals are utilised. Special praise to how they handle the Eternals, Markari, super speed power as they for once don't use slow-mo which makes it look more unique. I also think the actors do a great job. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are both a joy to watch when on-screen while getting some genuine laughs from me. Richard Madden is cool yet menacing. Lauren Ridloff despite being deaf, easily convey the right emotion for the scene. Barry Keoghan is creepy yet charming and Don Lee gives a real lovable performance.However, there was just something off about the main lead Gemma Chan who has the most screen time. Her performance was just very wooden and dull most of the time. She has been in the MCU before in Captain Marvel (2019) and I remember her standing out a lot. So it was just kind of odd how boring her performance was in here. Although, the major reason for this could be how her character, Sersi, is written. Every other Eternal has a clear personality, views, motives and problems. Sersi just seems to love humans and has some love problems that feel very inconsequential for the most part. She is a very boring main character with the other Eternals being way more interesting than her.On that note, this movie has too much going on. Each of the Eternals has its own problems that get brought up but immediately brushed over in a matter of seconds. For example, Phastos abandons humanity after seeing what they did with the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima, but the scene after he is completely over that! Every Eternal has an issue that could have been a whole plotline in itself that would've been more interesting than the actual plot. There is also a main deviant that starts to grow stronger, knowledgeable and more intelligent, which was a very intriguing idea. Unfortunately, the deviant is completely wasted and ends up having little to no impact on the main story whatsoever. Just there so the Eternals could have someone to punch. They could've removed this intelligent deviant and the story would still be the exact same. What a waste...Additionally, the pacing is quite bad. There is a lot of moments throughout where the movie just slows down considerably to the point that it can feel dull. This isn't helped by the fact that this movie feels like an eternity. It is 2 hours 30 minutes but it could be cut down by 15-20 minutes and still convey the same plot. There is also an incredible amount of exposition and it can almost feel like you are getting bombarded with way too much information. Character development is also rushed. Characters will go from feeling one way about something and completely do a 180 on it in a couple of minutes. It doesn't feel natural or believable. Furthermore, there are too many characters introduced and they don't get explored or enough screen time to really resonate with any of them.Overall, the reviews make Eternals out to be the worst MCU movie. I disagree with that as there are definitely way worst MCU movies than this. Nevertheless, it does feel like the movie crammed way too many ideas into it and did not utilize the ideas properly. Eternals (2021) could have been something amazing and unique in the MCU. Sadly the final product just ends up feeling like a complete waste of its potential. There is some genuinely great stuff in it but I do feel like the Eternals might be better suited to a Disney+ series than a movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Half of the characters are bland and forgettable, the scenery for the most part is bland and forgettable (most of them due to the fact that the director insisted on using natural lighting, especially in the jungle scene).The movie had some very good ideas that were wasted on this mediocre plot which needed more time to develop.Another good idea bad execution situation here. They could have made a better movie with a better plot with this story they had.The lore is good, but how they explain it and the way it unravels and how the twists and turns happen could've been executed way better. The lore is really interesting and for a 2 hours and 37 minute movie, I wanted it to go deeper into the lore, but it was disappointing in this department.As for the characters, I don't really care for any of them, especially and obviously the ones we saw less of. Even after watching them for 2:30 hours, I still have no emotional attachment to any of them, which is a 180 from other MCU movies, especially from Guardians of the Galaxy, which I don't think I need to explain much on why and where these two movies are similar to each other.James Gunn did what Chlo√© Zhao couldn't; he made a movie about a group of character that 98% of us didn't know anything about and made them relatable and engaging, made the movie's plot and storytelling coherent and not convoluted and gave us a fun movie with great rewatchability value.The glaring problems with Eternals are;
And I don't think any of the actors did a bad job, it's mostly the writing and the characterization that makes them bland and uninteresting.Now things that I liked, I like most of the actions, especially with Ikaris and Makkari.It's amazing how Marvel can do better Superman and Flash fight scenes than DC. Makkari is what I want to see in a Flash movie.I really liked the music Ramin Djawadi did, I thought it was great and memorable. It's the most memorable thing about this movie.I also liked the lore and the story as a whole, but as I've said, the plot was mediocre and they wasted a big potential with the lore.I heard someone say that when you watch the movie, you realize that Eternals didn't need a series to dedicate an episode to each of the characters, and after watching the movie I... kinda agree?But at the same time, when I think about it, the characterization and especially the plot and story needed more time.This is another mistake from Feige's part. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would've worked better as a movie (with a better plot and writers of course) and Eternals should've been a series instead.Because they tried to put so much in this movie that contributed to its failure. Why cram all these lore and story into a 2:37 hour movie and make a 4 and half a hour show about TFATWS with a simple story?Also, the lore is kinda similar to Mass Effect's, but Mass Effect did it better. It's kinda unfair to compare a 2:30 hour movie to like a 50 hour game, but that's the point exactly.In conclusion, it was way better than I expected it to be, based on the ratings and the reviews, but it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent movie with relatable and memorable characters like GOTG did, and it's very long and mostly boring and bland, but I'm still interested to see in what direction and in relation to MCU they take the story and its characters next.I was gonna talk about more stuff but I'm struggling to remember what they were because I already forgot about most of the movie lmao, so there's that too.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have only watched it now to catch up with the MCU because I couldn't think of anything else. Overall, the movie is just average, nothing sticks and neither is there a wow moment, and mind you it has a run time of 2+ hours. It felt like one of those movies where too many characters are crammed together and none of their arcs are truly explored. The fight scenes didn't seem that marvelous, the constant flashbacks were underwhelming, and Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were definitely underused. At the end of the movie, I thought there'd be something more because it didn't feel like an ending, there was no climax but they decided to leave it like that.Watching Jon Snow (Kit Harington) call Gemma Chan 'Sersi' did not work for me on so many levels.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No longer colorful like other MCU movies, no longer simple and entertaining, Chloe Zhao's Eternals (2021) brings a whole new breath to the MCU.Eternals (2021) brings many powerful and immortal characters but all that the characters show is too faint compared to the length of the film. The fact that Chloe Zhao brings fates, situations or circumstances to the character can completely contradict the audience, creating uncomfortable feelings. 2h36m is quite a long time compared to a movie that can be said to be quite flat, if Marvel decides to bring a tv series, it will be a lot more suitable.With a pretty good plot, but what Chloe Zhao shows it is to create too many conflicts between the characters, making the film become ""more dialogue"" and less ""superhero"". That is why the Eternals performed quite superficially, with few highlights, but the character Makkari is really a bright spot of the film, although there is not much acting space, but each frame that appears this character provide an enjoyable and beautiful experience.If you like Chloe Zhao and the movies she made, you'll have a little interest in Eternals (2021). Limiting CGI as much as possible, Chloe Zhao brings to the MCU the visual art that no previous MCU film can do, which is the immense scenery of nature and people immersing in it. The authenticity, rustic in those footage is something you won't be able to find in previous MCU movies. Unlike the backgrounds full of CGI buildings, Eternals makes a huge difference, but that's why there are quite a few movie scenes that are out of tune when trying to harmonize between the actual scene and the CGI. The lighting in the movie is also very well optimized compared to previous MCU movies, perhaps partly because of the actual use of light, so many different segments and lights are shown very wellEternals is not a bad movie but it's not too good for everyone to enjoy, maybe many people don't like it now but maybe later the movie can win the hearts of viewers. Like a ticking time bomb, Eternals (2021) didn't reach the audience's satisfaction, but it was definitely a premise for the MCU's Eternals to explode later.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I findthis movie, good not bad not good it is okay. Long time, ago the Eternals comming to the earth and with one order, to defence the humanity from the divians. We see all eternals to help the humans and the interessing question is all eternals do all of them really believe in their task or is there someone who doubts it or someone is against it from the start. Do all Eternals pursue the same goals or does someone betray them and what is the real goal of the Divians and those where they send to earth with the mission to protect the people.Conclusion:
I find this sad on the first so negativty and Reviews i find this not fair and when i see the review are done from eternals i can't belive this. I don't understand why find the people this movie not good. You should convince yourself of the film. The negative reviews diminish the director's great work and wouldn't do her justice, of course it's a matter of taste, but I don't know how to tear such a film apart. If you see this film as a stand-alone film rather than as a whole of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film is good. Of course you can't compare it to Avengers Guardians of the Galaxy and yes it's true it's still a Marvel movie. I think you should give the movie a chance because we're doing something completely new here but I think we have deep characters where I find what is rare for a Marvel movie. We just get something completely new and I'm personally happy to see Angelina Jolie again in a big role. Of course, the film also has its weaknesses, it's a shame that not all actors at Eternals would have had more screen time because the cast is very well selected. You should stay seated until the end, which gives you an insight into the next film and how things will continue at Eternals. I have to admit that I haven't read the comics, that's why I'm not involved in the subject matter and only reflect how I saw the filmMy review of EternalsIn genre 7.5 / 10
For moviegoers: 7.0 / 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, it's far from the best. Unfortunately, the beautiful cinematography doesn't compensate for the one-dimensional characters, monotone acting, and the numerous plot holes. The movie lacked genuine emotion and the laughs felt ham-fisted into the narrative. One can't help wondering if the movie's producers were more concerned with scoring points for representation (and in that respect, the movie scores high indeed) than with telling a compelling story. The problems with the movie may have started with the inexperienced screenwriters, Patrick Burleigh (whose previous credits include Peter Rabbit 2 and the TV movie, It Was a Pug Day) and Ryan Firpo (who's never written a screenplay for a movie before Eternals). Considering how much was spent on making Eternals (some estimates are as high as $200 million), it's baffling why Marvel hired such unseasoned writers.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I saw the movie opening weekend and I thought it wasn't too bad. The only thing that kept bringing the movie down was that it had 10 characters. The movie kept trying to do so many things and connect us with each character that it never really did any of them great. The graphics and fight scenes were really cool and the weight of the characters in the MCU was pretty well explained and cool. It's also funny how every time Disney has a new marvel character movie like this one they have to explain why they weren't part of the fight for Thanos like they did with Captain Marvel.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"5","/10","It felt like a summarized version of a TV series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7520576/?ref_=tt_urv","centerd","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur142601222/?ref_=tt_urv","6 November 2021","This movie has two main challenges that it needs to overcome: introducing a brand new cast of main characters and setting them within the context of the MCU's Post-Endgame era. The last MCU movie that had to deal with similar challenges was Guardians of The Galaxy. However, while GOTG only had to introduce 5 main characters, The Eternals has to introduce 6-10 (depending on how many of the Eternals you consider to be part of the central team). Moreover, while GOTG could avoid most of the existing MCU context (post Avengers 1) because its setting was in deep space, The Eternals takes place on Earth and must address the recent MCU events. Overcoming these two challenges in a satisfying way for the viewers is incredibly difficult, so I have some sympathy for director Chloe Zhao for how lackluster this movie felt. What annoys me is that The Eternals wants to do so much more while already having a pretty full plate.The first half felt like a collection of key scenes taken from a 10-episodes TV series. A TV episode can build a connected and complete mini-story in 45-60 minutes on 1 or 2 characters and their relationships with the world around them. This allows a TV show to flesh out more, if not all, of its main characters. A movie does not have such luxury, so the typical solution is to focus on only a few characters and leave the rest with some surface-level development. But this movie isn't willing to sacrifice, choosing instead to give each Eternal a personal conflict to overcome. This results in none of the characters having enough screentime to properly go through their arc and allowing viewers to be invested in them. Like watching only the introductions and highlights of a TV show, you may find the scenes interesting, but they don't deliver any major impacts. Combining this with the movie's frequent switching between past and present and you get a jarring, frustrating, and eventually boring experience. The second half does have some interesting revelations and resolutions, but by that point I'm only watching to see how the MCU will be expanded and not to see how the characters can overcome adversities anymore.I'm kinda sad about how this movie turns out, as I had hope that it wasn't as bad as critics have said. And to be fair, the movie tries to tackle many interesting ideas: dementia, sacrifice some for the sake of many, duty vs. Love, allowing people to make their own choices vs. Living their lives for them, and more. But it got too ambitious while disregarding its limitations and, like Icarus, fell into the ground. So in this one case, I agree with the critics--this movie is a 5 for me.On a side note, this movie has the best visual effects out of all MCU movies. From the technogies of the Eternals to the appearance of the Celestials, it all looks incredible and outer-worldly. With the MCU expanding to the realms of cosmic entities and the multiverse, I look forward to what spectaculars are awaiting (looking at you, Dr. Strange).","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie checked just about all the wrong boxes for me.I'm a long-time fan of Jack Kirby and am quite familiar with his source material. His solo writing was as awful as his art was spectacular (that's precisely why his collaborations with Stan Lee writing were far more successful,) but there was no reason to translate such wooden, inept dialogue to the screen. There was zero chemistry among the meticulously diverse cast, though, so perhaps that's also to blame.About the only thing I liked was the depiction of the Celestials, although they were almost entirely wasted in this lackluster film.

I've seen all of them more than once, some of them a bunch of times, and I can't imagine sitting through this one again. It took me 3 and 1/2 hours to get through it because I kept getting up out of sheer boredom to start the dishwasher, let the dog out, watch some paint dry, all of which was more interesting than most of this movie.It's difficult to enumerate the problems with The Eternals because there are so many. With the exception of special effects it fails on every level. Right from the start we are dropped into a pointless flashback structure, which starts in the middle of things. Beginning in medias res has worked in other movies (Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best examples), but here, instead of creating a sense of mystery or suspense, it is just confusing and tedious. We're dumped into the middle of fight sequences with characters we don't know and with whom we've established no connection. Even the humor in the first part of the movie falls flat because the movie hasn't earned those laughs. So much of the humor in the MCU is rooted in character development, and there is literally none of that for the first half of the movie, and precious little for the duration.We are subjected to boring romantic subplots involving characters we don't care about, and soulless melodrama between same. There have been a couple of similar missteps, most notably in Age of Ultron, but the MCU has never simply given itself over to this kind of tedium. (I can't help but use tedium/tedious repeatedly. It's one of the defining characteristics of this flick.)Even most of the action sequences are tedious. I know some people think the action sequences in some MCU movies go on too long, but I have never found them simply boring until now.Fittingly, the score is also uninteresting, and with a terrible electric guitar component that just does not fit.Following from the ineffectual flashback organization, the plot is convoluted and overblown, with tepid moments of explanatory exposition, and many unearned moments of ""high emotion.""Incredibly, for the first time I can remember there is actually MCU miscasting (Angelina Jolie - I have no problem with her but she doesn't belong in this movie), bland casting (Kit Harington? Snooze. Harry freaking Styles? GMAFB), and even the casting of someone who does not appear to be a particularly good actor (sorry, Lia McHugh - maybe you were just poorly directed and had lame dialogue to work with).Heck, even the mid-credit and end-credit sequences left me cold, thinking, ""Blech. 'Eternals will return...' Who cares?"" I've never left an MCU flick feeling like I do not want to see a sequel to this movie.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yes, considering that the events of this movie takes place after everything that has been released up until now (this includes of the Loki series, Shang-Chi, Spiderman NWH, Hawkeye series to name just the recent ones).So on one side Marvel is still laying down the ground works for the new characters, as well as the Multiverse (which has a huge impact on the MCU as whole), and on the other side thew decided to throw in 1 movie about the Gods of the MCU (which has different huge impact on the scale of things).Their existence is also very poorly explained.This should have been a series and plan it when the more cosmic stories play a more prominent role in the MCU.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A very long-awaited film from the Marvel superhero movie series. Motion picture quality in itself is a mass of pressing problems and solutions. There are feelings, emotions, good directing, excellent specials. Every moment of the film is breathtaking in its own way. Unexpected plot and twist. While watching, I could not predict the possible action and ending of the picture. Each of the heroes of the protest.I love all the films from Marvel, which have been reviewed a large number of times and several times. Another novelty is also impossible.Most of all I liked Angelina Jolie, my favorite actress, I was waiting for her appearance on the screen. She just played her part perfectly. As always on top. What do you want to say. The plot is felt somewhere in the middle, this is for me personally. The special effects are awesome. Inspection is just top notch. I personally liked the movie very much. No wonder I went to him and returned time. The finale was not unequivocal, I think we are waiting for the continuation. I give this film a good feedback at 9 departure!

Some of these new Marvel movies are trying to be too much hollywood too serious, why so serious? I wanted Deadpool to show up and end this part of the Marvel Universe.

A decent setup for the future and a commendable introduction of the Celestials, Deviants and the Eternals to the MCU.Far from the worst the MCU has to offer but not top10 material either.

What I met was a way too long, way too poorly paced, and way too lacking in a lot of aspects. I felt like Eternals was a movie that wanted to be everything at once. It was an origin movie, a setup movie for the future of MCU, and an ensemble movie. In my opinion, it failed in every aspect simply because it tried to be everything at once.I had zero emotion invested in them as characters cause nobody had time to grow and connect with the audience, the movie failed in pacing cause it needed to explain way too much. The CGI was pretty and the first act of the movie is the strongest.The last 30 minutes of this movie is around the poorest MCU have made.I will see it again, in case I missed something but if you are a marvel fan then of cause you want to see it, I don't know who else would like this.It tries to answer some philosophical questions and I like that MCU wants to try this, but it does it half-hearted. It felt like it wanted to be something different and yet still felt into existing tropes.Well, it's pretty, a few good jokes and some decent action. Visual it should be viewed in the cinema, but as a film, you could rather watch it at home and drink every time the Eternals line up in a straight line - you are gonna get drunk.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

There's zero character development, the chemistry between the characters is a joke, the story itself is lost, and again, 2 and a half hours of diversity.I gave it 2 stars because of some of the casted actors (and yes actresses for all woke people,) in general and some of the action.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

The movie is better than the what the critics made it out to be. It is a more somber story for sure. That would be off putting for usual MCU fans for sure. The DC references caught me off guard. Hence the title of my review. Not blatant attacks on DC like in Deadpool 2 but more subtle references. More like an homage? Very weird. The visuals are great however the movie suffers due to length and the chemistry within the actors. The chemistry is not great.

"4","/10","IS THIS A ""MARVEL STUDIOUS"" FILM????!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7525107/?ref_=tt_urv","Aziz24","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur105044330/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2021","Eternals (2021) absolutely failed in presenting and introducing this beautiful story and characters/superheroes of Eternals in a way that would be entertaining and enjoyable to not just the MCU fans but to everyone. There is not one person to blame because the film is bad in nearly every aspect. Like, the editing, the music score, and surprisingly the acting which is shocking when you look at the cast and big names that the film has.There are many other ways to introduce and tell the story of the film that are not used well and the film doesn't take advantage of the beautiful story that Eternals have, because Eternals with its many characters/superheroes and the cast chosen to portray these superheroes have a unique and entraining story that can entrain anyone and everyone. So, why ruin such a beautiful story like that? Why not take advantage of these sources and apply them well to the film to present an entertaining film?.There is no way the script and dialogues are written by an academy award winner. They are very ""cringe"", cheap, and cheezy. The film is full of long, unorganized, unnecessary, and meaningful pusses and silences. The opening scene Is very bad and no film would want to start off the way Eternals does.The story and plot of Eternals (2021) is told in a way that would cause confusion and chaos to audience members and to the film itself by jumping right back and forth in time and it does that many times and in a way that would make you wonder what year and where are we now in the story/plot?.The acting is (surprisingly) very bad. An actor/actress should always deliver a realistic performance in which the audience doesn't feel like they are watching someone who is ""acting"". Every performance that I have seen in this film made me feel like I was watching someone who is trying to put on some fake facial expressions to play the role of their character. When a character was trying to deliver or provoke a specific emotion/feeling in the heart of audience members, they failed, because of the bad acting and portrayal. It's very shocking because there are names like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, and Richard Madden. There is only one actor who shocked me with their performance and acting that seemed more than real. They portrayed their character more than well and were able to deliver to the audience what and who this character really is and that actor is Barry Keoghan as Druig. Druig is such a mean, tough, (sometimes) cocky character that likes to make and follow his own roles. Barry Keoghan was able to play that role very well. You can see it in his facial expressions, voice tone, and body language. I don't know how the film would've been without him.I have spotted many editing mistakes that are very noticeable. For instance, in a scene where an earthquake is happening, you can tell that not every prop in the set design is moving/falling down, some were still. How can a prob be holding still and not moving at all when there is a strong earthquake that was caused because of the arrival of creates in the size of a truck?. How is that even possible or realistic?Or In one scene when a character is holding something in their hands, in the next shot, it is not there anymore.In addition, the transitions between scenes are the worst that I have seen in any film before. They are so cheap and weirdly made in a way that seems like there Is zero effort put into it. For instance, if a character is walking to enter a building, the scene transitions and does a jump cut into the character being inside the building like some kind of magic occurred. The jump cuts/transitions are also being done in such cheap and very bad way.The music is very usual. Nothing new is presented. This is weird because I thought ""Eternals"" would have their own/signature theme music the same way Iron Man or Spiderman has one. In which when you hear it you'll be able to reignite it as the theme music of ""Eternals"". Or maybe there is one but I haven't heard it. But, even if there is and the fact that is it not noticeable, means that the music department failed.The runtime is 2h 35m. This movie should've been at least 1h 50m. It's way more than enough and can easily be told in that runtime as the story is pretty simple and straightforward. In addition, the film has way too many scenes that literally mean and add nothing. It also has way too much comedy in it and in a way that would make you feel like you are watching a superhero/""comedy"" film instead of a serious superhero film. Marvel films always use comedy in every film, But it is being used way too much in Eternals (2021).My rating is: 4/10
Watched: in theatre.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Night Shyamalan; after watching a trailer you are excited and count days for the release but then you start watching a movie you realize that fresh lasagne is actually frozen and just been microwaved. If you feel at that moment like chef Gordon Ramsay in Kitchen Nightmares, it is totally and absolutely okay because you thought you would be served delicious cuisine in a high end restaurant, but sadly it is not even the level of fast food.I am not an expert in comics and do not know how ""Eternals"" (2021) match their original characters but this movie is not even reaching the level of ""Spider-Man"" (2002). If Chlo√© Zhao planned to surprise everyone by computer effects, stunt tricks, and diverse / multicultural cast, sorry but that was not the main point. The main point was to not fail and made movie at least somewhere close to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), make an interesting plot with some twists (yes, scenario should be a bit better, or should I say complicated than in ""The Expendables"" (2010) or ""Death Race"" (2008). P. S: please no offense, but it is not ""The Courier"" (2020) level of scenario.), and introduce ""Eternals"" (who are they? I still don't understand.)Overall, the movie has a good cast, nice graphics, and some ""strong"" scenes. Some scenes I would even describe way too ""strong"" for the youth generation. However, maybe it is a new approach (""hook"") from Marvel Studios; ""Black Widow"" (2021) had some really nasty and offensive scenes, so ""Eternals"" (2021) are kind of holding their temper in some frames. Anyway, the movie was okay, not good, and not brilliant. If you watch it 1st time you will feel ""butthurt"" and will be bored but 2nd time you will probably say, ""it's not so bad"", and then eventually after 3rd time seeing it you will end up with, ""It's a ""lovely"" movie, but enough is enough.""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Comics have played an integral part of my life growing up with the likes of Spiderman, The Avengers and Doctor Strange among too many more to list, and I remember back in the 80's and 90's, studio attempts at making poor films like Spiderman and Captain America. I also remember being so excited when I had the chance to watch them, but also disappointed they didn't live up to the imaginative creativity of the original comic books. How could they?The lack of technology, cgi, special effects and budget constraints (back then, no one wanted to see superhero films). With that, we were satisfied with what we got, because we knew it was the best we could get for the time.Fast forward a couple of decades and we now expect much more. We have been spoiled with amazing adaptations of comics we loved in our youth, and they are brought to life on screen with the same creativity and passion we loved them for. The Avengers saga, Spiderman films, Thor, Ant Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Captain Marvel, to name a few, all living up to expectations and sometimes exceeding them.Then there is the Eternals. What feels like a cash grab riding on the coattails of Marvels success. A CGI extravaganza that pushes the 2 and half hour limit, but could have been shorter or longer (depending on who was making it). In the hands of Chloe Zhao, it feels like it was falling through her fingers. Don't get me wrong, technically the film looks good. But the film feels forced at times and hollow at others. The characters, although well defined are boring and waning in their own existence. The potential was there. I liked some of what I saw, but I left the cinema feeling annoyed, unloved, taken for a ride. I expected more. And I have a right to expect more because I have seen what Marvel films bring to the table, and I am familiar with the feeling and emotion I get from those other films, that take care and show love for the material.If the Eternals come back for another film, I don't know if I'd care for it. It would require a whole new direction for me to be interested to go back for another foray.","14 out of 36 found this helpful.

The core story is pretty simple, but there are so many unnecessary details and events that the credits were appreciated very much: at last it was over and we could go. And yes, despite the movie is about universal events, humanity barely noticed anything. Just noted that humongous cadaver sticking out of water--meh, nothing big here, folks, now back to ""America's got talent"".I don't recognize Marvel. Their movies used to be so light and simple, and yet very entertaining. But ""Eternals"" looks like it was made by a completely different studio. It doesn't even feel like a part of Marvel Universe. Too heavy, too dramatic. The jokes are so rare, that it made them too precious, but too weak to save the whole thing.I can't say I didn't like the movie. But it's not Marvel I love. It's like I got back to the X-Men era, but now they are not mutants, but eternals. I wasn't amazed, unfortunately, though I liked the cast.And... Stark, Nat, Cap--they're gone (as Banner and Barton, I suppose), and their places are still vacant as for me.

Amazing that after 7,000 years the main protagonists' chemistry is non-existant, and her current human one (so obviously chosen cause he looks like Icarus) is no better. All the flashbacks with some of the Eternals, and the whole Bollywood stardom for the Indian Eternal helps none of the present or past stories. The whole ""let's all find the others and fight the bad guy"" reminded me so much of the recent Justice League movie. You get these heroes together, with different powers (actually these DC and Marvel heroes have similar powers) they all battle the bad guys......and SO WHAT?If interested in stories involving immortals or eternals, checkout the short lived but excellent NY Detective TV shows: New Amsterdam, or Forever. Both have extremely handsome and talented actors and both explore issues around immortality. Both series got way better reviews at half the price of this boring Marvel movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Is it long? It isn't though at all exhausting in my opinion. It is as long as it needs to be in order to explain what is happening. The eternals are a new part of the marvel universe, in movies at least, and therefore it needs those two and a half hours to make you understand what the eternals actually are.In addition, what was also really good about the movie is the visual effects being marvel but also the fight scenes( not as good as Shang Chi though) and the acting which has a significant role ,as far as i am concerned, in maintaining the audience' s attention throughout all of the movie. Furthermore, the comedy in the movie helps humanise the characters and makes them more relatable.I hope more films like this will come from marvel in the future to expand the MCU.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

We spend far too much time on their relationship, which feels like it slows down the entire movie, and virtually no time on the relationship they all have with each other as a group.This makes it hard establish their personalities, how they feel about one another, how they work together and how they handle splitting up.Ultimately all that means is that most of the emotional beats with these character simply don't hit, which isn't the most awful thing in the world but if you want a excellent movie we need to feel all of the characters all the way through.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Know what a title should stand for and plan accordingly rather than copy and pasting the script and the cringe Hollywood humour designed for every superhero movie.

If you were to skip this you wouldn't be missing much.

The methods in which the characters were introduced, how their conflicts and differences in ideologies were displayed, the storyline overall, were elaborated in a very natural way, nothing was forced. This paves the way for the audience to really invest in the storyline and the characters as each was given the chance to stand out. The film was also visually striking. The cinematography was spot on and the battles scenes were both gorgeous to look at and fun and exciting, as expected from an MCU film. Overall, it's heaven sent to have Chloe Zhao join the MCU universe. The Eternals is something different which is absolutely a welcome sight.

It's pretty solidly okay. It has some really weird decisions (using American Sign Language in 5000 BCE, for example), but is still worlds better than T:DW or AM&TWEternals would have clearly been better suited for a long-form medium like a tv series; much is skipped to streamline the story to a lofty near-three hours. Inconsequential details such as the name of the main antagonist deviant are omitted in favor of the MCU's first sex scene-one that is wholly unneeded to frame the depth of the relationship between the characters involved.

I see a lot of reviews and people complianing about the length and pace. It takes a slower pace and a long time to build up, but for those like me who prefer build-up to constant action, it's a great watch. Don't go in expecting to be constantly engaged in the action or flashy visuals, this isn't a light-hearted or ""fun"" movie in comparison to other Marvel films.It's not perfect, as there are some plot choices that I think could be done without, and the main couple stuggles to have a convincing chemistry, but overall the characters were fine. You will find yourself adoring the side characters much more than those who are the main focus, though! There's great representation and I found myself really loving the cast, even if it took a while for me to get a feel for them. I liked the plot and it did well at capturing the sort of cosmic terror the major threat in this film brought.The overall concept is interesting and the film is very visually appealing. It takes on a more alien or space-like vibe, with locations from ancient civilizations to modern day on earth as the backdrop. I loved the variety of locations, though if I had to nitpick, I really *really* dislike the ""superhero"" costumes. The thick material looks hard and clunky on the actors. Everything else was wonderful, though.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also this movie seriously lacks an interesting villain. 6/10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Right?! His brother is Prince Star Fox/Fire or whatever his name is. Also an Eternal. Thanos' main objective was to reduce the population of the universe. He kept saying it was about food and resources when he spoke to others but WHAT IF he knew of Arishem's plans, just like Ajak, and decided he would end the Celestials for some reason? Or control them? Or change their impact on the universe or whatever?Don't get me wrong, I feel like the screenplay was really lacking unfortunately. But if we know Marvel we know this movie was made for a reason. I think that was the reason. That and Phastos made Shang Chi's 10 rings lol.

This required a lot of exposition, not just because they aren't mainstream, but because there are so many characters in this film. It bogs down the movie.Fanboys and Fangirls who enjoy films like Fast and Furious, Transformers and the like will probably give this high marks. That is their right.However, professional reviewers and connoisseurs of sci fi/comic treatments will give this a solid C or C-.On to the next MCU film...Spider-Man No Way Home, which will hopefully be as entertaining as the first two Tom Holland spidey flicks.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Insanely long movie and minor scenes. It is clear that the director was shooting, to whom heartfelt dramas and scenes of walking by the hand are much more important than a fantastic action (question: why would such a director be trusted to shoot a fantastic blockbuster? Maybe he should do his own thing-shooting soap melodramas with sobbing and moaning of the main characters in each other's arms?)2. The most strikingly terrible thing is the final scenario.Just imagine that, according to the scenario, robots ""Eternal"", designed to protect the celestials (creators of life in the universe), kill such a celestial.

10 Eternals send to Earth 7000 years ago to fight the evil preventing human civilization from flourishing (I watched this last night I think I remember maybe 5 names) and that's part of the problem.We are introduced to the Eternals they day they land and have several cut scenes showing the battles won ( with very little to no character backstory or development) then it just cuts to modern day we learn almost nothing about them why they choose the path they did when they go separate ways..very wishy washy then all of a sudden boom.bad guy...fights internally (with the family) win war against bad guy end credit scenes..
Nothing wrong with the casting the quality of acting even the plot really it's just you can't get invested in a character without knowing them.Maybe make it a 3hr film spend time getting to knwlow them first... Or as a friend suggested so brilliantly when I was trying to think of how they could fit this all in without making it 3hrs long......should have been a series instead! Nailed it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It branches out from the same old characters in Avengers and co., it provides diversity that fits well and makes sense, and it provides a detailed and cool back story to the broader Marvel Universe. And it looked a million bucks... sumptuous colours, great fight scenes, Kumail Nanjiani steals the show...yada yada yada.But it did provide a few bits that niggled.(1) The characters. The first three you'll meet are Superman, The Flash and Wonder Woman. I mean, that's not their names, they are Ikarus, Sersi and Thena but that's the power sets and templates they've pinched from DC. Kinda generic and unadventurous, but that's not the movie's fault, that's Marvel.(2) It's overlong. At 2 hours 36 in a darkened cinema wearing a mask that forces you to rebreath the same carbon dioxide you just breathed out, it's a perfect storm for an unintentional snooze. There was a LOT of padding... a hell of a lot... which, edited better, would have made for a tighter film.(3) Blatant and repetitive cross promotion. This, in my opinion, is the biggest and most common flaw to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. Characters are inserted into storylines with the most tenuous connection and very little need to the narrative, only to promote the next Marvel release. It takes you, the viewer, out of the story, destroys the suspension of disbelief and reminds you that these are just products we are being sold. Christopher Nolan didn't do it in the Batman films, it didn't happen in the Joker movie, so it IS possible to stick to the art and the story in telling a super-hero yarn, without resorting to being a carney telling people to ""step right up"" for our next show. I also saw Shang-Chi on the same weekend and there it was again... blatant as can be.On IMDB the aggregate ratings average was 6.9. Sounds about right.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Each character was distinct and utilized in the film perfectly, Makkari and Thena were my personal standouts, and the action scenes were very fun to look at.The story, while dense, was also a highlight of the film even when the film slowed down drastically. And that's where this film's problem lies. It's a pretty good story with some really cool concepts and yet at times the movie drags on and after a while I got a bit bored.The acting sometimes contributed to the wooden atmosphere, leaving me bone dry during scenes clearly designed to invoke tears.Despite the cons, it's a solid Marvel movie and I can't wait to see what happens next.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

All the attempts to deliver riveting action and one liners seemed half-hearted with the plot producing more questions than giving answers.The cast ensemble was great but they somehow gave unexciting performances, some were quite wasted to be frank. The villain department was underwhelming with not much to focus up, just creatures to be wasted. Now I know that I went in without any knowledge of the source material but thought the deviants would be some well defined characters and not just some apex predators who didn't evolve. And the end well it thoroughly confused as to how the combined power of eternals can stop a celestial whose capabilities are beyond anything what we have seen in MCU.Positives were the shots were good cast is great. Movie length mattered since not much happens. And please atleast leave the bollywood out or get that act better.

I can see the director want to keep her own style but it's not successful.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most of them were bad. ""Too long and slow""; ""too much walking and talking and standing and talking"" etc
I really was put off even bothering to watch it.But the good news about bad reviews? They lower your expectations.I did watch it in the end, mostly just so I could say I'd given it a chance.And I *DID* enjoy it.Yes, it's long (maybe too long)
And yes it can be slow, in places. But this is the first movie setting up the story of a whole new set of characters - a whole set of characters, not just the usual ONE new hero. It's going to take time to give us a bit of backstory before the kick-ass action comes in.Personally I enjoyed Eternals. Possibly BECAUSE my expectations were so low thanks to all the bad reviews.But I'd say, get yourself a large packet of popcorn, bottle of wine, or whatever your viewing companion is, and give it a go.""The Eternals will return..."", so you'd just as we'll get introduced to them now.Oh and that oh so trumpeted ""first gay kiss""?It's an established couple kissing each other goodbye FGS. Is that really still 'controversial' or even noteworthy in the 21st century?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So, I got bored with this film in the first 20 min.If you have seen this film, you know this can go either way in how the characters could deal with main antagonist.Hopefully, Marvel/Disney will come up with something more helpful and inspiring rather than recycling the same plot over and over again in the future.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

And the box office performance also not so good, part of it relate to it release in pandemic stage. But i before guess part of it , may relate to the movie boring.After all of the above reasons,
make me lost interest to watch and not plan to watch eternals.But finally, in order to know the story line for future mcu movie.I choose to watch it.May be becasue don't have any expectation or already expect it very boring. Eternals movie gave me some surprise. And feel the movie quite good. As mcu always style, had a few funny part, had a few twist.Just first few mins a bit boring and slow, then after that, start make me want to watch.Actually the final fight scene is impressive.The script is ok, some dialoge also interesting, have many link to different mcu movie. And seems got some big revenue on product placement???becasue sound so obvious.The ending music part, use the graphic, antique, history wall picture to connect them with eternals. I feel that idea is quite good.I would say , if u are mcu fans, eternals <-must watch.Even to non-fans, the movie also ok and intersting.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The appealing visuals and need for MCU set up will give this movie 2 stars instead of 1.As many will say, this movie brings in way too many characters and tries to get the viewer to invest in each of them. There is a clear protagonist, but she is not given enough of a spotlight to stand out. The main antagonist is lame as well with a motivation that is explained but the viewer will probably not resonate with. The movie is also way too long and trying to tackle way too many conflicts. This feels like a knock off, less funny Guardians of the Galaxy and I did not like it at all. The plot was both predictable and unexciting. This felt like one of those obligatory set up films rather than an impactful story/experienceAll in all, this film is an absolute bust and its a shame to see such an interesting concept get thrown away. I really didn't think it could get worse than Thor the Dark World or Captain Marvel, but they found a way.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

In this sense it was an enjoyable piece of entertainment which I do not regret watching.The true shortcoming of this film is not that it spectacularly flopped but simply that it succeeded on delivering a disappointingly unambitious piece of cinema. The characters were largely two-dimensional and the story was fairly clear from the getgo. The midway twist was not shocking because we did not yet know enough for it to surprise us and the conclusion was predictable at best, clich√© at worst.Overall a waste of a good cast and a budget, but not a waste of a couple of hours to watch it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The characters are incredibly fun to watch and their relationships/conflict are what carry the movie. There was only one moment in the film that I felt dragged on a few minutes longer than it needed to, but it immediately picked up again after that. It was diverse, but not in a preachy, political way. The differences in the characters were empowering and actually aided their characters identities. I think this movie is so contested because it doesn't it the marvel formula as well as other movies (so it is jarring to the marvel fans who crave movies like Ant-Man) and it is a blockbuster superhero movie so it deters the art/critic group. If you put labels aside, this is visually beautiful movie about 7,000 year old superheroes confronting the possibility of death. If that sounds appealing to you, I encourage you to ignore what others are saying and see it for yourself. I would like more experimentation like this in big blockbusters in the future. I think this one boils down to a matter of preference. I gave it an 8 because personally, watching it brought me great joy, I loved the characters and themes, and I felt it was above average. I'm curious to see how time will treat this one. I imagine it will be like many of Jack Kirby's post-60's works: maybe a little too high-concept and hard to digest at the time, but worth a go to see the artists vision. It's not perfect, but I thought it was a good time.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I liked the interaction of the Eternals with the human race through the ages. The action is fast and impressive due to the multiple camera angles and direction. There aren't any new super powers we haven't see before but all heroes use their powers in a most efficient way with the help of the special effects. I Didn't like the costumes too much and Jolie's character condition. I think this is a good start for any new sequels that may follow.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Their job was to eliminate Deviants and when the mission was done they would leave.The cast feels weird. Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie as superheros. The movie just doesn't fit in the MCU universe. I felt like Captain Marvel was too much. She was too strong and made the universe unreal. Now we get 10 immortals with superhuman powers.The movie was in my opinion all right. Nothing special about the acting but still felt a bit weird with some of the actors. All the characters were very plain and it was hard to get a feel for any of them. And the movie had some funny parts but not really serious in my opinion.Overall an okay movie. No need to watch to understand any of the other Marvel movies. I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for Harish Patel (the camera guy).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a way too long movie and the boring story telling and lame acting made it even longer. They missed a chance for another good Marvel. I really did like all the other Marvels except 'Iron Man 3', which was unfitting into the whole series, but the 'Eternals' fouled up completely.In the beginning there was good music, but with more and more time the music was replaced by a score, which was nerve-racking dramatic - totally misplaced. Sometimes it was schmaltzy over the top.It was one of the worst disappointments for me this year. The top of the disappointment were the stilted dialogues. Lame show! The time jumps didn't make the movie better. Some scenes looked awesome, which couldn't prevent me from being bored over the whole runtime that felt like 5 hours.

Get over yourselves. Go pick up some Jack Kirby books.The Eternals (both in comic and movie) is a tale of the many differences in life and choices we make.This movie is about life, family, and a sense of purpose- with the very real struggles of everyday man represented via deus ex machina.I went to see this with my father, and he's a very smart man; Well educated, but he's of a generation that goes to the movies to be entertained and not to be provoking any thought. His favorite marvel movie is Iron Man.Was that a good movie? Yes. Do we need 1000 Iron Man cookie cutter movies? Heck No!We have been spoiled by the MCU providing the best in super hero cinema and visual effects.This movie is no different than that except... the pacing is a little slower to flesh out a larger cast of characters (of whom we've never seen before) and so that we really feel for these ETERNALS.If anything, I'd say the pace of this movie is about the same as Saving Private Ryan.Everyone played their part very well.Chloe Zhao could not have done better. This was truly a magnificent look at humanity. (I can't wait for the longer cut to come out. I'm sure this could've been a 4 hour movie and I would've loved it just the same!)For all the haters:
Maybe you just need to process a bit and then see it again, or read a comic, or just think of this movie outside of your perspective on what the MCU is or isn't.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

The writing was on the wall with Captain Marvel but I never thought that they would go as shallow as the Eternals. This movie, for some reason, introduces ton of new characters and lore that no one heard of or even cared about. The first 10 minutes sets the tone of the movie. It can't connect with the audience and never explains who does what and why. Half the time you can't even remember the character names. In the third act when they were talking about Ajak, we were looking each other ""Which one was Ajak? Oh, Selma Hayek... Ok..."" That's never a good sign. In the end, we assigned nicknames to the characters, the fat one, the black-girl, the child, Dinesh, Angelina, weirdo, etc. Special effects were Marvel quality but they tried to follow the Transformers route in that, multiple CGI characters collide with each other and you have no idea what is going on. Oh and finally, the story has so many blatant plot-holes, half way through the movie, you have to shut down that part of your brain in order to continue watching.

Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel(our beloved Indian actor/comedian of 90's movies) definitely nailed it. They always caught our attention. Top to bottom the movie was so perfect. I think the Deviants were needed to be explored more. And yes the credit scenes ? Specially the mid credit scene ! The people gone wild !

This would've been a better miniseries. Instead, its two and a half hours spent desperately trying to explain these overly generic feeling characters called Eternals that are... Eternal. We bounce back and forth in time so much there's no cohesion or sense to it. We learn of their abilities sort of but barely understand any of the relationships or characters.It feels like such a shame. I want to like these characters, I want to care about what's going on. There are fun ideas here but even with 2.5 hours of time none of it feels lived in or earned. When the end comes around, I still don't know who these people are, I may have two or three names actually locked in. There are visuals that I appreciate. The representations of the powers are generic but weirdly feel fun. A couple of the powers themselves are used to interesting effect despite them pretty much just looking like rejects from Doctor Strange. There are giant alien machine beings that show up and look properly imposing and yet... How no impact on the world at all?This feels like a victory lap for Marvel, except instead of crossing the finish line the wheels fall off, and smoke billows from the engine at the halfway mark. They throw together a big team of godlike heroes with next to no build-up or explanation for most of them, they mention both Batman and Superman in the film. The Superman reference is even directed at a character that flies, has super strength, and laser eyes. It feels so much like Marvel trying to show up DC and in the process, they fall for all the same problems. The mention of DC characters felt especially jarring as well.Such a disappointment to have a movie with a fun concept be such a complete miss. At seemingly every turn it makes the most generic and underwhelming of choices. I want to like it but it feels like a complete nothing of a movie. It reminded me of Thor: Dark World but it isn't as aggressively bad. To quote Dean Winchester, Eternals is so vanilla it makes vanilla seem spicy.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It tells the story of the Eternals who are extremely powerful & immortal entities. The Eternals have lived on Earth for thousands of years & have been present for many of its historic moments.Eternals is a mind-blowing film. Director Chloe Zhao has brought her flair for breathtaking visuals, to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematography by Ben Davis is absolutely gorgeous. What's super impressive is that all the locations in the movie are real & not green/blue screen, which is usually Marvel's modus operandi. The action set pieces are excellent. The visual effects are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The camerawork in some scenes are a bit too dark for my liking. The Deviants are quite unremarkable as villains. Also, there are some minor inconsistencies in the storyline, and there is not too much humor compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, this film doesn't deserve to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first rotten-rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. Zhao has also done a phenomenal job, giving each main role to such a diverse cast. Gemma Chan is spectacular as Sersi. Richard Madden is amazing as Ikaris. Chan & Madden share electrifying chemistry together. Angelina Jolie is outstanding as Thena. Kumail Nanjiani is the star of the show as Kingo. Lia McHugh is awesome as Sprite. Brian Tyree Henry is brilliant as Phastos. Lauren Ridloff is awe-inspiring as Makkari. Barry Keoghan is great as Druig. Don Lee is unforgettable as Gilgamesh. Salma Hayek is impressive as Ajak. Harish Patel & Kit Harington are memorable as Karun & Dane Whitman, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Eternals is a must watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. I promise you won't be disappointed but, expect a one of a kind Marvel film. Can't wait for Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021)!","232 out of 634 found this helpful.

The landscapes, the use of natural light, even the aesthetic of everything Eternals-related is simply mesmerizing. The fight scenes are actually cohesive, so you can fully comprehend what you are seeing, and it shows clearly how strong the characters are, how they individually fight with their own styles, and how tough their enemies are.Eventhough the movie is very long and it has some slow paced moments, it is introducing at least 7 new characters that are going to be in the MCU for a while, so it is not an easy accomplishment - and it does it very graciously. The team is formed by different people, with different powers, points of view, motivations, and you have enough time to understand what makes them individuals.Ironic that a film about humanoid-deluxe-robot-aliens can show so much humanity and love for mankind. And for that, I have to say that it trully has a much better subtext than any other MCU movie, because it found it's own way to tell this story, and now I'm glad it did.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Trippy, epic, magnificent grand, add any adjective it'll fall short. It is unlike any Marvel movie in terms of the scope and grandeur. On an IMAX screen it's truly an amazing experience.This movie misses the mark a lot of things-the pacing and length being the most obvious.But the parts it hits right outweigh the misses. The casting is top notch. At no point it felt like SJW cash-grab, each character had a distinct role. The performance is what holds a lot of the scenes and the jokes from falling flat (yep it goes there), and the chemistry between the cast feels organic - during the dramatic scenes and fight sequences. Marvel always gets the casting right for sure.The background score by Ramin Djawandi is amazing.This movie touches on a lot of topics and some things go really well. The timeline hopping narrative. Historical fiction blending with the Celestial mythos. The fight sequences have good CGI. It's not a PS2 game. The CGI is actually really good.The film feels like it starts a lot of things and takes it nowhere but the path it does tread are done well. Zhao's touch is the most prominent in this journey of these characters.And now as a comics fan watching Jack Kirby's name and to see his work on such grand display is enough to get me satisfied. The work he did is still relevant and creating new trajectories in the MCU, it is a delight to see. This movie may not be the best MCU entry, but there is also no other movie like this in the franchise. It has a a heart. It has it's faults and that's why it's a good movie. In a way this movie is like Druig's description of Humans. Worth watching for sure.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

I laughed, cried and was surprised at many points.Yes there were too many themes and the film would benefit from narrowing down what they wanted to focus on.

In marvel standards it failed to bring that sense of coolness we usually get, probably because there was so much going on. But, I liked the movie. Acting, cinematography, casting, cgi, special effects and general plot were all fantastic. It only missed its mark by trying to fit so many new characters into one movie. It was difficult to feel a connection to them because of this. Except for Gemma Chan's character Sersi, whom I immediately took a liking to and could connect with. She was the highlight of the film for me. Everyone saying this is the worst marvel movie isn't being dramatic. This movie was good. In my opinion, better than Thor 1 & 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Venom 1 & 2, Captain Marvel and Incredible Hulk. CGI was much better here than in Black Widow. I think the main disconnect for fans was the fact that none of these characters have been shown before. In all the other MCU movies and series there's been at least one appearance from a previously established character. Even in Shang-Chi, Wong had a little appearance, plus some other characters in the post-credit. None of this happened in Eternals. Overall I enjoyed the movie, would recommend watching it, think it's a good movie alone, and pretty decent in regards to other MCU content.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

Somehow though, none of the characters feel like developed characters by the final act and you're left with a movie with no interesting action, adventure, story, and characters. Some of the things they do just makes no sense either, they will just switch up their entire motives for no reason and it makes no sense.

With so many characters in the main cast it can be difficult to keep track of which one is which. But eventually I'm satisfied with remembering their names, vaguely defined powers and if I'm lucky their one-note character drama.As I go through each member of the team I find myself hating each one. Ikaris: egotistical jerk. Sprite: annoying brat who has the power to make illusions but can't figure out how to make herself look older. Phastos: Always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Makkari: Doesn't have a whole lot to do, but could solve all the problems if she just used her powers. Druig: Jerky emo guy who thinks he's better than everyone. Thena: Will randomly flip out and start attacking everyone.Although the visuals are good, I couldn't help but notice that the aspect ratio of the movie kept rapidly changing throughout the film. It was very distracting. The action isn't helmed all that well. It is hard when dealing with super beings that hardly anything can hurt, to make an action scene that is compelling. But at least make an action scene where I can see what is going on.Towards the climax of the film, one of the characters just decides not to participate in the final showdown. Honestly I should have taken my que from him and just bailed on this movie part way through. The finale is your typical Marvel CGI fest with no concrete weight or stakes.As far as the positive goes, It seems to be trying to tell a strange new story with compelling ideas. It just fails to do so.The main characters are pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone . And the fans of this movie come across as pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Chlo√© Zhao, you should have never agreed to this one. This could have been such a great series! Every character could have their own 40 min episode, and with stars like Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, it wouldn't have a been difficult one to make!But due to the short time, too many characters with too many plotlines, this becomes a convoluted mess that tries to solely depend upon the cgi to impress the audience. But MCU was never about that! The best aspect about that is, we felt what the characters went through. Iron man, Captain America, Thor, we see their development slowly, we relate to them in a way that when they fight together at the end, we know exactly why they're doing that. Eternals fails in every way possible for it to fail as a MCU movie.People who are rating it above 3 stars, I think you have never seen a MCU movie and I request you to go watch it. As for Marvel authorities who greenlit this project, if your intentions are to make poor end products with the sole intention of cash grabbing, please go ahead. You will lose more fans like me.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The side romance stories and the side atory with the sword-lady's mental health deteriorating could all have just been left out. To fix this the movie could have focused more on developing a single character, it would have made it less awkward because no one really cares about some unspoken rift between characters that supposedly happened and now there's a grudge.II. Rehashed powers.Seeing the same generic magic powers again and again. Yes I know it's a Marvel movie, but adding gold streams doesn't make super speed or super fist or eye-lasers cool again. It's all been done.III.

Over all I think this movie does two things wrong that really brings the movie down witch includes the characters and the pacing. For a story that can be told in a half an hour this movie is two hours and thirty minutes long. With such a long run time very little of it peeks my interest. The second thing wrong with this film is the characters. I think what makes Guardians of the galaxy so good is the interesting characters while in this movie every single character is super stupid and I hate them. Overall I wished the movie was never created and Marvel please do better in the future.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Changed how their movies look and feel. Eternals is that game changing film. Not only does Chloe Zhao have a signature look for all her films, the movie felt authentic and real. Visual affects were some of the best I've seen in the MCU, the locations were beautiful, the all star cast performed as we would expect from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Bryan Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek and more. The story was on a large scale dealing with humanity, hints to the effects of climate change and making tough global decisions. The film goes between present day and back to the early years when the Eternals arrived to earth 7000 years ago. There is a lot of the same MCU humor and charm in this film which is always the cherry on top when it comes to these films, making light of a situation when lives are at stake. Over all this film was fantastic and most definitely my new favorite MCU film.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Running over two hours, I was expecting the story to hit all the essential points. Sadly, the plot got lost in time, making me empathetically connecting the dots in between. The main story wasn't compelling, leaving me distracted by the subplots. There were potential subplots but sadly they were not expanded. Perhaps the budding romance between Druig and Makkari should be given a go instead of focusing on a jaded romance that died centuries ago between Ikaris and Sersi. Perhaps. Or even Kro... He could have an engaging storyline, the whole inner battle between good and evil as he evolved. The dialogues were underwhelming and simple for the Eternals beings. If they are beings of superiority, shouldn't they be speaking in an ethereal manner to depict such status? The narration and the intertwining of plots seemed to be choppy, lack of fluidity. The verdict? I was left baffled. I didn't want more. The question left to ponder. How do you salvage the sequel? Perhaps riding on Harry Styles' Eros?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie feels slow, because the actual story line doesn't really progress... it should be summed up, 1. Here are the Eternals, 2. There's a world threat, assemble Eternals, 3. Fight world threat, 4. End credit scenes.Problems with the movie itself:
1. Too many holes in the story line... like, where were all the Eternals during Thanos's snap?2. End credits scene CGI was horrible.3. Many unnecessary things in the movie.

The visuals are undisputedly gorgeous, and the music was notably good too. While the plot did have some minor setbacks, I don't see a clearer way the director/writer could have conveyed such a complicated project in one sitting. Some would say the movie is too long, but I think the movie is too short for what it had to cover. Eternals had great character evolution, and the lengthy duration was necessary. Some Marvel hero's require 3 movies see near the same development.I don't think a true impartial review is what this movie has been receiving. Many Marvel films with much higher reviews can't be enjoyed without a grand context, and this one works as a stand alone. Eternal is slower paced, more dynamic and has less action than the average Marvel film. Perhaps that attributes to the lower rated reviews among the other controversial inserts. However a slower paced movie that sacrifices mindless action scenes for plot development shouldn't be disgraced.Lastly, I think that the disparities represented was heartwarming and were realistic occurrences within the story. Same-sex relationships shouldn't matter conceptually speaking and the being in question doesn't reproduce. The point of the movie was to love another without pointless conflict. The ban of this movie in countries gives awareness to unjustifiable discrimination as if they were programmed to believe that way. This just so happens to be the message Eternals is trying illuminate!!","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

It didn't work here.Since IMDB numbers seem to rate ""saw it, it was interesting"" as a 6, and anything with at least something special above that a 7+, this gets a 5.

However there's not much more there and certainly not enough to save this delivery. The film soon gets too slow, too long, too filled, a little mixed up, and unbearably pretentious. Characters are just too many to convincingly develop but at trying, it sacrifices steady structure and splats the tone all over the place.

Big cast, for whaf? Very poor script; they tried to put too much in, not much of a back story for the Eternals. No need to include so many characters (some were pointless), it's definitely the worst Marvel I have seen to date. The credits were just as bad and especially the guest appearance from a well know musician. I don't know how they will continue this story, it was so poorly written. Looking forward to watching Spiderman. This will be forgotten very quick.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They just rely on the fact that it was long with few action scenes. Indeed ,this is the first Marvel film not suitable for children, because to be able to understand the film, you need to have a slightly more open mind since the film focuses a lot on the psychological characterization of the characters. This film is much more complete than the others because it has a beginning, a development and an end, it tells a story of its own. It has dramatic parts that meke you move, and there is no longer the usual comedy of the previous marvel films, in short , it is no longer a film suitable for an audience of children and people who do not know about cinema. So it's normal in the end that it has all these negative evaluations, but it is sad.-italian guy.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sure he's a ""god"", but this is Norse Mythology -- I studied this in a Catholic High School -- never, ever a competition for God. However with this film, it really appears that this is an atheist's version of all of Creation -- and I found that just too tough to swallow throughout the movie. That's primarily the reason for 3 stars.Otherwise, this group fights more amongst themselves than any other -- including killing each other, and for no apparently significant reasons either.Angelina Jolie looks fantastic, as usual, but most of the time (Read: very LONG time of the film) she just stands or sits around and does not do or say much at all. Certainly not like the first ""Tomb Raider"" at all!The rest of the cast were virtual unknowns to me; and it was difficult to assess them -- mostly because they really thought they were playing or serving some false god someone dreampt up.In summary, this was either like X-Men on a very warped tangent -- as they didn't seem to care about the Human Race much; or it was like some fake god-like fantasy continually dreampt up by Atheists. Either way, the film sucked.P. S. To the Marvel folks: Don't you dare think you are going to replace Iron Man or Captain America, in the Avengers, with any of these idiotic characters!

Marvel took a risk with Eternals, tying to sophisticate the storyline and bring a never before seen representation in big blockbuster movies, and it works, in a way...The movie underperforms precisely because it tries to achieve to much in a limited amount of time with the biggest cast of leading characters I've ever seen, which left them, for the most part, underdeveloped (kinda like what happened in The Crimes of Grindewald), but it doesn't mean you can't appreciate how different and unique each of them are! Putting that aside and understanding the bigger scope of the story, it's really worth the watch. The Eternals focuses more on the characters moral conflict with the task they've been given then the typical evil vs good story we've all seen before. The ""we don't interfere"" plot line had me skeptical until I saw how, that even for the characters, it wasn't natural. It was also interesting to see the burden and the toll the ""don't interfere"" actions took on them and their relationships among themselves and the people. By the end the movie as paved the way to set itself free from the limitations it had in the first place, which is good and bad, since we're only see the true potential of the story in the next movies. Eternals also have to be praised in the amazing visual effects and directing by Chlo√© Zhao, it has some National Geographic levels of visuals.I do believe this movie and this story has potential and that we need to be more realistic and recognize the good and the bad, giving it a fair feedback. Because this way we, as fans, have a shot in putting constructive criticism out there and help pave the way to better content!","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The only (maybe) chink in the armour is the dragged origin story, and little slow start (but takes up considerable pace afterwards).The reason maybe it was reviewed badly, is because over the years superhero movies have painted a very gallant, high adrenaline rush picture, and subtle aspects of inclusivity, emotions and feelings have mostly been sidelined (not totally).

I got home from work made dinner and sat down to watch it on my 80 inch Samsung UHD tv. I adjusted colors to perfect settings during a viewing of Red Notice. The picture started off beautiful. Colors really popped and I was getting use to characters. Then it's like the lighting crew for the movie quit and the rest of the movie was shot in pitch black. It wasn't until final battle that I could finally see everyone again. Tv brightness was maxed out.Hollywood has done this alot over the last few years and I believe it's their way to hide imperfections in details. However the rest of the Marvel movies are excellent balance in lights and darks. Disney was so proud that they hired a recent academy award winner to direct but somehow forgot to hire a crew to support her. I have a hard time believing that this is the film she intended to make.Story was competent, casting was amazing and diverse, action was great when you can see what's going on. You can also tell this wasn't shot on a studio and that they really went to the locations to shoot. All of this should have made a decent marvel film. It didn't. I am disappointed with film and if I hadn't just seen Spideman I would be worried for Marvel.Disney please take note. Make your movies so they can be enjoyed on any device and anywhere without needing a high end device to make it watchable. You advertise that you can watch Disney+ anywhere but I dare you to watch this movie on any device and not get pissed off.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has nothing to do with the other MCU movies. It's much more poetic. There are those who say it is slow, I don't agree, I think there was a great concern to introduce the context well, to make sure that clich√© situations were not created just so that they could use easy solutions. Eternals are neither heroes, nor villains, nor anti-heroes. They are purposeful beings, and they don't all have the same purpose. There is an enormous respect for each character, there are well-defined power levels, but all characters are carefully developed, which creates a complex and unpredictable plot. The film ventures into some more controversial sequences, but does it with such smoothness and mastery that the scene just flows naturally.It's far from the typical superhero movie, there's no fuss going on 100% of the time, there's no excess of lines, no senseless fights. There are, however, pauses, moments of introspection from the audience, which intensify the characters' pain and make us understand the side of both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"". And all the jokes and fight scenes are epic and hit the timing on point.(Next paragraph may contain a really really vage spoiler, no names and no specific details mentioned, but it's just a warning)I just thought that it failed to develop a certain aspect that was crucial to the outcome. Something in the film has a lot more impact on a certain character, so much so that it makes her commit the unpredictable, not having as much impact on the audience, perhaps making them doubt why this character made that decision.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

But everything came together brilliantly in the third viewing, and I have to say, Chloe Zhao achieved something special here.The film begins with an opening crawl that the audience will distrust as the plot is revealed. We meet the Eternals on their spaceship as they arrive on Earth in 5000 BC to combat the Deviants, a race of monstrous predators that have begun killing humans. The ten Eternals arrive and start their mission of protecting humanity over centuries from Deviant's, vowing never to interfere in humanity's conflicts under strict orders. It's a smartly addressed question posed to them early on by Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) when he learns his girlfriend Sersei is an Eternal, and he wonders why they never helped fight Thanos.Having gone their separate ways after their final mission during the Aztec War, they find themselves reuniting to combat the Deviants who have suddenly emerged once more. But this time, they're different, capable of absorbing the powers of the Eternals. It's a small detail that's glossed over, but it a savvy MCU viewer will know this is a setup for a bigger story later.The story progresses by showing you The Eternal's past failings over the years and how they ended up where they are now. They need each other to ward off an even more significant threat: an event known as The Immergence.There is so much to explore here as Zhao uses every scene to plant seeds about this new world while deconstructing these gods. In many ways, they are as weak as humans, flawed beings who have also been fed lies to further the agenda of the powerful. Zhao uses her settings and camera work to create the most epic-looking visuals ever seen in a Marvel film. And nothing plays out as you expect it to play out in this genre. The decisions each of these ten Eternals make are profoundly different than what we've come to expect from superheroes. Yet, there is still that element of heroism that makes Marvel characters feel as though they care about the worlds they inhabit.The performances are sedated to some degree, and at first, it felt a bit off for Marvel's usual cast of energetic, quippy heroes. But once I learned their true origins, it made more sense for them to behave as they did. Each Eternal is gifted with a unique ability such as super strength, healing abilities, illusions, mind control, and super speed. The later power is one of the best on-screen presentations of a speedster I've ever seen, and Lauren Ridloff's Makkari, a sticky-fingered speedster, is easily my new favorite Marvel character.The Eternals is a film that has already divided the Marvel community as it doesn't feel like any other film in the universe: it's more methodical and heavy on exposition. But that's what I love about this film. There is some intense world-building at play here, and while some of it may have been best served in a Disney+ series, the visuals demand a big-screen presentation. This is one of those Marvel films that viewers will go back to years later and realize how much it matters to the broader arc of Marvel films and make them wonder how they missed all that was seeded here.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story had a predictable MCU twist but we all expect that. If they've learnt by this a follow up could be better. Quiet frankly I hope they never make a Thor movie again. The super hero & 'gods' movies genre has been burnt out over the last ten years so this was never going to be received well by 'fans'.

Yes, it is not as fast paced as other Marvel movies, especially those of the Avengers variant, but that is a good thing. I actually new what was going on on the screen while I was watching it instead of being bombarded with fight scenes in which the camera is forced to give every big name actor equal screen time.The Eternals spends a lot of time allowing the viewer to get to know the cast through flashbacks. Since we have never seen these characters this only makes sense. And it is done beautifully. The movie is long, yes, but it is only boring if you expect fight scenes and destruction every few minutes. If this is so, then this is not the movie for you.The relationships between the incredibly diverse characters, the back stories, the secrets - all of this is slowly revealed. The movie focuses less on fighting and effects and more on the emotions of the characters. I cannot say more as I do not want to spoil it, but unless you expect another Marvel Action flick, then you should just give it a try and realize that this movie just does not fit into the Marvel formula - and that this is a good thing.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm not sure, but halfway through this I was starting to think it's one of the worst things marvel has produced to date. I felt like probably 2/3rds of the film was just trying to get you up to date with what was going on, so by the time it actually got started properly I was already a bit done with it. It pulls itself back a bit with some impressive action scenes and special effects, but the characters just feel a bit sacrificial and most are probably not going to be important moving forward. I like some of the ideas it opens up in the franchise but it all just felt a bit forced..... a bridge to where marvel is taking things perhaps.","17 out of 57 found this helpful.

"9","/10","""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7522151/?ref_=tt_urv","djmomo17","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12690203/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2021","When the Eternals were announced as being featured in a future Marvel films, I was pretty unimpressed. Having read the original series, I didn't see how the concept could possibly fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And with a the film being directed by Chloe Zhao, known only for the indie film ""Nomadland"" (which was not my cup of tea), I was less enthused. However, after seeing the film I was very pleasantly surprised.Eternals is a COSMIC Marvel film. In its premise, famous characters from mythology (Gilgamesh, Athena, Mercury, Icarus, Hephaestos, etc.) are revealed to have actually been a team of superbeings sent to Earth by ""space gods"" to help the development of mankind (kind of an ""Avengers"" of the Ancient World). The movie takes place in the present, but flashbacks document episodes from over the last 7000 years of human history. This gives the film the opportunity to take the audience to many different time periods and to many different regions of the Earth. It's a feast for the world history buff, that's for sure.As the film proceeds, these ageless ""Eternals"" start learning about their true mission on Earth, and have to make decisions which might affect not only Earth, but the future of many planets in the galaxy. Although this is a Marvel ""superhero"" film, it actually comes across more as a thoughtful science fiction epic. The Eternals are not humans who wear power suits or who have been given super-powers through artificial means, but are actually alien beings who have made Earth their home for thousands of years. In fact, these superbeings have lived on Earth long enough that they have taken on the emotional characteristics of humans. Now they must rise to defend their adopted home against their own godlike masters from outer space. In a bold move for a Disney product, this film presents some complex moral choices (at least on par with ""Captain America: Civil War""), and even at the end of the film there is an earned sense of consequence.Aside from the massive mythology that this film has to present, it also has 10 main characters to establish, each with their own personalities, powers and back history. In an amazing feat of pacing, the film manages to do just that, giving each character a meaningful introduction and arc.As usual for an MCU film, there are lots of visual-effects supporting battlescenes, but there also many scenes simply featuring the natural beauty of its locations as well as many scenes highlighting the diversity of global culture.In the end, ""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date. The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to be following the pattern the comics did in the 1970s by introducing more varied concepts incorporating elements of sf, horror and ""art-house"" than just super-strong capes. It's a very welcome move.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And that's exactly what happened.GOTG just about pulled it off with 5 heros, and even that only worked because one of the characters was a tree with one line and came at the expense of a one dimensional villain.Eternals doesn't mange to give you characters which you care about or empathise with. Honestly, you struggle to remember most of their names half the time.Rob Stark appears to be as thrilled to be in this film as he was at the end of his last wedding. Angelina Jolie is basically just there. Salma Hayek does what she can, especially with a character that the script doesn't seem to realise is actually a terrible leader; but thats not enough to save the film. Gemma Chan hasn't really got the personality to carry the film and her character isn't written in any way that you'd really care about her either.Sprite and Druig are actually really annoying characters, Makkari is just there for most of the film and Phastos isn't given much to do beyond talking about his family.The only characters/actors with any personality and charisma are Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo and Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh. While they manage to steal the scenes they are in, for some reason the film decides they need less screen time...perhaps the actors needed surgery after carrying the fist half of the film on their backs.Despite this bloated cast, the 2 and a half hour run time still feels like an eternity, because pacing is a huge problem with this film.A huge portion of the film is dedicated to 'getting the band back together' and honestly, with the exception of the 2 scene stealing stars doing their best, the entire second act moves with all the pace of your average glacier.The film lacks any real villain, so you're not even invested in the struggle. Anyone sold as a villain is eventually just 'misunderstood' or doing what they have to...which makes the third act even more dissapointing.If I can say anything good about the film, I can say that it's visually impressive, but thats about it. Beyond that it was a chore to get through.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

With that said, although with flaws, Eternals is a fresh take with fresh characters that is a nice change from the other monotonous hack and bang MCU movies out there.The story is strait from a History Channel documentary. Aliens (the Eternals) landed on Earth thousands of years ago to protect humans from deviants and to help them progress. Conveniently, they are sworn to secrecy, and therefore do not play into any other Marvel film to this point. Flash to the present, and danger is poking it's naughty head above water again. Will The Eternals be able to save Earth (as it must be August and all the are on vacation?).There are a lot of characters, and yes, the cast is a United Colours of Benneton collection of very good actors. Rainbow, check, sexuality, check, mental health, check. But unlike other films, these are character traits that seem to flow naturally, and we are not constantly reminded of how 'woke' the movie is. The acting is strong, and the dynamic between the characters is the strength of the film. Just like any team, there are those that work well together, those that have a history, and a wide range of engagement levels. This is all done well, but with so many characters, and a pressure to get the story moving forward, these sometimes feel unexplored.The action and special effects are on par, but often feels like a distraction from the interesting elements of Eternals. This feels like a major balance between director and studio trying to create an action film but include so many characters and script. I myself was way more interested in the story than the action.Why not overly philosophical, I appreciate the each character is unique, and has a chance to share different perspectives on the events. This is not a united team of superheroes, but a group of supreme beings that has a rough history it must come to terms with.Overall, Chlo√© Zhao does a great job juggling so many balls in the air; and yes, a few do fall to the ground, but those that stay up create a unique and overall interesting movie experience.8/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

They are so hard to write well... as this movie sadly demonstrates. The best stories comes from fundamental truths, retold in fantastical and new ways. This movie tells us nothing.

An extensive look into the history and origins or the universe and earth is ever present throughout the film, perhaps too much for some people liking, but for fans hoping for more theories and branches to the MCU, perhaps not enough and perhaps opening more doors of opportunity and confusion than the MCU and it's fans were ready for. The action sequences speak for themselves, beautifully crafted and choreographed, emotionally charged at points, and full of surprise and tension. Perhaps more than other MCU entries to date, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat. For some, the action may not be frequent enough, but it can only be agreed upon that when it is there, it is brilliant. Plot holes do loom in the film but not to an extent that harshens the progression of the film, however some unanswered questions and odd behaviour do complicate the plot from a viewers perspective, but it is nothing that the film gets stuck in the mud over. The visuals and cinematography live up to what you expect from the trailer with fabulous scenery and eye catching sets, The Eternals does not fade away from being extravagant. The film does a sound job developing character and gives wonderful unique aspects to all of its large ensemble, mixing comedy with tragedy, and action with recount. It is safe to say, for those who enjoy the intricacies of a shared universe, this film will be very satisfying. It is safe to say that fans of the cosmic MCU will be pleased. And it is safe to say that fans of the emotional and character side of the MCU will walk away with glee. But for those who may find it all a bit too over the top, or long, or slow at times, The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming. Marvel Studios: The Eternals, 8/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I absolutely loved it and have watched it more than once. Unlike some other reviewers, i did feel that the plot and background was explained well and most of the characters had at least some depth to them. I know it's hard to fit in a ton of background and depth when you have such a large group of main characters but i think that's why this would do well as a saga. I do think this is different than what the MCU often puts out so maybe that was off putting for people? Overall, i had a great time and really enjoyed getting to know most of the characters (except sprite who was insufferable). I for one am hoping for an Eternals 2! This diverse group of characters deserves more exploration!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It doesn't affect the current course of the MCU and the impact that it attempts to have make no sense.Alternatively, give your money and time to movies like ""The French Dispatch"", ""Last Night in Soho"", or ""King Richard"": films that don't have the luxury of being under a cinematic universe and actually had to put in some effort.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I confess, the theme of superheroes, people who save the world just because they have super power, is not very close to me, because most of these films have an unfinished plot, very bad actors, who are not something that you don't believe, as Stanislavsky said, you are waiting so that they get out of this frame as soon as possible, and the film just continues, this film is no exception.

But also I like creature features. My sci fi preference has that. With the Eternals created for the sole purpose of destroying the Deviants met my requirement for fun. In the actors' dialogue you get a personal feel on the flick and the characters. And you can tell early on how Sprite had a real liking for Ikaris so it doesn't surprise you later when she leaves with him. One of my favorite visuals is when Searcy does a Metamorpho on the bus.

Not the worst Marvel movie, but far from the best, and far from the middle point as well. If you came for some amazing entertainment - you came to the wrong place i guess.But the worst about this movie is that's waaaaaaaay too dark. Even the 4K Atmos Bluray is dark as hell... And I checked it out, it's not only my complaint. Even if you have decent screen, they still feel dark and dull, sometimes hard to watch because they screwed the lighting - you can't just shoot dark on dark without adding a contrast or contour lighing or something to make distinguishing what's going on. Same problem was with The Black panther, but that here is the whole movie. Not to mention that the color editing was mediocre and dull as well. IDK how it is on HDR and OLED top screen , but i asume it won't be much better. And my screen gives pretty good color representation since i have it for photoshop.So in summary - this will be unwatchable on laptop or cheap bad screen, because it will be impossiby dark. It kinda looks like B-movie, but with the extra budget :DStorywise it's nothing spectacular, the thypical superhero movie, with shallow characters, weak jokes (finally they reduced the Disney-kind of jokes to minimum, as they were getting annoying in the previous marvel movies...) , not good character arc. The sound is decently good, with decent surround and kinda powerfull bass (not too low tho ,but still you can feel it). Visual effects are as expected decent, but for such budget it's not surprising. Yet, nothing in the movie pops up as wow, what a great scene.As you can expect - there are 2 post-credit scenes, one for ""yet another sequal"" , and the 2nd post-credit scene is waay to far fetched. I had to google it to see wtf was that, and the explanation is even worse than i hoped.... That would be pretty bad movie mashup if they go for it.. and they will.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

When that line ( and its not much worse than the others ) comes out of a teacher / superheroes mouth, you know a writer wasn't involved in this flop ... Its just a sprawling mess that jumps around through time and narrative with no rhyme or reason ... The cast look about as engaged as if they were at a wedding they had to be at, so as to not upset their parents ... There's monsters and explosions but nothing new or interesting ... And what a waste of Ma Dong-seok who has been one of my favourite actors in the last few years
Who on earth thought Chloe Zhao would be a good idea to direct a superhero film should be fired immediately ... Of course she also has her name top of the writers credits so she is very much responsible for this rubbish ... ""Nomadland"" was nice little film ... Its BIG ( slightly over sized ) heart was in the right place, which is rare in american films ... But it was not a ""good"" film ... It was rather flat ... The only reason it won prizes was due to another great performance from Frances McDormand ... The directing lacked flair and style, which was what the film needed admittedly, but showed no great flair ... To put the director of that on to a film like this was supposed to be is insane ... But that's hollywood... If you manage to sit through this garbage, I can guarantee you won't bother a second time ...

A Marvel movie meant for adults and with some emotion to boot. Not the usual testosterone driven formula for the host of Marvel movie. When you open a comic book and find something different from the previous comic you read, that is what makes the story interesting. A movie you didnt have to worry about the back stories so much. For many the post credit scenes made it worthwhile - ergo you want to stick to a formula. A tad change, you lose it. The male stars didn't have perfect chiseled jaws and gave the impressions there could be someone normal looking and still do (super-hero)good. Not a doomsday scenario unlike all the other Marvel movies & there makes it a cut above and it didnt matter. Definitely deserves more than the Age of Ultron which seemed tiring. Taking liberty to use a Pink Floyd track in the movie calls for more marks than been given. Kudos to Zhao, migrating from Nomadland vibe to this. Pure gold.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

These Eternals has been on earth long enough to see humanity at its best and worst and it was their job to save us from the Deviants.

However, after seeing so much hate for this movie, I feel the need to share my review. Sure, if you like the typical, cookie-cutter formula that most Marvel movies have, you may not be a fan of Eternals. But if you're looking for something fresh and different within the MCU, Eternals totally exceeds expectations. The visuals are beautiful and you can really feel the chemistry between the characters, in ways that can't be felt in most other Marvel movies to be honest. Also, the two post-credit scenes alone earn 10 stars in my opinion. It's definitely worth the watch and I'm eager to see where these characters end up next.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The visuals were amazing and as always it's nice to see new superheroes along with their story. But in the grand scheme of things, the movie missed it's mark.Eternals, was slow in pace. The entire movie was basically about a long, drawn out love story that had next to no feeling to it. The film slowly introduced the cast one-by-one, without actually showing much or even giving much, but some how kept going. And when it finally started to pick up during the very end, the fight scene was way too short. The viewer barley got to see the extant of the abilities the new superheroes possessed. What was worse of all was how little Angelina Jolie's part was in the movie. And that there was no real chemistry between the cast/team. These people have spent thousands of years together on earth and yet they all come across as strangers without much feeling. It feels cold, and Angelina felt the coldest, like she didn't belong in the same room as the others - she felt out of place.Very long, drawn out movie that was full of fillers and a cold cast. The film should have had more to it's plot. More action and much more feeling. Visuals are stunning, and adds to the MCU story.

I usually enjoy Marvel movies and own just about all of them (except for Black Widow which I will never watch because of Scarlett Johansson) but there was something about Eternals that I just didn't enjoy.I liked the premise very much but a lot of the main characters were forgettable. The way the past was sprinkled throughout the present felt disjointed or jarring at times. I was actually very much surprised at Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Thena. I'm not a big fan of hers to begin with so I didn't have high hopes but I felt she did an incredible job with the character. Salma Hayek is also one I wouldn't term to be a favorite of mine but again, I was pleasantly surprised by her as Ajak. I also thoroughly enjoyed Brian Tyree Henry (but he rarely disappoints), Kumail Nanjiani and Don Lee.While I know Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were supposed to be the main focus, I don't think they have the charisma or star power to lead a Marvel franchise. I really wish more of the ""supporting"" characters had, had more screen time (including Kit Harrington). If they had spent more time on the other Eternals besides Ikaris and Sersi, I would've enjoyed it more.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Phase three had ended in rapturous appluse, thier small screen future looked promising thanks to a new streaming platform in the shape of Disney +, what could go wrong?Nothing like a global pandemic to throw a spanner in the works.Black Widow (which always felt like an afterthought) and new kid on the block Shang Chi had all arrived a year late and both had felt a little underwhelming compared to what we had grown to expect.The problem with Eternals is that despite its eye-popping visuals, decent cast and name checking characters like Thanos, Doctor Strange and the Avengers, it somehow doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.The MCU have taken chances before, the Guardians were pretty much unknown characters that included a tree and a talking racoon. Here we are bombarded with new characters, non of which are very memorable or exciting.Phase four has been a little hit n' miss to say the least and this is its lowest point. But maybe time will be kind to the movie, as a stand alone story it's ok. It just feels totaly unesseasry to the MCU and come the end we are promised that the Eternals will return, although its hard to see where, when or why.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can tolerate one or two quirky individuals in the bunch, but when the whole team suffers from various emotional troubles, you feel repelled by them. The writers opened up a journal for mental illness and said... OK lets make this one a cry baby, and that one antisocial, and this one can be a narcissist, and we can give this one amnesia, and how about making this one constantly jealous, that one over there can live in their own fantasy world... and it may not be a mental illness but we can make this superhero homosexual.

Its certainly not a ""rotten film"". My biggest issue is that with it being a team movie vs a solo, I did feel there was a lot of backstory to set up. And unfortunetly I think some characters get more development than others. But I overall enjoyed it. I thought it had a good balance of action, comedy and emotion. And while I didnt cry, I nearly did with a certain scene involving Ikarus and Sersi. I also liked the character building done for Sprite. She reminded me of ""Claudia"" from Interview with the Vampire"" in a lot of ways. And I loved what it had to say around ""religion"" and blindy following your faith. I thought it was a very interesting and fascinating movie and definitely would be interested in expanding upon the mythos and characters. Not a perfect movie by any means. I would rank it, i dont know....maybe somewhere between 12-20. I'd possibly have to do some rewatches to get an exact number, but I think I can fairly say its not a top 10 film, nor is it bottom of the bunch.

I think the dividing line of responses is whether or not it fits the Marvel mega-action template and if that is okay or not. Just to deal with that question out of the gate, this does not fit the Marvel cookie cutter. There are a variety of differences. It is diverse in both casting and subject matter. The cast is international, multinational and multi-ethnic. We have our first openly gay superhero. We have our first hero who is deaf. We have our first hero to struggles with their mental health. All artfully and beautifully presented, in my opinion. This is not a single character's origin story. It is 10 characters' origin story spanning over 7,000 years, plus the introduction of 3 distinct and new species: Celestials, Eternals and Deviants. It also acknowledges superheroes from other universes, like the potshots at DC's Superman. There are also some Marvel staple components, humour, brilliant CGI, fight scenes and world weaving. This film is also beautiful, in its casting, cinematography, graphics and music. The story is rich and the immense timeline is artfully woven into small bites. There is also a deeper treatment of relationships and some mature but tasteful scenes. The draw for me was Marvel and the stellar cast, especially Gemma Chan, whose career I've been following for a long time, now (do yourself a favour and binge her filmography). I have to confess that when I left the theatre I wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. Then, I heard Rotten Tomatoes gave it the lowest of all ratings for a Marvel movie (49%) and the critics who saw early releases were brutal. But, I also read the positive reviews by ordinary theatre goers and in writing this, I've decided to give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 and, personally, I look forward to seeing it again. {Superhero Action Adventure}","60 out of 166 found this helpful.

But that's essentially the only enjoyable aspect of this film as many times i contemplated leaving. The plot is predictable and incredibly uninteresting with a story that lacks structure and constantly changes from flashback to present day, making it difficult to follow. Many characters are 2-dimensional with little to no character development. They are uninteresting and didn't come across as particularly memorable.There are definitely some good ideas here but the film's dull plot, flat character hierarchy and exhausting and unbearable fight scenes don't allow it to reach its potential.Lack of connection to greater MCU made the movie feel disconnected from the rest of the universe that it's meant to be based in. This was better done in guardians on the galaxy (2014).You know a movie is bad when you spend the entire viewing time thinking of a multitude of ways to which it could be improved.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Additionally, there were way too many characters with too complicated names.Some of the fight scenes were a lot of fun, but there was way too much dialogue for one film. Great movies knows how ""show"" just as much as tell.I think if this movie would have been off-Earth it could have been a lot better. The celestials were cool entities to bring in, but to have them on Earth just felt like a disservice.I can't think if anything good to say about the movie other than the effects.

No. Is it a film that breaks the boundaries of a Marvel film? Also no. Eternals is in this weird limbo where there is a lot of stuff I like but for everything I liked, there was something I didn't like. The film's visuals and directing are honestly some of the best in the series. The environments and shots look consistently great. Sometimes there is the awkward visual effect but that's expected at this point in Marvel. The music is pretty good at points but very forgettable at others which sucks because the good pieces are really gold but the bad pieces are really bad. Half of these characters I found interesting (Sersi, Ikaris, Sprite, Gilgamesh, and Druig) while the other half I found to be boring and uninteresting. Chlo√© Zhao is a great director but I'm not a big fan of her writing. I feel the same way about her previous film Nomadland. There is a lot of exposition that can be interesting sometimes when combined with the pretty visuals but also really boring. Sometimes they prioritize the exposition over character work which is one of the reasons I found some of these characters to be uninteresting. The action is this way as well where it can be really fun and different sometimes but other times it does nothing to stand out from other Marvel films. I am glad Marvel tried to do something much different. I truly am but it definitely could have been done better. I really hope the negative critical reception doesn't disuade Marvel from making something different in the future. I would really only recommend this if you are big into Marvel movies.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's nearly 2022, get your heads out of your straight, white minds' and deal with the fact that Marvel is becoming what it should be: diverse.Now, onto my review! I loved this movie! Chlo√© Zhao did an incredible job with the world-building around this new plot for setting up the new phase of the MCU. Not only that, the cast worked so well together to bring these characters to life. The on-screen connection between Gemma Chan's Sersei and Richard Madden's Ikaris made me go through so many emotions. And I was so happy to see that Phastos's marriage with his husband wasn't pushed to the side, we actually got to see them be cute and care for their son together.Overall, I loved the plot, the visuals, and the cast. I can't wait for this to be continued!","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

But perhaps kids could like this stuff?More bad: there are some great actresses starring in it, but unfortunately there are also a lot of below average other actors.Even more bad: the story is quite hard to follow.Concluding: not annoyingly bad, because it has got a gentle feel, but it is kinda boring.

(As written by their original creators, the Eternals are actually of Earth origin and was an offshoot of humanity that had been genetically enhanced a million years ago and became the genus Homo Immortalis, in case anyone was wondering). Even the color pallet was changed to a brownish-grey, dull and souless hue when, as drawn by Jack Kirby, the Eternals were actually one of the most vibrant, more akin to Thor Ragnarok.One of the reasons for the MCU's success was that it was a celebration of the best the comics had to offer. Now it would appear that they think they are cleverer than they really are and just want it to be a vehicle for whatever dross they want to put out themselves.This movie is dull, soulless and meandering. The whole logic and premise of it doesn't even make any sense whatsoever. Early on, the movie tells us (more than once) why the Eternals are forbidden to interfere in events like the infinity war. Later we are told of the Celestials' real agenda. That would have actually made Thanos enemy no.1. His plan to wipe out half of all life would have been catastrophic to every.single.planet they had a vested interested in.1/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

There's a lot of strengths this movie has:The script is legitimately excellent for a few reasons. It takes its time introducing the characters-I could have done with even more in this respect, especially with a couple of them. I was always engaged and genuinely curious.The writer understands multi-level stakes, which most super heroes simply do not nail at all. The consequences feel artificial and the action perfunctory. Not so here. Why? Because along with that the conflicts are all multilayered as well. There is not ""one side"" that's good and the participating characters all have far more nuanced beliefs and drives when it enters the climax.The story is simply written well at a craft level. It only gets more interesting and the implications of the result are super interesting and perfectly usher in Phase 4.The direction is great. Shot composition is excellent. Cinematography is phenomenal at some points. Amazing CGI. Very cool conceptually-far more interesting than most super hero movies (which I've seen all of them).I thought a couple scenes could breath more, and like I said, a few of the introductions feel slightly rushed. Then, one or two jokes don't land. Which is normal for me. Surprisingly, some did. Weird ones. So I'd call that even.Overall, this is exactly what Marvel movies needed. This is an intelligent script. It succeeds as a superhero film but also as a science fiction film, too. It's exciting and made me care about where this kinds of films are going, because they're becoming a bit workmanlike and overproduced. What a breath of fresh air.","48 out of 130 found this helpful.

Being a fan to the franchise, the Marvel Universe have really gone down to the lowest level of writings with this one. Why did they have to create such a mess? I wish I had gone with my gut feelings about skipping this one, but I went in anyways after checking 6.9 IMDB rating reluctantly.Writing is a backbone of any movie and CGI is a branch of that spine. With this one: CGI seemed to be the main course and Story was merely a single topping on it. Save yourself from the troubles of watching it in the theatre. Wait for it to release in Disney+, so you can at least change the channel.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It features so many things done amazingly from technical wizardry such as astonishing cinematography and mind blowing visual effects to the core elements such as triumphant acting, a (mostly) clever script, an intriguing story and subtle direction. I you want a movie that features the wildness and unpredictability of Quentin Tarintino mixed with Scorsese's exploration of life and humanity, you get Chloe Zhao's controversial masterpiece. Particularly Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Barry Keoghan stood out as actors who thus portrayed interesting, complex and fragile characters. Chloe Zhao gives her best work (after Nomadland) yet and the script-writing duo made quite a good story, albeit the story could have been more... perfect. Ben Davis' Cinematography is naturalistic and looks real, the score is fitting and the soundtrack just right. I am not too much of a fan regarding superhero movies but this doesn't feel like one. It does not feel like part of the MCU. Why the nativity then?Well, it is quite risky and you can expect some shocking conclusions to certain characters which was completely shocking to me. Some say the story is weak and yeah... that's all the criticism I could really define... Also, this might seem like a coincidence but the fact that a woman directed it and critics calling it a ""messy production"" (that's as vague as it goes:/). So go see it for yourself, it might just be on the best movies you'll see... or not great at all... Either way, in my opinion this is a true cinematic triumph that encompasses all parts of the medium to bring out the best in this genre.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

There was very little to connect with as these characters we aren't familiar with and they aren't exactly great. The lead of Sersi played by Gemma Chan was quite good and likeable yet the rest came off as generic and not interesting. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek are the most know actors of the film yet are reduced to supporting roles.The powers they displayed was a highlight, as was some of the fight scenes but overall the story just wasn't engaging and we didn't seem to care.With a reported budget of over $200 million, and making slightly over $400 million worldwide, we doubt there will be a sequel. And perhaps that would be for the best. This could possibly be the worst Marvel film. As this is the only Marvel film in the MCU to have a rotten score on RottenTomatoes (currently 47%). We will see what partakes in the future.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time. Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" are often very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better. I want Eternals 2 now!There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. Top marks in all categories and extremely high production value. 9/10 and I highly recommend.","60 out of 168 found this helpful.

It's tonally different from any Marvel film we've gotten and takes one further step into reflecting upon what ""super"" and ""hero"" in ""superhero"" means. The closest comparison would be Zack Snyder's Justice League.Nomadland director Chloe Zhao brings a freshness that diverts from the usual Marvel formula, though its arthouse sensibilities may turn others away. The film takes its sweet time introducing ten characters of the Eternals ensemble and cross-sections through each of their respective backstories.The story explores what god-like powers mean towards helping mankind, similar to Star Trek's Prime Directive. What is the right amount of help for mankind? Does helping mankind alter their destiny? Is humankind even worth helping?There is a tinge of Terrence Malick's sensibility where the camera stares blankly into nature's void, looking for life's answers watching waves crash on the beach.It is essential to see Eternals in IMAX. Ben Davis' cinematography is breathtaking but more importantly, it is the sheer scale of the frame that lets the nature shots overwhelm and engulf the audience. The IMAX shows what it is like seeing Earth from God's point of view.This poetic search for grandeur is what I enjoyed most about Chloe Zhao's vision. Eternals takes itself more seriously than other Marvel films and seeks gravitas. There's less of that trademark Marvel ""buh dum tss"" humour, which I deeply appreciated.All the time devoted towards its grand mythic storytelling comes at the cost of developing its core love story. The relationships between the Eternals members are told more than shown and are only skin deep. This unfortunately lessens the dramatic impact that it so needs at the end.I enjoyed Chloe Zhao's ambition and appreciated the breath of fresh air. Eternals is my favourite out of the Marvel Phase 4 thus far, including the recent Disney Plus shows. It's not for everybody and commercially-minded audiences may lose patience with it and it will most likely fly over kids' heads.Usually at the end of every Marvel film, I am long accustomed to feeling, ""That was fun but didn't really hang together. I guess they'll fix it in the sequel."" With Eternals, I wanted something more from it. It was so close to sticking that landing. So close.","31 out of 82 found this helpful.

A true and faithful adaptation of one of Jack Kirby's more peculiar brainchildren, the Eternals. By no means was the film perfect, but I believe what Chloe Zhao managed to accomplish was nothing short of remarkable. With all of the themes that were presented and explored (morality, free will and self determination, the burden of immortality, etc), and with the sheer number of characters she introduced us to, it was truly an incredible feat. By far Marvel's most ambitious movie to date, crossover events notwithstanding, and certainly it's most beautiful, both visually and poetically. The invigorating score, the captivating cinematography, the gorgeous visuals, the heart-pounding action, the use of real-world natural settings wherever possible, and of course, the brilliant performances by the cast- all the very best the MCU has offered.Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the story isn't perfect. There is more than one flaw, but ultimately, it can be boiled down to too much story, too little time. Why this was not a Disney+ show, I don't understand. Had all of the strengths of this movie been retained and the story was simply expanded upon without diminishing those qualities, this would've far surpassed any other Disney+ show to date. I only wish Marvel's top brass (yup I'm looking at you, Mr. Feige) had had the foresight to acknowledge that the task of introducing an audience to 10 new characters in a film, and expecting us to care for them, was simply a task too tall to handle, even in the hands of a capable Oscar winner. For what it was, and what it was given, this film was the best that it could be. I didn't find the plot to be convoluted as some have criticized, nor do I believe it was overly expository. In fact, it was in those moments of exposition that I found myself begging Marvel to dig deeper, to finally break through those seemingly immovable boundaries of the superhero genre and explore more mature, dramatic themes. Alas, I don't believe the time restraints of any feature length film would've afforded that opportunity.If Eternals did anything, it definitely showed us that Marvel is ready and willing to explore new themes; to break the mold; to rid themselves of that overbearingly repetitive formula. If Shang-Chi dipped its toe into new, fresh, and feel-different MCU waters, Eternals plunged its leg in. I hope this trend continues and eventually, they dive head first into the deep end. I honestly can't wait to meet these compellingly interesting characters again sometime soon. To say I'm excited about how this movie has expanded the Marvel universe to cosmic proportions would be a dramatic understatement. Outside of Infinity War, I haven't been more excited for an MCU sequel. I highly recommend watching this film, especially if you're a Marvel fan, but even more so if you're a Jack Kirby fan.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

And this movie really impresses!The bold, artistic vision of Chlo√© Zhao is brilliantly showcased, with expansive, natural landscapes and a sense of scale that will leave you in awe. The lightning fast pacing of other entries is replaced with a slower, more contemplative one that allows the audience to better digest and engage with the bigger and more complex themes of the movie.If there is a word for it, it is ""magnificent"". Magnificent imagery and ideas.As a huge fan of all things mythological, it is beyond exciting. Its pantheon of characters are embroiled in an archetypal mythological drama. Various mythological and historical references are cleverly woven into Marvel's own mythology and history.It brings a breath of fresh air to the Marvel Universe, while also greatly expanding its lore.The characters are incredible, as well as the actors portraying them. The special effects were among the best ever produced by Marvel, which is saying a lot. And the action is also impeccable and breathtaking.It's sad that the critic reviews were so confusingly negative and came out so early, because it preemptively poisoned the movie in many people's minds. It's punishing an amazing movie a disincentivizing Marvel from taking risks, which is very disheartening.I hope that for anyone reading, this review can at least convince you to watch it and judge it for yourself.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

I disagree with the very bad critics. This is a very good movie. I'm saying this without knowing the source material. So my review is based solely on watching this movie, without any acquired knowledge of the source material beforehand.The story is more interesting than what most comic book movie adaptions have to offer, due to its more philosophical approach. The story is also coherent and well paced. Too slow you think? No it's not! It's just allowing enough time to develop the characters of the Eternals and their emotional bonds among each other as well as the inner conflicts each one of them has. The Eternals use their powers consistantly during the movie, which gives the viewer stunning visuals and entertaining action. This movie is not boring!I read another critic that the Deviants hardly show up. I can't understand this critic. They are a recurring threat, from the very beginning, to the very end of the movie.The acting is good, not spellbinding, which is absolutely fine for a comic book adaption. My favourite performances are the ones from Madden as Ikaris and Nanjiani as Kingo.Be open to more than just a movie filled with some generic ""two super heroes face off in the streets of some big city"" scenes. Allow your mind to wander a bit and be open to the world of the Eternals.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Bollywood & Karun, foreign languages, black/white gay couple with adopted child, ... the list goes on and on. There even is an intentionally deaf-dumb Eternal only to give a deaf-dumb actor a bigger role which unfortunately does not match here (contrary to her role in The Walking Dead) but only disturbs the (painfully slow) pace and immersion further.Then we have a really bad script with almost consistently wooden characters who (with the possible exception of Sprite) have no empathetic backstory and between whom there is also no detectable chemistry. Not enough, there is no real character development, or rather, it is conveyed in such a blunt manner that you don't notice it. Of course, all the illogical decisions and behaviors don't make it any better, because, if you think about it more carefully, the entire plot makes no sense.--- SPOILER-START ---------------------------------Thena forms a clear threat to other Eternals because she has reached her memory capacity after 7000 years. But instead of eliminating this danger and erasing her memory, the others hesitate and so there are always unnecessary fights with her, which don't contribute anything to the plot at all and therefore suddenly disappear in the last third. The whole thing is only made more ridiculous by the fact that Ajak is able to remember millions of years.Sersi and Ikaris get married, although marriage as a religious and legal institution makes no sense at all for the Eternals, since they can neither ascend to any heaven, nor bear children, nor do they have to protect their family tree in order to bequeath any property to the children (of the husband). Here then also the question remains in the room, how after millennia the divorce took place, because Sersi is obviously single again.But even more glaring is the fact that the Eternals have no problem at all to consistently exterminate a certain species without ever questioning this. But then suddenly they get remorse and feel connected to humanity, elevating it above the evolution of zillions of other possible creatures/planets. Who does not recognize a hypocritical double standard here, I cannot help either.Then we come to the core of the story, in which Celestials are created from the ""energy of intelligent life"". To be precise: When a sufficient population size is reached, which the Eternals unwittingly ensure. The problems here can be broken down to 3 points:1) Energy is constant (relative to mass) and thus more people does not equate to more energy, as it is merely a conversion of energy.2) There is not simply more ""intelligence"" the more people live. On the contrary, the Eternals have to constantly supply humanity with technological inventions (starting with Sersi's dagger and Phasto's constant meddling) in order to increase their productivity and thus their population, which promotes their struggle for the unfortunately finite resources and ultimately also increases the corresponding number of victims more and more. What this has to do with intelligence remains a mystery.3) It also takes place after Infinity War and Endgame, which means that Thanos has wiped out half the universe in between. But that didn't seem to have bothered the Celestial(s) or the Eternals, although it might have delayed the population increase plan considerably.--- SPOILER-END -----------------------------------Last but not least, there are bad casting decisions. IMHO Madden and Hayek are just bad (you can see that especially in the key scene between the two.... they are just pretty faces/body but can't carry a scene) and Ninjiani can't fill a serious role (not coincidentally, he also got the role here to make stupid lines). Maybe Chan should have played a female Druigi, maybe Harrington should have played a male Thena, and Jolie should have played Sersi as a strong protagonist or Ajak. Who knows.But even that still wouldn't have solved the other problems that led to the wooden performance, with actors unable to work with such a poor script.To sum it up: Enjoy the visuals. Once.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Phase iv has not tempted me much so far. This one was the only one except for the new Spiderman and Dr. Strange movies I have considered. But all the bad reviews nearly put me off ever viewing it. So I went in with moderate expectations. And I am really shocked how much i disagree with most of the reviews. I think this is one of the better Marvel movies. Not the best, but among the best third of them.The scenery and cinematography is the most stunning in any marvel movies. It has an overall more adult and serious tone than most Marvel movies, but still has enough humor to not become too dark and moody. And for once there is actually something at stake and real twists that you did not see coming. Not every hero is alive by the end.The plot is more intelligent than usual with some real though provoking elements and not everything is black and white. A bit like the Captain America movies.Casting is much better than expected. From the trailers I got the impression that the casting was done purely to have as muh variety as possible. But when you watch the movie it comes off as quite natural and neccessary since the cast is big with lot of new heroes introduced fast. And all the actors do a great job breathing life into their characters.Some reviews complain about it being hard to follow and too much because not everything is told linear. But seriously.... I am not a huge fan of non-linear storytelling myself. But if this movie is too demanding for you then you have an attention-problem. Most of the movie happens in the present and is told linear with a few quick neccessary flashbacks. Nothing advanced.I just dont get why people dont like this. Nice characters, plently of great action that is directed very well so you know what is going on , fantastic effects, story among the better marvel efforts, best ever cinematography. I suspect that most of the bad reviews come from people that that hate it just because there is one gay character in it and a shory gay kiss that lasts 2 seconds. Seriously? What is the problem? Props to Disney for ""daring"" to do this although it can hardly be seen as controversial in 2022.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm a big fan of the cast, especially Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, and Lauren Ridloff. However, I found the movie unfollowable due to not caring, but it does make great background whitenoise though, so $236 Million dollars well spent. The movie leans heavily into Chloe Zhao's filmmaking style, which is great for character-driven Eternalsit really doesn't lend itself to the Marvel universe, especially with nine main characters.Eternals attempts to weave a needlessly complicated story without any real character development or emotional investment to speak of. Even my love of Kumail Nanjiani couldn't garner my attention. The plot felt way too thin to be this confusing, as it tried to cram way too much into one film without any kind of clear direction. The potential of the characters remained largely untapped, leaving me completely uninterested in if they lived or died, more less what their futures hold. The lack of depth made it impossible to care.Overall, Eternals was a real whiff, the type of bomb that would bankrupt smaller studios, it feels alot like the ""Heavens Gate"" fiasco actually. It's not fully the fault of Chloe Zhao, and I dont blame the cast; they did their best. The real issue lies with the mismatch between the director's style and the superhero genre, coupled with a garbage script. The ""Eternals will return"" tag at the end felt more like a warning than a promise. It'll be intriguing to see how Marvel addresses the problems this movies flop brings to the larger timeline.P. S.Those costumes were some of the ugliest, stupidest costumes I have ever seen, except Angelina Jolie's, she must have brought her own wardrobe.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I usually do it because my boyfriend likes to sometimes.In case you don't read it all, I do NOT agree with a 6.2, and most negative/low reviews. I think this movie is a solid 8.I started watching all Marvel movies (well, except Ant-Man, sorry) in August and recently started Phase 4.I quickly checked the reviews, because this phase has series which is new, and I wanted to see a general thought on this new phase. I saw that Eternals had 6.2, which is pretty low, but I didn't think much of it.When I reached Eternals, I remembered the low score but still wanted to give it a try, with my own thoughts (I didn't check any reviews or trailers, just saw the number when you Google a show/movie name).As I watched it, I was really enjoying it and did not feel like the score was deserved at all. More than halfway through the movie I was even wondering if the reason it was so low is because it was going to have a bad ending or something.But it did not. Most people say it's boring, a boring cast, a boring story, too much.I do not agree with any of it l. I think it's new, yet familiar. I loved the cast and how they portrayed so well all these characters. That despite there being quite a few characters, they showed each personality and troubles so well. Despite it all being new, I really felt like the story was well delivered. I never felt lost or confused. If anything, I wanted to know more. So to keep it short, because I do NOT agree with this score and want to bump it up, and to tell people to watch it and give their own thoughts, I really really enjoyed it, and I think it deserves a solid 8.The cinematography, the characters, the story, the heroes, the twists, everything! And they incorporated it well with our world too. I don't want to spoil anything, but please do watch it. I think it deserves more and hope to see more in the future.Honestly, it's the movies that Marvel does best. The epicness is always present, there is no fluff, which you are seeing in most of their series in thid phase. And Eternals is another show at how well their movies are done, even introducing so many new characters.We all do hope that soon they will bring it all together, in the epicness of Avengers, but the movies are still very good (better than the series in my opinion, except for Moonknight and WandaVision, although that one could've been a movie), but Eternals really shows their talent and how good they are at making super hero movies.So if you are wondering if it's worth it? Watch it. Give it a shot. Don't take others opinions before your own, ever!","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Really good special effects, the battles look really good and the Celestials are really good too.The story is really complete. All the side stories are necessary for us to understand the type of persons that each Eternal is. Yes, it's a really long movie, but for me it was eye catching the all time. The story is well delineated, the paralels with the ""real life"" are well done by mentioning several historical facts, and the most important thing to me the way that Zhao included several present day subjects like lgbtq+, religious differences (like ""I will never hurt you because of my beliefs""), war and more...
It is notable to mention the performance of Angelina Jolie. She is a beast. They could have explored more her mental condition and relationship with Gilgamesh and give ver more screen time, but I Aldo believe that in a next movie we will have that.Higly recommend the movie.

It had its moments, sure, but also plenty of head-scratchers. Like, eternal beings protecting humans? Talk about a cosmic sitcom waiting to happen. And the runtime? Let's just say it's longer than the Eternals' lifespans.Marvel really went all in with this one. It was like they took a shot in the dark and ended up hitting a metaphysical pi√±ata. Emotional? Definitely. But at times, it felt like waiting for your microwave popcorn to pop-slow and anticlimactic.The jokes? Well, they tried. But the laughs? Not quite there. Though, I have to give props to the VFX team. They must've pulled off some serious magic to salvage this one.And speaking of 'Eternals,' did anyone else notice Chloe Zhao's casting choices? It's like she had a vendetta against white American actors or something. I mean, we've got a lineup that looks like a United Nations meeting-Asian, African, Latin American... You name it, they're in there, unknown to the majority of the audience, and also a bit old for that type of roles, Maybe she's just got beef with the standard Hollywood crew. Or perhaps she's secretly plotting a cinematic revolution, one diverse cast at a time. Who knows? All I can say is, if there's ever a superhero movie about breaking stereotypes, Chloe Zhao's got it covered.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If I had to summarize, I would say it's trying too hard to mix X-Men, The Avengers, Dr. Strange and the first Thor movie all into one film.

That's what this film tries to pull.The movie wasn't great, but had the film been not been tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I would have been more lenient in my rating.The characters are unknown, the story is unfamiliar, it's only relationship to other Marvel movies is they briefly talk about Thanos & his wiping out half of all life. There are action scenes too. Remove all mention of Thanos & company & the movie would survive, especially because the mention of it sounds contrived.To avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate more.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Beautiful story, characters, score, visuals, themes. Everything in this film just felt like such a treat.What I loved most was how much there was to discover and learn. Eternals lifts the lid on a whole new world within the MCU and it was just a joy to get to know these new characters, who were all very different and exciting. I was concerned that introducing 10 characters would be a handful, but it was masterfully done. All of them felt well explored and developed and there were no weak links.As you'd expect from such a solid cast list the performances were great. Highlights were Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Angelina Jolie, all of whom were so captivating, but really all of the cast nailed it.I thought the plot was very interesting. A few unexpected twists and turns, moral quandaries, compelling themes, exciting if a little repetitive at times action. A bit of a deviance from the usual MCU formula but a most welcome one indeed.As mentioned the visuals were stunning. Zhao's direction can't be faulted and was complimented perfectly by the epic score provided by Ramin Djawadi.As a final point, because I've seen other reviewers accuse the film of being slow, the pacing was absolutely spot on. It flowed so well, took its time but was never meandering or lost. For a film that is over two hours thirty it absolutely flew by.I got everything I wanted and more from this film. It was a visual feast and an engaging and compelling story with complex characters. Arguably a bit of a risk for the MCU but it has massively paid off.","41 out of 120 found this helpful.

I knew nothing of the characters, the plot, anything. Basically the only thing I knew I got from the trailer.This isn't your typical marvel flick with mostly light hearted tones and the more serious stuff glanced over, this is a mostly serious film in my eyes, and I love it. Yes, you still get the jokes but it leans into the darker tones way more than you'd expect. We got a hint of this in Infinity War too, but here it is way better.Now let's address some typical points in the bad press this has gotten. One of those is that there's bad CGI, which like, did we watch the same film? Did I notice it? Of course, there's aliens made of purple string, how could I not. But it wasn't distracting nor immersion breaking in any way. The film also didn't fall into the typical trope of large CGI marvel fight ending. Was there a fight? Yes. But it wasn't the ""let's fight thousands of faceless monsters"" type of fight. It was a personal struggle between characters you got to know through the film, and got me several times emotional.Overall, I'd say give this film a go (as if you weren't to already). Just please, don't trust the bad reviews.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The VFX are on another level, although the finale is a bit too ""grand"" for lack of a better word, the first 90% of the movie for the most part was quite grounded and slower than most MCU movies which was very welcome as it suited the style of this story and characters, plus gave us something new and refreshing to the franchise.The big finale was classic Disney, in a way that was a little disappointing, a massive CGI sequence that felt a bit out of place from the rest of this brave movie, they somewhat chickened out and were too afraid to let the film climax on its own terms. A very in-your-face reminder that MCU have a formula, there are a few moments like this.I stilled loved it, the speedster looked so good The Flash movie really has to bring it to satisfy now. The amount of beautiful shots have no right to be in a MCU movie it was wonderful. The deep and complicated relationships within a diverse and interesting group of characters makes the movie immersive and relatable. It also has some profound questions at its core. I can't wait to see these characters again, Phase 4 has completely exceeded my expectations so far.One terrible after credit scene that made me very nervous for the future of the MCU (not funny or cool). And a second one that is really intriguing and exciting.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is completely different from every other mcu movie and that's really refreshing and something that should happen more often.The movie explores the life of the eternals and their personal change over thousands of years. It shines with its ability of putting different beings into the spotlight of becoming humans and explores the variety of characters that are formed over the years. This movie with multiple characters is more intimate and tragic than every other mcu movie out there that features only one main character. Zhao manages to draw beautiful characters in such a short time and combined with her teams skill in cinematography and the actors ability to act every nuance of the characters she manages to bring an incredible experience of a movie onto the screen that I hope we will see more frequent in the next few years.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's more than the basic moral questions built into the comics genre, namely good versus evil; the responsibility coming with power; and who's watching over the watchmen? Which for themselves are deep moral questions that all the best comic based movies dealt with. This one asks us questions about free will; the overall sanctity of life; what is the nature of evolution? Do creatures that were created eternals and made to remain the same for eternity - Do they really remain the same?All these questions (and some I chose not to mention here to keep this thing from going way too long) push this comics saga into the realm of true science fiction. A realm only the X-Men visit regularly while other comics based movies only touch upon fleetingly. This is not a complaint - I love sci - fi with all my heart, I also love good comics, but the combination is really my personal favorite combination. Thing is, this calls for some very deft writing and directing - mission accomplished - It does make the movie slightly slower than most comics based movies but I found the story so riveting I hardly felt the time passing. The acting is superb, and I don't know who to commend because they all do their jobs as well as I could imagine it. The visuals, as some already mentioned here, are amazing, including some very nice timepieces that look spot on.Bottom line I loved it. It could easily sink into platitudes and slogans - but the writing and the acting kept it real. Go see it, but know in advance that you're stepping into uncharted territory.","26 out of 74 found this helpful.

There is no pacing or structure. Just scene after scene jumping back and forth through history and the present to try develop a connection with the characters. Completely unsuccessfully. The characters are totally forgettable backed by awful performances. Barry Keoghan as Druig gave one of the worst displays in acting I've ever seen.

It was an eye candy watch for seeing the attractive Gemma chan and Salma Haye as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Angelina Jolie,who has portrayed the character of Thena,was incredible ""at her age"". Another thing I liked about the movie was its shooting across a varieties of locations around the globe including Spain, England , the US,Fuertaventura and Lanzarote. Moreover the action and VFX scenes were thrilling and fascianting. Another thing I particularly liked about the movie being an Indian is its showcasing of the ancient Gupta aempire and tradition. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I recommend this movie if u r a MCU fan. The movie won't disappoint u.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I didn't want to see this movie, but my friend bought me a ticket so I decided to go see it with him. I sat through the entire movie bored and confused at what was happening and why. They started setting up all the eternals super hurriedly, and spent the rest of the movie trying to finish setting them up through the entire movie, and character motivations were introduced, but then they wouldn't really go anywhere, some characters would die and it was hard to care because we barely had any time to get to know them. The humor was ok, but often a bit out of place. The characters' powers also weren't clearly defined so it was hard to really understand everything they could do. Probably my least favorite part though was the villain had potential to be super interesting, but his motivations were wasted on a character that was way too powerful for his own good. It seemed like he couldn't be harmed or beaten, and even when it seemed like he met his match later on in the movie, he just breaks free of whatever restraints were holding him and goes to confront the ""main character"" if you could call her that. This movie didn't know what it was doing. It was rushed, bland, uninteresting, and was riddled with so many plot holes that were even apprentice from watching the movie once. Not recommended, stay far away. In fact stop watching MCU movies. They're not that good.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just pretend this movie was never made. Or it happened in a multi-verse far away from the main one which is inhabited by characters I like such as the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers & Spider-Man. Despite volcanos etc popping up no existing Marvel characters appear in this film so this makes sense.Please don't pollute the MCU with its ridiculous messy mythology or over populate it with these boring, bland characters. The Eternals are like old, pompous, serious power rangers.Most of the action in the film is the Eternals fighting the Deviants (not sexual), CGI video game like monsters, who randomly show up and are the reason for the eternals existence. Such lame antagonists. The rest of the movie is politics between the Eternals who apparently sit around dormant for 1000s of years between these Deviant attacks.I'm amazed we got through this movie, although I did nod off at one point. When ""The Eternals will return"" text came up on screen at the end, everyone I was with groaned ""No!"" in unison. It was like a threat rather than something to get excited about. Marvel, if you have to, please leave it an eternity before making a sequel. Unless the sequel involves killing all the Eternals. P. S.

I don't see where the hatred is coming from. Of course it is not the typical MCU type movie. This movie started a new era and new dimension in MCU...
I personally enjoyed the movie!! Some great drama is shown. The jokes were also okay ( I know that the jokes in Shang Chi was much better but that doesn't mean the jokes in eternals are dull) and there were some scenes in the middle and in the end part of the movie where I literally cried watching.If any of you reading this review and trying to decide whether to watch this or not then I will say if you just want to watch a action MCU type movie then don't watch it but if you really want to invest yourself in the MCU universe and want to show some new dimensions then it is a must watch movie.Bonus tip : Dont miss the mid credit and the end credit scene.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"8","/10","This is the best MCU movie in years","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7984445/?ref_=tt_urv","LivingWitness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62331611/?ref_=tt_urv","19 March 2022","Here's the short version of what I think about Eternals: it's the best MCU movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and I wouldn't be too surprised if the main reason a lot of people don't like it is because it's tonally different from a lot of the other MCU movies.Especially early on, Eternals doesn't depend on a lot of exposition heavy scenes. It's trying to tap into more visual forms of storytelling. Really, the closest thing it gets to heavy exposition is a very Blade Runner-esque text prologue at the start.Eternals is also much less reliant on comic relief than other MCU movies. It's not totally humourless and it does have a couple of comic relief moments, but it's not like Guardians of the Galaxy or Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings where the comic relief stuff is injected into every single scene, even when it's not really needed.Both of these things are good changes for the franchise. Generally speaking, audiences are smart enough to follow what's happening without having every little thing explained to them, and the comic relief aspects of the MCU movies (especially the recent ones) have tended to be the weakest elements.The other big difference between Eternals and other MCU movies is that this one has a slower pace. I feel like this is much more of a mixed bag.On one hand, there are a couple of points where this slower pacing does make the movie feel bloated. Eternals could have been twenty minutes shorter and it would have been better for it.On the other hand, if only fifteen or twenty minutes needed to be shaved off for this movie to be better, then it's much less bloated than other recent superhero movies.Plus, I feel like this slower pace allows Eternals to develop its characters more fully. Eternals does better at character development than the overwhelming bulk of the MCU stuff to date.None of this is to say that the movie is some kind of Earth shattering intellectual experience that'll change your life forever or anything like that. The story is still pretty simple, and it's still dealing with a lot of the found family type elements that previous MCU movies have dealt with. However, I feel like this is a slightly more mature look at that concept, and I hope the franchise decides to continue down this road.In terms of the action sequences, Eternals does well. Each of the team has their own powers, and they're able to use them effectively. They also generally feel like much more of a cohesive team than The Avengers, and are generally able to work together without acting like children. The action sequences in this movie are some of the best in the MCU to date.Overall, I think Eternals is the best MCU movie in years. It's a break from other MCU movies tonally speaking, but this is a good thing because it'll allow the franchise to grow. Really, my only major complaint is that it's taken Disney this long to come out with a superhero movie that attempts to go down this road stylistically.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only reason I am writing this is in the 1/1000000000 chance someone from Marvel reads it.The cast is stellar, the visuals are amazing, but the script and dialog are awful. The movie seemed very slow at the beginning and then rushed at the end like they were not sure how to finish it. Many of the side comments and back stories that play a larger role at the end of the movies came across as filler and lacked real purpose. I am not sure how this movie was pieced together but the formula for this movie was the worst marvel has ever used (mind you, I enjoyed all versions of the fantastic 4, which many did not). I was so excited and so very disappointed all in a near 4 hour window. Spider-Man: NWH and Avengers: Endgame can be 3 1/2 hours because I have emotionally invested 13 years to their build up. I have zero emotional investment in this film based on B marvel characters. I need to time to learn and invest, not have their histories force fed at high speed. I recognize and understand that it may seem like these characters should be easy to relate to because they are taught in most 7th grade classrooms across the country but people attending this movie haven't learned Greek mythology in at least 10 years. A 13 year old would love it but the 23 year old that grew up watching Iron Man in 2008 has long since forgot who Athena is.Again. I loved the idea, the cast, the visuals, almost everything (and I know a lot of wonderful people worked so very hard on this film) but the part that matters most needs flat out redone: depth, dialogue, and delivery.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Since no asking seems to have been done, isn't that just stealing?One character is so much like Superman that one of the lesser characters says that he IS Superman, but the greater character rebuffs the child by saying he doesn't do capes. Batman is mentioned as well, and the powers of the Flash are borrowed, even though they are already borrowed from Mercury to the Romans and Hermes of Greek Mythology. But that's not the only one. Most of the main characters are derived from either Greco Roman Mythos or Hindi Mythology, and even more remote fables. One of the most amazing parts is that it steals so much from DC Comics without a single mention. :-(We have seen all of the super powers before, with different capes.

After watching it for the first time I am starting to think all those people are completely tasteless.Addressing some of the critics I have red:1. Characters aren't relatable... Oh really, so you can relate to a 12 foot green ""Bigfoot"" and a super smart billionaire with his own power armor but this is too much?? It's a superhero movie for crying out loud!2. Not funny... I am sorry you were born without humor. It's one of the funnier Marvel's I've seen.3. It's overreaching... Yes it's called expanding the franchise. We have had our typical superheroes and tones of content like it. After ""End Game"" it makes perfect sense they are heading in this direction. Exploring more of the universe and looking at the MCU on a broader scale.4. Tooo long... Nope, it's perfect. They take the time to cover the relationships between the different Eternals over a time span of thousands of years. To make sure we get the full picture and get to know them. So nope, not to long. It's a MOVIE.5. VFX look poor... Yeah, those are just some spoiled people. Not even worth mentioning.6. It raises more questions than it awnsers... Again, this is because we are expanding the franchise. It's part of the fun you know. And if you watched till the end you'd know the ""Eternals"" are returning.7. I could go on but I think you get my point.All in all pretty solid movie. Loved the actors and music as well. Only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because they keep their suits on for to long, at the beginning of the movie. Makes them feel out of place sometimes. But again they are Eternal so what do I know.Can't wait to see how this will fit in with the ""Guardians of the galaxy"" if they decided to move in that direction. And to all my sweet reviewers out there, remember it's only my personal opinion. Nothing personal.Much love.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

However, before watching ""Eternals,"" I wasn't surprised - super hero fatigue is the newest disease that seems to be infecting the public. All of that said, imagine my genuine shock when the credits rolled and I found myself actually having enjoyed this movie quite a bit. ""Eternals"" isn't perfect, but its genuinely exciting action, intriguing narrative, and shocking surprises make for a super hero movie that, while not breaking the mold, doesn't fit perfectly into it.""Eternals"" starts strong with an action sequence taking place in the year 5000 B. C. Featuring our titular heroes, the Eternals are shown fighting monsters known as the Deviants. The Eternals' powers are depicted in all their spectacular glory, and while many of them are similar to specific DC counterparts (The Flash and Superman will come immediately to mind), it doesn't make this sequence, and their powers, any less exciting. The Eternals aren't afraid to slice, dice, and otherwise demolish the Deviants, which can make for some brutal fights, especially for a Marvel movie. However, one thing that can and will manage to put a damper on your enjoyment of this film's action is the fact that many of the sequences take place in dimly lit, nighttime environments. No doubt an attempt to save money on computer generated images, this stylistic decision makes many action scenes difficult to comprehend - as you can imagine, this is particularly infuriating because, after all, ""Eternals"" is an action film.That said, even if I had to strain my eyes to decipher the onscreen happenings, I found myself enjoying the action scenes as a whole because, well, I started to really take a liking to many of the characters. Yes, ""Eternals"", which is no doubt a long film, does contain the trademarked Marvel mediocre dialogue and rushed characterization. So I'm not sure if it was the charisma of the actors and actresses or what, but I began to truly find myself entertained by the Eternals and their interactions with one another. Richard Madden as Ikaris and Lia McHugh as Sprite were the two standouts for me; usually I dislike child actors in films, but Lia was very good playing an immortal super hero who so desperately wants to live a normal life. Richard Madden's Ikaris was immediately likable - headstrong and cocky when he wants to be, and resilient and steadfast when he must, Ikaris brought some genuine surprises in this film, especially in the last act. Most of the other actors were good as well, but unfortunately, underutilized. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek play small, but pivotal roles in this movie; they are both top tier actresses, so I was really hoping they'd play a bigger part. Barry Keoghan as Druig is also a show stealer, with one scene in particular featuring him being my favorite of the entire film.The story that ""Eternals"" decides to tell may not be the freshest, but the way it is told is certainly unique. Featuring scenes that take place in both modern day and in the past, ""Eternals"" feels like a sprawling adventure. Chlo√© Zhao's directing adds a stylistic flair that is much needed, especially when compared to the other fairly flat looking Marvel movies. She is also unafraid to tell this story by shocking the audience; I found the twists and turns to be very unexpected - I won't spoil them in this review, but let's just say the formulaic CGI boss battle that most super hero movies employ isn't necessarily the direction that Zhao decides to take this story.Honestly, I'm slightly shocked by how poorly received this film has been. When compared to other films in the MCU, ""Eternals"" is, in my opinion, one of the better ones. Much less predictable and formulaic, this film's unique story and entertaining characters makes for an enjoyable super hero experience.","30 out of 90 found this helpful.

The fans of the source material hate it, those unfamiliar with the source material but love marvel movies hate it. These characters and the actors/actress that play them are awesome but could have easily been brought to screen in other IPs.The movie suffers greatly from lackluster performances, a convoluted plot, being about an hour to long, at times 1990 CGI and way to many characters to give any real time to flesh out, show heart or sympathize with.I guess with as many hits Marvel has had recently they were due for a stinker of a film. Here's hoping this doesn't start a permanent trend.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Poor acting, weak script, forced attempts to maintain character balance and some weird CGI. It's not worth the money spent and quite frankly, directors and producers should not be allowed to create anything similar in the future.The script has major gaps that are not explained and the ending is both predictable and rushed. The superpowers of certain hero's are also closer to X-men universe rather than Avengers'.Icaris, would benefit from acting classes. Humour attempts were also bad, I mean, really bad making the movie even more boring.

Honestly, if made as a series, this could have had the potential to grow to something truly great. I still don't understand why they are so afraid of that. Though another alternative, this could have done well if only Marvel lessened the characters, as some of them could be removed and have no drastic effect on the plot whatsoever, such as Kingo, Sprite, and Druig.Anyway, now the special effects and CGI. Most of them look downright clean and perfect, but some, for some strange reason, look like they came out of a low-budget sci-fi movie. I, nor anyone else I know, understand how this is possible considering the massive budget this movie has; 200 million USD.Not to mention how boring this is. Sure, the fights kept me engaged, the scenes with the Celestials kept me engaged, but other than that, the movie is drowned by talking and talking and talking, most of which have mediocre dialogue.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The visual effects in some of the scenes were amazing and if only they had more of it, it would have been great. The few problems I have with this movie is how forced it felt. The forced comedy (thank god they didn't forced Indian accent on the Indian characters though), second, so many tears so often. And it felt forced for almost all the time. Another major drawback was chemistry between characters, they had none. Neither friendship nor love felt real. It was un-Marvel like. Third, there was a change of heart by lead character and the only explanation was some cliches such we they have seen so many good things in people and so on but there were no scenes portrayed that connect which was created by humans being humans. And you guys had Angelina Jolie and you wasted it! Unforgivable. There are some basic plot line gaps, some illogical explanations about their avoidance in interfering during Thanos and other catastrophic events which really makes this one a dud. Avoid it as it has no relevance to rest of the MCU and you are likely to miss nothing whatsoever.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Yes, it's long and slow in places, but I've generally got a short attention span and I coped fine.For me, this is the most interesting Marvel film in a while, not for the discussions about ""Where have they been for thousands of years?"", or ""What have they done to influence mankind?"", but for the interactions between the characters, and how they come to discover things about themselves and each other. They're a fascinating bunch, and I enjoyed just seeing them together. (Also the lead actors tend to 'under-act' (is that the phrase?) quite a bit, which was refreshing.)The main plot is somewhat thin, but the scenery makes up for it, it's a beautiful-looking film (especially the last act).","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Truly I could have watched entire movies just exploring them. To be honest they were so good that it felt kind of jarring to watch the Eternals in their superhero getup walking around them, like if you added aliens to the Harry Potter-verse or something. It just kind of clashed.The Celestials and space scenes were incredible too, and the golden geometric aesthetics of their powers were sooo pretty, much more visually pleasing than the usual metal and fire explosions you normally see with superheroes.The plot was definitely slow, but the one by one introductions to each of the characters modern day lives was interesting and made up for the lack of plot development. However once everyone was introduced i feel like the plot started to go downhill to the point where i was kind of bored through the final fight sequence.It's apparent to me at least that Marvel put a lot more effort into filming locations, special effects and getting big name actors than they put into the plot line and story telling, which is unfortunate as the concept in general could expand indefinitely for future movies so hopefully marvel fans can look past that before they write this movie off as a flop.Gemma Chan was not a good choice for the lead role. Her acting and vibes were bland to the point where the character was boring and forgettable even though she was supposed to be the center of the movie, She didn't have the presence the movie needed for a main character, and the story fell flat because of it.I really liked Kumail Nanjiani's performance as Kingo, he def added life to what otherwise would probably have been a bland group dynamic. Druig's character was interesting, but I felt he could have had a more complex role and I'm hoping he has more going for him in the next movie. I absolutely LOVED how the Eternals communicated with Makkari in sign language, I thought that was a great affition to the movie and dynamics between the characters.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's boring and doesn't really fit with the other MCU movies in tone, style or anything.The casting is also a bit odd, some of it is well casted, other parts are just strange cast decisions, again, what were they trying? The film doesn't fit at all and totally wastes some excellent characters and their potential.Ultimately, it doesn't matter what the audience thinks as they will just make sequels and redos (already read they plan a sequel...) but they should really rethink doing anything further with this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A truly original take on the superhero genre, which may explain all the negativity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8065488/?ref_=tt_urv","cherold","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0011762/?ref_=tt_urv","16 April 2022","I always think it's weird when Hollywood producers grab some trendy indie director to direct a big-budget action movie. But for the most part those director jump right in and make the movie expected of them. And the interesting thing about director Chlo√© Zhao is that yes, she's made a big-budget action movie with monsters and an epic story and lots of bantering, but she's also made a movie that feels of a piece with her Oscar-winning Nomad Land - a contemplative movie about people trying to navigate life.Those people are the Eternals, alien superheroes with typical powers (laser vision, speed, etc.) who came to earth centuries ago to protect humans from freaky monsters.After the monsters were all wiped out, they stayed and just ... lived their lives quietly. Until, as happens, monsters reappear and stuff starts getting weird. And it's time for an Eternals reunion.This movie has the action set pieces one expects (one of which takes place during a twilight that makes it irritatingly difficult to see what's happening) and some cool twists, but it also has a *lot* of personality-driven drama.In a way, Zhao is the anti-Zack Snyder. Snyder made superheroes into Gods, Zhao, more radically, turns them into people faced with tough, morally-complex problems. And while they both choose a limited color palette, Snyder's is stylishly desaturated while Zhao's is, as in Nomadland, more blandly realistic.I feel this is a reason this movie has gotten such a poor reaction. Superhero movies come with a set of expectations, and I think some people would prefer a bad movie that plays to those expectations (like Venom) over a good movie that flouts them.Yes, there are issues. The visuals are too muted, and there are absolutely things in the whole concept that can be picked apart pretty thoroughly (if you're not occasionally saying ""but wait! What about ..."" then you're not paying attention. But this movie has both what I expect from action movies - the banter, the action, the impossible odds - and some stuff I didn't expect but thought was really interesting.I think it's a shame this movie wasn't better liked, because it really broadens the possibilities for the genre. I suspect what will happen now is Zhao will not get offered more blockbusters and Eternals 2 will hire a conventional director who will make a conventional MCU film that pushes all the proper buttons. And hey, I *love* those buttons, but I also like it when new buttons are introduced. (Just read that Zhao will do Eternals 2 so I was thankfully wrong. Yay!)TLDR; this movie is way better than people are saying and I highly recommend it.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

I've seen every single marvel movie (and series) and i think it's one of the best movies that marvel has created.The characters are fun and so, SO diverse. People from all different types of life can really connect and root for characters that they can see within themselves, and i'm sorry that all of the 30+ white men are pressed that there's not another steve rodgers or doctor strange taking the role. Personally, i think that one deaf kid deserves a character that they can cheer on.I do have to admit, you can't really watch this movie with the rest of the marvel franchise in the back of your mind. Thankfully, chloe zhao does a good job of making the film about the eternals alone, so it's not hard to mindlessly enjoy this movie without thinking about how it connects to the blip or captain america and the winter soilder. I'm curious to see how she'll carry the characters if there's a sequel, but for now, i'm perfectly happy in enjoying them in this film.Basically, if you're a sucker for films revolving around family drama (think of a knock-off, less r-rated, umbrella academy), interesting and intriguing characters, and won't be mad if you're favorite white-boy doesn't appear in the marvel tl of this movie, i full-heartily think you should watch this movie.Signed, somebody who is not a 30+ year old white male, with way too much iron man collectibles.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I read the negative reviews and promptly ignored them like always. After the last Avengers movie, I noticed the interest for the MCU had noticeably declined. Don't put down a movie just because it's the cool thing to do. Externals isn't the best but it's a fantastic movie. It came with the typical Marvel cheesy humor that's in every movie/show so everyone saying the dialogue is bad, every MCU is cheesy af. Stop being sheep, go watch the movie, decide for yourself and don't be another passenger on the hater bandwagon.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, where The Eternals really struggled was the pacing. Some scenes felt too long and drawn-out, while other moments - and indeed entire characters - often felt neglected. Most problems appear to be caused by the overly ambitious scope of the project, introducing 10 new characters over a span of 7000 years. Perhaps these issues could have been rectified by making this into a series? Overall, this is a great experience for any fans of the MCU, or those who just want a decent movie to watch for a few hours.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I watched this movie 2 weeks ago and I couldn't tell you every one of them if you held a gun to my head.It tries to be grand and epic, almost like Dragon Ball, but it stretches itself so thin. The plot flashes back thousands and thousands of years, from the dawn of Man to the ancient Aztecs, to the point where it feels entirely detached from anything going on in the MCU, which is really the only reason you would want to watch this.The finale is made out to be a gigantic, world-ending event but I will be shocked if anything about this movie ever comes up again.If you want to watch a two-and-a-half hour superhero movie on an epic scale, you're better off re-watching Infinity War.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I walked in expecting a boring outing, and was totally proven wrong thank goodness.The story of the Eternals is massive and there are 10 new faces to the MCU, so it is understandable why the story and some scenes kind of move along fast. Yet Eternals doesn't waste any time at all, it intertwines the past with the present.The themes and metaphors to life, religion, and mythology are just astounding. The acting is great. The dialogue isn't always the most verbose for it has a massive story and alot of characters, but by the end of the film you get that old Avengers feeling again. The action was sick and the heroes all utilize their powers correctly, unlike Ant Man who could have shrunk and destroyed Thanos from the inside out.Overall go see it! This is one of the better Marvel movies!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Together we have been rudely awakened by a movie that claims to be the next evolution of the Marvel universe movies, except it's not. Not even close. The first 30 minutes of poorly executed storyline, character development and editing blunders? Is then followed by more of the last 30 minutes. From actors and actresses that have past their used by date, to absolutely stuffing up the once upon a time, well crafted villains - the ones you used to hate but almost sympathise with as their character development had depth and purpose. If I was to sum up this movie in two words it would be... yawn, followed by trash. Maybe the Other way around? Even DCs infamous Martha line tops this movie.

She is not your average action director. Zhao's perpetration in filmmaking is a journey through a medium of human empathy and emotion. Whilst this movie does not strive to be the next ""Endgame"", Zhao's employment of extended character responses, and thus the lack of any meaningful action act to challenge the essence of humanity within us.Yet at the same time, this challenges the foundations of the MCU.The positives... The visuals are INCREDIBLE. The continuous entanglement and subsequent evolvement of golden lines and formations are majestic visual features that have burned into my memory. The cast smashed it (what did you expect?) and Richard Madden & Gemma Chan outperformed their expectations.Also, the score was excellent, and seeing as Ramin Djawadi scored this film, I would have expected nothing less.However, the flip side in Zhao's direction is the very thing it aims to achieve. From a blanket point perspective, there are simply too many characters and too many threads of development. Therefore, the whole film can be very confusing if you lack the pre-reading.Furthermore, the film was 2hr 40min long. At times, it felt like a maddened rush to force the audience to accept every Eternal, despite many people not even knowing their names at the end.The ending was a tad underwhelming and I feel that with the emotive characterization Zhao employed, I feel that Ikaris should have carried his rage further before flying into exile, despite the comics.That being said, Eternals is a solid film, and with the excessive character introduction established, I am thoroughly looking forward to part two!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is about an immortal alien race that has been living among humans for centuries without interfering in their conflict. Their main enemy as they know are Deviants which can exterminate humanity and even kill the seemingly immortal Eternals. One Eternal, Sersi lives in London with another fellow Eternal Sprite as they try to enjoy what human life has to offer. Once the Deviants return however, they along with Ikaris stop it from destroying London. They decide to search for the other Eternals around the globe to stop the Deviants' return and await Arishem's return.Eternals was a movie I was excited for the moment I heard about it. The more I learned about it, the more I was looking forward to it. It just seemed so different from all of the other Marvel films that I wanted to see how the story would unfold. Also, I loved Chloe Zhao' as last film, Nomadland. There was a lot for this movie to deliver on. Does it deliver on the story and material?I don't know how Eternals fares as an adaptation to the comics so my review is solely based on how this movie operates as a movie. As a movie, it is a huge mixed bag. Let's talk about the good stuff. First of all, the cast is terrific. This is one of the most diverse casts I have ever seen in a blockbuster and I appreciate how Chloe Zhao makes sure every single character gets some limelight throughout the film. Some characters are more developed than others, but they all feel like they have at least some hidden depths and chemistry. Some particular standouts are Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo who is as charismatic as he is funny, Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Don Lee as Gilgamesh and Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. They brought their characters to life and made them feel like people with conflicting emotions rather than just soulless robots of an alien race. Another standout for me is Harish Patel as Karun. He made for an amusing comic relief, but when he had serious scenes, he executed them perfectly. He knew when the tone got more serious and he has some great emotional moments in the film. Finally, I liked Richard Madden's performance as Ikaris. He plays the stoic character with some insecurities very well. This is a great ensemble cast and they deliver some great performances.I also thought the movie was great on a technical level. The cinematography is solid, the visuals are stunning and the action scenes are outstanding. They flow so well and the camerawork is some of the best in the MCU. The final battle features this camera work in action. It uses the powers of all of the Eternals at the scene. I thought the costumes were pretty good as well. However, this is where things start to go south for this movie...My biggest problem with Eternals is the script. It's a hot mess. This is easily one of Marvel's most ambitious films because of the huge cast and the themes of humanity, pleasures and compassion, but the movie has a lot more exposition than it should have. It also has some jarring tonal inconsistencies. This film has many out-of-place comedic moments that kind of fall flat for the most part. I did get a chuckle here and there, but I think this had the worst humor in an MCU film. A lot of it has to do with the timing. There were so many times I feel like the movie was starting to take a serious direction and then a gag randomly pops up and spoils the mood. When the film tries to be dramatic and intense with the Eternals reflecting on how they can influence and impact humanity, it comes off as melodramatic. The scene in Hiroshima particularly standouts as does the scene right before they split up.The pacing is what really frustrates me. The movie is two and half hours long. While that is a long runtime, it makes sense for a movie like this that has a lot of material to cover. The problem is that it feels like the story progresses so slowly. It takes forever to move from one country to another and some of the flashbacks can be pretty confusing. I feel like there were a lot of scenes that could have been sped up such as Arishem's conversation with Sersi or one of the dinner scenes with Gilgamesh.While I liked most of the characters in the film, I do think they could have been better developed in some areas. Particularly, Sersi ends up being the most vanilla character in the movie despite being the focus. She has very little personality traits or depth aside from being an all-loving and altruistic hero and being fascinated with iPhones. Every other character in the film has more interesting traits than her. Ikaris could have also been more interesting as well, but there is a twist that helps him. Sersi on the other hand? No offense to Gemma Chan who does her best with what she is given, but Sersi is probably one of my least favorite protagonists in a comic book movie. I just never got attached to her at any point.Eternals has its ups and downs, but ultimately, it is a letdown. I think it could have been overhyped after Chloe Zhao won Best Director at the Academy Awards but even then, there are too many problems with this film. There is a lot of good in here and I was always curious to see what would happen in each scene, but it is not enough to save the movie entirely. I hate to say it because it is clear Chloe Zhao and everyone else who worked on this film were trying to create something truly special and unique from Marvel and in some ways they did. However, this movie shows why ambition alone does not make an amazing film.Despite all my problems with this film, I am happy that I saw it. It helped me clear my mind of stress and rebuild my excitement for films.Just like any Marvel film, stay through the credits.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

It was the opposite of inspiring, and had no true heart or hope in it. It was boring, difficult to relate to, and was the first movie I've ever asked for my money back. I'm pretty sure the only reason its gotten any good reviews is because of the popular actors and fact that it is supposed to be a marvel movie in the marvel universe. Gross error in a line of fantastic and inspiring movies and stories. It will soon be forgotten about because there was nothing significant in it, just fancy attempts to put seemingly strange agendas in a highly expensive production.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

Bad and horrible Indian portraying and presentation. Is this what Hollywood thinks about India and Certainly about Bollywood. What a crap. Writing department did all the mess with this movie. I thought Captain America First Avenger and Thor the Dark World were the worst movie from Marvel. This movie succeeds those to suck even more. This is a pure arrogance of Marvel to produce any movie to be overconfident to make money.I didn't give a damn when ever a character was dying. Only 2 characters were good.It's bad to see Batman and Superman jokes used in a marvel movie. Batman and Superman are the most favourite superhero comic characters in the world.Now coming to character writing. How come an Eternal is Deaf and yet she is has super power. If they are not human doesn't it mean they won't have human disability. This is called stupid writing.Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were only good characters. Angelina Jolie was wasted. Kit Harrington was there for no reason at all.Mesopotamia Civilisation was done so badly.Too much blue, purple colour used for the civilisation. This is what happens when you lack story and screenplay writing with research about the civilisation.Couple of shots were beautiful such as Sun set shots and The tree scene were Angelina Jolie was painting. That's all.Cinematography was good. Locations were good. CGI was hit and miss. Music was forgettable.Too many unnecessary characters.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","With 157 Mins, Marvel's Eternals Feels a Bit like an Eternity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7530394/?ref_=tt_urv","iamianiman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2021","No offense, Phase 4 of the MCU films has been nothing but a streak of okay-ish films for me. It seems that the bar has been set low compared to previous phases which did live up to audience's expectations.Marvel's Eternals is the first MCU film to ever receive a rotten score and it is also the lowest rated MCU film to date in Rotten Tomatoes. But how? After all these years they have produced such quality superhero films, how can Eternals be worse than Thor: The Dark World?Throwing the linear mode out of the window, Eternals jumbles back and forth manifesting a sequence of incoherent narrative that feels misplaced and sudden, skipping centuries of backstory that ultimately impacts the emotional weight the whole movie should carry.With a tangled narrative of character developments, one cannot feel emotionally invested, barely touching the base of humane values, wasting an expedition that solely relies on the A and B-list casts. Some downfalls & deaths feel apathetic leading Eternals to one of the more forgettable MCU films.The core issue this movie has is its problems of sourcing its screen time for the characters justly and equally. Half of the characters, though some undeserved, get way more spotlight than some others.But unlike most MCU films, Eternals provides real stakes to them as we get to see some survive and some don't. However, because the backstory is largely impotent, characters who don't make it feel that their sacrifices are made meaningless and insignificant, a major turn-off for Marvel fans.Eternals also attempts to create a masterfully beautiful piece of rich storytelling, only to fall flat with its formulaic plot, by trekking and grouping the Eternals one by one without any real tension or heavy conflicts.Don't get me started on the costumes. What the Eternals wear feel plain and cheap, resulting in an unimmersive experience as it projects this parody-like vibe that fails to provide authenticity and aesthetic values.For an assemble team film, Eternals could have gone way better in almost every aspect. Indeed, the entertainment value seeps its way occasionally but it idles through its running time in a slow-fashioned indie style that the excitement never actually meets its peak.Albeit the lack of screentime, Makkari is definitely my top-tier character out of the 10, followed by Sersi and Thena taking the top 3 spots. All of them have the charisma and charm that other characters are lacking of.Yes, there are plenty of action scenes here and a lot of them are choreographed well but they offer nothing new except wjen Makkari steps in.Angelina Jolie is the queen! She is so presentable, even when her character is flawed, she makes Thena seems so golden and likeable.After Shang Chi's mystical creatures made a bizarre appearance, Eternals also sets itself up with a disappointing finale that looks like a combination of Dragonball & Power Rangers. The final climax seems off and rushed, it is as if Chloe doesn't really understand the MCU assignment.Adding to that, the whole finale isn't set as a fight important enough for the presence of every Eternals and aside from Makkari & Thena, it lacks the commitment of displaying their true potential power and only shows a sneak peek of what they can do.The most powerful asset the MCU has to offer ths time is its pair of end-credits scenes, one being the already-leaked cameo and the other features a voice & weapon belonging to an anticipated character.Injecting both blockbuster & indie DNAs into one, Marvel's Eternals aims for a MARVELous oeuvre but as the idea of new directions approached, it stumbles upon what feels like an eternity, resulting in a mediocre made assembled film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

First of all, it is long as hell, more than 2 and a half hours long is too much, they just spend the first 1 and a half hour reuniting their team and just talking; to this point in the movie I was already bored and I wanted it to be over, but surprise surprise there was still 1 more hour to go. And then, the next hour is mostly the characters debating if they should do something or not, FOR ALMOST AN ENTIRE HOUR. Fortunately I did like the end, the fact that some of them actually disagree with each other is a cool idea I did enjoy. But thats it, the fight at the end was the only story thing I liked, everything else is boring. The characters are also really boring, I dont feel any of them have any personality and maybe its just me but I think their powers are almost the same as the JL and that just reminds me of better written characters (in the comics) that I would be rather watching. Also, there are just too many characters, they should have cutted the cast in half or less. It does look good in some scenes and the special effects are also good, but those things dont save this in any regard. A boring film with boring characters that I dont want to watch ever again.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I expected this to be a throw-away MCU movie used to introduce a new high-power gang of superheroes that would ultimately lack in style and substance, even with Chloe Zhao behind the wheel.What I got was a truly good movie, and one of the best Phase 4 has got to offer. I don't mean that in a snarky ""Phase 4 has been bad, therefore it's one of the best by default."" The movie is legitimately good.There is so much heart and care put into all of these characters. You really believe their bond. Yes, it is a bit silly to show beings who've been around for multiple millennia over the course of a couple of hours, but they truly do make you believe that they love and care for each other as family. In a movie like this: that matters. When they split up, argue and betray each other, you feel it.This movie also does well with exploring morality and responsibility in a way that doesn't just make it ""Civil War"" 2.0. Every character's stance on the issue at hand is treated seriously. It isn't just one side vs the other, there's room for contemplation. Of course, in the end, humanity is saved, but it's not a cut-and-dry issue and even after the fact their is consideration of what the right thing is.And lastly, this is one of the most gorgeous MCU films to date. Stylistically, this is miles ahead of most MCU films. The sheer amount of scale in some scenes was enough to make my jaw drop. Color is important, but it doesn't beat you over the head with candy-colored overload, which as it's place, but not in a movie like this.This isn't a movie for everyone, especially in terms of MCU superhero films. The movie handles some heavy themes in a way that is not very palatable to kids. There is not a lot of humor, and it really does up the drama in exchange for the lighthearted nature of MCU films. This is not a typical MCU film, it breaks the formula. If you come into this expecting something along the same lines of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" or ""Guardian of the Galaxy"" you will be very disappointed.My main issue is the character of Sprite. Some aspects of Sprite are well handled, and then some aren't. The emotions behind her actions make sense, and are very well conveyed, but the actions in and of themselves are not fully justified enough to make sense.Overall, I'm looking forward to more ""Eternals"" content.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Action scenes of this movie was really good. The way they created that storyline that they arrived on earth around 5000 BC. And their main work to save the earth from those creatures. I liked the power of all 10 superheroes. Some character I like the most but with some characters I wasn't connected well example that deaf superhero, her acting was decent but there should be any translator or anything like subtitles to understand that what she tried to say. There were very less action scenes but no doubt VFX was top class I like the way they introduced Indian culture. This movie's humour was also quite Decent. Only the length of the movie little bit long aside from this, movie is worth watch!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I really like that the MCU are trying to introduce some new hero's since the originals are slowly dropping from the universe and honestly it's needed, but some of these characters are just bland and not fleshed out enough. I feel like they just dumped way too much information about brand new characters all at once and it's abit much to care about all of them at once, it just doesn't feel like a marvel movie. The deviants are a little bit boring in terms of villains and again they aren't given enough time in screen for us to care who they are. The effects in this might be some of the best in a marvel movie and I really like some of the costume design on the characters, some of them are a little similar looking at first but for the end fight scene they look really unique and interesting. I love that this film introduces more celestials as they are some of the coolest characters in the marvel universe and they look amazing in this movie and I can't wait to see more of them I'm future films. The end credit scenes are pretty exciting and they do keep me excited for future films. I just wish this movie had a few more things going for it because there's not really much else to say, it's just a little bland with some cool ideas that would have worked better over a couple of movies instead of all crammed into one. Definitely not the worst MCU movie but not the best either!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is a great MCU film.It was always going to be hard to introduce 10 new characters and give them all sufficient time to develop but I think the film managed it well enough with many of the key players in the story being given good development and I cared for many of the team by the end. My rating is as high as it is because I think Chloe Zhao does a great job at piecing the overflowing epic story together in a neat easy to follow (after the first 15 minutes) way which managed to surprise me in good ways as the story progressed.This is one of the most epic yet personal marvel stories out there with action scenes shot perfectly while also giving each character (except a couple) conflict and emotional drive.Please stay for the 2 end credit scenes which tease ever so slightly some future projects which I cannot wait to see.I will happily watch this movie again and I'm pleased to see representation of all types included in a film without it being made a thing. I hope this continues as part of the new normal of cinema.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

From a diverse cast to brilliant direction, Eternals is a film that casual moviegoers can enjoy without needing to catch up on the previous films in this cinematic universe. For the Marvel fans its a visual spectacle with a well written storyline and that quintessential humor. The film packs a punch in terms of action and emotions. The film makes you feel the same kind of dilemma that the Eternals are faced with: Should humanity be allowed to exist or use it to make way for other forms of life? We get to see the conflict within the team when their ideologies create a friction and it eventually climaxes into the final act with some stunning cinematography.It might be easy for the audience to not give this film a go based on the ratings and the thrashing its receiving from the critics but watch the film with an open mind and then form your own opinions. Eternals is the first superhero film to portray a deaf superhero character played by a deaf actress and actors with varied racial backgrounds portraying the Godly beings. The film also beautifully portrays a gay relationship in a way that it doesn't feel forced. So, after watching the film one may wonder whether the film critics were on weed while writing the reviews for this film!","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

there is NOTHING wrong with this movie...it is remarkably well paced and balanced...with something for everyone who isn't a cynic.I may be pessimistic about humanity's future...but i have not given up ALL hope. And i'm old and have seen/done a lot.But there are SO many reasons that the low scorers gave that speak SO much more about who THEY are than how good this movie is. Even the 'qualified okayers' that said something like, 'yes...it's beautiful to look at, but the story isn't all that good...'.For one thing...it gives us insight into OTHER MCU stories. So there's one plus.But another is that there was an OBvious effort to include most cultures which, by the end, seemed to me to be more than just a marketing ploy.I went into this movie VERY skeptical because of the imMENSE number of people who trashed it in these reviews...figuring that i'd stop watching less than halfway through...but, scene by scene, it won me over...showing me how well done it was...as any good movie would...
and yes. It's LONG...as most blockbusters ARE these days. Anybody catch the time of the new Avatar movie? Or the new Top Gun. Point proven.And YES, i watched it in segments...one of the advantages of not seeing it in a theater these days...eSPECIALly one of those that hasn't yet adjusted its policy of 'no intermission' to conform to movies being longer these days. So, until they do, i'll be watching the long ones here, at home...sure, i'll miss out on some of the perqs...like 3D...or 4DX(i live in the NL. It's a pathe theater sensory tech combination. But they have a 'no intermission' policy at this time).The dialogue was well written...most of the characters were fleshed out. Even some of what i would consider annoying, adolescent level humor was paced in such a way that i could enJOY it at times...
most of all, though...i enjoyed what i feel the ultimate message was. But for me to reveal this would be a spoiler...and i hate spoilers...you'll just have to see it for yourself...and, if you were on the fence but like a good(albeit it, long) story, then i hope this review has helped you to decide to do so.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

First off it takes an hour before anything even slightly meaningful starts to happen and then tries to quickly develop its characters. In the end none of them are particularly interesting or unique. The movie then allocates a fair amount of attention to the deviants which in the end their role doesn't even alter the story that much. It's almost like they wanted to edit this part out and take the story a different direction but forgot to remove some of it.The way the story is pieced together is almost like a student who completed his/her homework 5 minutes before class. New information and special abilities and talents are just inserted randomly to try and make the constantly evolving plot work often with little explanation. By the end of the movie it just becomes a bit numbing and the unexplained plot holes don't bother as much.I thought Karun added a bit of good comedic relief but this was the only positive for me. The post credits scene suggests a sequel which I am hoping is abandoned , but seems like is inevitable. Since I go to everything Marvel I will give the second one another shot. It can only get better from here at least.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Which may be the reason he is AWOL at a certain point in time (you'll know which moment that is) - you can hold that against the movie or just go with the flow.Which is true for the inclusiveness - and I am not even talking about the very first sex scene of the MCU. Don't get too excited (or upset), it is quite tame, but might still be reason for kids to be asking some questions (they are just cuddling like we do - could be a possible answer I reckon). You also have the inclusion of a gay character - the movie does not make a big deal out of it. You may when you see a tender male on male kiss. Hopefully you are not someone offended by such things and open minded.And all these things have nothing to do with any ""superhero"" powers (I reckon you can and probably most will call the Eternals superheroes) ... so the movie is quite packed. So much acting talent in front of the camera, so much creative and technical wizardry behind the camera. So there is a point to be made that this could have easily been a Disney Plus show. Who knows, maybe there will be an Eternals inspired Disney Plus show. Could be after the movie plays or in between the arrival of the Eternals and ""Present Day"" (I always wonder what that must look like decades after this was made - anyway).There are certain elements that can be considered cliche, but that would be quite the nitpicking, if you went down that road. Chloe Zhao really held her own and was able to reign in everyone and make a really good movie. Especially on a big screen this will impress you (like on an Imax screen). Because it is different in many ways, this may be viewed more favorably in the future with more context or different expectations.We're still early on in Phase 4 and some may have a better understanding or can guess where the MCU might be heading next. I am talking about fans, I am quite certain Kevin Feige and some others do know of course. At least vaguely. 2,5 hours long and never felt boring or too much. If anything it felt like too little. For what it is (ensemble), it is really well made and condensed.Yes there are logic issues (where were they all this time? Why didn't they appear earlier and so forth?) ... they are adressed of course, but would not really withstand a smell test. But if you are invested in the MCU, the question is: do you really mind? Also this can be seen and watched without any knowledge of anything that came before ... but as always it is way better enjoyed if you have seen the things that came before.Interestingly enough characters from the DC (universe) are being mentioned, like Batmans Alfred or even Superman. So there does not seem to be a mean spirited thought behind that. More like an acknowledgment and a nod to the other universe, that has created so many great stories and characters too. And an admission, but also acknowledgment to the audience and their feelings and intelligence. There is not a void - this could be our universe ... maybe a parallel universe that works that way ... wouldn't that be a great thought/thing to have? And who are we to say that it isn't possible? With Spiderman coming up next - the door will be smashed rather than kicked in - and I am really looking forward to that one - hoping to keep the ""spoilers"" far away from myself. Until then, don't forget: there are two bonus scenes (mid and after credit), like with most MCU movies.","13 out of 38 found this helpful.

Half way through I was like OMG I'm only half way through. How many times do we have to hear I love you Sersi? Every character is pretty boring but we all love you Sersi!! When the movie was finally done, they added an extra bit to set it up for a sequel. The movie is well paced, entertaining and a little disjointed. It's definitely not the Marvel of the past 15 years since Disney took over. I think it's a 4/10 which it better than a lot of movies. It needed far more structure, story telling and character development or background to launch it up towards 8 which no Marvel film is ever going to get near to. So it's typical for a Marvel movie to score a 4 and anyone that disagrees is just wrong. I am the god of you all and you will respect my authoritie!! ><","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

That's pretty much all it has going for it though. It gets a 10 in terms of budget size and visual production, but that's about the height of its merits. The score is okay too. If you are into slow-moving dramas about intergalactic space gods set on planet Earth this might be up your alley, but if you were expecting something like an enjoyable comic book or action movie you'll be sorely disappointed. The story and the script exist. The acting is alright, not a lot of range from anyone. I guess I should mention the diversity, since that's what this movie wants us to celebrate about it-- it's definitely there. Slow clap. I'm inclusively bored. Eternals is more watchable than Ant Man 3, but about as forgettable as Shang Chi (and less exciting). 3-6 stars is fair.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I get that some people are used to fast paced superhero movies and have no patience for dialogues and slow script build ups; but I can't agree with them. Clho√© Zhao is magnificent here; all the ten characters evolve well and we attach to them and understand their motivations, the twists and turns the movie throws at us using the epic concepts are incredible and everything is visually convincing. Moreover, this is a breaking point for Marvel's formula; Eternals stretches the old recipe and, although it still has past elements, it focuses on telling the story in a more mature way. This is a philosophical movie and it goes beyond Marvel's lore to deal with humanity's unanswered questions and create a cosmic ecosystem; it deals with life and death, explores worlds and creation and uses a huge scale to infer its grandiosity. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch Eternals with an open mind, be ready to embark on an epic long story that requires attention and patience, just like great deep movies/series always did; Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, etc. Beyond the amazing script and directing, Eternals is a mark for cinema diversity and inclusion; we finally have real people leading a Marvel blockbuster and minorities being respectfully represented; black, Indian, Korean, deaf, gay, immigrants with real immigrant accents. The importance of ethnic and cultural representation is enormous and it is already resulting in the banning of the movie in many countries; and don't get me wrong, but this is great! Marvel is affronting prejudice all over the globe. Although all the actors are incredible and everyone will have their favorites, I have to highlight mine; Brian Tyree Henry and Kumail Nanjiani are brilliant here and I want to see more of them. Overall Eternals is a great movie, very well structured with an ambitious script and a huge importance for Hollywood's scenario today.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

With this cast and the buildup I expected a good story and exciting characters, I got neither. The directing was atrocious with no subtlety in the camera angles. It was like a children's pageant- the actors took turns standing in the view of the camera and the background could have been a felt board. The characters were detached and unrelatable, the entire plot development relied on an uninteresting and long monologue by a motionless and flat psuedo-character that could have been played by pictures of a plastic action figure. There was no consistency in the action scenes and CGI and no explanation for any action by the characters other than undeveloped and invisible motivation.

Mixed in all this slowness, the movie filps back in forth between past and present, but will spend several minutes in one time period where I would often forget that this is not the present timeline and that there is just an enormous amount of backstory and exposition. There's some interesting twists but interactions between characters are mostly bland.I think part of the problem is that there were too many characters trying to compete for character development and I ended up not caring for any of them, just hoping the celestials would kill them off so we have the next big bad guy for the MCU. The movie is unique and has some cool moments but I think even the characters in this movie lack an identity to the point you'll probably forget half of them the next morning.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Definitely not the MCU's best film, but it's not as unwatchable as I've heard many people claiming it to be. The good things first: The movie is pretty to look at, and despite the fact that these characters have very little writing to them, as immortal beings I'm invested in their plight (mostly because the cast sells the emotional weight of it well) and I'm a sucker for the ""immortality"" trope in any medium of fiction. The actors and actresses do a fairly decent job of of (mostly) making the audience believe the eternals care about each other like family (which helps, because the people who wrote this movie certainly didn't). The twist (which I won't spoil here) is probably the best piece of writing in the film. So it has that going for it? And now the bad: At the end of the day the movie presents a lot of interesting and cool ideas like: Sprite being immortal, but also pre-pubescent and unable to experience adulthood. Or Athena's mind cracking under the weight of living for so long. These are very interesting concepts the movie just doesn't have time to explore. Am I saying I need a multi-film epic about the Eternals? No, not quite, but to have just a bit more time with these characters would've been nice. Especially considering they are almost 1 dimensional from a writing standpoint. On top of that, I can say the director's style (though I'm not familiar with any of her other work) was not suited to the movie (though this has happened with other films in the MCU, so I shouldn't be surprised). And whoever wrote the film didn't provide the best material, which makes you wonder ""who is in Marvel's writing room exactly?"". I think the director and cast did the best they could in two and half hours, and that left us with an average MCU film with some cool visuals, and a few neat ideas. All in all probably should've been left in the hands of a more competent director and writing team. Despite my criticisms I probably enjoyed the film more than most people (including my wife who was next to me throughout) just because I don't need to see highbrow cinema all the time to be entertained. I don't mind a straightforward adventure movie with super-powered people and pretty visual effects. Either way, if you really want to formulate an opinion on this film I suggest going to see it for yourself. Don't listen to the blatantly paid for praise, and don't listen to the people that are simply hating because of ""wokeness"" or ""diversity"", or ""it's just a bad movie"". Go see it if it interests you, and if it doesn't that's fine too.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'd heard this movie was pretty hard to watch but ignored all the negative hype and avoided reading reviews because some people just like to complain and I always like Marvel movies, unfortunately that's not the case this time. This doesn't feel like a Marvel film at all, maybe a B sci-fi movie.Don't expect the usual character depth, Easter eggs or interesting plot, this is more like a DC movie than a Marvel movie. They even reference Superman in this universe so that twists the cannon a little.It's got the Netlix problem where people are every race, gender and sexuality going which has no impact on the plot but disrupts the main movie flow for each person's gender/sexuality reveal.The special effects are sometimes amazing - but too often they look like Matrix (1999) and while that was great for its time - that's hard to excuse in 2022.The main plot is understandable, but the character development and constant flashbacks are really disruptive and more often than not, have no bearing on the story or character development. There's also no depth or weight to the story - it feels like the story of the Eternals and the effect on the rest of the world really didn't have any impact. I really didn't engage with the threat and wasn't at all worried about the effect on the world if the baddies win... I literally live on the world - but they made it feel more like a coin toss - everyone lives / everyone dies, but either outcome wouldn't make much difference to anyone.I'll not be watching it again - which I hardly ever say about a Marvel film...I doubt they will be making the Eternals 2, but we may see some characters in a cross-over of another film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out this story should've been a miniseries. All of the relations and character development they're trying to do, doesn't belong in a 160min movie. The movie's multiple stories were scattered all over the place and these said stories barely connect with each other, or matter at all at the end of the movie. Otherwise, I very much enjoyed watching them interact with each other but it wasn't enough and AGAIN had horrible pacing, sadly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Eternals feels like it came from a whole different creative place. It was long, boring, and I couldn't find a reason to care about the protagonists. There was something alien about the look and feel of this movie thatvleft me cold (no pun intended. It alsonlacked the fun and wit that other MCU movies have. Jolie and Hayek were miscast. Their performaces were stiff and half-hearted. Also, when you have a main character named Sersi, who happens to share a name with a main character from a blockbuster like Game of Thrones, don't cast two other guys from GoT as leads. It was very difficult to to get into the film when the characters keep taking you back to another program. Honestly, I don't have any affinity for this film and I wouldn't care if I never saw these characters again in another MCU property.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One of the most mentioned problems being the slow pacing is quiet justified though, but even in the endgame we received that pace until the moment started to build up after most of the movie. Although it's definitely not on the same wavelength as Endgame, its not half bad as well.Cinematically it felt surreal but simultaneously quiet real, wonderful job on that. More the reason why it should definitely be viewed on the big screen. However I personally think that the point where the movie lacked was in the last half hour. The whole stopping the emerging scene couldn't quiet live up to the hype it built for us but again I think it's just a mere part of the story that's going to continue in the upcoming phase.To conclude this, I liked the movie. It was like a refresher from the prior movies we've scene. Still I'd say this again, doesn't deserve the heavily negative reviews it's receiving but again it's just my opinion. Solid 8 from me, -2 for the let down regarding the ending scenes.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Who gives a squids bottom what the keyboard 'critics' or 'movie polls/scores' suggest...this had a great cast and superb visuals based on an unusual comic book that has translated well onto the big screen.At last we get to see the grand scale of the celestials, ominous and threatening and also a glimpse of the main characters who have lived many lives through the passage of time. Their hopes, ambitions, flaws makes for interesting developments in future instalments.Probably one of the most tricky of marvel adaptations to pull off, the direction is faultless and certainly captures that epic scope with both its big operatic action sequences and more intimate scenes.Only downsides was the deviant designs that are all too similar in modern science fiction fare but it's the grand celestial designers that more than make up for them.It also works well as a separate entity of the other marvel films and carries its own weight with heroism and grandeur that certainly opens the portals to the bigger marvel universe that fully embraces the heroes and legends of old as well as the future cosmic ensembles yet to come.I'm sure Jack Kirby will be puffing on his cosmic cigar with a wry smile.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every single scene seems to be on a different chronological line.Also, the main motivation of the Eternals is just so superficial and vain, that makes this group look like a parody of the Avengers.Moreover, this movie portrays a lack of identity to humanity itself. The moments of history are poorly selected and rapidly included in the plot. The introduction and explanation of their true will it's goofy, and the climax is just as disappointing as the whole story.On the other hand, the CGI is decent, and some of the action scenes are good looking. Also, the inclusive and diverse range of heros is great, and personally, I was really disappointed with how they handled some of the characters, using them merely as inclusive cards and not showing more of their true identity.In conclusion, this movie only adds up as a Marvel timeline movie, that introduced a new group and flushed our minds with new upcoming events with the post credit scenes. Was expecting more from Chloe Zao and the cast as well, but it is what it is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a Marvel movie, so there was never any need to be worried in that department. Now, it's not the best ever that they've made, but it's up to par, with eye-catching effects, vibrant environments and impressive fights.Unfortunately that's about the only good thing about this movie.The plot is very mediocre at best, and while I don't expect anything gripping and moving, this one is particularly hard to like. The main issue with it is that there are WAY too many things happening and so many subplots that it's too much to fit in a 2hr 30min movie and it all becomes very half-baked. Personally, it would have been much better to build up the characters with their own movies first before a movie with all of them together. The general audience, including me, knows too little about any of the characters to empathize with any of their plights.The acting wasn't anything amazing, either. From a star-studded cast like this, I'd have expected to be blown away, but this was more like a whisper. It's all too wooden and seems forced in a lot of areas. Because of this it's even harder to connect with the movie which was already hard enough given the subpar plot.For a movie of this scale, from Marvel, with all this star power, I'd have expected something truly stunning and amazing, and I was so excited to finally see this movie. If you're a casual moviegoer and not an avid Marvel fan, just skip this movie, you won't regret it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ultimately you end up realising you've missed absolutely nothing of consequence but maybe in future films it will be relevant so if you have Disney+ you kind of have to watch this bad film ).Should this story of the Eternals end here ( absolutely ) as if you want to use the actors & characters in other Marvel films with a competent director & screenplay writers then fine, but Chlo√© Zhao has killed Eternals 2 we hope.( there is no coming back for this movie as it doesn't make real sense ).Normally I give my personal opinion & reasons on why a film loses stars & brings it down to a 9,8,7 or 6 etc, however this script is so bad & the whole directing of it so ridiculous ( for a big budget Marvel universe film ) instead I'll try to list the positives of the movie that drag it up to the 5 out of 10.So it earns 1 star quite rightly because the visual effects are top notch.( the visual effects team can be proud of the quality hard work put in ).It earns a 2nd star because the character Ikaris was well acted by Richard Madden as he is a very good actor & proved his talent in this dire movie.( he was good in Game of Thrones so good to see him really commit ).It's 3rd star was earned surprisingly not for Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie or Salam Hayek ( who all underwhelmed with their scripts given to them even though in other films they have been fantastic ), but it was earned by the very talented Ma Dong-seok aka Don Lee who played Gilgamesh as he was very good in this & also committed himself 100% to his characterisation.It's 4th star though hardly in it was the actor Kit Harington who plays the peripheral character Dane Whitman ( who has a secret that we want to learn about in a completely separate moving please away from this Director ).Kit Harington was ""Jon Snow"" in Game of Thrones & is captivating still.Finally but not least as the real star of this movie, dragging it up to a 5 star film ( some how ) is the incredibly talented comedy actor ( with really great comedy timing ) Kumail Nanjiani who plays Kingo to perfection as this is a very likeable & entertaining character who makes the movie in the few parts he is allowed to be in enjoyable as he makes me laugh which is good.( He played Pindar Singh in Franklin & Bash & was excellent in that too ).Hopefully the Marvel universe will be much more protected in the future & they won't just let anyone write a script & direct it, as we as fans expect high quality from Marvel movies & Eternals is a movie we all need to forget.( however any of the actors or their characters should not be punished for this dreadful film, as yes a sequel should be cancelled however these actors deserve a chance to be in a very good marvel film when it is time for them.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

2) characters were amazing, each had their moments to shine, each played off each other well and everyone felt like they knew each other for thousands of years
3)story was fantastic, people are saying it lacks but how.... It gives backs story, it's at a nice pace to not let the film dip at all and it's a great plot with twists and love and comedy?!4)effects were top, like so good from super speed to deviant art was just amazing and fight scenes, yes the beach and amazon were so good!!!!5) still had that marvel comedy to it whilst sticking to an intense battling super hero film!Can't wait for a second and happy they left us with a cliffhanger movie and cliffhanger end credit scene!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

ETERNALS is not one of them. Having used up the bulk of Marvel's best-known characters, and the X-Men and Fantastic Four still not available for MCU use, Marvel had begun scraping the barrel for heroes that were completely unknown to any but hardcore comic fans.The ETERNALS was a poor choice to introduce a new super-team. Granted, the Guardians of the Galaxy was equally unknown to the non-comic-reading moviegoer, but the original team was only five characters who were introduced as individuals. The Eternals is a NINE member team that is shown from the beginning as being a cohesive group. This allows very little chance to make the team a group of individuals, as had been the great strength of the Avengers and the Guardians. Instead of developed characters with genuine character growth, the Eternals are introduced as character types with some of them receiving dramatic plot twists.There is no sense of connection with the rest of the MCU. When the Guardians were introduced it was with already-established baddie Thanos as the highest-level villain. The ""Deviants"" are as unfamiliar as the heroes, and the audience is unclear as to their powers, motivations, or nature until too deep into the film. The only connections to the rest of the MCU are throwaway references to the ""blip"" and to the Avengers losing their leadership. The reasons for the Eternals not participating in the Infinity War are at least covered, albeit unconvincingly, but there is no explanation why the literally earth-shaking final battle in ETERNALS doesn't attract the attention of the dozens of metahumans already active on the Earth.With a run time of 2:36, ETERNALS plods along, with the many flashback scenes making the story hard to follow. The special effects are, as always, great, but ultimately aren't enough to carry the film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When I think about Marvel I think of a wonderful collection of heroes, packed with unique stories that makes them entertaining, fun and singular.I don't mind long movies either. As long as the time is well used and stucks my attention to the screen, I'm in for a long movie!This particular movie however, was a big disappointment from my point of view. I feel since Disney touched both Star Wars and Marvel, these two brands seem to have diluted their appeal.For example, we all know the spiderman story. There is very little a movie about spiderman can surprise us with. And still, when in 2002 one of the spider-man movies was launched it was an outstanding movie with an overall rating by either critics and general population much superior to this ""Eternals"" movie.To make a movie is not just to follow the story from the comics. It's down to how you set up the presentation of the characters, how you build a relationship between the characters and the people watching the movie. How deep do you make the character to be felt by the audience. How you have the ""raise of the character"". Every MCU outstanding movie we see this ""raise of the character"": Steve Rogers, from skiny guy trying to get to the army to Cap. America. Iron man, from prisoner to building an iron suit. Thor, from banished from his kingdom to hero... I mean, I'm not going to continue, but this is a simple ingredient that anyone doing movies should know.Then you have the villain. A character we tend to dislike just as much as we like our hero.Then we have a twist (most of the times) and then a climax.This movie has nothing of this. And therefore, anyone watching it tends to say ""I feel this movie is a bit shallow...a bit flat""
There ate just too many ingredients of direction and production missing.Maybe the actors sensed this and it reflected in their charisma. The variation of facial expressions was so low that we couldn't really attach a feeling to who was good and who was bad. We can't really compare anyone from this movie to for example Robert Downey Jr. In his MCU movies.I mean, maybe I am ""over-analysing"" but I have seen far more intertaining movies with less plot to explore.My suggestion: maybe Disney should ensure that the basics of Movie making are there, and only then splash the movies with imagination and beauty.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I hope she can survive this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A Chloe Zhao film. It offers something different to the other films. Interesting to follow the journey of immortal beings. In the beginning the Celestials were here. They created the Eternals. But hidden in the darkness were the Deviants. This specific team are on board a ship. They head to Earth. They weren't to meddle in human affairs. You get to see what they get up to throughout the ages. Some humour. Nice bit of drama and romance. Plenty of action. You will like the special effects and soundtrack. Great cast of actors. I like the Ikaris character. Superb powers. He is handsome. I like the powers of Makkari. Richard Madden could have played Superman. The Deviants thought to have been destroyed are making a comeback. Other secrets are revealed. The heroes had split up and lived their lives as they saw fit. Sersi and Thena looking hot. The team are to report back to Arishem. Worth looking at the back story. The credits scenes need explanation. One casting choice was a surprise. I want to see how this film is connected to others. It is a pretty good film. I would ignore the reviews. There are the fake reviews written by rightwingers that don't want to see poc on the screen. They use ""woke"" ""diversity"" in a negative way. One country wants to censor the film. Ridloff is currently in The Walking Dead and Lee was in Train To Busan. Each character has a unique power. Some youtuber or blogger mentioned Mutants. You might like The Old Guard, Highlander.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Boring, bland and utterly uninteresting story and ""heroes"" who spend so much time in the movie crying you think you are watching some kind of a period drama. There is probably a scene of each of these Eternals doing some crying in the movie and for some more than once. The acting is terrible and the scenes that are supposed to be dramatic like one scene where one character is seen crying in the ruins of Hiroshima are completely laughable. Each of the superheroes are completely forgettable and it seems like they paid some of them only for a couple days work the way they keep disappearing and appearing in the story.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Richard Madden's flying scenes seem so natural and I don't think anyone could play ikarus better he is probably a plus point of the movie. AJ is just beautiful and Thena is probably the most badass eternal. End credits set up the future of the MCU pretty well though I am not a fan of him (trying to keep it spoiler free) most would be pretty pleased with his casting. But it does feel a little slow at times and the repeated flashbacks don't help it but it does not hurt to watch and at no point do you feel that it's too long. Review bombing (due to LGBTQ rep) even before it's release has made every one lose interest from it and yes its not the conventional marvel movie with intense action but Chloe Zhao s vision can be seen through this film she has prefered to keep the movie more focused on the plot instead of the action not that the movie has bad action scenes. She has shown characters with more emotional depth and a plot that focuses on the human nature of the eternals rather than only action and comedic one liners in between fights. Another problem that some might feel with the movie is the lack of character development, well somewhat true because you don't feel the connect you should have felt with Ajak and Gilgamesh but I think that's because we have become accustomed to marvel series but in let's say Avengers (2012) we didn't know much about all the members of the the team until much later when they got their solo movies. We didn't know anything about black widow until this year. So I think we will get to know more about character s like Thena and Druig atleast in the next part (hopefully).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The layers of human history thrown into the plot keep the movie lively. The acting was fine and I don't see how other reviews are calling it wooden.This movie was shades of Watchmen which I love. One of our Superheroes is clearly most powerful. There is a final showdown between our Superheroes.

That said I walked into this film (steaming now that it's on Disney+) with very low expectations. I didn't hear much buzz surrounding this film (odd for MCU at this point in the game) but what I had read online wasn't spectacular. I decided to watch it & decide for myself. I'm SO glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! Bravo!I love a whole new fresh set of characters that were beautifully developed, with an imaginative storyline, gorgeous visuals & a fresh approach to the tired out hero trope. The emotions here were raw & real. I felt connected to these heroes by the end of the film. Also this cast is INCREDIBLE (side note bringing Harry Styles into the MCU was a plot twist I didn't know I needed in my life)!I've honestly become bored with Marvel after 16+ years of films, but this was a welcome change! If it didn't make box office expectations I think it's definitely due to poor timing (released a month before the final Spider Man installment) & the fact that these are entirely new characters for most MCU fans. Audiences have grown lazy & don't want to be forced to venture away from what is familiar. Change is good people!I'm glad Marvel made this film & I'll eagerly await the next installment!

I saw one claiming that someone rating a movie low but watching the movie more than once is 'ridiculous'. Have you never watched a film critic before? We watch movies, even movies we don't like, over and over again to make our review accurate. To those high reviewers, I'm glad you liked the film. Maybe loved it. I respect your opinion on the manner, and I hope you respect mine. Moving into the specifics of the film, this story is a mess of pacing and characters. I specialize in character writing, and if my professor could tell you how to NOT write a character, she would point me to this movie.The protagonist has the same amount of personality as I did in middle school, and that's being generous. She wishes to save humanity for the sole purpose of being good I guess. She's a passive character in her own story, and that's without even mentioning her lackluster chemistry with the deuteragonist, Ikaris. But hey, still a better love story than Twilight.Speaking of, the deuteragonist in this story couldn't be more on the nose with the name. Ikaris, we get it, it's a reference. Haha look we're writing characters well, aren't we? We're gonna put lines about references to his name that is also a reference in the movie because we're clever. That totally won't get annoying and repetitive.It's honestly sad how the most interesting characters are sidelined. Phastos had an interesting past with humans and a really nice scene I won't spoil that gave him a reason to NOT want to save the world. But all of that is forgotten in five seconds and we don't explore that at all. I would've much preferred to see him learning to trust again and falling in love with the humans who betrayed him rather than it just... skipping.The cinematography is fine, but cinematography isn't just how 'pretty' a film is, it's about how the camera tells the story. It wasn't anything overly impressive to me.The action scenes were a snooze fest and was generic Marvel. I actually really like Marvel, but these scenes were just... no.The music was nothing special. I can't remember a single track that played and I watched the film yesterday.As for the ending, I think it's just stupid sequel setup that was unnecessary. Again, will not spoil, but I really LOVE the way they just wasted Kit Harington's character. Loooove ittttt. I have to wait another movie to see him in action, huh?(obviously sarcasm)This movie isn't worth anything over a 5/10. I don't particularly see how anyone could have a movie of this length with such atrocious pacing as even a guilty pleasure, but I'm not about to bash their opinions either. I'm glad if you liked the film, but personally, this disappointed me greatly. I literally only went to see the film because Jimin and Taehyung's song was in it. 3/10.Pros:
Cons:
(Now watch they all scream at me saying I'm just being homophobic because there's lgbtq+ representation in this movie... but here's a plot twist guys... I'm female and half-gay...)","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I love marvel and indeed this wasn't your typical marvel movie but I feel I like the risk they took with this in being not too overly stuffed sometimes with action and lots of things happening at once. It was nice to take a different approach where it took a more emotional approach to a superhero movie using their family dynamic to tie it in.

You could see the characters become more and more human along the way until the final conflict where they truly struggled between following their mission or protecting humanity which, to them, was an impossible task. The internal conflit even continued once they had achieved their goal.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I can't recall who was in it, the plot, any of the expensive visual effect set pieces, NOTHING.However I do recall being really disappointed to the point of being a little bit angry that I waisted 2 hours of my life on it and I recall hating the atrocious dialogue.Here's the thing, I can recall most movies I've seen, even the not very good ones like; Hudson Hawk, blade trinity, the matrix resurrected, or the league of extraordinary gentlemen. But with the Eternals I am drawing a complete blank.For anyone who has been in a car crash this lack of memory probably will not come as a surprise, the human brain has a tendency to blank out traumatic experiences and the Eternals is car crash of a film.

The film isn't a dumpster fire, or the worst superhero film ever made; it's simply uninspired and misguided. Throughout the lengthy runtime, characters either walk from place to place or sit giving exposition for minutes on end. Leading to an uneven narrative flow that is also bogged-down by sparse fight scenes that aren't thrilling. There's a talented cast here, and the film is often gorgeous to look at. The problem is, the film can't convey why it's important to be in the MCU. Not every movie is a winner.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Quality special effects, solid plot and useful sideline stories, sufficiently developed characters and nicely crafted/well timed jokes. No more. The recent productions coming out from the Disney-owned franchise are basket cases. High on that list is this movie, the Eternals. The plot is incredibly patchy and poorly edited. Too many characters are being thrown in this movie without being given a chance of getting off the ground. Doesn't matter if they are all established and talented stars. The material is just not there. The rhythm is far too slow. So many moments wasted on totally futile sequences. So the movie stretches senselessly, almost eternally, until those 2hrs+ are gone forever, leaving a taste of enormous waste.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thought out, different characters. Liked them all.GOOD representation for anyone. Different race? Boom heres half the eternals of different races. Sexuality? BOOM we have 2 loving dads. Hard of hearing? BOOOM WE GOT A COOL DEAF SUPER HERO. This film really did focus on the characters, and i enjoyed that a ton. They all felt like people and I could relate myself to at least 2 characters. Plot wise its a shaky start, but i see long potential for more movies
Cons-
The movie lacks in the clear department. I was confused for at least 30 minutes it felt like and thrown into character death that I didn't know how to feel about. However I will say, as I learned about each character I understood more and more, and began to actually mourn for any characters dying. I just wish I wasn't confused for such a long time at the beginning of the movie.Overall or TLDR; I cannot wait to see where they take the characters and I hope that they improve some writing to make info more clear. I'm so excited Marvel released this. WHOHOOO PROGRESS!!!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It felt like you are starting at the end of the film series, with lots of flashbacks to explain what has happened since the Eternals arrived on earth. The constant flashbacks and the written explanation at the beginning of the film did nothing to endear me to any of the characters. Some of the CGI was a bit ropey. The story felt lazy. The Creator of the Eternals looked like the robot from the children's film The Iron Giant.At one point one of the Eternals casually wonders what the rest of the Avengers are doing since the loss IronMan etc at the end of events in Endgame. You may well wonder the same as none are anywhere to be seen in this potential end of world story set after Endgame.And there were far too many references to love, family, relationships, etc, that really shows that Disney are now the owners of Marvel. For me this is now three strikes in a row for Marvel, The Black Widow. Shang-Chi, and now this. Just like the comics did, Marvel have seen their best days, and are slowly dying by introducing more and more so called superhero's with sub standard, or seen it all before stories.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They use to be funny yet amazing to sit down and watch them for the first time. Now you wait to watch them because you don't want to spend any money paying for the tickets. You don't care if you see them or not.This movie was just terrible. Marvel has this way now a days of jumping right into story lines with out any context. It was to confusing and chaotic to be good. So many things were happening at the same time. The flash backs were so hard to follow.Right now I think marvel is trying to do and add so many things and new characters at once that it makes it hard to enjoy the movies. I am a big Marvel fan but I miss the old cast, the original six. Maybe I'm just not use to change but I'd rather have more of the old movies than new story line.So I rate this one star. They did a good job on Shang-Chi and the Ten Ring, but in my opinion they tried to do to much at one time. To many characters and confusing scenes.

The plot and story has huge and nice foundations. But as the story roles, you just get lost in to an Avengers type of story searching to rebuild a team and defeat an unrealistic end of story line.I know, this is Marvel univers and realism has to be taken with a grain of salt. But each character fails to bring an attachable story so we don't really connect with one or the other. As for the somewhat interesting character of Angelina Jolie, we have no backstory, actually, no story at all.It's a movie bundled with CGI creatures that seem indestructible. I mean, the eternals feel so weak facing these creatures that the movie just makes you grip your chair's arm rest to refrain from forwarding the movie if you could.And they put John Snow in the background with an end credit that only hard core fans will understand since there is nothing to the eye that can make you understand anything.For those wanting to see it, it's just a visual CGI fantasy movie that can be skipped to my opinion. It got a 2 stars because the story is interesting, something about celestial beings mis-managing their sublime powers for stupid archaeic reasons that the Eternals decide to fight against. Story is good, but presentation feels like the streets during COVID lockdown, EMPTY!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought the same thing when I saw Thor: The Dark World (2013), it did not do much but had cool action and good characters.Eternals (2021) has good cinematography and has a lot of pretty locations, along with great visuals when you learn more about them.The actors playing the Eternals are good and play out dramatic scenes well. There are a lot of characters to introduce in one movie, so it is hard to know more about them and who they are.The action is staged well and looks cool, but the movie feels slow and can be boring until a certain plot point. It is mostly them talking about what is going on, but the plot and what they are made for is interesting.Like most people have said, they should have made this into a MCU show to get more character development and to understand more about the characters. They are not wrong.The explanation for what they are really doing was a little surprising and the ending made me ask ""what?"". One of the after credits scenes is a little questionable but the other one is a little exciting.I do not know what to say other than saying I understand why people do not like this. I did not hate this, but I did not love it as much as the other MCU movies.But it is just ok. It is just standard until the 3rd act, which did pick up the movie a bit. If you want to watch this, go ahead, and see for yourself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

You have to spend first part of the movie building their entire world and history to frame the characters and their situation. Of course it pays off later in the movie but I would have to consider the first 30 minutes of this movie to be quite boring. After the first act it does pick up pace but also fails to get interesting quickly as I did think this movies plot was going to be quite predictable. The latter half of the second act and a third - proved me completely wrong and there are plenty of surprises and twists. And for anyone who ever read the comic quite a turnaround on some of the characters. It is a slow boiler and while some of the comedy misses it's target quite enjoyable but with an excellent and dramatic ending. I would also have to question some of the accents which makes no sense considering the age of the characters. But I certainly hope to see future eternals movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storyline was at (many) times all over the place, and I was left confused at many points in the film as well as feeling little sense of any solid direction. The characters, played by a notably A-list and diverse cast, were for the most part underdeveloped which let down the actors, and the characters failed to provide any substantial depth or arc to this film (however I felt most captivated by Nanjiani's character). Additionally, the film drags on far longer than it needed to due to the poor pacing of the story, and ultimately finishes on an underwhelming and somewhat messy note. The fighting scenes, and in particular the final battle sequence, rely heavily on stunning but over-the-top visual effects to keep the audience engaged. In contrast, the acting and soundtrack stood alongside the visual effects in adding to the films pluses, but the cons do far outweigh the pros on this one.Worth the watch? Give it a miss.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There's some of us who like adventure without a ton of fight scenes and guns blazing. There was still plenty of action, but it also had a more philosophical approach. One of my favorite parts of the Thor movies is the interlacing of old mythology into current stories, Eternals does that as well. For me, it adds depth and resonance making it more enjoyable than the average action movie. I really hope they make some sequels.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A very long-awaited film from the series of films about superheroes Marvel. The film reflects a lot of pressing problems and their solutions. There are feelings, emotions, good direction, excellent specials. Every moment of the film is breathtaking in its own way. Unexpected plot and twist. While watching, I could not predict the next actions and the ending of the picture. Each of the characters evokes emotions.I love all the films from Marvel, which I have reviewed a great many, sometimes several times. The next novelty also could not.Most of all I liked Angelina Jolie, my favorite actress, I was waiting for her appearance on the screen. She just played her part perfectly. As always on top. What do you want to say. The plot becomes clear somewhere in the middle, this is for me personally. The special effects are awesome. Everything is assembled to the highest standard. I personally liked the movie very much. No wonder I went to him and wasted my time. The finale was not unequivocal, I think we are waiting for the continuation. I give this movie a 9th round!

It grapples with philosophy and morality more deeply and with more nuance than could possibly be expected of a franchise blockbuster, and it does so without dumbing down any of it. It includes large-ensemble interpersonal drama fitting of its mythical proportion, and it makes it meaningful even while introducing all its characters for the first time. It imparts in its characters a shocking degree of depth and relatability through both acting and writing; I teared up multiple times in the theater, which is very unusual for me. It pushes forward diversity in casting and characterization while always remaining natural and never feeling pander-ey. This was easily a 9-star film on first viewing.After going in blind and coming out wowed, I checked out some reviews. Whew. Apparently other people don't like this movie. Some criticisms were valid, notably the seeming irrelevance of the monstrous villains and the cutting off of the thematic qestions they pose. Others were less clear to me. People have complained quite a bit about the pacing of this film, but on first viewing, I really din't notice any issues there. A lot of the bad reviews for this movie, though, seemed to be centered around the idea that it failed to adequately develop its large cast of characters, leading to a lack of personal investment. That, I simple don't see. Every character in this film is fully formed, fully develped, and fully engaging, maybe even to a fault. When you have to introduce and develop such a large ensemble cast, you're bound to need quite a bit of backstory and a whole lot of talking. I imagine this is where some of the pacing complaints came from.Having seen the mixed reviews, I decided to see it again before fully forming my opinion. It was entirely possible I was just blinded by the novelty and missed some flaws, so going back with those criticisms in mind could've changed my view on some things. For the most part, I found that not to be the case. This really is a very, very good film. Again, I got chills multiple times, and again, I teared up multiple times. The VFX were no less stunning, and the shot composition remained world-class. At one point, I started anticipating that I might get bored being re-exposited, but it didn't happen; the character drama was so engaging that even the standing-around-talking scenes drew me in despite already knowing the factual information they were presenting. I did notice one thing on second viewing, though, that knocked it down from 9 to 8 stars for me: Dramatic developments late in the story significantly re-align the nature of many of the characters' interactions earlier on, and while this sometimes resulted in crisp foreshadowing, more often than not, it felt like a mostly missed opportunity. Still, this film holds up under strutiny, and I imagine it will only grow in popularity with time, as it no longer has to bear the burden of introducing new characters and its depth comes into better focus.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

First of all, I feel like Marvel is just trying to create cash bag money making heroes that aren't original, but ARE gonna sell well. The heroes in this film are literally just Marvel ripping off various heroes from DC and trying to make it their own, but failing.This film was also incredibly forgettable. I saw it about 4 or 5 days ago and I can barely remember anything that happened. This is due to the forgettability of the plot, characters, questionable special effects, and everything in between.I did find it entertaining in the beginning because I was expecting a mindless Marvel movie with a ton of action and not much plot, which got me excited because, usually, Marvel movies don't have the best writing. But, after the first couple battles, they stopped the action for a large chunk of the film, putting it to a halt.I don't hate this film, but I do find it way too long and incredibly forgettable and a film that, in a week from now, I will forget that I ever saw it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A diverse, well-casted group of actors with stunning visuals, an Oscar-winning director, and what do people have a problem with - the plot?? I've been trying to wrap my head around why most reviews are calling the plot ""a mess"" and ""too complicated"" and the only thing I can come up with is that people were expecting more of the same from Marvel. I am a huge MCU fan, but most of their plot points up until now have been fairly cut-and-dry and easy to follow. (Probably to also grab a younger audience.) This one is not. They are trying to explain the origin of the universe while introducing an ensemble cast of 10+ new characters, so yes the runtime is long at 2 hours and 37 minutes, but I think they did a beautiful job introducing each of these characters. The film itself is character-driven and each of them grappling with their own immortality and humanity.So, if you are looking for another simple plot with tons of action scenes or explosions that your 6-year old will love, this isn't it. You have to pay attention for this plot to make sense. They are trying something new with this film and I am loving it! Not your everyday Marvel movie, which is a good thing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Eternals team are introduced very fast, and I couldn't really get to know more of the character, besides more in the end, when everything came. I don't know, this movie had some really weird elements of build-up that I didn't like, but I have to admit that Eternals wasn't a disaster either. First of all, this movie did sometimes fast flashbacks from that and that timeline, that sometimes was confusing to what was going on. First, we are going a hundred years back, and suddenly we return to present day, what was sometimes confusing. The acting was on the middle, average, but the superpowers was disappointing. When you make superheroes, do something original at least. Super Strength? Already made, Hulk. Super speed? You know that one, The Flash. Do you know what I'm trying to say? That all of this superpowers in this movie, was already used by several made-up superheroes, so I couldn't feel the feeling off something new and interesting, that made the action scenes weak, because you knew how they were going to attack. You get the picture? One new superpower that I haven't seen but was also not interesting at all. So what I mean is: Boring superpowers. Not any new superpowers. Eternals have some pros, though. I think it was very good scenography and camera-work, the pictures were high quality taken, and the light set-up did the job to capture the feeling. The music was ok, some nice tunes, it made it to the scenes, and lastly I think that the conclusion in the end of the movie did the job of completing it. To conclude everything, and put the most important details in the end. That was the problem across the movie, that it had some detail gaps, so the ending made it. But beside that... To summarise, Eternals was a Marvel movie with some good sides, but the bad sides were many, too. Not so entertaining from my point of view, and it had bad structure, what I didn't quite like. If you like to watch Marvel movies, then you shouldn't watch it. Watch something else from Marvel, because this one, didn't hit the score, if you know what I mean.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The visuals are wonderful, the characters have potential, and the director clearly has talent, with some absolutely beautiful shots. It truly is a beautiful movie. But Eternals being a movie may be its biggest flaw.The characters were full of potential; they still have some potential. But their stories, personalities, personal struggles, inner thoughts and feelings, major plot details, all of it is rushed, to the point where it pretty much ruins this film. Sometimes they just say a character's detail instead of showing it off naturally or within the story. At times, the film and its script treats the audience like we're stupid. The absurd amount of characters in this film is more of a disadvantage than anything. This film probably would have worked much better as a series, or a multi-part film series, allowing it to span its plot across multiple episodes or movies, and in likely six hours minimum.This movie is a prime example of how important plot and characters are to a movie, because if you don't have that, everything else you have almost doesn't matter.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

We are used to the Avengers or the Justice League as an alternative from another film universe, so when you see a group of superheroes on the screen, you draw parallels. However, the most interesting thing is that in this film everything is so chaotic that it is impossible to single out really good and cool material from this, I will even say more, I think that this film is a ""passer"" in KVM. Even if we make an alternative for the same League, then in this film KVM failed. The film extremely strongly smacks of the failed 2021 series Jupiter's Legacy, both in pitch and mood. The idea was not brought to the ideal, the characters were extremely poorly revealed, and most importantly, in the spirit of KVM, the film began to confuse the viewer, but then there was not even an explanation of how this can be seen in other KVM pictures.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It leaves you with this sense of satisfaction, a unique one that cannot be compared to either of the INFINITY WAR or ENDGAME, but a satisfaction nonetheless.

And the pacing is much better than I'd feared, considering the movie is 2.5hours long. Big plus for the diverse cast as well.The movie masterfully portrays its central themes of Purpose, Fate and Freewill, which are aided by the exceptional acting of the stars. It's definitely the most philosophical Marvel has ever dared to get.By the time the credits rolled, I was dawned by the satisfying epiphany that I was enthralled throughout the film, and not distracted by the sometimes forced comedy and prolonged action scenes that we've come to expect from some Marvel movies. Heck, it's not _just_ a marvel movie, it's a grand sci-fi epic, that's meant to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible. Which is why it's probably my favorite one yet. It's Big, Bold, and emotionally resonant. I cannot wait to see what the Director Chlo√© Zhao does with the characters next.I can see why some people might not

I fear the makers of super hero movies are losing the plot on what it means to be a super hero. Rare do we see one where they are not woefully ""normal"", while those that are not even human, are even worse.It had it's moments, but throughout the whole movie you disconnected to the point of them being a ""family"". One would think after centuries, stronger bonds would have been made. To fight for something bigger, but instead we get the same old drivel of bad betrayal and monster that just want to live. It is base and boring, might as well have watched any run of the mill poorly written and badly executed tv show.The acting is fine, the movie magic is great, but the story is weak and the feeling of super heroes is pretty much completely absent.They could learn from Wonder Woman or Witcher 3.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Based on some of these reviews, I was expecting it be really bad and boring. This movie is somehow being rated lower than Thor 2 which does not feel (personally) accurate. Although it is a 2 hour and 37 minute movie, I did not find myself checking the time to see when it would be over. I was fully entertained the whole time. The story of the Eternals and how they came to be was easy to follow and made sense. They did a good job of showcasing all 10 of the Eternals which is no easy feat. I did wish they had used some actors/actresses more but overall the acting was superb. This movie definitely felt important in setting up the storyline for future Marvel movies, so I'm really excited to see what's next.P.

It's actually above the average. The movie actually has quite good pacing as long as you are an actual Marvel fan and you are interesting in learning more about the history of the MCU and new stories in the universe.The fights are amazing and plentiful for a non Avengers movie although you would want more cause it is that good.The movie does have a big story to tell but Chloe Zhao does an amazing job of telling that story. The movie does cut back a little on the snappy one liners but it's still plenty funny, mostly because of karun i.e. Kingo's trusted assistant.It does have an open ending that leaves a lot of questions unanswered and the post credit scene just add more questions.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Through out my experience at the theater I was riding an emotional roller coaster and was so satisfied at the end. Comparing this movie to any movie would be like comparing apples to oranges, this doesn't feel like a marvel movie due to all the different conflicts I didn't see coming, but the story telling was so intriguing it was very easy to follow. I know eternals and The celestial's are comic characters, but I feel if they weren't, this movie would feel more like a classic.

I was not compelled by them. When any of them were killed or taken, I didn't feel sad at all and that's sad, because they are really awesome characters and the actors cast seemed well placed in their roles.I wish they would have taken their time and split this into 2 movies. Made us care about them all and love them. As it stands currently, I left the theater with pretty much the same feeling as I did after seeing Batman v. Superman and the original theatrical release of Justice League.It was not a bad movie. It had some good moments and definite shining comedic spots.

I see why. It was the same thing with black widow, and there were things in that movie that upset me too, but that didn't stop me from giving it a 10 out of 10 and neither does this. This movie was so raw and beautiful and cinematically as well as visually stunning. The emotionally textured scale of this film is astonishing. We go on this journey with these eternal's who have hearts! And they grow and learn just like real people do! They fight for what they love. It is no different from any other MCU film except for the obvious, New actors, a new adventure, more mysteries and, CELESTIALS! I am not saying that this is the best MCU film ever, but it is the most epic of all. The actors showed how these Eternals are real people and I thank Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, and the rest of them for giving us a beautiful Sci-fi Journey! And most of all, I want to thank Chloe Zhao! Not everything she did was up to peoples expectations ( including my own ), but her work brought tears to my eyes and I will forever remember this. I will never forget the shock, the twists, and the experience in the theaters!! WATCH THIS MOVIE!","12 out of 37 found this helpful.

I didn't see the twist in the movie at all despite watching some spoilers on YouTube. Well done. The celestials were just intimidating and not cheesy like I was expecting. I'm not one to notice diversity in movies all that much but I have to say I loved loved how much this cast represents the world alongside a story of us all as a people. It really hit home. The fight scenes were pretty good too. Because of the live background scenes, it really felt like you were just there. You get like it really happened.

How else to explain the low reviews for this atmospheric and all-round interesting film?Eternals is the increasingly rare Marvel cinematic masterpiece that doesn't conform to the rigid cookie-cutter template. It reinvents the concept of the 'superhero' from scratch, offering a sense of freshness utterly lacking from other recent efforts. It owes little or nothing to the rest of the horrendous 'MCU', which is a welcome relief.The characters are flavorful, the story is interesting, the action is entertaining. It all seems appropriately larger than life, yet remains relatable. I could have wished for a bit more of a Kirby flavoring, but overall I had a great time.If you're as sick of Spider-Mush as I am, definitely give Eternals a try.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It rushes into it too quickly without giving us ample time to care about the characters (like we do the Avengers).The special effects are quite impressive and Angelina Jolie might be the most fluid fighting superhero I've ever seen, but it's not enough to push this film into greatness. There are only a few laughs to go around (more like chuckles), and the plot moves so quickly between locations and times that you feel like you've watched the SparkNotes version of an epic tale. Not to mention, I thought that Gemma Chan's character fell a bit flat for what was supposed to be the main protagonist role. Not sure if it was the writing or direction, but it never felt like she was given liberty to expand her range.It's worth a view, but temper expectations and think of the Eternals as the equivalent to when a sports franchise says it's in a ""rebuilding year.""Verdict: Watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unlike the other movies in this universe, here we have a film that has more of a plot, but it can be tedious for some who are already used to other Marvel movies. It can get boring as it requires a lot of attention. The characters, despite being new, have something interesting and the most remarkable thing about this film is that it takes its plot very seriously and even has a cosmology on the part of Los Celestiales and the origin of the Eternals and the Deviants, which I love. It seemed quite fascinating and gives some depth. If I had to mention the diversity in the characters, I really think it's fine. Each of The Eternals is unique in its own way and that gives them a certain originality, although there was more that should have been explored. The Eternals is not the best Marvel movie, but it's not the worst either and in the end it's a decent and peculiar film for being something outside of what Marvel did. I rate it an 8/10.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

She usually stands completely behind her character, but here I missed the fire.Kit Harrington was one of the few bright spots, playing such a wonderful anti-Jon Snow that I have to give the film a star just because of him, and of course the end credits scene. A kobold introducing Harry Styles, hilarious.The Plot: Unfortunately, the story is nothing new. Just more stretched out - we're slowly getting into Hobbit spheres. The Eternals, who at times remind me strongly of their egotistical counterparts from ""The Boys"", have to say goodbye to their normal lives, get together to save the world. Stars for creativity: zero!The worst thing, however, is that it takes almost the entire movie to do this. Unnecessary flashbacks and endless talking included. ""Only"" 30 minutes lasts the so-called finale. I also found the fact that the film is set in modern times disappointing. Which once again throws the MCU into question for me. Why did the Eternals just stand there and watch during Thanos? They couldn't possibly have all disappeared. They are not real living beings! They were created. They could have helped!Anyway.In short, the movie left me wondering. Where has the charm of the Marvel saga gone? The excitement you feel from the very first minute? Where are the actors who, in addition to all the seriousness, were not at a loss for a joke or a saucy response? The ones who portrayed the character as if they actually were that person. I miss the lightness of the past films. The heroes from the neighborhood. Who were real. Without any hidden motives, without all the little games, without back and forth...Anyway.Here's to an unnecessarily bloated second part.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Excellent portrayals from a star studded cast. Much like Shang-Chi (another top ten from the MCU) you don't need to have a huge background knowledge to enjoy it. Going into it I'd say the only thing you need to know is that the Snap happened, making it an easy view from someone who isn't super well versed in the MCU. It does expand on some previous ideas, but no prior knowledge is needed. It does an ensemble cast well, giving you just enough from everyone to want to know more, but not throwing too much at you. That being said, it is undeniable that Gemma Chan's Sersei is the main character, even if she herself doesn't recognize it at first. I believe this movie has some serious rewatch ability, you'll get what I mean after you see it! The visuals are stunning to watch and the magic is unlike anything we've seen thus far. Academy award winning director Chlo√© Zhao shines with this piece. It is also the most diverse MCU film we've seen to date, having and equal balance of male and female main characters, a racially diverse cast, a canonical queer main character, a deaf main character (and the MCU's fist deaf superhero!), as well as an excellent portrayal of the different kinds of love. You have familial, romantic, and true, deep, friendship. This is the found family that the OG Avengers wanted but never quite achieved. The only real fault I have with this movie is the sex scene. It isn't explicit and you don't see anything other than faces, collar bones, and I believe a back, but I just didn't care for it. Overall a wonderful and fantastic film that stands wonderfully on it's own but does a wonderful job of setting up future stories. Can't wait to see where the Eternals go next!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The emotions are right in place. And the visuals and the action is just mind-boggling.This is what Marvel is about and this is what we want to see on the big screen. I fail to understand how this did not gross more at the box office.Did total justice to so many MCU concepts and comic-figures. One of the best MCU films of all time, no doubt.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

At least the lighting wasn't so poor in that show that I had to guess at what was going on half the time. I tried to see it through just because it seems like they are determined to wrap these characters into the MCU, but I mentally checked out about half way through and had to quit before I fell asleep. At that point, my dad, who was watching with me, had fallen asleep for the third time. He said he hoped they weren't planning to make a sequel to this because he would NOT want to watch it. I'm hoping that, like Inhumans, any plans to incorporate this into the MCU are scrapped because if this is where the series is going, retconning the most dull superrobot characters in and making them and this insane planet killing and recreating plot all-important, then I really don't care to follow.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think Zhao did an amazing job on developing the characters within 156 minutes runtime.We don't need to argue if this movie is good or not, I think Shang-Chi is old-fashioned, however, the fight scene impressed me.

Venom was a movie which felt like it was made in the 90s when many comic book movies weren't good. The Eternals had great visuals, epic and catchy music by GAME OF THRONES composer Ramin Djawadi, fun and new characters; Ringo and his assistant were fun. I don't know wtf these critics and some audiences want! If a movie has too much action then they want some characters development. When they try to develop characters, then the movie is boring and want more action; Eternals had both! The movie tried to tell a new, different story, with different characters while world building and world building takes time and exposition! I can't believe these critics liked Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man 2 and 3, Captain Marvel over The Eternals. Maybe it's slow at some parts, but that's where you develop characters! You cannot have action 24/7. Anyways, I cannot wait to see more of the Eternals in future MCU movies and shows since this movie literally changes the MCU from the formulaic films they've been so far.

The film follows them first arriving on Earth, 7000 years ago and then in the modern day teaming up again to save the day once more.After winning an Academy Award for Directing Nomadland, Chloe Zhao is an inspired choice to direct this intimately beautiful story about a dysfunctional family that learns what it means to be human. After all, her indie darlings have all been focused on humanity and character driven pieces.Eternals is beautifully balanced by showcasing the relationship between these characters, whether it is the on and off century spanning relationship between Gemma Chan's lead, Sersi and her beloved Ikaris (Richard Madden). Or even the platonic love between the broken and suffering Thena (Angelina Jolie) and her hardy protector Gilgamesh (Don Lee).The film introduces ten new characters and somehow manages to equally display all their relationships and all their powers, giving them much more nuance and complex interactions then many Marvel solo outings that focus on singular characters.Zhao was also brought on board to visually give the Marvel universe a kick up the backside, we are all too accustomed to the green screen backgrounds Iron Man is flying on where you can clearly see the actors are interacting with nothing but a tennis ball. Eternals changes this, giving life to every scene as most was shot on beautiful locations, allowing the action and visual effects to be steeped in reality.The humour between characters feels effortless, with Kumail Nanjiani really providing the laughs and the action is incredibly exciting when it takes off with a special mention must be given to the visually stunning speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridlofff). I sorely recommend seeing this in IMAX, the visual effects and just the entire epic scope of this picture alone is something to behold. There are genuine jaw dropping scenes that are made for the biggest screen possible.The entire diverse ensemble do great work, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden prove solid leads with their complex relationship. Don Lee and Angelina Jolie are standouts, providing a warm and heartfelt storyline. Barry Keoghan, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh and Lauren Ridloff also make for great members of the ensemble, giving some of the most genuinely exciting action sequences as well as unexpectedly deep character interactions. Salma Hayek and Kit Harington make the most with their brief screen time. Die-hard superhero fans wil also want to stick around for the two credits scenes!This film will not be for everyone, it is patiently paced, allowing every character to have their moment, whilst dealing with incredibly mature themes on humanity that most superhero movies refuse to go. This is not your typical mindless action flick. Marvel and most likely Chloe Zhao have made the first indie feeling superhero movie that is a brilliant blend of incredibly jaw dropping spectacle and deep themes on love and what it means to truly be human.I hope this is a start for Marvel to take more risks and bring in more exciting filmmakers to create not just a superhero film but character driven pieces that really change the landscape of this oversaturated genre.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Powers are at an extreme, characters are far from human and so unrelatable, and action sequences involve every power under the sun, so everything is special effects, taking you out of the film.Evidently Marvel wanted to make another film following the footsteps of the hugely successful Guardians of the Galaxy, but Eternals misses that mark as there is no real rapport between characters, it's just a series of well known actors dumped together.That isn't to say it's not interesting. The story is coherent, and largely interesting for the majority of the film. The Deviants aren't the most inspired villains, and the development of the main one feels downright stupid at times, but all in all the plot makes sense and twists along the way keep things moving. And they need to keep moving, because this is a long film.The big-name actors are more secondary characters than all the trailers and build-up suggested, and with the introduction of so many new charactera, and an entire universe, no one is given much chance to develop. We skim the surface of a number of bland heroes.It's still an okay film, but below the usual MCU standards, and the ending is still poor whether they changed it or not.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sadly neither of us liked it. I thought it was a mess. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. So in the movie, there are the eternals - aliens that look like humans, but they have super powers and are immortal. They've been protecting regular people for thousands of years from other aliens creatures called Deviants. But suddenly one of these deviants returns to Earth, to be more specific London. But why would they kill human beings? Well, according to Arishem, some kind of a god called Celestial, if the population reaches a certain number, the Earth will be destroyed and a new celestial will be born. Isn't this plot confusing already? And that's just the beginning. Also Sersi became the chosen eternal to communicate with a god like creature, because something happened to Ajak, the previous leader of the team. The rest is spoilersMost of the flashbacks felt out of place and randomly added without any order. All of the characters are bland and forgetable. Sometimes it was interesting though. For example, Phastos wanting to advance the human civilization with his creations or Thena, who didn't want her memory to be erased. And one joke made me laugh about Sersi's boyfriend. I also appreciate the special effects. Sadly, for the most part, is boring and not like your typical Marvel. Not terrible, just boring. The worst thing I can say about it is that it's way too long. Can you actually sit through 2 and a half of hours of this nonsense? For some reason, me and my mom did it, but it wasn't worth it and we felt tired after watching it. I don't think even Jolie fans would enjoy this film. So, you can skip this film if you want, if you still have a wish to see it, then you can, but don't expect much and don't expect your average Marvel movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then things get complicated. If you've been watching the MCU entries and wondering why you haven't seen or heard of them before, well, the film does explain that, which you may find more or less plausible. Or not. The Eternals look like humans but they just have superhero kinds of powers. And they never age, which kind of makes sense, given that they're called...The breadth of this film is epic, covering the dawn of human civilisation to the present day, I suppose you'd call it or, at least, after ""The Blip"", which occurred in ""Avengers: Infinity war"". That being said, as an origin story, there is no need to be familiar with previous MCU films in order to feel confident watching this one, as it's a stand-alone outing.An interesting aspect to this film is how it offers an alternative myth to the rise of humans as well as implying that myths and legends which exist in our actual history are wrong. The names of the Eternals play on this notion, with characters called Ikarus (played by Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) to name but a few. Given how American Christians have protested against 'Satanic' heavy metal music or even Harry Potter, for goodness sake, I'm surprised that they haven't protested against this film for challenging biblical accounts of the nature of the universe!Now, seeing how these Eternals are depicted as advancing human civilisation over millennia, I suppose that could make one roll one's eyes in disappointment. Maybe I did this initially but I just submitted to the myth and went along for the ride. At the back of my mind, however, was the thought that this depiction patronised humans. If Marvel's counter-myth, which short-changes the ingenuity of humans offends, well, at least be calmed by the knowledge that the works of William Shakespeare aren't attributed to any of the Eternals!I can't say that seeing this film was something that I was keen to do but I did come across some information somewhere that it was (or would be) directed by Academy Award winning director Chlo√© Zhao, a woman who grew up in China (she is the first Asian woman to win an Academy Award for direction). Even though I hadn't seen any of her previous films, that titbit was enough of a lure for me to see the film, out of curiosity at least. It was a punt which I'm glad I took, in contrast to a similar scenario, which was also in the MCU, where another Academy Award winning director Ang Lee (a man who was born in Taiwan) directed ""Hulk"". That Lee film was quite a disappointment to me (I'd say that I saw that before I began reviewing films on the original ""The movie show"" website and then moved to this site when SBS closed their website). It was conceivable to me that I would also find Zhao's film pretentious and underwhelming but she's done a solid job here. Seeing a trailer for this film recently, it didn't look promising on the comedy front at least, with that scene where an Eternal breaks a table. It looked like humour aimed at very small children. However, I can say that I did laugh other times, so the humour improved (I especially liked the inside humour about online video creators).If you've seen the two most recent ""Avengers"" films and the opinions of supervillain Thanos gave you pause for thought, well, you might like the direction that ""Eternals"" goes into, as it takes this to a whole 'nother level, perhaps, with the character of Arishem.Anyway, I enjoyed this film but I don't think that I'd make a point of seeing it again and I might not be interested in seeing any sequels (unless, maybe, Zhao also directs it and...the Avengers aren't in it, perhaps). This MCU outing had a diverse cast and diverse characters. A minor gripe for me though was finding it hard to understand dialogue on some occasions, either because of accents or the use of audio effects, like that used for the voice of Arishem.The following are just random observations for my own benefit:* Is it weird that Eternals are extraterrestrial in origin yet are otherwise like humans? I mean, I assume that humans can interbreed with them!* Is it weird that the extraterrestrial Eternals have sex in the missionary position?* Is it weird that these supreme Eternal beings include the deaf amongst their ranks?* One Eternal, ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) reminded me of a similar character in ""Interview with the vampire"" (I think...my memory could be faulty here). Why is there such a young Eternal? What's that all about?* I was also wondering about the point of the Deviants but if I imagined them to be the inspiration for the concept of ""demons"", they didn't bother me so much.* One of Ikarus' superpowers reminded me of Superman...this is referenced later on in the film.* One part which I found to be unbelievable was where early humans take up arms against obviously much more powerful Eternals...which have just helped them. That didn't ring true to me...for those two reasons.* Product placement and endorsement by Eternals was quite marked. I counted two such scenes. How about you?* One scene was presented as being in Australia...I had my doubts about this, for some reason.* Climate change is brought up in the narrative.* Lastly, I found the Eternals' frequent ruminations on what makes humans worth saving insipid.* Lastly, lastly, my scoring for this film was tracking at 75% (7 out of 10 stars here), then 75+% (8 out 10 stars) then my final score of 77.5%.","20 out of 72 found this helpful.

And what a fantastically refreshing Marvel film at that. It's nice to explore some of the more interesting and varied characters from the comics for once. I enjoyed that we explored so much history, viewing Earth from a very different perspective than other MCU films, refreshing for sure
. In many ways this feels like essential viewing for the hardcore marvel fans.I can't really understand the bad reviews either, Jolie puts in one of the performances of her career. Her screen presence has never been better. Chan is fantastic, so is Madden. The sets are beautiful, the CGI is as good as it gets on screen. My one criticism would be that I figured out a major twist very early on, without even trying I should add. It was a little obvious because of some of the dialogue, at least to me personally.I enjoyed some of the subtle history nods. Some are quite obvious and I would hope everyone more or less knows what is what. Others a re a little smarter and I imagine most viewers won't catch it. It'd perhaps not best aimed at children this time, personally I think it's refreshing. There is still humour but it doesn't gift you all the information. Sometimes that makes for a better film and it does here.I definitely wouldn't listen to the negative reviews. If you love sci-fi you'll love this. If you love history, this is your film. Lastly, even if you just love cinema, you'll enjoy this. It's epic and grand and I can't wait to see more of this story.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

Halfway through I did pause to consider whether I'd enjoy going for a double root canal compared to having to watch the movie again.I don't like to hate for the sake of hating - and there were some positives. The cinematography was lovely, most of the special effects were spot on, and what a stellar cast!Unfortunately, all the characters felt under developed. If anyone was in peril or was doing a good or bad thing, I just wasn't invested enough to care. I mean, by comparison, DC did a better job at character development with Justice League.Maybe I was just expecting too much from the MCU. All previous movies and even the Disney + tv shows have been overall really good. So, this just stood out like a sore thumb.Obviously, Marvel being Marvel left us with possibilities for spin-offs, sequels, and another sub-universe. But I plead with the studio execs ""no more!""","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Eternals is Marvel's biggest swing in years. Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently. Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it. The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely unique, and full of heart. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. Eternals is also Marvel's most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio's decade-plus-long run. Chlo√© Zhao did such an amazing job directing, making the phase 4 of marvel for there fans to love and future generations to see. ""We have loved these people since the day we arrived. When you love something, you protect it.""","14 out of 49 found this helpful.

He's the most fleshed out of the group maybe because he is a love 'em and leave 'em klnda guy - that I really don't like at all so am wondering why everyone else is so stupid to fall for him!! All I know is, I cannot put any more time into this overly complex yet shallow tale of yet more superheros littering the movie galaxy.This movie makes Green Lantern look like an Emmy Winner.Time for a good book.

"4","/10","A wannabe Avengers movie that fails on all fronts, wasting its considerable cast.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7586254/?ref_=tt_urv","felix-wyderka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57321744/?ref_=tt_urv","26 November 2021","Marvel's ""The Eternals"" is a feeble attempt to enlist new group of superheroes we are supposed to care about. After living with the Avengers so many many years and getting used to familiar faces, we are now presented with a new team of superheroes, or should I say deities, that are obviously supposed to replace the avengers. Unfortunately non of the characters or actors come even close to the Avengers.The Eternals is overloaded with dialogue and information. We are told many things half of which we forget. The movie starts of quite well with the first battle the Eternals fight on earth, they are send there to protect, you see, against so called deviants. Next wee see Sersi (Gemma Chan) with her boyfriend Dane (Kit Harrington) in London. The deviants have been vanquished for thousands of years now and the Eternals live peaceful lives on earth. All of the sudden a Deviant appears in the Themse and starts attacking the city. Soon Sersi and her fellow Eternal Sprite, start fighting it and discovering a new breed of Deviant.I am going to leave you here with the plot as it is best to let you discover it for yourself as predictable and slow as it may be.We are introduced to the different members through flashbacks which occur all bhourhgut the movie. Unfortunately, this greatly disrupts the story and structure of the movie, not always knowing if we are in the present or past. I never understood why directors insist on splitting the flashback sequences into so many little parts instead of giving us a full account in the begging of the movie. That way we would have a full account of the characters and understand them better as we went along.I felt confused and frustrated by them movie. Partly because the characters were so incredibly dull and on the other hand because the cast, as good as it may be, was so underused. Harrington especially.We all know him as the brooding, fighting hero from Game of Thrones, but here he takes on a quite different role and it is so refreshing. He only has a few minutes of screen time but that's enough for us, to long to see more of him. His comic timing is spot on. He feels at home in the world and seeing him in normal clothes and short hair brings a refreshing change to his persona. Unfortunately not all of the cast members are as convincing. Richard Madden for example, Harrington's co-star in GOT, doesn't seem to be very comfortable in the movie. Every time we see him in the first hour his performance is wooden and he is as stiff as a plank. In fact none of the Eternals appear to have any chemistry with each other. Neither the actors nor the characters. They feel like random characters thrown together to form unit, but not knowing how. The cast, in case you don't know, consists of bights like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek or Kumail Nanjiani. None of them can bring their considerable talents to the movie, given their characters are completely flat and boring.""Eternals"" tries hard to be a new Avengers movie, but the lack of background and missing of credible threat make them seem like a bunch of gods wanting to stir up trouble. Chloe Zao is an incredible director and she deserved her Oscar this year. I am sure she gives her best here but even she can't make much of a script as confused and messy as this one.Should there be another movie, I do hope they share more of the characters backgrounds and make it more entraining this one. I am hoping for more refined action sequences and less dialogue, letting the characters speak for themselves.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This by far the most gorgeous MCU movie. However, there are a number of CGI effects that are rough for a Marvel movie, which shouldn't happen as often as it does considering the enormous budget Disney typically pours into its large action superhero movies. Second, the characters. It has 10 characters, which is an absurd number to care about, but is comic accurate. It is for this reason that Eternals should've been a TV show or two-part movie. However, considering that the movie is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, the characterization should be more developed than it is. Some of the characters do have interesting motivations, but not enough to save the movie. The writers' attempts to forge a bond between the characters become a copied and pasted version of the dynamic we've seen in other Marvel movies. They attempt to create this bond through jokes (which do land), banter, and tender moments (some of which land), but unfortunately these are not used effectively enough to guide the audience into feeling anything beyond basic surface emotions for the characters. Third, the MCU has its first sex scene. It is brief and not explicit, but completely unnecessary to the plot and characters and was avoidable. Fourth, the pace. This movie rushes forward, then slows down, then rushes forward, and so on. It typically goes between fight scenes with Deviants and philosophical discussions. This is very annoying because, while entertaining, the fights with the Deviants begin to feel repetitive and like they are there to fill the runtime. It is as if the movie cannot decide where it's trying to go, so it lurches back and forth. Fifth, the story. I loved the high concepts and backstory this movie introduced. Thev were certainly the strongest part of the movie. They made me excited for the future of the MCU. However, this movie feels more like a setup movie than an actual movie we are supposed to care about. It is forgettable, except for the things it sets up. As mentioned before, the Deviants seem to be there to entertain and fill the runtime, not to meaningfully contribute to the story. By the end of the film they almost feel like wasted villains. The story becomes interesting when the high-concept philosophical issues are being explored. Finally, the movie is mostly well-acted, as would be expected with a cast of this caliber. However, some of the actors seem to be bored with the material they've been given. I would be too. The two post-credits scenes are worth the wait.If you're looking for an entertaining Marvel(ish) movie, this is for you. If you're looking for unique concepts, complex characters, and outstanding execution, then very specific parts of this are for you. Sometimes Eternals doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, and that's a good thing because it indicates Marvel could break free of its standard formula. Unfortunately, the concepts are much better than the execution. Eternals had the tools it needed to be successful, and it isn't a bad movie, it just wasn't put together right. Even if it's not particularly rewatchable it is worth seeing for the sake of understanding the future of Phase Four.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

You have to give a kudos to creators for bringing this grand concept to life.I liked the visual side of ""Eternals"" very much. This movie looks amazing. Cinematography was gorgeous, special effects were great. Acting was solid but no Oscar will be won here - its just a great cast doing their good jobs.

Like below sea level downhill. It was rambling and pointless and couldn't make up its mind what it wants to be. Drama? Comedy? Romance? Doesn't matter- it wasn't successful at any of them. Preachy, scolding, aimless and so boring. Utter waste of time. I really didn't care about any of the characters and found myself actually rooting for the one who was supposed to be the bad guy. Two stars only because I though the Scottish guy playing Ikarus was pretty good.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Never mind, just sit back, relax and enjoy the fun. The Eternals are sent to Earth to protect humans against the Deviants, predatory monsters. Arriving in Mesopotamia in 5000 BC they battle the Deviants using killer eye-beams, super strength etc. The locals are a plucky bunch though and menace the Eternals with spears so Druig (Barry Keoghan) has to control their minds, those minds and hearts are soon won with gifts. Throughout history the Eternals battle the monsters, we them in Babylon (complete with hanging gardens) in 575 BC, in Gupta, 400AD. They have a sort of Prime Directive not to interfere in human conflicts and this especially causes problems for Druig when he sees the Conquistadors slaughtering Aztecs in 1521. But they do nudge technological development along with inventions by Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), I'm not saying it's Aliens but... Anyway after a 500 hiatus the Deviants return so the Eternals must assemble once more. I'm always expecting Ikaris (Richard Madden) to say See You Jimmy in his Scottish accent as he headbutts a monster. Thena (Angelina Jolie) forms weapons from cosmic energy but (like a Limerickian) is likely to stab anyone due to her demented state (Mahd Wy'ry). There are ten Eternals in total with numerous other characters. A coupe of interesting plot twists add to the intrigue. An action drama with a fine vein of humour. Directed and Co-written by Chlo√© Zhao. 8/10.","22 out of 93 found this helpful.

Eternals delivers on this potential more than any superhero movie in the recent history. It is grand in scale, absolutely stunning visually, progressively cast and humanely told.It has melodrama in spades, but in a similar way the best X-men movies used to have. Each and every character is interesting and sufficiently nuanced.The action is clean and satisfying.The abilities are somewhat archetypal and simplistic but are represented with such gusto that every use of them is pure geeky joy.This is probably the most dramatically satisfying movie in the Marvel catalogue to date. Up there with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and the Holland Spider-Man Movies.It is long and somewhat slowpaced.Jokes are as always might seem to some to be misplaced....
The movie is TRULY diverse in its cast. In many ways that might annoy a certain type of movie goer/comics reader. But the diversity is not the point. It just makes the characters sooo much more real. Which is a good thing....

Eternals ended up my favorite group of heroes from the one and only MCU movies.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only thing that truly bothered me about the characters was the young one who even though has 7000 years of memories still acts like a kid, but that could also have to do with her origin. The movie was good, it had many different personalities throughout the cast. Aside from scientific technicalities it played well and I hope they make a sequel... it's a touch darker than your typical Marvel go, so that's something to be aware of.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

It may even be the weirdest inclusion in the MCU including the Netflix and Hulu shows. A majority of the time it feels like its not a Marvel movie.When it does return to the old MCU tropes, like it's humor, it is still funny but extremely out of place. This is a movie that wants you to take it very seriously and get emotionally attached to these characters.The issue with this includes but is not limited to:
-WAY too many new characters
-Many plain underdeveloped and poorly written characters.-Too much time being covered at once
-Too much new lore that was a lot to keep up with even if it wasn't filled with plot holes.The movie just feels quickly thrown together like a DCEU film and then decked out in I'll admit gorgeous and expensive scenery to make it seem worth watching.I'd argue this movie doesn't fit into the MCU more than any other project Marvel has done. It is very unbelievable to me no one discovered the Eternals or noticed this Avengers level threat when there's so many heroes out there like Doctor Strange.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Chloe Zhao is a brilliant director and I am forever gratefull to her for giving us Drukkari.The story is unlike anything we have seen before in the MCU and personally I find it quite refreshing to see superheroes other that Captain America and Iron Man. It was also really interesting to see the superheroes having completely different super powers than what we are used to see from the MCU. I'm here for all cosmic energy weapons!

Just make someone fight for something. Really, it is boring and left me so oblivious, that I will not even ponder if the blockbusters degenerated into this sterile hodge-podge because that was what the average audience wanted, or the customer taste was over time ""cultivated"" to be satisfied with this ""a bit of fight a bit of love"" template non-sense. Even the 1990s catastrophic epics look like a ""high art"" compared to this ""fast film"" hamburgeriade.Idiotic costumes and kitschy designs - even for a comic adaptation. Some fighting with absurd weapons and abilities that in its entirety would be too much even for a parody. Concocted storyline. Horribly painful replicas, debilitating dialogues, whimsical motivation. Are the studio managers so stupid or so anxious in relying on the elementary-school few-word sentences that actually just comment on what is happening on the screen? Is drawing a real story, real characters with real problems and real conversations (even at the median intelligence level) such a market risk for the product?

What this is, is a pretty bad Marvel film.If you think of this as an indie movie or a low budget production, with vast usage of open spaces, and easily filmed-in locations taking advantage of the superhero-craze.. then it might even be worth discussing. A copycat attempt that it's quite decent!Otherwise.. it is an awfully boring set of characters with logically inconsistent and unbalanced set of powers (for their purpose), terribly slow and dull dialogue, pointless additions (like the Deviants, that go nowhere, instead of using a completely internal struggle), world-building implications that unnecessarily affect the universe they created and don't really make sense physically, and poor addition/adaptation of someone's beloved character from the comics.I also found interesting and constant mention of other franchises I would rather be watching (Superman, Peter Pan, etc)..Like Cap Marvel, it can be completely ignored.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Personally, I'd rather they made a hundred good 'Spider-Man' or 'X-Men' films and left the more obscure Marvel characters in the comics so that they could do the existing Marvel Cinematic Universe more justice and in an effective way to keep the interest in it, without just making films for the sake of it or to introduce a character in a scene after the credits.Everyone else had their own stories that were worth watching, with hints of what might come later, but this seemed like they were just chucking anything out to introduce something new and to keep the name Marvel on the lips of the audiences.It already felt cheaper than any of the other films within the first few minutes, kind of like one of those terrible Syfy channel films with supporting actors from awful soaps and the odd celebrity that had been declassified from A list to K list or lower and it reminded me of the poorer
production qualities of 'Xena: Warrior Princess"" (1995-2001) or 'Hercules' (1995-9).Even though it definitely bore some similarities to 'Inhumans' (2017) it was still so different to what we had seen before and perhaps if it hadn't been a Marvel film, set in the same universe as 'Iron Man' (2008) and 'Captain America' (2011), it might have been good in its own right, but it was so apart from the other stories that it jarred a little bit and was hard to see how it could fit in. It was also very rushed as they tried to introduce a whole new team of people in less than two and a half hours.I assumed that we were supposed to realise that the teams names were all altered versions of Roman and Greek mythology and that, because they had been on the planet for so long, they were actually the basis for those myths?But as heroes went, they were all just a bit too ""Super"", like when 'Captain Marvel' (2019) conveniently turned up to save the day in 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) with all sorts of powers that were just what they needed. And sadly they didn't really know how to use them or even how to work as a team, which meant that they struggled and were not really the strong characters that an audience would want to get behind.I couldn't stand the character of Sprite and I felt that the casting of Gilgamesh seemed a little too close to that of 'Wong' from 'Doctor Strange' (2016). I also felt that it would be nice to see Richard Madden, who played 'Ikaris', in a role where he isn't a bad boyfriend, because despite his alleged love for 'Sersi', I thought that he was lusting after Angelina Jolie in her role as 'Thena'.I actually did like 'Sersi' played by Gemma Chan and felt that she was leading the whole thing, because I didn't have time to get to know any of the others or their capabilities and she seemed to have the focus.Selma Hayek as 'Ajak' was good too, but didn't receive enough screen time, due to the complicated, confusing and at times quite silly storyline.The character of Kingo was just daft and an attempt to bring in the same quirky humour from 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017), which didn't work.To start with I enjoyed Kit Harrington as Dane as well, because he seemed to be at least a few degrees away from his other character, Jon Snow from 'Game Of Thrones' (2011-9), but then something happened which made me wonder about the future of his character and whether he could deliver it well.In general, I felt that this group could have been portrayed better if they had made this first meeting a TV series instead of a film. They could have quite easily introduced a new character and or their abilities with each episode, as they built up to a final battle at the end of the series and once the characters were established they could have been used throughout their own films going forward, as well as the rest of the Marvel Cinematic and TV Universe, but it felt like this hurried and unpolished film was just a way to set up what will be an updated 'Avengers' cast, introducing characters that we know to join up with them from the comics (Although I only know, because I read it in the encyclopaedia).Also, having started off so rushed, the ending seemed to slow right down and became quite dragged out. It was a tad complicated and hard to follow at times too and I'm not sure that all of the time jumping helped to deliver the desired effect.By showing the previous issues that they'd had in flashback just before the right moment, when they became relevant it just seemed to explain what was going to happen. It was the equivalent of 'James Bond' being given an exploding watch in one scene and using it straight away. It took away the mystery of when and how things might happen. It became a bit jumbled as a result too.And although I appreciate that ""Theatre"" and in some respects, film, should be blind to skin colour, nationalities, abilities, Etc, it was distracting that they all had such different accents. I didn't believe that they would have accrued them all so differently over time. If I was a Celestial sending a team to earth, they would only have had enough difference to enable them to fit in wherever they were working and would all have had a basic toned voice, but right from the start they had accents that probably weren't even in existence that many years BC.It was good that they did have such a variety, if that's what they were trying to achieve, which I assumed was in the hopes of making a point about diversity. However, because I needed subtitles for some of the accents it was just very noticeable.I also felt, because it was really quite badly put together and that one or two of the actors were really bad, that the whole exercise seemed to be a waste of some of the good actors that could have been used better in other Marvel films, as new versions of more popular characters or new people that could be introduced on top of those we already know. Gemma Chan would have made an excellent 'Psylocke' and Richard Madden could have been a good 'Banshee' for instance. And actually a few of the secondary characters actors were a bit of an odd choice in the first place.I did however, appreciate the LGBT representation. It wasn't much and no fuss was made about it, which is how it should be. I just like to see that it's there.I feel that with those few films that have been released since 'Endgame' there has been a need to keep momentum going and as a result they have skipped the final checks that they would have done previously, missing out on a extra filter, realising that the Deviants all looked a bit cartoony and that the soundtrack was oddly quiet. And I think that they rely far too much on CGI, which makes the whole picture seem less real and therefore more difficult to get in to.I do have some sympathies with the producers, directors and studios, because you can see that they are trying, but it comes across that they are trying too hard.Sadly one of my notes for this review was
""They're not going to make another one are they?"", because I think they are.I can only hope that it is freer to pursue the characters and their journeys having got this awkward and clumsy origin story out of the way.539.09/1000.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Terrible ratings on tommats, low ratings from critics, cries that a complete failure were replaced by cries that this is the best Marvel movie with such constancy that I myself did not know what exactly to expect from the film. Chloe Zhao is undoubtedly an incredibly talented director, ""The Land of Nomads"" is a meditative masterpiece, but will the Oscar winner be able to shoot a major blockbuster for the main cinema franchise? He can! Yes, he can! As has been said several times - ""Eternal"" is not a Marvel movie, it's a Chloe Zhao movie, and this really makes it the best picture of the franchise in a very long time. Chloe Zhao, the director of independent films, was able to remove her author's statement skillfully hidden behind a bright, superhero costume. A meditative, infinitely sweet, meticulously introducing us to each character, the film puts at the forefront of a purely ""Snyder"" question - what kind of life is it for gods among people. A real drama about the gravity of the divine gift, an incredible epic, after watching which I would like to say - a MOVIE. ""Eternal"" has a lot in common with Zack Snyder's Justice League, not only by a long, thorough acquaintance with each character, not only the question raised for consideration, but also the feeling that the film leaves after its viewing. No Marvel movie has ever caused me such a strong sense of GREATNESS with its monumental approach to creating a picture. ""Eternal"" by Chloe Zhao is a brief excursion through all the mythology known to us (after all, it was the Eternal Ones who became the prototypes of all the mythical deities within the cinematic universe), it's an incredible cast, it's amazing characters (every single one!), it's a powerful drama that was not in the KVM before, and it's not a fact what will happen after. Despite the mixed reaction of the audience and critics, despite the not very good fees, I will firmly believe that Chloe Zhao will retain the director's chair in the sequel to ""Eternal"", because right now it seems that no one but her will be able to work with these characters as well. ""Eternal"", like ""Guardians"", feels like the brainchild of only one director, who left behind a gorgeous legacy within the framework of the KVM.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They made me care about a group of heroes I knew little about and had me cheering them on with intense emotional energy at the final conflict of the movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Marvel has always succeeded in introducing new characters to its universe, further proving it through this film. Each character is given interesting personality traits and ideologies that lend themselves to a personal feel to the film, which most other MCU films have never fully explored. It is only furthered by the entertaining and endearing chemistry provided by the notable cast. The powers of each character are brilliantly utilized to provide visually breathtaking sequences of action and world-building. Despite the amount it tries to accomplish, this film, for the most part, succeeds in illustrating the new aspect of the universe Marvel wishes to explore, creating an existential insight into the world outside of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, it's also because of this aspect that makes the film at times feel bloated with many pockets of the story that feel unexplored. Although this can be used for further sequels, the amount of story that is thrown on screen may at times feel overwhelming with brand new information being provided with limited screen time. The aspect ratio can also be distracting at times, shifting from gigantic IMAX visuals to standard camera shots without flow in its transition. Despite the number of positives, the film manages to accomplish, the over bloated nature of the film's story feels akin to something that should be made for the small screen, making for a mixed yet interesting viewing experience.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sadly, this movie was lacking in several areas. The story was weak, the pacing was sloooow, missed the mark on some casting (needed more Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie brought absolutely nothing to her character - maybe they should have switched rolls). Gemma and Madden are pretty to look at but they were missing something, especially in their live story. There were a few good performances from Brian Tyree Henry, Harish Patel and Don Lee. The shining star in my opinion was Kumail Nanjiani. He got ripped for the part and it showed. He had the right sense of humor Marvel movies have been known for and I appreciate. Most of his scenes were hilarious and the rest were bad-ass because his actions scenes were the best all around. I wanted to see more of him fighting. He said 'peace out' for the big climactic ending and was sorely missed. Also, the antagonists were lame, prehistoric alien dinosaur creatures has been done before and better. What a disappointment.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is a part of phase 4 of the MARVEL cinematic universe and was released with high anticipation. It has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews but somehow I liked it and to my surprise I liked it better than Shang Chi. Eternal's may not be the perfect MARVEL movie, but it does have pretty much all the classic MARVEL characteristics.While the main plot of the Eternals occurs in the post 'blip' MARVEL era, it also connects to some of the major historic events of human civilization. Some of the mythological references to the characters work well. But the difficult part is to introduce another set of superheroes doing the same things as Avengers. The story tries to explain why they were not involved in the previous battles on earth, but it is just not convincing enough. Eternals suffers from the lack of character introduction just like DC's Justice League a few years ago. There are too many things thrown at you at once and for most of the film I didn't even realize how many Eternals there were forget about what their superpowers are. I believe Eternals would have worked better as a separate universe in itself like Xmen. Apart from a few, most of the characters lack chemistry between them.Despite the above criticism, Eternals manages to entertain somehow thanks to Kumail Nanjiani and Bryan Tyree Henry's comic timing. The director has made full use of Nanjiani's comedy background and also South Asian heritage. There are many scenes aimed at pleasing the Indian audience and they work well. Of course there is forced diversity at times, but that is how the future looks like for the big movie studios. Richard Madden and Gemma Chan as Sersi do a decent job but I personally didn't feel so emotionally connected to them as the leaders of the pack. Angelina Jolie's character loses itself in the mysterious vibe created around her. Ma Dong-seok and Lauren Ridloff are pretty impressive. Harish Patel's role is a pleasant surprise to all the Indian audience out there. Although Kit Harrington barely gets any screen time in this movie, I believe he will get more in the upcoming ones.Eternals may be a forced addition to the MARVEL's universe but it is thoroughly entertaining and I hope it does get better from now on.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A visually stunning triumph that goes thematically deeper than any Marvel film thus far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7531319/?ref_=tt_urv","JoelAlexanderr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94233651/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2021","I have never been more disappointed leaving a movie than I was leaving ETERNALS. Not because of the movie -- in fact, it was because the movie was astonishingly great that I felt this way. I was disappointed because I have never seen such an instant and passionate hatred online for a movie, and for no concrete reason that I can discern. ETERNALS is perhaps the best MCU film since Avengers: Endgame, and is the most ambitious superhero film I can think of in the past few years. Every minute looks gorgeous and is a visual feast. Director Chlo√© Zhao dares to go thematically where no Marvel movie has gone before. This is a brave and different big-budget tentpole movie that finally gives fans the deeper experience that many have been craving from the MCU, so it's only natural that critics are tearing this movie to shreds for being ""boring"" and ""dry"" while praising Dune in the same breath.Eternals is, admittedly, a lesser known Marvel comic that only hardcore fans are likely to know in detail.. However, the plot is simple: the Eternals are immortal beings that have been residing on Earth for centuries and have seen it through each stage of human development. Their goal is to rid the Earth of Deviants: monsters who ravage planets and the life that resides on them. The film transitions between present-day and important events during the Eternals' history on Earth to effectively tell their story. In the present day, the Eternals begin to realize that the Deviants are returning for unknown reasons and planning something terrible for humanity. However, some truths that the Eternals have taken for granted are not what they seem, and the truth may reveal a more complicated reality that will unearth some uncomfortable revelations.From the very start, the look and feel of ETERNALS is different from any other superhero movie, and that is almost entirely attributable to Chlo√© Zhao, who directs this big-budget Marvel blockbuster like an indie film. Most directors, when they are sucked into the MCU, are forced to water down their artistic tendencies and cater to the formula that Disney has established for their superhero movies. While Zhao still includes many of the trademarks Marvel fans are used to seeing, the general approach is different and more ambitious than the traditional origin story. ETERNALS is an epic of gargantuan proportions that has to not only develop each character at a personal level, but has to relay the story of how the universe was created and why life exists. Zhao does all of this with an auteur's creativity and expertise, and always manages to connect every aspect of the story to the deep human emotions ingrained in the plot material. Along with this, it examines some of the most existential and essential human issues one can explore -- it shares many themes with Zhao's previous films but on a bigger scale.Zhao also adds her visual flair to ETERNALS, making this far and away the most visually impressive MCU film yet, which is saying quite a lot when Shang-Chi, Thor: Ragnarok and many others exist. Sure, the movie doesn't have as vibrant a color palette as, say, Ragnarok does, but, similar to Nomadland, Zhao constantly has an eye for the natural light and the beautiful Earthy background, which, in this case, adds to the sentimentality the Eternals have for the planet they've called home for thousands of years. The wide shots in this movie are gorgeous and shot in a way that no other director could, and that alone makes this film stand out from other superhero films. Some have pointed out the shotty CGI in one or two scenes, however I did not notice these while viewing but only when people complained about them on the Internet. Almost every scene in this movie has impressive visual effects, so one or two scenes where the effects are noticeable failed to take me out of the narrative.The narrative is constantly engaging and emotional, and develops more layers as it progresses. A common complaint I have seen circling around film conversations is that all of the characters are dry and boring, and that the movie drags on because nothing is interesting. Not only do I disagree wholeheartedly with these thoughts, but I think these are some of the most complex, human and yet larger-than-life characters the MCU has introduced in a solo movie. Much of the details regarding each character's arcs are somewhat spoilers and were not revealed in any promotional material for the film, so I won't go into too much more specifics here, but the ethical dilemma that the Eternals have to face regarding the fate of humanity is one that even I was struggling to decide upon.Sure, I understand ETERNALS is not going to be for everyone, but there is something about the reaction of this movie that seems off-putting to me. Not often do I see a movie regarded by all as being a complete failure before many have even seen it, especially when said movie is a fantastic and well-made film that stands out from the pack. The acting here is all top-notch, with not one weak link throughout (Richard Madden as Ikaris was perhaps my favorite, although there are many great performances), and there was never one scene that struck me as even getting anywhere near the definition of the word ""bad."" While this does not make the movie good on its own, I find it odd how Marvel fans have been clamoring for both a movie that breaks from the formula and a movie that showcases diversity, and when one that covers both comes handed to them on a silver platter, it becomes ""the worst rated MCU movie ever made."" All I know is that ETERNALS deserves far more attention than critics seem to be saying, and I genuinely believe that in years to come people will begin looking back at the initial reception of this film as being erroneous and misguided. The ideas it has are far more interesting and contemplative than the reviews seem to be saying, and the clear amount of effort and passion put into every shot tell a story of success and creativity.A.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's watchable. It's an intriguing idea. But I feel what lets this down is the characters - there is no connection, no story to them. Maybe because of the quantity or probably more the story. Personally I think this would have been better outside MCU. The links to MCU just do not work well - sadly one of the bottom imo of the 26 movies. Difficult to explain what exactly went wrong; no one single thing just lots of little things which amazingly drag this movie out. Very predictable too. The cut scenes come across a little more interesting. Maybe characters were over powered; and though there are several comments to DC - it really does feel like a bad DC knock off with characters abilities. Probably half the problem was it was MCU Earth; maybe a different realm like Shang-Chi would have been a better direction.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Holy crap the critics REALLY got this one wrong. It's a solid masterpiece of a movie and one of the most beautiful, unique and innovative films that Marvel has ever produced, thanks to Chloe Zhao's visionary talent. It isn't your average Marvel movie, hell it doesn't even feel like one. And that's why I love it! It's a breath of fresh air and shows the MCU taking bold, new risks, instead of just using the same type of storytelling. I love the creative choices that were made and how they all make it stand out in such a special way from the rest of the MCU, from the dense mythology, gorgeous visuals and more emotional, character driven storyline. It really taps in to the work of Jack Kirby, from a story and even visual perspective. This movie is still blowing my mind, its one that is getting better and better the more I think about, process and digest it, and I'm sure it will only get better with more viewings! (And god I cannot wait to see it again!) The film is ambitious, but handles everything so perfectly, which Chloe Zhao deserves every praise for! Her direction is stunningly beautiful, incredibly strong and she brings her very nuanced style to the MCU. I love how she puts story and character above the action, and while not one of the action is as big as some sequences from other films, what we get really works for the story! The film has a scope that is so ambitious and epic, feeling a lot like Zack Snyder's Justice League, which for me is a great thing. Zhao's script is also really well done, the mythology is rich and complex, the story is emotional, pure and heartfelt with so much humanity imbued into the characters. The characters were really fantastic and I fell in love with all of them very quickly. I really liked how the movie made every character feel important and valued, and with a cast of 10 main characters I found Zhao balanced their screen time and actions/conflicts really well. One of the best parts of the film is the dynamics and interplay between the characters. The Eternals are all essentially gods, but Zhao, alongside her stunning cast, did such a good job at bringing the humanity to each of their personalities and stories. It's a complex story with differing character motivations and ideologies, and I loved how the end battle was essentially a battle of ideologies as the Eternals sought to develop their own sense of autonomy from the Celestials. I also thought some of the dialogue at the start was a little iffy, but as the movie got going it got better. I loved the humour throughout, there were many really funny moments for sure! And like I said, the cast was perfect, each of the actors brought a warmth and sense of life to their roles. I especially loved Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden and Brian Tyree Henry, but it was clearly Gemma Chan's movie. Barry Keoghan was also such a surprise! Kit Harington had a smaller role than expected but I am so excited to see where his character goes moving forward! And that's another thing I loved about the movie; it reinvigorated my excitement for the future of the MCU and showed me how different and new it could get! The world building in the film is excellent, it really fleshes out the cosmic side of the MCU in such a rich and intricate way, making the MCU feel much more grand and complex. The movie essentially is what Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" wishes it was, and tells that sort of story but from the perspective of the engineers, which in this movie were the Celestials. I loved how they handled the Celestial scenes, especially in how they showed the physical scale and massiveness of Arishem compared to Ajax and Sersi. The visuals themselves, throughout the entire movie, are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. Chloe Zhao is truly gifted with a sense to capture the perfect shot, with stunning lighting and colour. Its easily the best looking MCU film, and I loved the natural feel that the on-location shooting did for the film. Its truly a feast for the eyes and felt so visually rich because it wasn't all CGI environments and was so brightly lit. I really admire the effort put into the cinematography for this film, and even the CGI looked stunning! The costumes also looked excellent and were nicely colourful! The design of the deviants was really cool, but unfortunately the characters themselves are somewhat wasted and served as better plot devices than villains, but luckily the story has a clever twist later on in the film. The overall villains of the movie are a lot more ambiguous than in a usual comic book movie, and that really worked for me. I really enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I have to say it is definitely one of the best films that Marvel has ever produced. It doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, it is very much a Chloe Zhao film and that is easily its biggest strength! Please go see it and form your own opinions, I can see how some may see it as divisive, but I was completely swept away by it! It's a triumph; a slow burning story that is epic in nature, beautiful in character development, and has gorgeous visuals. It's something the MCU hasn't seen yet, and has major implications for the future. I respect it alone for the bold creative risks Marvel took in making this film, and hope we see more experimentation from them like this! Not only that, but wow Chloe Zhao is truly a force of nature and proves she can handle a blockbuster! I loved it, its so fresh and really something truly special and transformative for Marvel, and wow it only gets better with time! (And woah, those end credit scenes were pretty exciting!)","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Would not recommend to an audience who is not interested in critically consuming media, they may come out of the experience with some warped opinions of what is and isn't okay.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

WTF is THIS ???FIRE the screenwriters, directors & anyone who had any input on this movie. MARVEL, with ALL your resources at your disposal it's really embarrassing that you people release this kind of GARBAGE ! Do you care about your fans and costumers at all ? Or are you people just trying to make more money on top of all you have by slashing whatever you can to come up w/ this TRASH. From the beginning of the movie I was shaking my head from the NONSENSE I was seeing & in the hope that it will get better ! Sadly it just got worse and worse by the minute. Anyone w/ ANY kind of COMMON SENSE can see the stupidity of what they are seeing . A 10 year old can come up with a better STORY & DIALOG between the actors ! I do not blame the actors @ all, as they simply were doing their job. I honestly will stop here MARVEL... you people do not deserve a minute more of my time.Stopped watching the movie at the 16:55 minute mark !Try A LOT harder next time !","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It provides enriched cinematography and dutifully examines the emotional temperament of each eternal, along with the nature of their existence.Eternals is essentially Marvel lore, its religion, and is treated as such. It's a fundamental keystone to the evolution of Marvels universe and is regarded as such. As is the case with most religions, there can be some boring parts. But they're only boring if you're wanting something more than emotional character development.This is a regular marvel movie because it has the responsibility of being something more. They've introduced wonderful memorable characters, enhanced the depth of the universe, and invigorated interest in the stories to come.If you're a real marvel fan, you'll understand the necessity of this type of story and will be excited to see how it ties into the rest of the universe in the stories to come.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was successfully done. I could not believe it was cohesive at all.Could it be done better? Maybe in an arthouse 5-10 hour movie. I am unaware if there is a precedent for a blockbuster of this size and relatively short runtime.The title of this review is meant to cause as much outrage as The Eternals. At the end of the day what I learnt is that we are irrelevant and small, minuscule filth in the universe, whatever good or bad you do while in here is all that matters, hating two people who kiss is what many focused on.

In terms of how much distance we feel from the characters as the overarching story is told, this feels more like The Odyssey than your typical Marvel movie, and I see that as a strength. And don't forget: this is part of a franchise; if you want more development of a particular character, remember that future films are coming. But also, why not try perceiving your own life from a grander perspective? I hope this movie stretches the viewers to rethink their own sense of their role in history.Some viewers also blasted the film for pushing the maturity level of the content, and even as a moral conservative, I have to defend the filmmakers for this choice. This movie is part of a franchise, and so it makes sense for its installments to mature as its viewers mature. The Harry Potter franchise did the same thing.One more thing I appreciated: the final film had so much less comedy than the previews led me to fear. Telling a story spanning 7000 years should have a gravitas and solemnity to it. I believe it patronizes the viewer, for a filmmaker to believe we need weighty matters broken up by laughs. We are growing up. Our movies should too.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Characters uninteresting. The story didn't interest me either and was a bit poorly presented here and there as it jumped around to the past and then to the present and was a bit of a goulash for me. The action wasn't bad, but there wasn't much of it, and especially it wasn't good enough to keep the film at 2 and a half hours. Like I said. The action wasn't bad, but Endgame set the bar high and this was definitely weaker than that. To sum it up. The movie itself wasn't even all that spectacular in my opinion, and when you add in the fact that this is the third Marvel movie and that the previous ones were great, this is a pretty big downer for me. I'm disappointed. The thing that scares me the most about this is that this probably isn't the only movie and there will be a second installment. Who knows? Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. But for now, I'm not looking forward to it at all and I wouldn't see it as a series. For me, a mediocre movie that I don't recommend and if anything, really only to the biggest Marvel fans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A couple of the characters are played by such well known actors that I couldn't buy into the fact there were in fact eternals. There was a twist at the end which looks as though will be interesting to explore. Could have done with being a bit shorter . Was incredibly long , and some parts drawn out . Effects were spectacular as we come to expect these days . There is a smattering of comedy thrown in which lightens the general sombre feel .Worth a watch.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The style of the movie was clean and almost abstract which was interesting to experience. The fighting sequences and strengths of the characters were powerful and very entertaining to watch. I love the dynamics seen between the characters. My favorite thing about Eternals though, was the cinematography. The visuals and setting were insane, each shot being mesmerizing to look at. The storyline was interesting and had plot twists that left me shocked. I found myself getting emotional along with the characters. Overall the movie as a whole was well done, but it's not the best the MCU has created.

The plot is jumpy and the story is week and erratic and the worst And saddest part is not only do I not care about the characters, with a few exceptions I actively dislike them.If I cared about them, I might be prepared to let the plot holes and weekness pass but it seems to me if this is marvel's new direction they are in for a rude awakening. Please let this be a slight anomaly and not the new direction. I think the critics were so taken with how new everything was they forgot what marvel comics were truly about and who their core fans are and what they love.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is a continuation of Marvel expanding its genres rather than just pure action movies. Eternals has beautiful cinematography. The movie does fluctuate in pace due to introducing many new characters all at once. The characters appear to very stiff at first, but continue to soften and develop throughout the movie due to exposure to Earth. I love some of the small moments that truly make the Eternals a family. There are small interactions between characters acting more like siblings nagging each other. The characters vary from the comics which I think are enjoyable creating more diversity in the MCU which is neededGemma Chan is at the heart of the movie and she delivers. You feel Chan's character, Sersi weigh decisions regarding the future of earth and what she was made to do.There is the overarching theme of time and its impact on all of us.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The family displayed here was something amazing and special that was directed beautifully. If having such representation is problematic and considered woke as a negative, then the world is sick. To other critics who believe the problem with the film was the directing and the two together are negatively impacting this director's career, you are just wrong. The casting, directing, plot, and special effects are the movie's positives. This movie however has real production and editing problems. There were multiple points that I found were unalligned to previous things said, and way too much cut. You could tell something else was filmed in multiple places throughout this movie, which was also too long, but were edited out incoherently. So much needed to be in that was obviously cut, whereas so much needed to be cut that was left in, making it unnecessarily lengthy. The time could have been the same if the right scenes were kept more wholly while taking out scenes that added no value or understanding.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I thought I understood the film and what it did right (and possibly wrong) for various folks. I also thought I knew ""how"" it deviated from fhe Marvel formula, and what it would keep. I was wrong in so many ways, sometimes completely, and that was an intriguing feeling for a Marvel film.Because of some things I won't share here to avoid spoilers, there are very real stales in this film there aren't in many of the other Marvel ones. By the last third, I felt I had zero ability to predict what would happen with and to our heroes and villains and that was kind of awesome. I found myself invested in ways I am not in the standard Marvel film.I also thought, for some reason, that it wouldn't be funny. I had it my head it would be a serious drama, devoid of Marvel joy. That wasn't the case, at all. It was plenty funny (not a comedy, by any means, but it had a lot of lightness) and the vistas and action looked and felt so different from other films. It was clear they shot on real locations without as many worlds ""created"" with CGI and I really found that really enhanced my enjoyment.I also worried it would feel too crowded with that many movie stars needing to serviced with screentime and big moments. But that wasn't an issue. Some spend whole stretches completely off camera and that lets other parts of the story breathe without having to play everyone in every scene.I will say this is the kind of film you might need a few hours or a day to fully process. It asks big questions, zigs when you expected it to zag, and makes some choices that are story service more than fan service, and we aren't always used to not getting what we expect. And there are a lot of new characters to experience and think about. I almost wish reviewers didn't have to write their articles right afterward, because I wonder if some would have had more nuanced take after having some time. But either way this is definitely a film to see yourself and form your own opinion on, as it may very well feel as brilliant to you as it did to me.Oh, and I am looking forward to seeing where Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman goes next.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I also understand that this is the beginning of the Eternals, so I know the next one will be better. And the actors were on point, great job from every single one of them.

It also features a cast that has little to none chemistry, jokes that never land and a runtime that exceeds any acceptable level for this kind of story. The movie is actually saved by it's ridiculousness starting at about the end of the first third, from which point it at least leaves you speechless and at awe of what you are witnessing.

I actually think the core plot and themes of Eternals is pretty good and interesting. But the following problems, listed in reverse order of importance, really cripple the film and make it one of the weakest entries in the MCU.First off, what is the deal with the color and light balance? I watched this movie on Disney plus at home; perhaps the experience is different in other settings, but I constantly struggled to make out what was happening in the many low-light settings. I actually had to rebalance the video settings on my tv. I've seen plenty of dimly lit shows and movies before, and I've never had to resort to changing my settings. From time to time, I also noticed issues with the audio balance too. Ie, the voice of the celestial was strangely muted.Secondly, the movie is way too reliant on CGI, and it's not very good CGI. This is particularly a problem for movies where the baddies are 100% rendered. The whole thing feels plastic, like watching a cartoon or video game cutscene.Thirdly and most importantly, this movie falls into the classic trap of presenting upfront a superhero team without any precursor development. I thought the whole point of the MCU was to avoid this? The Eternals are a group of ten(10!!) heroes that we've never seen before. How can ten protagonists possibly be given proper treatment in one film? The group as a whole (already established at the movie's onset) is also brand new to audiences. By contrast, the origin of the team was precisely the plot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.What is the result of this? *Exposition*. Grueling, in-your-face plot exposition told through montages (which are further deadened by the aforementioned CGI), monologues and flat conversations. The movie compounds this by springing back and forth through time (10s or 100s of years at once) in order to sprinkle in tiny bits that are supposed to add dimension and color to the characters; the payoff is never worth the break in flow caused by these excursions.There are a lot of comedic quips, many that fall flat and many that probably will age very poorly, but those are not enough to blow life into what often feels like an overly long trudge.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This highly-anticipated Marvel movie brings together a diverse and powerful group of immortal superheroes. The film's strength lies in its ambitious storytelling and exploration of complex themes such as identity and purpose. The ensemble cast delivers solid performances, with standout moments from Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. However, the movie's weakness can be found in its pacing, which feels uneven at times, with certain scenes dragging and others rushing through important plot points. Additionally, while the film attempts to tackle deep philosophical questions, it occasionally falls into exposition-heavy dialogue that may not resonate with all viewers. The music composition adds an atmospheric touch, but it doesn't necessarily stand out as memorable. Cinematography-wise, there are breathtaking shots that capture the grandeur of the Eternals' world, but there are also moments where the visuals feel a bit lackluster. Overall, ""Eternals"" offers a fresh take on the superhero genre, but it may not fully satisfy everyone's expectations. It's worth a watch for Marvel fans looking for a deeper dive into the cosmic side of the universe.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Worst MCU Film Yet!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7756928/?ref_=tt_urv","benmundie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94551008/?ref_=tt_urv","14 January 2022","'Eternals' is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is arguably one of the most ambitious films of this franchise. Ambition doesn't automatically substitute for quality however. Trust me I love the MCU, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that there is a certain formula that these films often follow, normally it isn't completely obvious but this time round it is glaringly apparent that 'Eternals' has fallen into the modern day Marvel formula.The epitome of falling into a formula is taking an Oscar winning director like Chlo√© Zhao, who is one of the brightest and most talented young directors working today, and even someone of that calibre churns out a piece of boring drab. It doesn't all fall on Zhao however, the cast is, on the face of it, full of big hitters from Angelina Jolie ('Thena') to Richard Madden ('Ikaris') but even their acting is wooden. Madden looks bored for 90% of the picture and who can blame him when the script is so poor.As for that poor script, this is one of the weakest the MCU has bought to the table. There is absolutely zero character development for pretty much every character apart from possibly Sersi (played by Gemma Chan), Sprite (played by Lia McHugh) and at a push Phastos (played by Brian Tyree Henry). Now this is a film where there are at least ten characters in the titular team, that isn't a good thing. That is the heart of the issue though, ten characters, ten main characters, already that is way too many, especially when we haven't met any of them before. Zhao had the impossible task of introducing ten new heroes and trying to draw the audience into caring for them. If they had lowered the number, it would've been much easier and would've given the writers time to properly introduce everyone. When Marvel try to adapt a project that is pretty much unknown even to hardcore fans of the comics, they need to give them relatable quirks that helps the audience empathise with them so if anything happens to them during the movie, we actually care. Sadly that doesn't happen here and I couldn't care less about any of the main characters.The writing itself also left a lot to be desired. From very vaguely defined plot points which are yet another thing that the writers must've felt weren't important. As for the 'shock' twist reveal of the main villain, what a waste. They spend a decent amount of the screentime 'setting up' Kro (voiced by Bill Skarsgard) as the antagonist just to opt for another villain. They had the potential of casting this phenomenal actor as your main adversary, but they squandered it.One could only hope that this film at least has some semblance of a thematic prowess about it, but that will also leave you disappointed. I believe the key theme the writers were trying to discuss was family and how these otherworldly beings work within a family structure. On paper, it would seem they cover the concept, but once you begin to delve into it, you realise that the filmmakers only covered the bare minimum with no real substance behind any of the characters relationships. Another theme that this film attempts to wrestle with is the question, what does it mean to be human? They definitely discussed this, but they don't dive into it at all with any character. The main protagonist that could've been explained more was Lauren Ridloff's 'Makkari'. They had a really interesting dynamic with how she copes with being deaf and having to live in a new world, but obviously did not think it was a priority.As bad as I've made it sound, there are some positives, the key one being the effects. As always with modern day blockbusters, the CGI is fairly flawless, with a blend of visual effects and practically built sets meaning that the world that is crafted feels authentic. It helps in making the film feel grand and huge in scale.Overall, this is a real disappointment. From poor writing, to lack of character development, this is riddled with shoddy errors which all adds up to making this film the worst that the MCU has made.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Special effects were great as far as I'm concerned, it's entertainment and that is why we watch in the first place. Do not let ANYONE tell you not to watch this movie. See for yourself, it's new characters, not your run of the mill superhero movie. To get my wife to watch it and enjoy it was major.

And yes I wasn't really too excited for Shang Chi either for similar reasons, but that still managed to be a big hit with me and audiences so it is in the realm of possiblity for this to be good. It's the first MCU film that I didn't go to watch in theaters and that was probably the wise decision. Introducing all these characters while trying to tell a story had to be challenging in a 2.5 hour crunch, but because of that, each one of them was already bland on arrival, there is a lot of info thrown at you that you're forced to keep up with, and some moments really had me scratching my head with a few causing me to laugh out loud when that wasn't the intent. There are some really interesting ideas that are introduced as well, mainly with the villain, but there's never enough time devoted to that and the movie kind of brushes it off to the side which was really disappointing. I can appreciate how Chloe Zhao wanted to do this movie in a non traditional fashion, but to me there wasn't enough to stay invested. I really believe that if this had been a Disney+ mini series, it could've been a lot better with developing more connections with the characters, understanding more of the history, and having some epic Marvel action to top it off. It is what it is and I'm not sure if it's a film that I'd want to come back and rewatch anytime soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is coming from someone who doesn't believe in wasting money by walking out of the movies, even if it's terrible. I decided to watch it again purely for review purposes because I have nothing better to do with my life.My big issue is that there is soooo much going on but not enough time to deal with each issue. Marvel was trying *way* too hard to make it seem like they have all these deep, moral issues tackled. The lame, goofy humour didn't help its desperation to be taken seriously. The superheroes btw? Yeah, they're lame. They barely did anything except talk. A lot. Their outfits? Lame. Like the Power Rangers with the same suits but different colours. Speaking of, I'd rather the action scenes in that than this. Oh, and that little girl/teen with the same name as a soft drink was so annoying. I remember people actually cheered when she got knocked out with a rock, which was the only satisfying part of the movie. The whole 'not interfering in human conflicts' thing to explain their absence for Endgame was a cheap excuse. Um, hello, they do interfere and their technology has been around for years so they've been preventing conflicts. That is what I call interference. And according to some sources, Thanos is an eternal/deviant which means they very well should have been allowed to stop him and just...decided not to? How does that make sense?Maybe if there were fewer ideas in the plot that they could fully explore and less people to focus on with some sort of character development (remember that, Marvel?), it could have been saved...somewhat. Or Marvel should just stop making movies.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unlike most every Marvel flick which has been more like cotton candy - sweet, no substance - this nicely laid out, enjoyably long movie approaches a level of serious credibility at lest compared to the existing remainder of the MCU which, after all, is inspired by of all things, the vapidity of comic books.No details here, only one suggestion: take my 9 stars and knock off 2 for a bit of real world comparison to other enjoyable origin stories for humanity. Those extra 2 stars were to set this review apart from all the nasty Marvelites who felt ""out of touch"" ü§£.Quite the opposite reaction for me. Hey - don't get me wrong; I'll watch any Marvel franchise product just for fun. It's just that I was very happily surprised by this one's depth in combination with Marvel's excellent SFX and production values. Closest in emotional range perhaps to the first Wonder Woman's revelations without the manipulative soundtrack and goofy human/goddess attraction.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I rather it be slow and they explain their story rather than it feel rushed and make you confuse. The bad is that it was hard to give focus to so much MCU history and so many characters as each of them have their own purpose and role compacted into one movie without losing the entire plot of the movie. The deaf character Makkari didn't really get a story at all while others did which was a shame since this was a historical first for the MCU. I felt like this was a missed opportunity they glanced over. They briefly linked some characters to be the influences of myths and legends, but I don't think it came across as well as they intended especially for people who do not know the myths or the stories, scenes they referenced. The Darwin jab, Ikaris, Athena, etc. I had to explain to my family about some of that. Visuals were great and to be expected. The good part they got right was the diversity that it told as well as a story of a dysfunctional species of superbeings and their relationship to human kind and to themselves. It was relatively relatable because they each had their own strengths and weaknesses which made you understand each of their actions. It also shined a light on how some species change over time and how the ""good"" guys aren't always good and how the ""bad"" guys aren't always bad. Without giving away spoilers, I like the link of how the eternals connect with humanity over thousands of years to end up trying to prevent the humans demise and their own. How they looped their plot in with everything with Infinity Wars/Endgame made sense to me as to why these events caused them to ""come out"" of hiding.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The visuals are gorgeous, the fights scenes are good and well distributed, there is a clear message... I mean, it is a story we have seen and read before, true, but it isn't poorly executed or acted or written. So I'd give it an overall positive review. Far better than Thor: The Dark World or Iron Man 3 or Black Widow. Quite frankly my only 2 issues were: (1) the trailers have major spoilers.

A woman was appointed as the project leader. As the project went along she shared confidential information with another team member. This information gravely damaged the relations inside the group and brought it into complete dissaray. (the woman couldn't keep her mouth shut, right?). On top of that she let emotions (women and emotions, I get it) rule her and felt like abandoning the project completely. Another woman was appointed by the corporate to lead the team instead. The second woman succumbed to her emotions as well and utterly failed at her job, leading the project to a complete disaster, immesurable losses for the corporate and the loss of the most capable coleagues.So, we have two out of two women leaders who fail because they couldn't think strait.The bottom line is...

There's so much interesting potential with the story, but most of that is lost, if not thrown away, in favor of visuals and action. And even most of that either fell flat or didn't make sense.Conceptually, this could have been a game-changing installment in the MCU, and really build on and shift the mythos into something much deeper than we've seen thus far.This is also an impressive cast. Salma! Angelina! John Snow AND Rob Stark! Dude from Dunkirk! And the guy who plays Phastos, who I don't think I've seen before, was a standout. Strong set of talent going into it.Sadly, the story collapses under the weight of trying to juggle the characters of 10, yes TEN, heroes and 2 normal humans, one of whom we later find out is not actually normal at all, but yet another hero. Not to mention balancing all that while clearly prioritizing CGI-filled action sequences. More time is spent trying to introduce, explain, and explore all of the character's various powers than the characters themselves.Then there's the jumping around through time. Oh, we are shown prehistoric Mesopotamia, the Ishtar Gates and Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the aftermath of Hiroshima, even the fall of the Aztec Empire! But none of it serves any purpose other than something really cool to look at. Which is probably the sole redeeming quality of the film as a whole: The cinematography. This is definitely one of the best-shot MCU movies, with lots of stunning visuals and camerawork, right from the opening shots. Ironically, the CGI monsters and the celestials themselves actually look pretty terrible, like a video game. Maybe they should have prioritized those in their effects budget?And... about those Celestials. They've been built up for a while now. We've seen brief glimpses of them laying waste to worlds, and they've been spoken of in almost hushed tones, from the floating head of Knowhere to Ego in Guardians 2 revealing that he was one of them. It should have been a big moment to finally give them a full and proper reveal. I would have enjoyed continuing the tension-building around that throughout the movie. Maybe only speak of them and of Arishem in the past tense. Then, when he showed up it could have been a really dramatic demonstration of power. But, no. Arishem is there in speaking roles right from the beginning and they do some kind of VR facetime thing across space regularly throughout the film. By the time he shows up at the end, it lost all of its weight and impact.Everything the script tries to do to give any of them depth or personality feels trite, contrived, and shallow as a result. None of it ever amounts to anything meaningful, even when it tries to be impactful to the plot, nor could it be... because that would take time to develop those things and the film is already two and a half hours long. What they could have done is pruned. Maybe half as many characters. Maybe not try to flesh out the villain if they are only going to unceremoniously kill him off, especially if the characters themselves are questioning the purpose of their mission? I have no idea what this film was actually trying to do, because it was doing so very much.A horrible mess of jumbled, half-baked ideas. The first MCU installment I truly hated... reminding me of just how bad superhero movies used to be and can still be, if not careful. It's a shame I saw this right after Shang-Chi, which was one of the better MCU films so far in terms of characters, motivations, and emotional weight to it. I hope this is not a sign that the franchise is too big to keep up with consistency.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

On the other hand, Chlo√© Zhao's ""Eternals"" is too long. It seems like the whole movie tries to pad its running time, and it's sometimes hard to tell what's going on in the fight scenes. I usually say that these movies will please the nerds and geeks (basically, anyone to whom ""The Big Bang Theory"" pays homage), but I'm not sure about this one. Personally I wish that Hollywood could go back to making stuff in the vein of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".And yes, in reference to the scene where he says that DVDs are a thing of the past and streaming is the future, I should note that not every movie is streamable.

The characters felt distinct, plot relatively easy to follow, and it introduced new concepts without inducing a headache.Visuals were also stunning, and most humor felt natural to the dialogue and most landed with me, although they didn't make me laugh out loud, it made me smile and induced chuckles amongst my crowd.Biggest cons were pacing issues, mostly with repeated information and a bit too many flashback sequences that broke the flow at times. Another big con was that the two leads, sersi and ikaris, lacked chemistry. It didn't feel like they were in love for 5000 years, so the ending felt contrived and unnatural.Other than that though, I find this a solid addition to the mcu.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything was obviously done in front of a green screen. I am not entirely sure whether the actors were even wearing costumes as their heads just didn't seem to connect convincingly. I.e. Their heads seemed super-imposed on computer generated costumes.Where was the real story? You need time to create a background/foundation the story, not a couple of paragraphs at the beginning, that is just lazy. Like all Marvel films there was no real character development with endless patchy fight scenes and explosions leaving plenty opportunities to go to the toilet without missing anything important, exciting or relevant.When will Marvel realise that a good film has one maybe two protagonists, not 10+. The more you have the more 'diluted' the story becomes.Definitely one for the very young children who like to imagine it is them with super-powers.

There was a large ensemble cast so I never expected all of the characters to achieve the same amount of development but it was nice to see such an inclusive cast where gender, ethnicity and sexuality received representation without it being forced into the story.The time spent following the lives of the Eternals raises many philosophical and existential issues which shows the true colours of the protagonists. They are a family unit and it was interesting to watch the emotional weight behind their decision making. They all had their own views and motivations which made this more than just a good Vs evil movie.The movie features a lot of exposition which can take up too much screentime at moments. This, I think is where the movie suffers from a mixed pace. It's difficult to show alot of the information that is needed when this movie features a lot of cosmic lore. It tries its best to show visuals with exposition at least.The action and music was really exciting in this movie and it was fun to watch the Eternals use their powers in different ways. The conflict in the final act felt personal to each of them and so I was emotionally invested in how it would come to a conclusion.Overall, I think Eternals gave us an original story with the usual superhero tropes we've come to love making it new but familiar!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marvel is known for taking liberties of its source material but this one, takes basically everything from its source material and throws it in the trash. Instead of trying to make a movie that fans will love, a faithful adaptation of a piece of work by one of the greats, they set out to make the most diverse and boring piece of fan fiction. Of course it all boils down to the straight white male being the bad guy again, and the strong girl boss POC being the bestest ever. They took the most recognizable enteral and turned him into a short evil guy for no reason other than you can't have a straight white man be one of the strongest characters in the MCU. Putting that aside the storyline has more holes in it than deadpool after a shoot out. Their reasoning for not interfering in the snap was that it wasn't connected to the deviants, even though thanos is an eternal with the deviant virus in him, and by him snapping the planet he stopped the progression of the emergence. Also why didn't the enternals try to stop EGO when he wanted to destroy all life? That would've stopped the birth of future Celestials? It's a useless DC knock off that even mentions Batman and Superman in it. They took a colorful series and turned into another generic dark syfy movie. The colors in this should have resembled and paid love to Kirby's style. Much like Thor 3 did. The movie is a mess, flipp flopping time periods, tracking down characters no one knows, that coupled with horrid cgi and bad writing. I recommend skipping this, because it has no implications on the MCU what so ever, nothing in this is mentioned in anything else that's come after. Which is weird because hands and half a head of a celestial are sticking out the earth.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I mean really sucked. It sucked so bad, I was in tears at seeing one of my favorite created comic characters, not only miscasted but also lose their beautiful other worldly uniforms. Makkari lost not his gender but his awesome crimson helmet and visor and most importantly his role as wingman to Ikaris. The only satisfying cast was Ikaris and Sprite. Everyone else was horrible. Gilgamesh was supposed to be super powerful like Thor and Hercules level strength with more of a silent character. I'll stop here regarding the casting and wardrobe, but another thing I absolutely hated was the rock like look of the celestials. They were supposed to have been dressed as giant robotic alien high tech beings....so sad. The story was slow and written by what seemed like a bunch of idiots, just throwing out ideas, to see what would stick. The deviants were written as brainless monsters, when they were much more than that. They resembled the same monster aliens from the Tom Cruise movie live die repeat. Then the Gemma Chan emotionless diva gave no sexiness to the siren character Sersi, it was just a lame duck acting the same as when she played in the movie crazy rich asians. The same can be said of Jolie and Hayek. Too much movie time was given to Phastos' family...who cares! They could have also written out Kit Harrington's character as it basically went absolutely nowhere! This is honestly the worst and glad I waited to see it on Disney + instead of the theaters. Disney better start doing some better writing because they already destroyed Star Wars franchise and destroyed Hawkeye, Wandavision, and I can bet they are going destroy Moonknight and the vampire movie. A couple of marvel comic characters nobody really cares about.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The stakes gradually rise as the true plot builds itself and all is revealed so by the time the 3rd act comes and all cards are on the table, you feel it all. The ending itself is something Marvel hasn't quite pulled before and it was quite nice, definitely sets up a huge plot element for the possible sequel.I won't say much about the end credit scenes, but I will say that they mean a lot in terms of expansion in the MCU and introduce key characters.You can tell that Marvel is changing its formula and it panned out very well here.

Firstly, this does not feel like a Marvel film and honestly after the what feels like 50 or so films, this does not feel like a bad thing.Clearly the director was focusing on the more human element of the ironically non-human characters but for me this worked really well. The action was also well executed and stands up with the best of the super-hero movies.Few little gripes for me was that Angelina Jolie was massively underused, which is a shame as her character was arguably one of the most interesting. Secondly, the deviants didn't really make that much sense and didn't feel that threatening.However, overall I loved it; good comedy, great action and characters you actually care about.

Its good. It isn't great, but it's good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Once it was on Disney plus I was able to find some time to watch it. What I didn't know was, is that I would need over 2 and half hours of free time just to get let down. This film was all over the place at a snails pace. I remember pausing halfway through and thinking, damn, when is something going to actually happen. The main characters felt like they were in a daze or just didn't want to do it. Angelina was the only actor that felt like they were trying. This movie was a complete and total letdown, perhaps the worst in the entire MCU. I love the story of the eternals, just not this iteration.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought the tone and the character settings were almost perfect, these are the ppl that only had one agenda for thousands of yrs (or they thought), but each is unique and have their own characteristics and agendas, they don't belong and don't fit in, the inner struggles each faces for so freaking long are real. Movie and its build up suppose to be a slower paced, yet still has great action sequences and timely comedic reliefs. Nevertheless this is a drama, about OLDER superheros in the MCU, so it does have a mature feel to it, like a fine wine. Anyone wants raunchy, like a beer, wait for guardians 3.

Unlike Guardians of the Galaxy, though, it was not good.The movie has a lot of problems and it falls under the umbrella of those flicks where the more you think about it, the worse it gets, and if you don't think about it, it's middling at best, as elements and players introduced by the story and trying to squeeze them in an already expansive Universe lacks well thought out writing for proper cohesion and thus it comes off as lazy and stupid. Case in point: The Celestials, the true Godly Beings that have been shown a few times before in the MCU but this is the movie where you get a proper explanation about their existence and when the plot reveals details about the Prime Celestial Arishem's design, it's just dumb and saps whatever interest one might have had in that part of the story and worldbuilding.Since I have grown a bit apathetic towards this cinematic universe due to worldbuilding shenanigans that Phase 4 has shown so far, poor writing in that area alone wouldn't have been a big issue (would still be an issue) had the characters been interesting but that turned out to be the biggest problem of this movie which stems from its own nature of being i.e there are ten Eternals, ten main new characters that are introduced in a single movie, and none of them is properly developed. As I write this review, I don't even remember the names of many of them. On top of that, director Chloe Zao decided to have the cast give uninterested/boring and bland performances for so much of the runtime instead of being energetic and charismatic utilizing every bit of screen time they have to imbue personality to their roles. There was also lost potential of a plot point regarding Deviants, the movie just ends it in an anti-climatic fashion and throws it away.With all that being said, I did enjoy certain things. There were some beautiful visuals, particularly with the Celestials and their gargantuan scale, especially if you don't think about the physics of it all. Some of the fights were entertaining even with the iffy CGI, the speedster Eternal especially was portrayed how I'd wish other movies to showcase their speed type characters and you get a fun meta pseudo Superman vs Flash throwdown. Despite having thin characterization, some Eternals I did end up liking such as Druig, Gilgamesh or even Icarus, and hell I even got interested in that one Deviant since that seemed important relative to most characters in the movie. I also do applaud the director for not filling the movie to the brim with the typical Marvel brand of humour which has been getting too annoying recently and I wish strong writing was present to complement the more serious tone. Plus, the movie had both Jon Snow and Robb Stark fall in love with Sersi which I found amusing.Overall, this is in the bottom tier of MCU movies for me. I wouldn't say it's the worst one, that title belongs to Black Widow for now. I don't know how the events in Eternals will play out going forward in the MCU or whether it'll have any impact or would be forgotten. This probably would have fared far better if it was a Disney+ series instead as that would have given it time to develop its characters at the very least even if at the loss of spectacle. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're an MCU fan and completionist. Anyway, if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie was absolutely amazing! After watching the trailer for the first time I was super thrilled to go watch another add on to the MCU, however after seeing the ratings were not that good I turned a little skeptical, but oh boy I should have trusted my gut. This movie has absolutely everything starting from visuals, action, romance, representation and a pretty well built storyline. Eternals was definitely different than any MCU movie BUT in a good way. Seriously, just go watch it and see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was no buy-in to the characters or their convoluted relationships or motivations. It's nice to see Marvel try to add some diversity to the cast of heroes but it felt more like a list to check off than a desire to actually make fleshed-out characters that are more than just their aspect of diversity.The second half was better than the first, but there wasn't much to redeem this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A very long movie, but totally necessary to introduce the characters and tell their story, but, like every featuer film, Eternals has it's ups and downs.As much as many people have said that the film is very serious and that it loses the essence of Marvel, I disagree with that, but yes! The movie is more serious than others, but it still has good and well placed jokes like any other Marvel movie. One of the things I was most impressed with about this movie was the CGI, I've seen all the Marvel movies and none of them have I was so delighted with the special effects as in this one.However, in this film there are things that, at least for me, were not very good/very well explained, such as, a love relationship between two characters, I don't know if I interpreted it wrong, but I thought their relationship was too forced. Another thing that, at least for me, was not very well explained was about the Deviants and, specifically, which side they were on in the final battle (but I think I didn't understand it very well and not a scoop on the script).For me, Eternals isn't just any Marvel movie but perhaps one of the most important of the MCU phase 4, 'cause it presents a new group of superheroes very powerful. Now I just want a sequel to this movie and this wonderful cast.OBS.: The movie is amazing, the critics who are boring.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I left wanting more, and I'd love to see Zhao, and renowned directors like her continue creating superhero movies..

Stop until there's something actually worth making as opposed to what just seems to be a mandate to get more 'product' out the door. This movie is all flash and little substance. I feel it adds little or nothing to the MCU.I watched this movie with subtitles (because it was night time and I didn't want to disturb the rest of the house). When you read the dialogue it's really not well written (sorry script writers!). There's a lot of extraneous talk, and I don't know if anyone else noticed (or were too bothered tbh) the beatification of 'primitive' cultures with many scenes of costumed 'superheroes' appearing to be angelic while braiding little urchins hair or doling out magic crystals. Or something like that.It's just a poor movie from storyline perspective and I was very disappointed with the outcome here. It's an extremely saccharine messaged plot line with no real substance.One day Feige and his crew will (like the first Iron Man) put their non Avenger superhero stable into a good - reality based - detective story and get rid of fire monsters and supreme cosmic entities.

The negative reviews for this movie & others I've seen throughout the 13 year period of this MCU, are disheartening, to watch marvel entertainment is to appreciate it & at just 20 years young, I can't wait to see what the future holds!

The Story was crisp and I never really felt bored. Yes these stories deserve time and they need to be developed and I feel a series would be great.

The story has been told really well. Not rushed nor too slow, just right. There is simply a lot of material to go through with the introductions of the characters, which is a crucial piece of the experience, and Chlo√© did all the characters justice in my opinion. She could not not do it. Going into the film that was what would have been the biggest challenge to get my head around, but my mind can rest at ease now, because that was well done.The CGI is arguably the best I've seen so far. Really impressive. Technology has come a long way.Costume and set design were also great and so was the cinematography to bring it all to life. Marvel films always get this right though. So no surprise here.Show is really well cast. Talented group of actors and actresses, but Richard Madden stole the show for me.I went into this movie with low expectations, maybe the psychology of that lead me to enjoy it more, but I see myself as a patient man that loves being fed relevant information and this film had loads of that and a healthy dose of comic relief. I loved it, but understand not everyone is like me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had high expectations for this film and even though I had assumptions for it that were not met Chloe Zhao still managed to craft something that exceeded those expectations. Almost from the beginning the story is engrossing and very expansive to a level that even the Avengers films never attempted. The characters are well crafted and treated deferentially from the outset. I am sure everyone will have their own favorites but mine was definitely Angelina Jolie as Thena.If you leave all expectations at the door and just let the story before you unfold I believe this film is one that will definitely command rewatching again and again.

Heading in a different direction from what we have seen previously, Eternals brings the MCU into a new realm of story-telling that breaks away from the typical Marvel formula.A standout aspect of this film is truly its diversity with Chlo√© Zhao and the rest of the team behind this film truly pulling together a truly beautiful and diverse narrative which speaks to the heart moreso than it does the mind.After years of formulaic movies, Eternals takes the MCU in a new, more mature direction and it is refreshing to see. Chlo√© Zhao definitely succeeded in bringing a fresh perspective into the MCU diverging from a story that is driven purely by the action and thrill of it all, to give us a story that has heart and love behind every aspect.As expected, this film was a visual masterpiece, where everything that we see manages to work alongside the story being told. The acting was amazing with Gemma Chan truly standing out and capturing the heartfelt essence that is driven by this film. Also, just to mention Angelina, a growing favourite of mine, who truly took the helm in each and every one of her scenes, bringing to life this strong and powerful warrior.The story itself definitely meets what it set out to achieve, however, it is also the key downfall point of the movie. Though it carries a lot of weight, the aspect where the movie fails is where they tried to incorporate maybe a bit too much story without truly figuring out how to go about making it fit into one cohesive puzzle.Overall, it was still an incredible watch and I cannot wait to watch it again. I would definitely go about saying that it makes it into my personal top 10 favourite Marvel movies!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There's a lot to like in this new MCU film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7529854/?ref_=tt_urv","gcsman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66541531/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2021","With the exception of just two or three little lines of dialog that reference previous movies, Eternals is the closest thing to a new, truly stand-alone story that Marvel has done since Iron Man in 2008 -- a whole new cast of characters we haven't seen before, anywhere. That alone is refreshing! I see that director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland, The Rider) is getting slammed by numerous critics for (a) being too much of an auteur director to do superhero films, or (b) abandoning her auteur status to do superhero films, or worst of all (c) daring to introduce (shock! Horror!) a *gay relationship*, right there on screen! The trolls who are piling on with ridiculous 1/10 ratings are I suppose reacting to that third item most of all. She can't win. Just ignore all of this and go enjoy the actual movie. And there's a lot to enjoy. There are loads of action scenes, new characters to get acquainted with, some decent character development, and an expansion of the MCU universe in a new direction.I liked the settings and scenes quite a lot. Most of it happens (gasp) outdoors, away from labs or big cities (or sound stages with lots of green-screen CGI). Yes there are scenes in London particularly, but most of it happens in big-sky country settings like Australia, North Dakota, Alaska, the Canary Islands. It just feels more open and natural than so many other MCU movies. And this is reflected in the cinematography -- lots of long shots where the Eternals team is seen in the landscape rather than constant tight focus headshots. So in the big dust-up scenes between the Eternals and the Deviants (or among themselves) they don't even leave destroyed cities behind them, a nice change from the Avengers.This is also quite a visually strong movie. The signature superhero 'effect' for each Eternal is the way they call up filigrees of light in complex geometric pattern, especially Thena (Angelina Jolie). It's repetitive, but oddly I didn't get tired of seeing those because they are so effective and gracefully done. Their team costumes have handsome, attractive designs (better than their comic versions by far). The way Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) show off their powers is great: Ikaris' Superman-like fight in the air with the Deviants is the best we've seen done since Man of Steel (2013), and Makkari's super-speed is probably the best special effects work in the film. And, the end credits are just plain beautifully rendered.And about the acting: it's a big job to introduce a double fistful of entirely new characters all at once AND tell a good story. But it's been done before, with the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy. Gemma Chan (Sersi) and Richard Madden (Ikaris) turn out to be the two main leads and they are just fine -- they've both had previous practice runs at this type of production and I got the impression that they know what's expected of them. Angelina Jolie was potentially an equally major character but she seemed to be a little underused -- or else her character's particular plot line just wasn't the central one in this rather sprawling multi-pronged story. Salma Hayek (Ajak), Don Lee (Gilgamesh), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari), and Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos) are all fine too -- they totally fit. But I felt a bit disappointed by Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) who just didn't seem to jell -- Keoghan especially wasn't convincing at all; he seemed to be way out of place in this type of thing.Lastly, the way the Celestials were used -- the giant cosmic beings who are Behind It All -- surprised me. A sneaky message that I haven't seen anyone else mention is that we now know what the Celestials are really all about. The big cosmic mission of the Celestials is ....... to breed more Celestials! That's their imperative, just like the simplest biological organisms. The particular way they do that is the mainspring of the storyline and I won't give any more away.I was reading Marvel comics way back when, when the Eternals were introduced, but I didn't follow them. They were the creations of the legendary Jack Kirby but after his long runs on the Fantastic Four and other classic titles, I thought he finally lost it: Frankly, his drawing became too crude and blocky, and his 'dialog' was even worse. He came up with names for them that are just silly mashups of gods and heroes from mythology (Ikaris for Icarus; Thena for Athena; Makkari for Mercury; Phastos for Hephaestus; Sersi for Circe; Gilgamesh for --- Gilgamesh; and Druig for who-knows-what). This Eternals movie is better than those comics by far.","6 out of 32 found this helpful.

Because of this, the plot contradicts itself many times, as well as creating holes in it that are never answered or developed. The special effects and photography are perfect, all the fights and scenes involving big special effects are well done and look very real. The acting is decent and the humor it uses feels very childish at times.The main attraction of this film is the visuals, the special effects and the photography that play a major role in the story, but the plot and the development of this constantly contradict each other, making it incongruous, the inclusion in this film is very forced, since the diversity of actors that there is, does not cause any change in the plot, showing that the studios are not interested in telling a good story where this diversity is involved, but only use them to generate more profits than expected.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Each of the Eternals was well-drawn, their dialogue was witty and intelligent and the acting was very good across the board, with particular credit to Jolie, Chan and and the dependably entertaining Nanjiani and Keoghan. Even Madden, who sometimes comes across as a bit stiff, found some good range, especially in the final act.And I'm not sure how its detractors measure spectacle and special effects; I thought they were amazing myself, certainly no less impressive than any of the better MCU fare, and much better than most of Disney's recent Marvel and Star Wars fan-fodder.Those Celestials!If I had to nit-pick, it would only be that Ikarus and Sersi's relationship, while it served the narrative well, nonetheless developed at an unconvincing pace over the aeon they were together. Likewise, Sprite's involvement, which seemed a bit contrived.In the end, there was a lot more to love about the Eternals than there was to dislike and I really hope they make the sequel, if only to give Kit's story some legs.7.5/10 bumped up with a grin.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

When my mind drifted, as it did quite often during this picture, I found myself wishing Tsui Hark worked for Disney.I'm also a massive fan of Jack Kirby; I have been ever since I bought my first Marvel comic in 1964. His art was huge, the characters jumped off the page at you, when they clashed you could feel the ground shake. His imagination was boundless. The Fantastic Four films - all of them - failed because they couldn't translate his vision to the screen. The same applies with the Eternals. There was a unique opportunity here to turn a grand comic book series into an epic. The human characters Kirby embedded in the narrative would have been great fun to develop, and they would have anchored the narrative and made it more relatable.Writing wasn't Kirby's strong point, but a team of highly paid writers ought to have been able to take the exciting raw material, give it better structure, bring it a little more down to earth, and turn it into a film worth the ticket money. The best Marvel films have always been the films truest to the source material, but updated to the present day. This one misfired.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie feels different, yes, but is it a bad thing? It IS a superhero movie, with cool action and effects... but it also does something special by slowing the pace down a bit and focussing on the characters and their relationships. This is what I think the movie excels at, basically doing a beautiful job showcasing the humanity of each one of the characters. It is a movie about a family, something that the Avengers have been telling us they are for years, but unlike them, this group actually feels like they love each other; and so, when conflict arises between them, it feels complex and nuanced. Though the plot stakes are huge already, it's the emotional stakes that are given a chance to shine... and I was able to enjoy that a lot. The cast is large, and so it's unfortunate that a few characters didn't have a chance to be fully explored, but I wouldn't say it was a true downside. After all, the story is not about one character, but about them as a unit, and we do get to focus on those who drive the conflict.There are many aspects I loved about this film. For once, the humor was an other aspect I enjoyed, specially the character of Karun (who I believe stole the show). The way they play into that easy family banter was great, and I felt like all the characters had great chemistry in that aspect. What can I say other than, all the jokes landed and had the entire cinema laughing. Of course, I also grew to care for most of the characters as well... because dammit, most of them are just wholesome and lovable. The big dilema and existencial questions tackled were very interesting too. By the end, you can understand all sides, and I find that to be very cool (it's not just good vs evil, it's way more complex than that). Even the characters who are supposed to be seen as ""bad"", have motivations that make sense, and could be considered righteous.. It's great stuff.Overall, I am very disappointed to see all the hate directed towards this movie. Sadly, it was bound to happen that the most diverse movie marvel has ever put out would get the most backlash, but it's still hard to see. All I can do is wonder how anyone could look at a movie that celebrates humanity and think including as much humanity as posible is a downside.Maybe this movie will not be beloved by all, but I liked it and I'll shout it from the rooftops.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Chloe Zhao did a great job showcasing the backstories of each character and letting us know that they were actually evil and created by a celestial god. Each planet was created to achieve the largest amount of habitants and then destroyed just to give birth to a celestial being. From this instance we learn that Kurt Russell's character Ego from GOTG Vol 2 was a Celestial being. The externals were lead by supposed Olympians like Ajax (Salma Hayek), Ikuris (Richard Madden) as a villain, Thena (Angelina Jolie), and Sersi (Gemma Chan). Kit Harrington has a few scenes and he has a clips at the end of the movie that I don't want to spoil. Loved Kuwait Nanjiani as Kingo who was hilarious as well as Harry Styles who has some part in a future sequel. Overall it was fun to see how these characters played a large part in our history and help develop our civilization to what we become. It was great to see a new set of characters but I always ask where are the Avengers when you need them. They are mentioned in some parts of the movie, but at least have a cameo from some of them. I would definitely say to check this out if you like Marvel and fantasy type of flicks.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was simple and beautiful. It only worked out in the end because of Ikaris, if not for him and him staying true to Arishem's vision it would have been a lot more boring. I'd probably have rated it 3/10 then.As it is the movie suffers from a rather slow start and middle part until things heat up in the end. The cast is pretty decent otherwise, the visuals and sounds are stunning and I'm Team Ikaris the whole way.Remember that GOT quote, "" Bear Island Knows No King, But The King In The North Whose Name Is Stark.""That quote shall serve you well here and also remember Jon Snow is a Targaryen not a Stark... anyway enough GOT references here. I am eagerly awaiting Eternals 2, I hope the director is changed or the storyline is given a bit more substance next time but all in all a great film.P. S. I also feel as if the cast was not chosen necessarily on acting ability alone, but rather so that the director/producer could appeal to a wider audience of people(LGBTQ+ Communities Etc).Anyway 9/10 from me, I can't give it a 10/10 with that ending for poor Ikaris.#TeamIkaris.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

Everything a human says in this movie is more heroic than anything these 7000 year old heroes said the entire movie. It's also boring because of the lack of action with only a few fight scenes.

However the story is a bit messy the first act is too fast the seconds a bit slow but it all comes together for the third which i really enjoyed. Several times in this film I just thought wow that looks amazing. I've seen alot of critics saying this film has no heart or life, this film has a heart and it is very much alive in every way. All of the characters are really intresting and none feel under developed.This film is getting so much uneeded hate yes it has problems but it's not one star worthy. The critics have been so vague about why they hate it some just saying it's too woke. Any form of diversity in this film is natural and not forced.Overall, If you're a marvel fan and want to go to the cinema this is a must see.

So when the previews for this started airing I was super excited! But after watching it and almost falling asleep several times, it dawned on me I've never dozed off during an MCU movie In my life. My biggest complaint about one was that black panther had decent acting but it lacked the flow with connection to other MCU movies. Well, this externals movie lacked just about everything. Boring, lack luster acting, the plot lacked in adventure that's usually in the mcu movies, and there was definitely no flow of connection to other MCU characters or movies or shows even if it's supposed to show some form of ""beginning"". Sorry MCU not a fan of this one. I will say though, if you haven't seen Hawkeye on Disney +, watch it! Hawkeye is bad ass! But eternals you are eternally boring. Also it's not ""kid friendly"" for those 13-16. It's more for 17 and up! There's other MCU movies that are more kid friendly!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Theirs many characters you're meeting for the first time all at once unlike The avengers where they each had seperate stories or Guardians of Galaxy who had a much smaller backstory/team members.The movie spans so much time periods that they do an awesome job of keeping it linear and relevant to the story. Now i knew nothing about the Eternals other then I knew their related to Thanos + a few comics involving StarFox & Sersi appearing in them. Many claim they had a hard time understanding the story + whats going on and Either they didnt pay attention & was distracted or on their phones while watching or they just simply have low intelligence Lol.At no moment during this movie can you get confused or unable to follow along cause its clearly laid out for you. Now you must understand the lack of Action & scenes to explain deeper into their backstories should be very understandable based on the amount of time & amount of characters to go through.They compensated it through simply speech, in the dialogue exchanges between the characters and their reactions can tell alot of the story for you without having to witness the scene unfold live.If they make a Part 2 movie you can bet their will be more backstory covered in it just as Marvel always does in any movie. They just cant fill in all details that span such huge n convoluted histories of the Eternals into 2 n half hours.Now onto the next complaint I see about how the actors/actresses had bad performances some complainers said and how they seemed not into it.Either these complainers didnt watch the movie or they still lack the intelligence to process what the movie is about. Their not Humans LOL of course they not gonna be all human like in emotion n reaction.The way these actors/actresses acted honestly did alright to show the divide between humans and Eternals as well as show their slow acclimation in their journey living among and relating to them.Not to mention if you had made it till the end of the movie you would understand already why the Eternals actors/actresses seem so devoid of humanity emotions hence their acting portrayal. Luckily this is not a spoiler since synopsis already tells you their not human anyway.Now many of the complainers probably doesnt want to admit it but some im sure potentially could be nitpicking reasons to hate it extremely and theirs abunch of reasons possibly just pick one? A Muslim character, a gay character, an indian, a chinese girl, the director is the first female for a Marvel project, the director is chinese too, I mean so many potential reasons considering how low the ratings have been.Lets be real anyone to say they gave a 1,2,3 rating for this movie is either just lying to themselves or they have ulterior reasons to hate it cause let me tell you a movie thats 1-3 rating would definitely be a D-lister movie shot on a camcorder with first time actors along with cgi that looks like a 5 year old made it on a free trial app lol. I can list many movies that fit that category and i could even film u one in my backyard of a Squirrel hunting for nuts and u would be rating it a 1-3 out of 10 lol.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is just a non creative way to make it comfortable for us.I never thought I would say this for this movie, but the acting is so so bad. I never expected this from a marvel movie, feels like the actors don't even know how to act out the character. The only thing good about this was the visual and sound effects.They gave the most veteran character of the movie a handicap... WTH. TBH one of the reason I watched this movie was for Angelina Jolie, and she's like a broken weapon in this movie. What is she even doing in the marvel universe? Such a waste of character.So in all this mumbo jumbo, we find that these advanced beings (robots) are just another form of bunch of humans? These so called ""eternals"" are supposed to be the best, yet they're just so much like humans in terms of emotional drama.I was expecting them to behave differently... yet the more I saw them the more they looked and behaved like humans which makes the whole point of them being from different planet and being different species (even if they're robots) meaningless.The plot of the movie was such a mess and hard to follow, the whole thing TBH feels so weird.Something was seriously lacking.Anyway, you be the judge of this movie and decide.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Visuals were just absolutely stunning and the cinematography felt fresh; but most importantly, the character build-ups were excellent along with a decent plot. I was looking forward to see how Chlo√© Zhao would handle the introduction of so many new characters in a single movie and I must say, she did a brilliant job. The movie, in its core, had a grand scale but still managed to keep the characters so grounded and emotionally relatable. It had everything from emotional and moral conflicts, to breathtaking visuals, humor, pleasant surprises, and strong antagonists. Without giving too much away, let's just say that the antagonists in this movie had compelling reasons for what they were doing. They had a grey moral compass (something a little bit similar to what made people love the character of ""Thanos"") and this is what made the plot so strong and emotionally engaging.Let's wrap up by saying that it is one of those movies where the critic scores mean absolutely nothing! (I could go on and keep asking questions about the credibility of these ""so-called critics"" but frankly, I don't care and neither should you.)Go watch the movie (preferably in IMAX 3D) and make your own opinion out of it. This is a good, if not the best, movie in the MCU franchise. It is a MARVEL movie; but it's so much more than that. :)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Good....not necessarily","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7523559/?ref_=tt_urv","isaacmward-85348","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur127335070/?ref_=tt_urv","7 November 2021","Eternals (2021) is directed by Chloe Zhao and it stars Gemma Chen as Sersi, Richard Madden as Icarus, Angeline Jolie as Thena and Salma Hayek as Ajak among many other actors to create this stacked cast. Does this entry to the MCU deserve eternal praise? Let's find out.The PlotThe plot has many distinct differences from other MCU films. It involves questions of morality and the extent to which we will preserve life. As a result, the line between a hero and villain dynamically changes throughout the runtime. Certain events desire multiple perspectives from different points in time. Furthermore, this movie has the most title cards in any MCU movie. This turned me off from the film because I constantly got confused at different points in the plot due to a lack of order. Ultimately, the plot is convoluted and leaves much for us to desire. However, the characters are really intriguing in this film. Let's talk about the characters.The CharactersI thought that the Eternals team has some of the most interesting characters yet. However their powers aren't necessarily unique. For example, as shown by the 2nd trailer, Icarus has the powers of Superman due to his ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes. Another character has similar powers as Loki. Although a couple of characters don't have unique powers there are some exceptions. Sersi played by Gamma Chen is able to manipulate matter and this leads to some beautiful visuals in the film. Also, the relationships between all the characters are really fleshed out and I deeply cared about what might happen to them. Specifically the character dynamics between Thena and Gilgamesh and the interaction between Icarus and Sersi. Ajak serves an important role in the film. She effectively grounds the team and introduces us to the world. She also becomes a strong motivation for our characters. Although the Eternals aren't human they certainly have some qualities of humanity. As a result, the search for humanity is a highlight of the film. Now let's talk about the cinematography.The CinematographyThe Director of cinematography for this film, Ben Davis, effectively uses diverse long shots. Specifically, beautiful long shots of space, the desert, and their ship. I believe that this is the best cinematography to touch the MCU yet. It also captures the grandiose nature of this ambitious film. So if you love diverse shots and compositions, then you may really enjoy this film. Now let's talk about the villains.VillainsAs shown by the trailers, the Eternals battle the deviants which are apex predators that feed on people. However, since they are brainless predators, they don't have much character. Not only do they not have character, but the CGI diminishes their realism. As a result, they really are just a punching bag for our heroes. These monsters are actually a background for the real villain of this film. I felt like the villains plan was bland. The complexity of the world disconnected me from the central conflict between our heroes and the deviants. As a result, I was really just waiting till the end credit scene.ConclusionSo although the characters are unique, the villains are bland and need more development. If you really enjoy visual spectacle and world building, I'll recommend this film to you. However, if don't want to wait through the first two acts to get to some action, then this film is not for you. I personally enjoyed the visual spectacle and characters, but the story and villains weren't for me. I'm going to the give Marvel's Eternals a 5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With pretty good VFX being an advantage to the movie the film succeeds technically too. Where the film goes down is in the unnecessary comedy scenes and dialogues which may give the viewer a slight feeling of sleep coming to him and saying ""hey, buddy what bout taking a nap for a while?"". And its a problem which Marvel has for the past couple of years, adding comedy can be pretty good sometimes but Marvel movies usually never succeeds in doing that, because the jokes which they add are actually a waste of time. And also it destroys the superhero-vibe of the film. In this film it was the first half which had a lot of unnecessary jokes which ended becoming a factor for creating some snores. But the second half of the film was pretty enjoyable and thrilling. It was well directed and the cinematography also looked beautiful. Another drawback was in the writing, some characters were poorly written which made them just a piece of cringe.Overall, a watchable flick.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It wasn't here. Despite tie-ins to the MCU (we've heard talk of Celestials before), this film doesn't work. Hell, it's not even paced well -- something many older MCU movies excel at. It's far too long for the content, and soooo slow. What was the studio thinking?There ARE interesting moments, sure, and some elements are sufficiently different and/or interesting to have some potential. Alas, it's all wasted with unlikeable characters, an annoying plot, and a pervasive undertone that we, the audience, exist solely to funnel dollars to Marvel Studios and Disney.Apparently Marvel now thinks a few plot twists, some CGI, and an overly-soapy plot are sufficient to satisfy an audience. Seriously? Was nothing learned from the 22-movie Phase 3 story arc (which Joss Whedon had a major hand in)? Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a let-down, but Eternals never gets off the ground. What a waste.With the possible exceptions of Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Ma Dong-seok, I didn't feel that any of these actors were portraying exceptionally long-lived characters. The believability is just not there.I give this mess four stars, with a half-star bonus for Angelina Jolie, who played an interesting character with some gravitas, and another for the fun Bollywood meta-humor. That's five (5) stars total.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a child's action movie.I pray this isn't a sign of things to come for future marvel movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was completely cumbersome to watch with a plot that was all over the place, mingling scenes and times and characters. It felt as though the scriptwriters wanted to intertwine a bunch of ideas that they just brainstormed on the spot and this film is the product. Nothing is cohesive, this film was too ambitious with no depth to make it work.The biggest problem comes with the character. Their names are taken from Greek mythology without explaining the contexts or details. Supposedly the characters were to have inspired Greek mythology, itself, which is so degrading for the culture and saddening that impressionable young viewers may actually believe this. Instead of giving value to the culture that created some of the most amazing mythology, it doesn't do so in the slightest. The names are warped and spelled horribly, thus making any knowledgeable viewer cringe.What makes this worse is the fact that all other marvel movies try to tell the story of the culture (ie. Norse mythology in Thor) and do not use it as a mere method to gain more attention. Personally, this bothered me greatly as there are so many amazing pieces of work that cherish Greek mythology and utilize it wonderfully (such as Percy Jackson, targeted to similar demographics).In conclusion, this film is held up by its budget and effects, it would not stand on any other ground.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is a LOT to love about this movie; it looks amazing, balances a lot of characters well and is certainly the most epic film in terms of scale. It is not your typical MCU film but that's no bad thing. There a lot of weighty dialogue and some topics are quite earnest and philosophical, but I prefer that over the vacuous content of many other films. And, as origin stories go, at least this one tried to do something a little different, merging material from the comics, with some original ideas and content.There are flaws however. The action sequences aren't always as impactful as they could be and some of visual effects feel a little rushed. The scope of the story won't appeal to everyone and the ending may leave a lot of viewers scratching their heads.People have been drawing comparisons with Dune, saying that DV's film shows how to make sweeping large-scale with complex characters and gravitas. Dune is a technically superior film to the Eternals, but here's the thing; I appreciated the craft and diligence of Dune, but I enjoyed Eternals more. Dune is intellectual but quite cold, whereas Eternals has a lot more heart.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watching a lot of movies doesn't make you an expert. This movie was great, was it different from other Marvel movies? Absolutely, but in a good way! I loved it, and so did my kids. It was a great cast of characters, and I feel like it's purpose in the MCU isn't late, like others have claimed. One thing about Marvel is they always make sure everything ties in together, they did it for 10yrs leading up to Endgame, I'm pretty sure they'll do it again. Honestly, don't bother with reading the reviews that are below an 8 because I guarantee they were either written before it came out, or it's just people trolling because they have nothing else better to do with their time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I feel like what helped in this department was how you can tell they always tried to film on location instead of in a studio so they could easily get natural lighting instead of needing to use studio lighting.

This is easily one of the most original Marvel movies to date so far but I will say that despite that the story for this movie is lacking. This movie is very much a more character-driven story in comparison to the other Marvel movies that are action-driven and because of that I just never felt myself getting fully hooked. Not to say the characters are bad when in reality it's far from that but I was always waiting for the story to speed up. I feel like my biggest issue wasn't the story but the pacing and how unfortunately it affected the story. This entire movie felt like the first part of a two-part series where it was building up the characters before a big fight in the next movie so when the ending happened, I was surprised. The best way to explain the pacing of this movie is up until the ending the movie is slow but once the ending happens it goes at the right speed. I will say that the action scenes in this movie were really well done and felt like something we haven't seen yet in the MCU. Another big surprise for me was the special effects in this movie and just how they looked pretty well done throughout the entire movie. The characters in this movie definitely weren't the worst part of this movie since despite the story not fully giving them much all of the actors gave it they're all in this movie. My personal favourite actor in this movie was Lia McHugh, who plays Sprite, because despite being so young in this movie, she still was able to bring real emotions to her character both serious and comedic. I also really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff, who plays Makkari. The final thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, for this movie. I enjoyed that he didn't just keep it as one type of music style but also included other styles from different cultures. In the end, Eternals is a breath of fresh air for the MCU that still has some problems but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.","4 out of 28 found this helpful.

However Pretty Shiny People I do have three of my own issues with this production.Firstly, how similar are the powers of ""Ikaris"" to Superman...only thing missing is a cape.Which even gets referenced by a child in one scene.The second is how all the actors playing these mythical Gods use their own native accents from Scottish to Irish, English to American etc and its never accounted for.And finally the giant Elephant in the Room is their interstellar space craft thats shaped like a giant Tablet for reading Audiobooks on.Look I'm no NASA Space Engineer, but I do know a bit about aerodynamics and this huge rectangle has none.Ignore the critics who say it needs to be serialised for Disney Plus and given more room to breathe.Make up your own mind about this 2 hour 37 minute marathon event at your local Cinema.Whatever you do, don't leave before the house lights come on because there's a couple of Easter Eggs you won't want to miss.Here's hoping any possible sequel will answer all our questions and iron out some of the quirks and maybe give us spin off story lines with even more Superheroes and Villains.""Eternals"" has plenty of twists and turns and you won't know which side to root for at times.Music fans listen out for a wonderful soundtrack which includes: Pink Floyd & Foreigner plus a score from Raman Djawadi...only his second time in MCU after starting with their first film, ""Iron Man"".All of this amazing movie is crafted by Oscar winning Director Chloe Zhao.","2 out of 19 found this helpful.

The post credit scenes made me wish for more sequels. Graphics effects and CGIs were beautiful, fighting sequences were beautiful and introduced new elements. Performances though with few dialogues were great with perfect cinematographies. Highly recommended and can't wait to see how the story develops from the sequels.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

There was a some overly boring exposition, during which I was mostly zoning out, and the overall plot was silly and over the top, but a lot of it was in service of creating drama between the characters. And that's what I liked, the characters. I thought most the actors did a good job. Gemma Chan's character was in my opinion the weakest one, after Salma Hayek who I don't like at all as an actress but had a minor roll. Yeah there were giant beings called the celestials, which create and destroy galaxies/life and whatever, but the main conflict was between the Eternals themselves and their beliefs. Also I enjoyed some of the action, which is rare for me when there is so much cgi involved.Still, there are many things that took away from the experience. For example I was confused by Kit Harington and didn't understand why he was in the movie, but spoiler alert, the ending scene was a sequel bait, so I guess we may learn in a few years why this superfluous character was shoehorned in.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For an origin story it was one of the best. We can't expect origin stories to be extraordinary all the time.

Love the story, the characters, the ideas of it but hated the excecution. Some scenes looked like they were choppily edited together, it doesn't seem seamless if you know what I mean, it ruins the flow between scenes. Also the dialogue, ugh I know this is a superheroes movie so a cliche is pretty much expected. But dangg, some dialogue needed refinement and not too much on the nose. Especially in the opening scenes, gaahh, slowly nodded, slowly talking, slowly picking up things for the dramatic effects, like, who shots this movie?? A fan? A high schooler with a camera?Okay moving on to the things that I loved. The cast that stands out the most to me is Barry Keoghan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Don Lee and Bryan Tyree Henry. The weakest to me was Gemma Chen, the supposed protagonist. I love how they're all different characters with different point of views, when you watch other MCU movies, oftentimes they're all overlapped, everyone is almost always funny with each punchline. With Eternals, not everybody is funny which is very refreshing! Some are more serious than others, more cynical and more gloom. I also love the story of Thena and Gilgamesh, Angelina's role even though she's not the protagonist, she stole every scene she's in and that part with Gilgamesh breaks my heart a little bit. Kumail also shines in this, I love Kingo and his valet. The comedic relief is not over the top like some other MCU movies.I enjoy the characters, the storyline, the overall plot , the overall design set and but I think this movie could've been executed better. The editing, the flow of the scenes, the direction of some lines, the CGI in some parts is horrendous, this could easily be a 9/10 movie but alas, cant have all perfect MCU movie. Hope they made a sequel though as I love these characters.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's like Marvel were trying too hard to make the film work and tragically failed. This could and probably should have been split in to a few movies in order to flesh the story out. It feels as though the writers weren't allowed enough time to develop the characters, or the it back story and this is proven at the very end of the film's credits when 2 more are thrown in just because. I knew nothing about the Eternal's and I feel let down by whoever commissioned this.It was so great to see a deaf superhero, a gay black superhero, and an Indian superhero and the wonderful cultural heritage of the Indian people, albeit briefly.

The melodrama is awkward and get annoying. A lot of weird stares between characters and of course a comedic relief character who has basically no additional value in the story.Trying to do many themes at once often leads to not making good use of any of it. Adventure? Fine, got a nice set of locations there. Romance? One of the weird couples has involvement in the story. Is that enough? Action part.. a lot of strange battles with somewhat dysfunctional superheroes... stranger than Doctor Strange.To me it does not have any depth, and it is boring despite the fan service in couple scenes. One point above complete trash like Captain Marvel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They're not meant to have any really noticable amount of chemistry, given they are what they are.

An ending that even though CGI heavy was not overwhelming mess as other Superhero movies have been.My only gripe was the repetitive clashes between heroes and creatures but not overly annoyed.Anyway, a definite above average entry into the MCU and compared to how I felt about future phases of MCU after Endgame having seen this and a very enjoyable Shanh-Chi I am keenly looking forward with optimism.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw Eternals on opening night, and as much as the cinematic scenes and beautifully choreographed fight sequences caught my attention; sometimes it was monotonous. Long boring cinematic shots took most of the movie's screen time. Marvel incorporating mixed ethnicities for their characters, which was awesome to see and each character did what they were written too, but each character also felt stock. Very few of the eternals actually had some sort of change to their change and overall each of them felt round and clich√©. The storyline was what can be expected from a Marvel movie, it was nothing special. The plot was rough and choppy and every event that was supposed to progress the movie on felt blunt and forced, as if the director spent too much time filming the sunset and quickly wrote in moving plot points; it felt like a shopping list.As a Marvel fan, I'd say go and see it. I'm sure that it will captivate fans during the film, but it won't wow most of them.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Lacks elements that made other MCU films special","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7885107/?ref_=tt_urv","Mike_Devine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5631526/?ref_=tt_urv","21 February 2022","After the events of 'Avengers: Endgame,' it was hard to know which direction Marvel would take in its cinematic universe given the film was the culmination of more than 30 films released over the course of a decade. We got glimpses of some chapters, from 'Black Widow' to 'Shang Chi,' but 'Eternals' felt like the next big event in the MCU.Unfortunately, while the film is technically impressive, it lacks the character and personality of many of those that preceded it. Sure, there's ample starpower, from A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to fresh faces like Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but in bringing everyone together the chemistry was not even close to being on par with the Avengers crew - nevermind those from 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' There was also the lack of a real intimidating villain, and the ""twist"" was seen from a mile away. Add all of this up and you get a pretty wooden, linear superhero film that doesn't light a fire the way others did. Oh, and the runtime...seriously?There's no denying Chloe Zhao is a talented director, but her decision to helm 'Eternals' may not have been the highlight of her career.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So it was indeed a pleasant surprise to find I enjoyed this.The for me bland characters from the 'comics' have been fleshed out and become much more interesting. And given the number of characters involved, I was expecting many to be sidelined, but each one had enough time for you to get to know/understand them. Then add a good storyline, the usual massively impressive settings that Marvel do so well, heart, a little humour and obviously action, all in all I came away thinking, ok not the best MCU film, but certainly not the worst, and definitely worth a watch. Actually two watches.I'll be very happy to see them again, mixing in with established characters - the interraction should be fun - carry on Mr Feige, you're continuing to oversee something special, even with much lesser known characters. Credit to all involved, super craftsmanship as expected, and a fine cast, certainly not wasted.....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It leaves the audience with a little more thought than just wow did you see all that action, which there is still a good amount of action in it. Please if you have a free afternoon or weekend that you made no plans give it a shot with an open mind.

Remove Action and Adventure as a genre, and I'd give this a solid 7.The movie is indeed very slow, with a lot of dialogue, and a lot of D&M moments. Whilst the cast don't really gel with each other that much, I don't feel they need to, considering their back story and that it's not really what this movie is about.I recommend this movie for the story lines are not as bad as some may make them out to be. The acting is on point with the each character and the roles they play.You'll be disappointed though if you're going in for some top action sequences and a feeling of adventure - this makes up maybe 10% of the movie, which is not much when the whole thing is 2.5hrs long.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"10","/10","An artistic variation of the ""MCU formula""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7752731/?ref_=tt_urv","bechbo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18081751/?ref_=tt_urv","13 January 2022","Let's be honest. The MCU formula of comedy action superhero movies works but it is getting old and a bit boring. Like in the comic industry, not every movie should have the same artwork, but Marvel should try to differentiate its ""movie artstyle"" a it has done so with the ""comic art styles"" in the last decades.The current ""MCU house style"" is very successful, but when you are at the height of your success, you should thry to evolve into something new and fresh again. This happens when a revolutionary new artistic team (writer & artists) take over a comic magazine. Like Frank Miller with Daredevil or Batman in the 1980s.So here is Chlo√© Zhao with her take on the Marvel MCU and yes, she tries a new approach with a more ""honest"" approach to portraying characters. She takes the gods/eternals serious and not as a comedy tool.And also her art style is different with these fine golden lines of energy and views of cinematic landscape and non-western people.I congratulate her for her courage and Kevin Feige for allowing this project to stay away from the MCU formula most of the times.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I truly dislike. They are weak writing and make lazy nonsensical choices for the characters to manipulate the plot. I would rate those higher than this. This was just disappointing. It felt like five plus hours of characters and plot that I just couldn't care about. It's amazing that in a movie that long, they couldn't develop characters enough for the audience to form some kind of connection with them.Also, I know they were bragging about how they shot the fight scenes differently with far less special effects than other movies, but it didn't work. I watched this at home, not in theaters, and no matter how high I turned up the brightness, the bulk of the fight scenes were basically hazy darkness. Shooting fight scenes in the dark to obscure mistakes is nothing new. In fact, it was nice to see that going by the wayside.Overall, I have to say that this truly is my least favorite Marvel film by far. And, it's not because there are obvious plot manipulations or character's personalities are assassinated. They didn't leave a gaping plot hole in the ending for the audience to fill in that is just infuriating. It's not that kind of bad. It's just because, in the end, I don't care about this film. At all. It made zero impression on me, and when I think of Marvel and their film catalogue, this won't even occur to me as having been part of it. It's completely forgettable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a pretty depressing idea to base a superhero film on, and one I wish was never made. It had some positive aspects such as an incredibly diverse cast full of talent, that was mostly on display in this film; and the visual effects were superb however, both should be expected these days. The story was straightforward and all plot twists that occurred were predictable from the first 10 minutes into the film. The relationships between the characters at times made no sense, there was no development onscreen, resulting in relationships feeling forced and without chemistry. There was no believable moment that the Eternals could fail any task faced, so the lack of any stakes helped to ensure that this film was a bore fest!

Because it is ridiculous... Or at least find some far-fetched explanation for it, or even maybe an approach like the Viking series (when 2 people are speaking the same language they just put it in English, but when foreigners talk among each other you hear their original tongue).Anyway, let's get into the movie, I know the multiverse brings a bunch of new possibilities but how many higher entities are we suppose to be on the lookout these days, and which one have the higher power? First Kan in Loki, then the Watcher in What If, the multiverse and now Celestials and Eternals...? I mean I know it's fantasy and that their doing a good job in some of the projects that bring together these heroes, but isn't there a limit..?The movie is way too long for the story it tells, it's as any other Marvel movie, predictable and even though it feels too long it is not built in a way where you feel attachment for the characters.All of them are highly uncharismatic, they are suppose to be wise millennial beings but they behave as humans with the age of their respective actors, the fact that they have all these thousands of years of life doesn't seem any different of an adult in its 30s or 40s...
Sure as you would expect you have some fun action sequences and stunning visuals, I mean I won't give a lower score mostly for that, and for that subconscious curiosity that Marvel puts us in with their foreshadowing and post-credit scenes.You won't miss a thing if you don't watch it, for now at least it stands on its own and feel very irrelevant in all honesty.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is intelligent discourse, character development and sone excellent historical scenery. Yeah there are some lapses in research with regard to the final point, but the recreation of Babylon's Ishtar Gate and Gupta Empire shikharas and quite spectacular. The plot twists are usually unexpected and serve to aid an engaging storyline.The plot is pretty close to a lot of the original comics and involves a substantial amount of conversation rather than pure mindless action. If you are familiar with the comics, there are a lot ""Ah-hah!"" events presumably laying groundwork for the next series of MCU films. The work as a whole very much has the feel of something which was originally created by the late Jack Kirby.I suspect the negative reviews come largely from those viewers who prefer explosions to dialogue or aren't comic book readers.In the end I really enjoyed this film exactly because it DIDN'T feel like just another Avengers or Spider-man flick. If you prefer your movies to be a little more developed than ""Die Hard XXVII,"" or something then you might just enjoy this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it also falls flat at best. Giving it a 4 was being generous as some of the characters are likable up until they are not.They have a lot of talent in the cast but there are so many plot holes that the move just doesn't make any sense. The over all premises of the movie is weakened by the fact this does take place in the MCU but it's never been mentioned before and there are planets far older than Earth that... well I don't want to give anything away but it doesn't match up with the plot.Angelina Jolie's character is just totally lost in the story. It's like they gave her a role then never followed through with it or totally forgot what the stated role was at the start of the film. They just gloss over it in the end and never provide any real follow up to the actually claims made at the start of the film.The film was slow at times and had to do a lot of explaining. Jumping forward and backward in time can greatly benefit some films but in this case it did more to damage the film than help the story along. Many of the jumps came at odd times and seemed to take you to points in time that didn't really further the plot in any meaningful way.And I don't think I am giving anything away here, in that the all the MCU movies have tid bits to where the next story will go but this one left me feeling it was not hopeful it would get any better. In fact the closing scenes fell flatter than the movie and I felt they should cancel the sequels now before they really stick there foot in it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's a lot of world building going on, much more so than in other MCU movies, and on par with the likes of Loki. The visuals are very, very bare. Most of the movie takes place in deserts and volcanic islands, with no background actors in sight. The superhero visuals are also minimalistic, take the Flash from DC and his different representations in cinematography, you'll find the speedster here blends into the surroundings a lot more, which is a very interesting take on a speedster, arguably more believable. The shortfall of Eternals was the treatment of Deviants, they were never more important to the plot than the buzzing of flies in your ear.The main conflict, as with many of the phase 4 media, lies between morally ambiguous choices, and the protagonist has to pay a price for either of those choices, only the future can tell if it was worth it. There are only a few connections to current or previous MCU releases, so you might want to start with this, if you want to enter the MCU.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But yesterday I had the opportunity to go, and I did. Luckily, I tried to keep an open mind and I left the cinema completely amazed and excited. The plot itself was, at least for me, mind-blowing. With the story about Celestrials and eternals. (I have never read the comic books, so I really had no idea what to expect). When it comes to cinematography it was eye candy, with beautiful colours and shots.This movie gave me a different vibe than the other Marvel movies. It was more serious, and the shots were slower than they usually are. But that is not a bad thing! Marvel studios is evolving and trying new things and I am glad that they are. We are already in phase 4 it is about time to mix it up a little.I am happy that I gave this movie a chance, despite all negative reviews. And you should too!

Actors looked promising and I am a fan of the marvel movies so this seemed like a no brainer. It was long and it was tedious. The premise is how the eternals save earth and the human race from their own race/planet? Not sure what to call them as people apparently doesn't fit. They spend something like 7000 years doing it and go through many decades that we get to see bits and pieces of as time marches on. So yes we do lots of time jumps. The group ends up scattered across the earth and are eventually called back together to destroy it but have now made connections and seen humanity and want to give it a chance even as others in the group want to destroy it and return home- which doesn't really exist. Now they start fighting each other. It's quite a convoluted movie. The optics are great and special effects are pretty cool but the story sucks and some of the acting was less than stellar. ( Jolie's storyline was just ridiculous). Hayak was wasted on this as well as Harrington. I had such hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed.

The action sequences are underwhelming, the storyline doesn't make sense, on it's own, and relative to the other marvel movies. It's really annoying because it seems Disney is more interested in pumping out blockbusters with unfinished plots that don't tie into the corresponding universe. They make crap like the intermediary star wars movies that are not really part of the new trilogy.This new movie doesn't make sense because Eternals were supposedly always around, and wanted to protect humanity, but when Thanos wants to destroy half of humanity, they don't get involved. Apparently, because they're only allowed to fight deviants...which he is too actually. By the way, neither does Arishem. If the birth of the celestials in the universe was so important to him, wouldn't a madman going around the universe trying to destroy half of all life everywhere be a considered a threat and worthy of destroying? Apparently, no, because Thanos was an eternal-deviant, but worthy only of human defenders.Also, can we talk about the acting.... Seriously, no one on this planet asked for a Indian Eternal, and trying to pass off Kumail Nanjiani as hot or funny (he is supposed to be the comic relief after all) is ridiculous. Angelie Jolie's character Thena is silent but disturbed, fights well, but somehow forms a close bond, which an overweight asian eternal (Gilgamesh) who is supposed to be the ""strong"" one, because nothing says strong like a guy who's had one too many pizzas.Disney has also been pushing the gay agenda down everyone's throats lately. I have nothing against the LGBTQ community, but was it REALLY necessary to have that male-male kiss and convince the world that a child can be raised happily by two men? Like in Avengers Endgame in the support group, there was a gay guy describing his date.The whole movie felt more ""slow"", ""cerebral"" (which I appreciated because it kinda celebrates humanity, but ultimately, it's like ""ok, where's the real danger?""), and disconnected with the past franchizes.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a lazy Saturday afternoon movie, where if it's on you'll keep it on, but as soon as they start to add commercials you're channel flipping for something better, and in the odd event you don't find anything better, you keep it on that channel and watch this movie. You can finally get your chores done while it plays in the background, because honestly you won't miss much anyway.You realize the story is very bland, the characters even blander, and the big named actors get hardly any screen time or any lines, seriously, count the number of lines each ""high-end"" actor was given.Trust me when I say, you won't miss much by skipping this movie, you won't miss much by skipping the next movie that happens to be tied to this movie, and possibly the other movies after that.As a normal, non-comic book type person, I loved the Marvel movies from Iron Man, to Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, The Avengers, Spiderman, etc. This movie was none of those, it didn't grab me at any point making me want to know what was coming next. It had some funny lines here and there, but overall I could've wasted the 2 and a half hours spent watching it, on literally anything else.If you want to watch the movie because of the well known actors, do yourself a favor, pick any show, movie, etc. That any of them have been in, and watch that instead.

So when they finally get some brocolli in their company restricted diet plan they spit it out in disgust. How dare it have nutrients! What is all this... vitamins? Iron? Who needs that. Not my body. Doesn't matter if you put it in a well made dish with a lavish, creamy sauce and a multitude of other ingredients to enhance the flavour, the reaction is the same ""ugh brocolli. Worst food ever!""Eternals has almost everything the MCU has been lacking. I can't really blame MCU stans who have been living in a cave staring at shadows. Yeah, I'm mixing my metaphors, got with it. Those shadows are entertaining. Even in reality they can recognise similarities to the shadows - good guys, bad guys, superpowers, lives at stake, conflict, build up to a big fight - but the newer details, the depth and complexity to reality has them staggered and distracted. Maybe if they spent more time outside their cave they might learn to appreciate the brocolli.Personally I loved the refreshing elements here. There is no real good guy or bad guy. Even the characters I wanted to hate, I couldn't because they had totally fleshed out, believable reasons for acting the way they did, and I don't just mean I understood them, I empathised with them. The good guys have done some terrible things. The bad guys have done some great things. There just different life forms doing what they want or have been told to do. That adds so much more complexity to the ideas and decisions that the characters find themselves embroiled in.Add to that the fact that Eternals has a fantastically diverse cast: ethnic minorities, disabled, LGBTQ are clearly represented and the film does fight scenes better than most other modern movies to date purely because you can follow the CGI heavy action clearly.Thoroughly enjoyable and rewatchable for it's complex themes.

I personally think that the film was amazing it wasn't the best marvel movie it can't because it's an introduction to new heroes to new characters that we as a fan base don't know unless you've read the comics and it's obviously hard to care about characters we are not familiar with. None of that matters though when you put into fact that this is a historical moment in film we've never gotten so much diversity on the big screen and instead of criticizing the film and finding everything wrong with it we should celebrate it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Come on Marvel, this is a golden opportunity to youngsters to shine, yet you hire almost retired actress to do the job. The problem is, they are investing in this movie and more parts are coming up.The movie lacks depth in story. Villains are monsters!!!! Any normal movie can have monsters as villains. Weak story. Movie is not emotional; you dont feel attached to it. More or less, the movie is just flexing super powers.Yeah, another sad attempt in making a copy of superman (after captain Marvel)!!!!! Yeah Ikarus. Very stupidly done. Moreover, we have a marvel Version of the flash. Yet this is the only character that i loved in the movie.I am a huge Marvel fan, but this movie was a let down.

It has a very different feel to it but it's honestly VERY refreshing. Recently Marvel has found a system that works for them and has been making a lot of their movies fit that mold to sell well (and it does). This is not one of those movies.I agree with some of the comments saying some little storylines here and there kind of got dropped throughout the movie and some of the actors could've been utilized more.Also, some people are insinuating that this storyline of the Eternals was just randomly made up solely for this movie which is not true. The comics introduced them in '76.Overall, the movie has a much more serious feel but has some comic relief as well. The graphics and cinematography are beautiful. And it's a storyline that most people don't know about yet! Check it out for yourself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, there have been many good Marvel movies (No Way Home being one of them), and Eternals feels different.For some the pacing could be appalling and slow, since there are many scenes where the main characters just talk, but there's a lot of character development in order to understand who these cosmic beings are.Eternals as far as I know are not as known as Spider-Man or Iron Man, and I was surprised Marvel Studios decided to make a movie about them, but I'm happy they did.Chlo√© Zhao's hand was very noticeable and I really liked the film, despite some flaws (some bad CGI, for example or why they weren't present in previous films). And I felt invested in the characters and the story.All in all, I prefer this kind of film than the tired tropes the MCU created and continued to use over the past decade or so.Recommended.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Amateurish exposition might be the worst offender, and wooden performances and useless distractions form plot-including an otherwise good antagonist and frustratingly unsatisfying fights-don't help in the slightest. Jarring special effects failures during these ruined otherwise fantastic visuals, too.A lot of it is just people standing around and not knowing what to do, but instead projecting their internal struggles it's just boring. Many of the 156 total minutes were spent on just that. At least the title is accurate.My goodness, how I would love this movie if the characters acted like they actually lived for thousands of years, growing and making decisions, suffering the consequences. Developing, you know, character. How I would enjoy a flashback scene to the ancient past, metaphorical of the struggle with Mahd Wy'ry. I would melt if the aforementioned antagonist was made to tap into a Celestial, or really used for... anything.There is so much potential within.Instead we get bumbling, confused dimwits, all in love with or hating each other and you're told to care without showing or even telling why, endowed with powers they clearly never even learned to use, demonstrating Brownian behavior.And a stupefyingly boring movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I finally got to watch it and can say it actually was a very good movie. It's not your typical Marvel movie, which I found refreshing. First off, it's visually stunning. I read that the director used visually pleasant filming locations rather than rely on green screen production and I can say that was a great idea. Besides having great cinematography, the actors all had great chemistry. The movie was heartwarming, had just enough action and a few comedic moments that were placed well. The story itself was very easy to follow and gave us just enough background to know who these characters were and why they are important. Yes, I admit it was a long movie, but there is not much you could cut out without ruining the story. I honestly feel bad for Zhao, the director, because she did an amazing job. Hardcore Marvel movie fans are giving this movie bad reviews because I guess they are used to the terrible drivel we get nowadays with all these superhero movies. This movie had a great storyline and was very heartwarming, something a lot of Marvel movies are not good at. This movie is different which is great. A breath of fresh air and I applaud the director's vision. I would like to see more Marvel, and even DC, movies made like this. Such a bummer this movie and the director got so much flack. It was such a well made movie and is now in my top 5 favorite Marvel movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The little humour in the movie fell flat and felt forced.The character's powers were underwhelming, Leaving us with less Eternals, and more a b-list of superheroes.The acting was okay, but slow and methodical. The movie felt more like some indi-emo flick than something from the MCU. There was no zip, no real substance we expect from a Marvel film.This is probably the worst Marvel film ever, and I am counting Howard the Duck in that list.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That incohesiveness isn't shown the most from the film's writing and characters -that second one being, most likely, the films strongest aspect, without being the best it could've been-, but from a technical standpoint itself. Zhao has a style where, it's cinematography is her top priority, even treating it sometimes like another character, a great example of this is her Oscar-winning film; Nomadland in contrast to this feels like a huge letdown.The film's writing style doesn't allow it's own characters to reach its full potential. That has got to be the most annoying factor of this whole mess. Some plot changes and other rearrangements could've helped but, I guess Marvel has to hold on to that ""this is the most different Marvel has ever felt"" marketing strategy. That's a whole other thing, this still very much feels like another Marvel movie, but this time around, that intentional differentiator is nothing but the facade of a very strategized intention, one that leaves you dissatisfied at the studio once you leave the theater because, at that moment, you realized what Eternals could've become if studios didn't ""interfere"" (yes, pun intended).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations and continues the trend of post-Endgame MCU films that struggle to capture the same magic.The primary issue with ""Eternals"" is its storyline and character development. The narrative is dense and sprawling, attempting to cover thousands of years of history, but it often feels disjointed and unfocused. The pacing is uneven, and the plot struggles to maintain a coherent thread that keeps the audience engaged. This is a stark contrast to the tightly woven and compelling storylines that defined earlier phases of the MCU.The world-building in ""Eternals"" is ambitious but ultimately flawed. The film introduces a host of new characters and concepts, but it does so without the depth and clarity needed to make them resonate. The Eternals themselves, despite being portrayed by a talented cast, fail to leave a lasting impression. Their motivations and relationships are underdeveloped, making it difficult for the audience to form a meaningful connection with them.One of the most significant challenges ""Eternals"" faces is its integration into the broader MCU. The film's premise and its place within the MCU timeline feel forced and out of sync with the established narrative. It raises more questions than it answers about how these powerful beings fit into the larger story arc, especially given their supposed long-standing presence on Earth.Given the complexity of the story and the number of new characters introduced, ""Eternals"" might have benefited from being developed as a short series or as part of a larger cinematic event. This would have provided more time to explore the characters' backgrounds, their relationships, and their roles in the MCU, allowing for a more nuanced and engaging narrative.In summary, ""Eternals"" is a visually stunning but ultimately disappointing entry in the MCU. Its ambitious scope and star-studded cast are let down by a convoluted storyline, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of coherence with the broader Marvel universe. It serves as a reminder that even the most promising projects can falter without strong storytelling and character development.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Additionally,i believe that the character development in this movie was good enough and if you take into account the level of dificulty the director had to face , i think that she passed the test. Furthermore, before seeing the movie i had a felling that some actors and actresses, like Angelina Jolie, would make to me a bad impression, however i was tottaly wrong the actors took their job very serious and they perform like professionals. One thing in the movie that i didn't like was the continious exposion, some dialogues that repeted themselves and the transitions through time and between places which were multiple and were tiring to the viewer.

I mean, they had me in the first half but I still was waiting for it to get better. Instead, the next hour and a half let me down a dark path with characters we really couldn't care about, their backstories non-existent or simply pointless because they've just been alive to unbelievably long.Sure the CGI was incredible, the creature design was unique, the visuals just wow, but the pacing-- switching back and forth from different eras destroyed any hope of a purpose.Weird decisions were made like unessesary inclusions of controversial scenes, failed jokes, and confusing casting... It just felt, uncomfortable.And why the heck did Harry Styles show up?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Hey this is a super hero movie so it has to be full of action, driving, catchy scenes right? Sadly no. It's boring and lots of flashbacks.. Maningless discussions and conversations. Boring acting and really boring super hero movie!It's actually so boring that I had to turn it off twice and come back later to finish the movie just because I don't like to quite things and I had hope that maybe it would start picking up but it never did.Usually I love Marvel's approach to making super hero movies but this time they failed big time. I can see why critics loved this movie.

They can not logically hold their own universe together any more.

The characters are flat, their motivation is not made clear. The only reason why they are doing what they are doing is because a red iron golem told them to. The conflicts between the eternals are boring because the characters are, the great threat never seems threatening. The visuals how ever a great, I like the camera work and the CGI is good, not as bad as it has been in other marvel movies.All in all, this movie is just senseless and boring and I as a viewer do not care about what is happening.And this indian with the camera...

If the Eternals aren't permitted to interfere with human development, what exactly was their job for thousands of years? They don't DO anything except fight the Deviants (whose origin and purpose is as unclear as everything else). With a timeline of millennia, the writers could have gone deep, gothic or prophetic and linked the Eternals with characters or events from Egyptian, Greek or biblical mythology. If the 'emergence' is directly related to global population numbers, they could have made Thanos' 'snap' THE event that interrupted this process and forced the Eternals into action. Instead of any of this, we are presented with a group of weak, unknown characters who just seem to be aimlessly floating alongside humanity (and the MCU) with no clear, grounded purpose. Add to this lots of dialogue, clunky exposition with only a couple of jokes that land and Eternals is a flat, static wasted opportunity. I could write something more interesting than this using only a set of Tarot cards for inspiration.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That said, it was one of the worst MCU films I've seen to date, and I've seen them all. There's been a couple of duds but perhaps none as boring, poorly conceived and executed... at least during the first half of the film. Like a soccer match this film was a tale of two half's, totally different in impact and quality. For a good stretch the main characters came off as weak for so-called ""Eternal"" beings and seemed to have little meaningful purpose, lacking even a modicum of the wisdom that should come from existing as long as they had on earth. The film becomes mildly interesting about halfway thru, then the action sets in and improves a great deal thru the end. I'm not quite sure if it wasn't because the bar already established was so low to make it seem so.I knew this was in trouble early in the film. Too much emphasis on the wrong things. Not a bit of story had been told nor a single character developed before we were already watching eye-rolling styled action shots of Angelina Jolie doing hammy poster poses for the camera. I was most disappointed in her casting here. She was/is a distraction in this type of ensemble cast film. Further, like her or not she can't act unless she's portraying the character she's worked hardest at being her entire career... ""Angelina Jolie"". If she MUST be included in the MCU they'd have done better to cast her in a cameo or as a one-dimensional villain.But for me Jolie was just one of many poor choices and is certainly not all to blame. There's an eery sense of speciousness to this film regarding its intent. Even the cinematography was poor as nearly the entire film was too dark and difficult to watch. As mentioned the best part of the entire film was about halfway thru with the speedster beating the bejesus out of the alpha character who had betrayed them. Finally something somewhat meaningful was happening in the scenes to follow. The plot and characters began to show purpose. If you managed to stay awake this long you were home free. There are still a ton of questions worth asking, tho one knows in the MCU they often get answered with future installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job next time out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Eternals is much like that. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and that's all. The plot is overly convoluted and poorly written. There are lot of unnecessary and badly delineated time-jumps. Absolutely no character development or arcs. Something important is happening to Thena, but since we don't now a single thing about her, it's hard to determine if she's just Like That or if it's a plot point. And guess what? It's neither! There's too much exposition about the wrong things, no exposition about wtf is actually going on. The characters are nothing more than avatars- the only personality trait available leans a little too far on the Sassy Sidekick trope to really count.I cannot comprehend how so many talented actors turned out performances that were wooden, stilted, and dull. I don't know why Chloe Xhou chose this iteration rather than using Gaiman and Romita Jr's much more exciting (and narratively sound) updated version. It makes no sense to hire the amazing Ramin Djawadi to score the film and then mix the music down so low that you can't hear it. Dane needed more scenes to establish any kind of connection with the audience so we give a crap about what he's doing at the end of the film. Actually, that's true for almost everyone in this flick.

It does lack in so many points i don't usually like to say the script was bad cause so many thing can happen in the process of making a movie and all the choices the director makes and etc etc but some of dialogs some things they said and i was like a real person sat and wrote this? I say overall this was an attempt that sometimes hit but most of the time missed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Why the Eternals?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7750015/?ref_=tt_urv","chicagorob1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2212662/?ref_=tt_urv","12 January 2022","Of all of the lesser known Marvel teams, the entire story of the Eternals is a very poor choices for a single movie.There are too many unknown new heroes, too much missing backstory and the stakes are far too high. There are uninspiring generic monsters, and gigantic all powerful god-like aliens (that are supposed to be long gone). There's just too much of everything for a coherent, engaging story.The Infinity Stone Saga took a dizen films to introduce everyone, tell their stories, develop the conflict and bring it all to a head in Endgame. This film tries to do almost the same thing, including a story set over thousands of years, with much lesser superheroes and simply not enough time. The A-list and relatively unknown actors are definitely the best for these characters, but their talents are wasted with such an overly dense and expansive story. It would have worked much better as a trilogy.What happened to much more accessible and relatable teams like Alpha Flight, Thunderbolts, Excalibur or even the Great Lakes Avengers (Squirrel Girl!)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Lots of good effort by many departments yet it's like a pancake left out in the rain.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
