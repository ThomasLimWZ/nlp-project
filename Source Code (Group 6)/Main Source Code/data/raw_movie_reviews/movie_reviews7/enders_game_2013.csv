It is needed to be said in the review, because even with all the effort it is impossible for me to review the movie without influence of the book.Movie did actually better job than I expected. I liked the cast of the main characters, Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Both did very good job. A big positive surprise for me was the visual aspect of the movie, I liked it actually so much, it is the main reason, why I keep my rating for the movie so high despite the negatives.The biggest problem of the Ender's Game adaptation is the race against the time. The movie tries to squeeze huge amount of information in a short time and it just does not work. I cannot imagine, how I would feel without having any background information from the book. Even if we can discuss whether the ""Earth"" sideline with Ender's siblings has to or doesn't have to be in the movie (it does not), there is the main storyline describing Ender's time spend in Battle school and it is handled so shallowly and quickly, it hurts. This story just needs more space. Without it there is almost no character development. No emotions towards side characters, like Bean or Petra or all the others, barely recognizable for the viewer. Even the great ending is ripped of emotions partially because of it. I felt all the aspects of the movie are more handled as trailers to that aspect than actually diving into it. And it is a pity.It was still a nice experience, seeing the universe come to life.Remember, the enemy's gate is down!","38 out of 46 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Needs an extended version","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2953503/?ref_=tt_urv","Jerghal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1866601/?ref_=tt_urv","2 February 2014","The box-office failure of big budget (110m$) book adaptation 'Ender's Game' doesn't bode well for the future of my favorite movie genre. Writer Orson Scott Card has had many offers since the book release in 1985 to turn it into a film. He rejected many of them because of creative differences and because most Studios insisted on making Ender older (in the book he's 6 to 10 years old). There were plans in 2003 by Warner Brothers to let Wolfgang Petersen have a go at it with a script written by Card himself. Card's script was a fusion of 'Ender's Game' and 'Ender's Shadow'. In 2010 Gavin Hood got attached as director and screenwriter and the script became based on the first book again with plans to make it into a franchise or a TV series if successful. Unfortunately EG made only 112m$ worldwide (although it opened first place in the US with 27m$) so all future plans have been put on ice. It's really a shame because as far as science fiction flicks go this really is one of the better ones. The VFX were done by Digital Domain who also co-financed the film and they look absolutely stunning. This film will a good 4K showcase Blu-ray when they finalize the format at the end of 2014. The film follows the book quite closely but because of the time constraints of the film medium a lot of events had to be compressed and some subplots where eliminated. 113 mins really is too short, an extra 40 mins or so would have let more room to expand on Ender's training etc. Altogether I think most fans of the book will be happy with the end result but it it just lacks the depth the book had to offer. So hopefully they make a 3 hour extended version (depending on how much material they shot) on BD to give the story more time to breathe.","62 out of 79 found this helpful.

My life went on and a few months later I saw the trailer again mentioned in a space video game called Skyjacker (Skyjacker - Starship Constructor update 20 in August). I got curious enough and decided to read the book first and watch the movie in November. Then I discover that there wasn't only one book, but a bunch of them. The Ender's Game saga!I'm a bit lazy when it comes to reading, so I decided to listen to the audio books instead :) I got lucky, since from the author's point of view this is the ideal medium for enjoying the story. The author also had some concerns about making a movie since:1- In the book the narrator is inside the character head. Making a movie with 3rd person speaking the thought of another one all the time would not work very well for the viewer.2- The kids must be very young about 6 to 12 years old and it's very hard to find outstanding actor at that age that can give the required dramatic performance.3- There should not be a love story and Hollywood tends to take advantage of the teenager feelings to do thatI was skeptical about the movie and unfortunately I was right. However they were able to do somethings right:What's wrong with the movie then?-- The training should take years, not days-- Ender's ascension to power is not credible. He fought too few battles to be promoted to commanderThey should have taken special attention to the cast. If the Bonzo character supposed to be funny, I assure you that none of the Ender's Game books fan laugh when saw him!The movie should have been split into two parts, in order to develop the Ender Wiggin personality and make is ascension on the Battle School credible. Also since they had Bean from the beginning why not develop him too? With a 2 parts movie everybody would have won. The producer would sell 2 movies for the price of producing 1. After the 1st movie the book would sell as hell and people would still be interested to see the 2nd part of the movie.Last, but not least, I must say that Human fleet looks good, although compared to the Skyjacker video game fleet it just feels shortTaking all into account I gave this movie a generous 7, when it had the potential to be a 9 or 10, if the had done it right!","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Great books hardly ever adapt into good films. But my friend wanted to see it, so I agreed to tag along on opening night. I have to say, as a movie, it is genuinely enjoyable. The visuals are starkly entrancing without being distracting. The casting is pitch-perfect - Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, in particular, do a great job. The ending is particularly well done (don't worry - it wasn't really spoiled by the trailer). The problem is, it's really just a caricature of the book. The drama in Battle School moves too quickly, the characters of Peter and Valentine are almost completely absent, and even Ender's video game is sadly underdone. I'm not usually a fan of splitting books into multiple movies, but this is one where two films would have done it justice. Also, the kids are just too old - there's an ironic moment in the movie where two officers talk about how conscripting kids under 15 ""used to be illegal"", yet all the actors playing the kids look 15 or older!Still, it's a fun ride, and if you hadn't read the book these flaws really wouldn't be apparent. Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen.","228 out of 345 found this helpful.

I will do this review in two parts. First of all this is a fun and exciting movie that is geared toward teens but adults will like it as well. The effects are great and the violence isn't anything for parents to be worried about at all. For then entertainment factor alone I recommend this for all families. The second part is about a deeper meaning. I could be reading way too much into this and I don't mean to get political but the movie is kind of a metaphor for the Iraq war. I don't want to give anything away but if you go into it with that mindset you will see what I mean. I know the book it is based off of is older then the war but when you watch it you will see what I mean. Anyway what I'm trying to say is that this is a good family movie that I recommend. Overall, exciting and entertaining and me and my son both liked it. I give it a B+.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie feels very rushed and chopped though. You're going through a great story with light speed, and none of us could shake the feeling that this movie could've done with at least half an hour more. The speed in which this story is told doesn't leave enough room to establish the characters, and certainly not to see their progress through the story.I will eagerly await the 3,5 hour during directors cut in a year or 2, hopefully.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The life of Earth depends on gaming skills","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2900207/?ref_=tt_urv","bkoganbing","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2483625/?ref_=tt_urv","5 November 2013","After all the controversy surrounding the author of Ender's Game and his iconoclastic views on so many subjects, I quite frankly didn't know what to expect from this film. It's far from the greatest science fiction endeavor I've ever seen. It really ought to be seen back to back with Starship Troopers on a number of levels.In both cases the earth has been subject to an alien invasion of an insect civilization of sorts. Starship Troopers never has any doubts or qualms about the citizen's exercising their right to defend planet earth from the bug invasion. The insects aren't even given a generic name, they're simply referred to as 'bugs'. And the bugs only see earth as some kind of feeding ground.These insects in Ender's Game are called Formi and they invaded and several million people were killed before the invasion was repelled. But they've been quiet over the last several decades, no one can say for certainty what they're intentions are. But earth isn't waiting, Harrison Ford is in charge of developing young and I do mean young new commanders with computer precision skills, honed to perfection on computer games.The one he favors is young Asa Butterfield who seems to have more of the right stuff than anyone else. In the end as you would imagine he does, but what he does raises certain issues that Starship Troopers would never imagine.It's ironic that the biggest strength of Ender's Game is the way that computer gaming skills have been refined and are so desirable. The Armed Forces in its recruiting for several years has made a selling point of gaming skills. All the weapons from the most sophisticated missiles down to tanks and even some hand held weapons have a computer guidance system of sorts. No more just point, aim, and shoot. Ender's Game has multiplied that exponentially. In fact in this futuristic society, one with the requisite skills can be drafted.In the end a mixed message is sent to the audience robbing some of the effectiveness of Ender's Game. It still has a lot to recommend it and the contrast to Starship Troopers is quite intense.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

It took over seventy years to give John Carter his big-screen debut. I had a copy of L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth that claimed that it would become a motion picture soon, but that never happened until almost twenty years later (and many would probably argue that it should not have been made). Ender's Game is another one of the best sci-fi novels I've read, and a film for it has been in development for something like ten years. So, in 2013, I couldn't have been more excited.Ender's Game is kinda like The Hunger Games set in outer space, only more aggressive, more fantastic, and more original. EG has its fair share of special-effects-laden spectacle, with massive swarms of spaceships and incredible planetscapes filling up the screen. Fortunately, it's not all just action for the sake of action, it is all a direct consequence of the story. When the space battles aren't breaking out, the film still moves very fast with loads of character-driven conflicts.The film still maintains most of its focus on telling the story, and it does hit up all the necessary plot points that were in the original novel. Some major subplots get cut out, the training/battle scenes are truncated, and various other liberties are taken, but for a two-hour movie, the filmmakers did their best to cover the entire plot, right up to its bizarre ending. A lot of scenes are exactly as I pictured them from reading the book (even the fantasy CGI mindgame scenes, which I always fancied should be animated Pixar style, and it turns out they were!), and the dark aggression of the book is mostly translated well into the film. Best of all, the book's biggest twists still bear some decent weight in the movie's narrative.Unfortunately, some things are lost in translation. Just as it is with The Hunger Games, the specific nuances of the characters, their relationships, their emotions, and their overall pathos is better conveyed in the narrative of the book than it is on film. Ender's relationships with his friends (and even his enemies) are left at the surface level, and never really reaches the same depths as the novel. Some things remain unexplained or glossed over. Deeper themes are never fully explored. Although one can't expect every single thing in the book to make it into the film, EG falls just a little short in immersing the audience in the characters. It may be easy to root for Ender when he stands up to his bullies and commands a whole fleet, but the film won't leave that much of a lasting impression.As a film, it looks pretty slick and stylish, with solid photography and editing. Acting can be rather mixed: I think all of the child actors did their jobs really well. Harrison Ford gets the most grief for his role, for he pretty much phones it in, but I still didn't think he was as terrible as other reviewers make him out to be. Ben Kingsley plays it kinda creepily in his role, and Viola Davis is pretty much herself. Writing in this film is okay, but has a rather bad penchant for exposition. This production has some good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score is not bad either.As usual, the book is better than the movie, but I think the movie still does a good job as an adaptation. I expect that average audiences unfamiliar with the book will think this movie is okay, but might miss out on certain nuances. Book fans might gripe that the film doesn't do justice to certain things. In any case, I think the movie is worth a rent to all dedicated sci-fi fans.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Pretty Good)","102 out of 154 found this helpful.

The only similarity I could see was in a one line summary of the plot and the name of the protagonist. 10 year old Ender Wiggin in the book was a little bulldog of a kid, without remorse, introspection or personal relationships. Ender Wiggin in the movie is a skinny, delicate kid with a much more complex character, interested in strategy, seeing the world from the perspective of his opponents, flirting with any females nearby and cleverly assessing any possible advantages and disadvantages in any conflict. He is perhaps the most intelligent fighter in movies. The best parts of the movie are watching him deal with people attacking him. The actor Asa Butterfield is a little too delicate to be believable as Ender the fighter, but he projects the intelligence well. He has some of the magic of a superhero with an unusual power.The movie starts with typical military brainwashing, lots of saluting, push-ups, insulting sergeants, racing to line up... This part bored me to tears. It has been done a million times before. The only difference was some uniforms modelled on the sexy suits motor cycle racers wear.Ender, being younger and skinnier and bright, attracts some really vicious bullying. The administration encourages this. This is a school to learn mass murder after all. Ender deals with this with a combination of intelligence, philosophy and surprise. It is one of the more realistic depictions of bullying I have seen in movies.Then we have the zero-g acrobatics. For what seems an eternity we watch people dangling on wires zooming about in a dome, sometimes clinging to each other. These exercises to me seem completely pointless. These shots obviously took a lot of time and effort to get, and the editor was reluctant to cut them down to reasonable length.The movie is much more explicit than the book. The philosophical musings in the book are handled more with inference.The music was composed by a relative of the guy who did the score for Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. It was syrupy and heavy handed. It made some otherwise exciting scenes come out silly.Much of the movie is spent watching CGI graphics. No matter how good they are, pictures of planets and space craft blowing up get pretty old pretty quickly.If I were the director, I don't know how I could make this feature film without introducing many more subplots. But I would do a lot of pruning. The director seems to think if seeing thing X is exciting, seeing thing X thrice is three times as exciting.It is a thoughtful movie, about the necessity for restraint in conflict, and becoming too sure you know what you opponent is thinking.I did not see this movie in the theatres, because I was boycotting Orson Scott Card and his anti-gay bigotry, which is not apparent in either the book or the film.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It feels like a rather disconnected series of scenes that were considered to be ""key"" scenes - and that can only really be connected with the lore and meta-knowledge of the book.Characters in the movie are well acted - but lack depths and development. But not so much to be annoying. So it is a slight disappointment for such a big movie.I have to agree with some reviewers on the fact that this movie should have been split into two or maybe even 3 parts of 2 or 2.5 hours each. At no point did i become greatly immersed or did i start to care much about the characters - because all i got was flickers of their progression.Story-wise it reminded me on the TV series ""space above and beyond"" - especially the ending. But the series did a better job getting immersed (of course, because it had so much more time to develop the characters) The movie is good - but one cannot shake the feeling that it could have been great ... if it had been more detailed and focused on the characters.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In my view, this is what has been done in adapting Ender's Game, the remnants have been stacked together as a bunch of sound-bites and run at fast forward speed, leaving no time for character progression and the growth of friendships that is the mainstay to the original story.It may be that, like Philip Pullman's Dark Materials Trilogy, this was an unmakeable film so we should perhaps thank them for their brave effort that didn't quite make it.In failing, the film is a testament to the writing of Card that he could cram so much story into just 350 paperback pages that it couldn't been captured in 2 hours on the screen.And finally, Ben Kingsley's performance, what a shocker! Think we'll see more of Asa Butterfield though.","237 out of 436 found this helpful.

It might be argued that Ford is playing to the gruff stereotype he has essayed in any number of recent films, but I like this performance.The younger members of the cast were unfamiliar to me, but they acquit themselves well.

"1","/10","5 things that would have made this movie better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2943944/?ref_=tt_urv","djc123-612-319888","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41079685/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2014","When I first heard this film was coming out, I decided to read the two books on which the movie was based (Enders Game & Enders Shadow). I really enjoyed the books and was confident that with a bit of thought they could make a decent screenplay that would be true to the story in the books as well as being entertaining to watch. Like many others, I was incredibly disappointed with the movie. Here are 5 things that would have improved it greatly: 1) Show the passage of time: Whilst I understand that it would be tricky to show the 5 years or so Ender is in battle school, having him writing an email saying 'we have been studying for months' doesn't really cut it. Everything moves so fast that you get the impression he has only been there a few weeks. This prevented something essential to most movies, character development. 2) Show Battle School as a school: Much of the book is about how the battle room games shape and define Enders character as a person and (eventually) a leader/commander. This is barely touched on the movie with the few battle room scenes being very disappointing and Ender becoming both an expert in the battle room and leader of an army within what seems like a week! Also, in the books there are a few hundred children at battle school, a lot more than the sparse 50 or so we see in the movie. Even classic Star Trek gave the impression of a large crew on the Enterprise by having extras walking in the corridors, how hard can it be to copy that?3) Show that Ender is truly on his own: In the book, Ender doesn't have any friends as such, he has to earn respect by becoming the best in the battles, then people start to follow him. When Ender arrives, Graff says that Ender has to feel alone, but from then on he always has someone to help him or be his friend. 4) More Bean, less Petra: Petra is a great character in the books, because she is a bit of a b**ch! Yes, she helps Ender with shooting practise but she is fairly ambivalent towards him the rest of the time. Bean is the person who Ender eventually trusts the most, and even confides in. In the movie, far too much emphasis was put on Petra's relationship with Ender (she didn't even seem like the 'real' Petra to me) whereas Bean is just a face in the crowd. 5) Show Ender getting tired: Even if they failed in all the other areas, they could at least have made Ender look tired from all the battle games! His exhaustion is what drives him to 'quit', again this doesn't come across at all in the movie. How hard could it be to show that? I could write more, but in summary this movie was an epic fail with very few redeeming qualities. The sad thing is, it could have been one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, but instead they traded the 'soul' of the book for a few flashy effects and a lightweight story. Somewhere in the process the real Ender's Game got lost.","151 out of 272 found this helpful.

And there are definite similarities to ""War Games"". But the protagonist (Ender) in this film is younger, making it harder to film convincingly.There was one scene where it felt silly to me that such young people were playing adult (military) roles, but otherwise I had no trouble accepting that premise. The film includes wonderful visuals, which could easily have been its downfall; but the real problem is the lack of exposition, which feels like the result of excessive editing. We need believable action based upon the psychology of the characters. ""Ender's Game"" comes up short in this area. The viewer can, in his mind, stitch the scenes of the film together to make a decent whole, but the story is short-changed and it fails to achieve the level of quality it could have had.Despite its visuals, the story is essentially a morality piece, asking the viewer to process the choices that the protagonist makes on his quest to achieve his goal. It can be difficult to put the audience in the mind of the hero, but that is especially true when they are not given enough clues to his thought processes.This is a film worth seeing, but it could have been much more.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love the idea of being in space, other planets, the idea of life in the universe. It is the perfect escapism for me.Ender Wiggin is a very smart kid who is believed to be the chosen one to end a war between the human race and aliens that want to wipe us out.The story is quite good, but I just thought that a film about a child being trained in killing aliens could have been a lot better. Ender just wasn't very convincing as a character. There were a few characters in this film that I thought were not very convincing. I didn't believe that this kid was as smart as he was made out to be. Then the bully character was just laughable. I think the casting and probably the story just didn't add up.The film has some pretty big stars in it. Harrison Ford makes his way back to science fiction films after a long period away... And seeing as he has signed up for the next instalment of the eagerly anticipated Star Wars saga, it seems he is hanging around sci fi for a while. You never know... That rumour of a sequel to Blade Runner might actually come. Harrison was probably the best actor in the film, but he should have been in it more in my opinion. The film also has Ben Kingsley in it... Ben has a relatively small role, but he is memorable in it. The main cast were Asa Butterfield﻿, Hailee Steinfeld﻿ & Abigail Breslin. Asa was not great. I thought in some scenes he was OK, but generally he did not pull this character off. Hailee did a good job. I thought she was he best actress in the film (next to Harrison and Ben).The thing I loved about this film the most was the visuals. It was an amazing looking movie. I loved the scenery and the effects. It was all done brilliantly. It made me feel that I wanted to be up there. It looked beautiful.The ending was really good. I thought it was really well done and I did not expect the ending like that. The ending was actually worth waiting for.Not a bad film, could have been a lot better, but visually it is worth watching.I will give this 6 out of 10.""Your mother cheated, that's why you look like a plumber.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:Ordinary Person Movie Reviews","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some of the best moments in the book were only briefly touched on as well, and pivotal events glossed over or even left out entirely. That's obviously going to rub some people the wrong way, but the low scores are ridiculous. 1 star? Really? As a standalone film this is easily a 7. There's enough here to entertain. Great special effects with some solid acting. Pretty exciting action sequences. It's far from the steaming pile of garbage some of these reviewers claim it to be.Personally I think some more time could have been better spent to flesh out certain parts of the story. It floats in the limbo of being slightly too vague for people that haven't read the novel, and too trimmed for the ones that have. Also, choices made regarding some characters surrounding Ender to appeal to a wider audience was a mistake. It feels very generic, safe and budget conscious. As in, ""Not sure if sequel will happen, so let's condense this in the most risk-free way."" Typical Hollywood stuff.This won't rank in your list of top films, but you won't regret having spent time watching it, either.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I loved Hugo, but it had nothing to do with Asa Butterfield. Ender's Game though was Asa's best work by far. The movie somewhat grabs your attention at the beginning with interesting concepts, and the story gets much better throughout the film. The movie had very good action sequences that surprised me and everyone in the theater. The zero gravity battles in particular were the highlights of the movie for me and everyone that I have talked too. The movie does a good job of not just putting action in the movie for the sake of action. They follow a good concise plot with the action only adding on to it. The design was pretty good all around, even though it was set in the future, it all seemed believable. I have not read the books, but from all I have heard about them, the movie stays in line with the key plot points. The movie focuses on Ender's training process more than anything else. The movie does not have any clichés during the training either like a love relationship or a bully that continually torments him like most teenage-centered action films. Ender's ability to analyze situations and take the necessary course of action is brilliantly displayed. Asa Butterfield particular displays this type of the character flawlessly with everyone believing that he is a Steven Hawking type. The only part of Asa Butterfield's performance that is weak is when he has to show true powerful emotions, but thankfully the movie did not have much of that. Harrison Ford's character was one that I have never seen him play before, but he made it look like he has been doing that type of aggressive, emotionless character his whole life. The other performances all did a decent job because the casting department did a chose each of them masterfully. There are some flaws that you will notice that particularly do not fit into the plot well and the director just put those in the movie hoping no one will notice because they were still key to the plot, but sadly there was no build up. I do not want to go into detail because I do not want to spoil it, but they seem like rookie mistakes. Other than those, Gavin hood did a solid directing job that is a huge step up from X-men: Origins Wolverine. The movie sadly does not contain much humor and it deserves the movie to have barely any comedy during the film. The movie finishes fairly well, but it seemed a little rushed like the endings of the transformers movies. If the movie gave the ending more time, I think it would have improved the film much more and given the audience a more solid feeling at the end of the movie. Still, the ending is better than most sci-fi movies. All in all, the movie delivers decent enough action with good performances from Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. The film is entertaining enough that makes the viewing experience enjoyable.

I wanted to see how it was translated to the big screen. Unfortunately it wasn't done well.A lot of characters were miscast - especially Ender. In the book Ender was younger than the rest. He was thrown into the school at the age of 6 where the usual starting age was 8. So just because of this alone there would've been size differences. Bonzo was considered a threat to Ender even in a 1on1 fight because he was bigger and stronger. In general this was also a theme within the book - the weak overcoming terrible odds.The next problem is that the story has been cut way to much. 90 minutes is not enough time to properly translate the book. They would've needed at least a 2 hour movie extending the first half of the movie.Ender as a character in the movie is not likable and there is no reason why he would've gotten the support of the other kids. In addition the other characters are extremely underdeveloped. By the end of the movie you don't really know anything about the supporting characters. And the worst is that you probably won't care about Ender neither.Also where the first half of the movie presents basically 2/3 of the book in a very condensed and modified version the second half of the movie makes drastic changes to the finale of the book regarding location and execution. It simply kills the story as a whole.The visual effects look good. However a movie can't stand on visuals alone.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

The last time I read it, I was too young to really understand what was going on, so when the movie was announced, I thought it would be a good opportunity to look into the story again. Though the film is no classic, it's held up by solid writing and performances. While Hailee Steinfeld is a bit disappointing (never thought I'd say that), Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford remain eminently watchable, both bringing the appropriate amount of charisma to their respective roles. It's also well directed, and you can see director Gavin Hood invisibly manipulating the sometimes dozens of characters and objects on screen with a delicate deftness. While Card's story shines through, the transition from pages to the screen feels a bit haphazard. The plot is rushed along, hurrying through dialog in order to reach the occasionally drawn-out action sequences. It's by no means incoherent, but more focus on the characters (and perhaps a longer run time) could have gone a long way.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact they feel more like the practice section in a video game rather than the better main event.

It is not Gravity. Which meant, it's probably not FILM OF THE YEAR, National Film Registry (Hollywood Hall of Fame) future inductee materials, it is not LIFE OF PI (inspirational EPIC), also Ender's Game didn't have the luxury to have Tarantino to direct the show (so NOT a cool type movie), it will not blow yr mind or inspire you to change yr life etc, but...2. It is a solid sci-fi thriller, well done, good acting, OKish special effect (again, gentle reminder, NOT GRAVITY), lack of depth in story, a long winded like Peter Jackson would probably produce a more detail and added more EPICness into this great material. Personally, kind of feel like it was too rush, probably a longer director cut will do the film more justice. Well, it work for THE ABYSS, not sure bout this one.3. DO NOT READ ANY SPOILER / WIKIPEDIA PAGE about the story line. Pls don't do it, I regretted this a lot, take away an important plot twist which kind of ruined the fun at the end.4. Why Ben Kingsley has an Oscar while Ford has none, well watch this film and you will know why. Old BEN has like a 5 minutes cameo and yet stole every scene possible. Butterfield kid was good, not Harley Joel Osment's Six Sense good, just quite good. The rest kind of fall flat. This is a waste to a list of talented cast, due to the rushness. A 180 minutes run time would probably better to showcase this wonderful scifi tale. Just IMO, didn't ask you to like it.5. Get to know that the director (Hood) from South Africa too. Kind of worry he will shake his camera like his fellow country men did in Elysium, luckily he didn't, which was good. It can be quite violent at time, not for kid, especially when children saw what Ender did to his foe. Take this as a warning.Thanks for reading, enjoy the film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

A film adaptation is pretty obvious and how it ended up is as intriguing as it gets. It's immediately gripping at the very start. Even though the film is able to introduce its concept cleverly, the film suffers for lacking enough interest in fleshing out the rest of its universe. But again, it works better at delivering its style. Ender's Game is a solidly made film that has plenty of ways to covered up some of the flaws and instead make the overall film inevitably entertaining.To be honest, the plot is well told. The real danger rather focuses on what the kids would end up after the military training than what the aliens would do to Earth. It's basic personal stuff towards Ender, which makes it quite gripping. While it decently follows its meat, the exposition moves too easy. The narratives may be straightforward and all, but there is a little sense of subtlety to the journey. At times it also feels cold. That's probably the result for not spending enough time developing Ender's relationship to the people around him. The film should have prioritized characterization as well to at least made some of its points compelling.And so the humanity of the characters are somewhat now relied on the actors. Asa Butterfield has a built for a hero, but other than the witty side, he is able to express the character's angst quite well to be relatable. Harrison Ford, Viola Davis, and Ben Kingsley did what they had to do, and it's good enough for the roles. Most of the credit goes to the direction. Gavin Hood displays sorts of gorgeous shots around its Sci-Fi aesthetics. Following the camera easily brings a large adventurous experience along the way, providing vertigo and excitement. The visual effects obviously helps heightening things up. It's just great to look at and it's appropriately satisfying as a standard action blockbuster.Ender's Game deserves to flesh things out more within the heart and the characters, but it's still a decently crafted movie. There's a sheer sense of adventure by the filmmaking. The world is already intriguing anyway, but there is definitely more interesting things that it might've developed to make it a lot more engaging. Again, it was the style that helped the audience thoroughly connect to the story. Ender's Game may not be as sensational as some other YA films out there, but it gets its job done well to keep it away from the worse ones.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Don't go in expecting typical young-adult fare. ""Ender's Game"" is an engaging and visually entertaining adaption of a classic sci-fi novel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2896807/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 2013","With a rumoured US$100 million production budget, ""Ender's Game"" could be written off as one of the latest in a growing line of high-budget young adult flicks, which its co-producing company Summit Entertainment probably hopes it will be. A more interesting fact is that it's also one of the first films whereby one of the other co-producers is James Cameron's special-effects firm Digital Domain, responsible for creating most of the futuristic sets and backdrops. But visual effects, even in a sci-fi movie, can only go so far in capturing audiences. The source material's acclaim far exceeds that of recent YA successes like ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"": Orson Scott Card's sci-fi novel won both the prestigious Nebula Award and the Hugo Award in 1985 and 1986 respectively, and is also recommended reading for the US Marine Corps.Attempting to give sufficient credit to such a classic novel is director and writer Gavin Hood, best remembered for the unimpressive ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", which received a lukewarm response from critics and audiences alike. This time though, the pieces look to be in place for a box office success. Beyond the lauded source material, he's also got a stellar cast, led by 16-year-old Asa Butterfield, who effectively wields his expressive, bright blue eyes to convey a contradictory mix of childlike vulnerability and a preternatural ruthlessness. These are useful tools for portraying Ender Wiggin, a brilliant boy-genius recruited by the military in a world that is still recovering from the aftermath of an attack by insect-like aliens. The government is somehow convinced that training children barely on the cusp of adolescence in the ways of war will ensure future victory. Employing a combination of relentless physical training, psychological manipulation and social isolation in Battle School, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) are looking to sieve out a suitable leader.Ender appears to have the ideal traits, a result of both nature and nurture. On the one hand his intellect and tactical instinct are innate gifts. On the other, a troubled family background consisting of ambivalent parents, a psychotic older brother and a compassionate sister creates a detached demeanour and an understanding that mercy must be shelved in exchange for a thorough victory. Graff, convinced that Ender is 'The One', pulls no stops in his training and quickly puts him in command of his own platoon. The inter-team battles resemble laser tag in a spherical zero-gravity court, lit in blue neon and dotted with blocks. Ender establishes himself as a leader worth his salt; crushing enemies along the way and swallowing the resultant guilt until an ill-fated showdown with a belligerent team leader Bonzo (Moises Arias) one day throws him off- course. Questioning whether the toll on his psyche is worth all this training to ultimately become a killer, Ender quits, only to change his mind after a rather brief talk with the one person he loves most in the world, his sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin). He moves on to advanced training in Command School under revered war veteran Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley). The script takes on a more existential tone after this point, leading up to the climactic final ""game"" where the theme of morality / oppression in war takes centre-stage.The pacing may be slightly uneven but the film moves fast enough to retain your attention throughout. Visually, most scenes are filtered with bright electric blue lights and warm amber hues set against black space, which feels familiar and reminiscent of ""Tron: Legacy"" – both films share the same production designers, Sean Haworth and Ben Procter. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuarón's astoundingly beautiful ""Gravity"" doesn't do ""Ender's Game"" any favours. That's not to say that it isn't aesthetically impressive on its own; the glossy and clinical sets are believably futuristic and highly pleasing to the eye.Acting-wise, Ford leverages on his grandfatherly gravitas in portraying a man who is convinced that the end he has in mind will justify any means. Alongside him, Butterfield ably holds his own, following his adorable turn in ""Hugo"" with another praiseworthy performance and creating a tense dynamic with Ford that hits the boiling point in the concluding scenes. Abigail Breslin, unfortunately, is underused. Movie adaptations of books invariably result in the loss of certain elements: While Ender's siblings are keenly-developed and complex characters in the novel, the lack of screen time and development in the movie render them as mere placeholders.","59 out of 97 found this helpful.

This complex question, along with many others, is explored in the 2013 film Ender's Game. The film is based on the beloved 1985 science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card. Both the novel and film follow the story of child genius Ender Wiggin as he navigates and excels in a military training academy located in outer space. The academy is focused on eliminating an alien race that is rumored to be planning an invasion. The film is a decent adaptation, though the middle of the movie may feel a little slow and the epic climax a little too fast. However, overall, the film is worth a watch, especially if you are a sci-fi fan and/or a fan of the novel.The performances in the movie range from pretty good to pretty... weird. Asa Butterfield (who plays Ender) is quite good and among the strongest performances in the film. Butterfield seamlessly captures Ender's nuanced struggle with his own darkside. Harrison Ford (Graff) and Mosias Arias (Bonzo) were among some of the other strong performances. One of the weirder casting choices was Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham. His on-and-off-again New Zealand accent and facial tattoos are so weird that they pull you out of the movie.Even though Kingsley's casting is questionable, there's still quite a bit to enjoy. For example, the special effects in the film are out of this world, pun intended. The battleroom scenes were very fun to watch, though they could turn the stomach of a motion sickness-sensitive viewer. Without giving away any spoilers, the final exam sequence was easily the best scene in the film; the special effects mixed with the young actors' emotional performances and the shocking reveal at the end of the scene made it truly memorable. Moreover, Butterfield and Ford's heated exchange after the climatic reveal is some of the best acting in the movie, and Butterfield's delivery of the film's thesis statement (""It's how we win that matters."") made it clear what this movie's message is. Despite the confusing pacing, the film does an excellent job of staying true to the novel's key thematic questions: Is it better to be cunning or kind? Can we run from our inner darkness or will it inevitably take over? And is authority something to be trusted or feared?All in all, I would rate Ender's Game 7/10. Though some of the casting choices were questionable and the pacing a bit disjointed, I feel that the film does do quite a bit of work to keep the core values of Orson Scott Card's novel present. At the very least, it is a fun watch that still manages to touch on some very complex topics!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the past, these bugs invaded earth, but humanity was able to drive them away, and now humanity wants to take the fight to them (Starship Troopers any anyone?). Except for this time, humanity is looking to children to lead the way. The film never really states why they are using these kids. My only guess is because it would make it easier to market the film to kids. I won't spoil anything, but I thought that it was a fun movie all in all. And I must admit I haven't read the books, which could be why the film drags in a few places.But all in all, it's an okay film. For the most part, the casting is excellent. Harrison Ford has proven he can play any role, and I think this is a good addition to his resume. It is similar to some of his other roles but different enough to be unique. A young Hailee Steinfeld also shines as the girl who becomes Ender's right-hand woman and his only friend. She isn't in the movie's first half, but once she shows up, she steals every scene she is in. And I know a lot of fans of the book would probably hate this idea, but I think she would have made a great protagonist had they decided to do a gender swap and had Hailee play Ender. However, I thought the kid who played Ender did a good job.At times the film dragged a bit. The training and the games they play are a lot the same, and it kind of gets repetitive. However, my main problem with this film is the ending. The film feels like it is meant to be part of a trilogy. However, those other films were never made, and the result feels a little bland and is kind of depressing in a way. Eight years have passed so it seems unlikely that any other films will be made now. I mean Hailee Steinfeld and the kid who played Ender are all grown up now. But with that said its still a fun little movie to watch every now and again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Lord of the Rings? At roughly 12 and a half hours running time for all three extended versions, there is STILL so much left out. And so much changed, but despite that so much of it is exactly as I imagined it when I first read it. Lord of the Rings, that is, I have never read ""Ender's Game"" and I'm glad I never have.The same goes for Ender's Game. We know we are getting a simplified story, so I choose just to accept it as it is. Even Orson Scott Card says they stuck to the basic book - So if the Author thinks that, then I can deal with it as well.So - Asa Butterfield, aka ""Hugo"" is in another film with his Hugo Co- Star Gandhi, aka Ben Kingsley. And Harry Ford is looking OK just shy of what, 70? And ready for another Star Wars adventure, I think.What I liked about this film was the mixing of Child Actors and the older actors, who we've seen over and over, so there is a lot to anchor on here- We see these kids, in ""Battle School"" and we see their Teacher Colonel Graff, so I can handle the Unknown Kids factor much better.Most astonishing is the appearance of Abigail Breslin as ""Valentine"" being the exact same little girl she was in ""Signs"" - She becomes the way the ""Buggers""/""Formics"" can get into Ender's Mind.The other total standout here is Hailee Steinfeld, who I thought was a better Mattie Ross for True Grit than the original actress in the John Wayne version. Her Petra is perfect for this film, I don't think anyone else could have done it as well.And this is the big MacGuffin of the film and of the book - Ender thinks he has stumbled into a Game loaded into his school ""iPad"" - But his ""Game"" is more related to what is really happening in his universe than what Graff and later ""Mazer Rackham"" (Kingsley) are telling him.And he has to figure this out, but he is being tricked, as we are being tricked by the clever underlying story of the book.In fact, during the first battle with the Formics, Mazer had learned something important, something which Ender is learning through his Game. In fact, Mazer is tricking Ender into playing His game, while Ender is being shown the Real Game in his device.When it comes down to it, we can either blow up our enemies into molecule sized chunks and obliterate them forever, or we can find a way to talk to them, even if they do not have Mouths and cannot Scream.","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

Ford and Butterfield, and the compellingly problematic relationship between their characters, are real standouts. I've never seen Ford this good in anything, apart from 'Witness', and I love him in everything I've seen him in. But it's that he's toe-to-toe with Butterfield: you can just sense the respect, the teamwork between them - it's just magic to watch. Though (as a Kiwi) I baulk at the use of tau moko on Kingsley, I can only assume it was sanctioned and approved of by Maori experts (I would LOVE to see the specific meaning of Rackham's ta moko: every line has import and relevance), and (as a Kiwi) I loved his Noo Zeelund accent. I would've loved to have seen more of Davis's Anderson, but I'm like that about her in everything she appears in! Steinfeld's Petra is also a standout, as is the magnetic Valentine from Breslin. And a cast of wonderful diversity, reflecting humanity's inevitable future: a range of cultures, ethnicities, creeds and disbeliefs is how we look now, and how we'll look very soon from now.On release, the last section of the film made me cry like a drain - some 'thing' so computer generated has never really had that effect on me - but on my second screening now, seven years later, those scenes still get to me. Kudos to all involved - you should be proud that this production will stand the test of time, and will 'get to' thoughtful kids just like Ender when they discover your gorgeous film.","11 out of 15 found this helpful.

Wiggins displays remarkable decision making abilities which shows that straight thinking does not always help and many a times lateral thinking is required, especially in wartime. One more quality he displayed is empathy towards the enemy which was unusual but I guess some leaders could be having this. Overall what I appreciated in this movie is the qualities displayed by the protagonist as a budding leader and his maverick approach which comes in handy in his dealing with tough situations. Worth watching family and kids' movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He's ably supported by a cast of Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. While it is not always clear as to why so much responsibility is thrust upon the children or the vague nature of the enemy, the film still manages to come together in a coherent fashion, especially in the final act - which is pleasantly surprising, to say the least.The film, while not breaking any new ground serves as an agreeable beginning for a sci-fi franchise with some promise.

Books usually are better than the movie 99% of the time.A fast paced sci-fi with some great acting, drama, and special effects. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Harrison Ford is always a bonus too. I would have enjoyed this in the theater.Basically, it's a story of a prodigy human teen who trains to help save the planet from an invading bug-like alien species. It's got aliens, lasers, high tech no-gravity laser tag, fighter planes, drones, swarms, space ships, explosions, and alien planets. There's a lot packed into the movie. And poor Ender, I think a lot of people can relate to being bullied because they were good at something. But Ender endures and stays focused on his goals. I think this is one of the themes the book probably explains better.I suspected there was a lot, I mean a lot of detail in the books that was missing from the movie. My guess is they could have split this into a two or three film series easily enough to get some more back story. There were quite a few times the film didn't do a good job of explaining something, so I suspect it's like squeezing LOTR into one movie.Otherwise, it was an entertaining and well done film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you know the books, you will hate it, it's the worst movie adaptation of a novel since ""Sum Of All Fears"" and almost (but not quite) as bad as the ""Dune"" movie. If you don't know the books, then you won't know what is going on.Worst case scenario. First, they decided that it would be good if this movie could be more like the Hunger Games or Twilight series, making it into a 50% chick flick, which the original story is definitely NOT. Lots of touchy feely hand wringing going on, particularly at the end, but without almost the entire story line regarding Ender's background or the reasoning and history behind drafting Children into the service, it all comes off as some lame plot line. And Peter has only 1 min of screen time, completely killing off that sub-plot and all of it's implications for the main story.The heavy lifting for the plot is done by narrative, Ender's letters to Valentine, which, while it gets some badly needed explanations across, is a totally weak story telling tool, and very much a cop-out. The Mind Game is also weakly handled, with only a few words of explanation regarding the Formic's influence on Ender through it.At least the special effects were up to current standards, no complaints there, but making this amazing story material into something not much better than Battleship or Pacific Rim, is not something that I would be proud of as a Director.They took a 700 page novel, made a 1hr 45min movie out of it somehow. They were forced to condense the first 600 pages into 3 or 4 spoken sentences of dialog between characters so that major (essential) plot points are at least mentioned (not that they help much). Then they take the last couple of chapters and go into more depth on that material, but by then, you don't care anymore. And if you have not read the book, at that point it will feel like some standard forgettable action flick. They go even further into the abyss by using material from the second novel to blatantly set up a sequel. It all feels so shabby and such a waste.I originally had high hopes for this one, Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley usually don't get involved in much crap, but they must have needed money or something because this one is crap. This will effectively kill Ender's Game for the rest of time, nobody has ever made a second version of a movie from a novel, which is what this would take to make things right. We can only hope that 75% of the movie was cut out in editing, and may be released as a Director's Cut or Extended Edition, but failing major changes in future release versions, the Game is Over.Very sad.

As fan of the book unfortunately I was disappointed that the movie wasn't the ground breaking blockbuster hit that I'd wanted. That being said I still personally enjoyed this film immensely. Most reviewers had mixed feelings about Ender's Game; one side found it flat out boring and callous while the other side thought it was just okay. I think part of this you can blame on the source material. One of the massive issues with turning Ender's Game into a movie was how much of the story really takes place in Ender's head. Orson Scott Card's writing is very psychologically. He mentioned in an interview himself that if you aren't privy to Ender's strategic thought processing than he comes across as just a violent kid. Personally for me, the aspect of the film that suckered me into it the most was the duality of Ender's character and how smartly written he is. The balance that he's trying to find between compassion and aggression while finding ways to beat his enemies is what makes Ender endlessly more interesting than other characters in this kind of genre for me. You want to see how he's going to react to every new challenge set in front of him because every choice he makes is sharply calculated.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was this excited for months about the film, and yes, I saw it opening night. But after having seen it, I say with dismay that although the admission may not have been a total waste of money, it may have been better spent on a few drinks at a bar, or on a Shake Shack dinner (for the non- drinkers). I was just so unexpectedly un-enthralled that I'm still in shock.The film opens with Ender Wiggin as his parent's third child in a world where thirds are not highly regarded, yet a prestigious military school's administrators monitor Ender's life via hidden cameras, and through this observation witness the potential genius within Ender. But whatever they notice, it is not shown to the audience.Nonetheless Ender leaves his family behind to study at this elite training school where plans are secretly being made; Ender will train to become the next great commander of the Earth fleet. While at battle school Ender meets the legendary Mazer Rackham, a famous Maori warrior whom singlehandedly defeated the aliens previously, when they attacked Earth. Rackham's job now is to mentor Ender, to prepare him for the greatest battle of his life.Director Hood's rendition of Ender's Game does just adequate justice to the original plot of the book. I pined for a grittier, R-rated Prometheus or District 9-ish kind of rendition, and instead I got something related more to Will Smith's Independence Day.There were no gaps left in the time line of the film, gaps necessary to explain how Ender could possibly have become a fleet commander at all. As Director Hood portrays it, the audience sees Ender go from cadet to commander overnight, almost literally. No human past, present, or future, (not even Ender) could pull that off.Blasé scenes are followed by descriptions of grandeur that made me wonder if I had just watched the same scene as the military commanders. In front of a group of new recruits Ender is praised by Officer Graff (Harrison Ford) for his intelligence, a set-up for later peer torment? But the intelligence Ender shows here is hardly praiseworthy. It's just a smart-alecky remark about zero gravity. Later, when Ender is confronted by a gang of boys, whom he ends up defeating, the fight is not convincing, yet again, administrators swoon. This type of device, apathetic scene followed by glorious praise occurs over and over throughout the film. Descriptions of awe are purveyed when no actual awe has taken place.Asa Butterfield as Ender is largely responsible for the film's failure. He is not a convincing Ender, and so all his examples of greatness seem staged. Every time Ender does something ""miraculous"" and is praised for it, it's reminiscent of the medieval age; a king's steward dolloping out praise at every instance to keep his majesty satisfied. Harrison Ford is also pretty terrible. Come to think of it, pretty much all the acting, except Ben Kinglsey's is bad.Ender spends significant amounts of time whining about the administration blocking his email account. What does this have to do with the plot? Nothing. Since when do starships send and receive email? They don't. There's ansible technology in this world people! (machines capable of instantaneous or superluminal communication) Starships are way past ""email."" Overall, I'd say Ender's Game was only kind of bad, but it so totally not awesome.Read more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

What they were hoping for was an entire visual representation of the book or something even more demanding and honestly, Enders Game is not a book you could ever do in 2 hours. The creators of the movie have done an amazing job in having that merge of story cutting versus having a complete movie. Sure it would be terrific if the entire book could be adapted but anyone who's read Enders Game must be realistic. Could you pull it off in 2 hours? I don't think so. The only way you could even hope of achieving that is with a trilogy of movies that went for 3 hours plus(like Lord Of The Rings for example, even 'The Hobbit' required a trilogy to do the entire story in detail and that's not even half the size of Enders Game.(Let alone the scope, subject matter and thought provoking nature of the story).Instead of winging about what you don't have, just take a look at what you do have. That's a visual of what Ender looks like, the other race in striking detail and clarity, incredible starship, space station visuals. A picture of the alien world.I think Leonard Nimoy summed up a lot of the negative reviewers out there with a comment he had on some comments to another famous production: ""people who probably haven't even directed traffic are blathering about how it should have been and what it doesn't have etc etc"". That sums up those individuals. For goodness sake at least watch 'The Making Of' featurette(it's on the Bluray edition I just purchased to support the film, don't know about the DVD editions). That will give you a bit more appreciation for the pain the creators had in having to condense Enders Game into this film. In short they have done there best with the time they had.Finally Enders Game was not a commercial flop, it made it's budget plus 15 Million in profits just from ticket sales based on world wide ticket sales.Personally it should be supported for 3 main reasons 1. It's terrific and I was glad to have a visual movie to enhance the novel. 2. It seriously is a great adaptation and movie production companies are going to be shy of doing other great Science Fiction novels if fans are too critical and judgmental(thankfully Guardians Of The Galaxy did really well but seriously, I would declare Enders Game the better film). 3. I'd love to see a sequel and there has been talk of the next movie to continue Enders Story where Orson Scott Card is actually going to write new material to bridge the gap between the novels and I think most fans of the books would enjoy this because A) They no longer have anything to bitch about as it would all be new material and B) Add to the great story in a way the actual author would like to see happen.Don't listen to the nonsense, watch the movie and enjoy and most of all, buy the Bluray/DVD etc and support this stunning movie so that a sequel will be possible(at the end of the day, it's money that talks).Enders Game is EXCELLENT period, I simply can't fault it and despite what other reviewers may say, you can understand everything Ender is doing as it's implied and told through the action and the eventual unfolding of the movie. Watch it and enjoy this superb movie that doesn't deserve the ridiculous cynisism and nasty criticism that it's received so far.Way to go and 2 thumbs up to all the people involved in this incredible production.","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

The main protagonists are children, and their training and drill was not a convenient topic for me to read. It took me some efforts to walk through the book, which was a bit of a disappointment for me, since I liked the authors' previous works.Nine years ago, when it came out, I watched this adaption, and this time I appreciated the training and maturing of Ender and his friends (who are much older than in the novel), the subtle hints about the enemies' true nature of communication, the way a closed society pushes their members, and so on. The implications here about questionable human behavior and structures are the many.And I was absolutely stunned and chilled by the captivating power of the big battle and its aftermath. It is just a lesson in exceptional filmmaking. And great musical score. And wonderful CGI. There are not many movies before and after this one, which come close regarding those qualities.Sometimes I rewatch this movie, and every time I like it even a bit more. The scenes between Ender and Mazer (Ben Kingsley enjoys being strangely tattooed), and between Ender and Coronel Graff (Harrison Ford finally shows his acting skills) are always entertaining. You may or may not like Asa Butterfield here (I think he is ab bit annoying), but he is really a great cast for that character, believable in every scene.The movie, though at a high production level and featuring several big names, failed at the U. S. box office, at a time when people already should be more open about challenging the word from their superiors. Strictly hierarchical structures and rigid mindsets prevent us humans too often from finding the right way, and though we know that now very well, we do not really change.I for myself call this movie a modern classic. It is thought-provoking at so many levels, it should be shown in schools and then being discussed.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As each student in our clique of slightly Gothic and artistic individuals finished novels in the series, we passed them on to the next person. So, I eagerly awaited the release of this film after seeing the trailer during my last trip to the theater.The story about a young prodigy, chosen as a sole commander of the earth's battle forces, is presented in much a similar fashion as in the novel. Asa Butterfield is Ender, the protagonist, who trains to lead the earth forces. Harrison Ford is his, sometimes, none-too-gentle superior who steers him in this endeavor as General Graff. I feel that in the novel, Ender is a much stronger character than the one portrayed in this film version. However, I've come to like the slightly more subtle Ender that might contribute less to deluded feelings of grandeur or overestimating one's ability to succeed in real life. Admittedly, after watching two hours of Ender's Game, I came out of the theater feeling like I could stop traffic with my eyes closed while waving popcorn from the machine, whimsically, through the air, across the lobby, out through the door, and into my mouth. Some moments in the novel and the movie are just magical like that!I had three friends with me, and after getting a feel for their opinion afterward, I think this movie is best suited to us sci-fi, fantasy, and ""geeky"" types. I would have loved for all of my friends to have enjoyed Ender's Game as immensely as I did, but I suppose I can't turn them all. ;)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I wanted to like this movie, I really did. The production quality on the film was amazing. The actors for the most part were good as well.This film, had it been successful, would have been the first of many; the story has a total of 6 books in its series, followed by another that contains 5 books.The flaw however, lies in the script. The people working on this movie seemingly decided that character development was below them, it was an unnecessary thing that those who lack directorial talent did. There is very little substance to this film, and what little there is has no consequence. Every plot-line that showed the main character grow, was either removed or minimized to such an extent that it no longer held any meaning.In its place, you are graced with scenes that should have made up the character development, with a voice-over narration from the main character. Usually these voice-overs describe what the character is going through, their emotional state and what their current environment is doing to them. It's a cheap way to get inside the main characters head, so it comes as no surprise that they decided to go with this as a method of placebo character development. I could live with that, had they done it correctly. Instead, you're forced to listen to Ender describe exactly what you see on screen.Had I not read the book, I believe I would have come away from this movie questioning why a few things I saw happen, happened. They even went so far as to spoil what was a major plot-twist in the book, only one third through the film.This film had potential. It had a budget. It had an amazing production and post-production team. Is was however, its script that lead to its inevitable downward spiral that will likely kill any chance of a sequel.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Plot points are glossed over, character arcs are limited and the timeline gets a little muddled. The visual effects are great, though. The Battle Room scenes, in particular, are very well done. This isn't the best adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel, but it's probably as good as we're gonna get.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A brilliant movie for an intelligent audience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7858232/?ref_=tt_urv","ashishagupta","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54467379/?ref_=tt_urv","12 February 2022","Ender's Game is a movie adaptation of the Sci-Fi by the same name. Like all movies that are book adaptations, the audience member must fill in the blanks around character development and the story's premise; there is insufficient screen time to do these justice.Latent Nuances:
The most brilliant parts of this movie are actually between the lines, so you'd have to listen to the dialogue carefully to discover and enjoy the hidden nuance.Intelligent:
Intelligence is the ability to create abstractions for the information coming your way. Refine those abstractions and finally project your conclusive abstraction back into the real world. The most intelligent minds never cease the intellectual process of continuously refining their abstractions of real world entities and concepts.Intelligent people never simply accept any piece of information told to them. They will challenge, assess and re-assess every bit of information; always looking for a more beautiful pattern that explains an enormous and complex deluge of information in a simple model.How far is too far?:
The author, Orson Scott Card, has written a book that presents numerous instances of the protagonist's asking himself the same question over and over again: Have I gone far enough or have I gone too far? The author does not provide an answer, it is left to the audience to reflect on this philosophically.Intelligent Brute?!Perhaps the biggest underlying question in this movie is whether it is possible to have an intelligent brute. Unintelligent people, function with flawed assumptions, flawed interpretations, and flawed perception. It is entirely too easy for such people to be unwitting brutes. If the outcome of their decision is viscerally gratifying, then they think their modus operandi is right. Consequently, with no self- intellectual and moral compass, unintelligent people frequently set a vicious route towards their goal.Intelligent people, on the other hand, are least bothered by outcomes. It is their abstractions that speak to them and their inner-critic that censures or rewards them. Consequently, unless an intelligent person is a psychopath, he will be kind in his modus operandi.Intelligent brute does sounds like an oxymoron, which is delves upon in considerable depth in this movie.Will the Real Enemy please stand up?The real enemy is, more often than not, found in the mirror. It's all very well to know how to fight; but do you know who to fight? The movie repeatedly explores this topic as well.Conclusion: Watch the movie; you'll probably watch it many times.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

It is not but that's not a bad thing because it's a character and story focused film. It doesn't go for too long, you aren't bored, and want to see how it ends. I was satisfied.The visuals of this film are great. I particularly enjoyed the zero G room used for the launchies' training exercises. In the future I suggest this be made available for recreation as it looks like a lot of fun. Also worth praising is how battles are shown from the holographic screens which zoom, tilt and pan to give ender the best view possible. It's almost like a video game except I asked 'how can he view battles like this'. Because surely in the heat of battle any drone cameras would be destroyed. But this is a minor grievance of how realistic viewing battles this way would be.All the cast suited their roles except for Ben Kingsley. The could've chosen Temuera Morrison who is a Maori and looks like a soldier for example. But he was in the new star wars trilogy which is why I think he was overlooked. Furthermore his character claims to be ender's enemy during training however he is actually another mentor of Ender's. A mismatch in dialogue and execution I think.At the end I had questions and got locked into discussion all the way home. I thought about events and occurrences not making sense or weren't explained properly. I thought about what I would do in Ender's situation. I thought about what was real and what wasn't. I lastly thought about the last scene and saying 'that isn't believable'. I thought and talking about a lot, but my friends and I agreed; this is a good but not great film yet entertaining nonetheless.I went we read the book and the second book Speaker for the Dead. If Ender's Game was not filmable then Speaker of the Dead is as likely as pigs flying. I also read the author does not want it made into a film.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

When I first read the book at the age of 12, I immediately fell in love with it and it has remained my favorite novel of all time—nothing has come close to usurping its position in my mind as the greatest work of man ever conceived. Now that my obvious bias is out of the way, let's get on to the review.I had fairly high expectations for the movie, considering how I felt about the source material. I felt it would be a triumph, one of the sleeper hits of the year; my enthusiasm for the film stemmed mostly from the trailers and advertisements I had seen, as well as several of the positive reviews I had read. However, while I feel the movie deserves a mostly positive review, I must admit I am at least slightly disappointed.First, the good: The movie looks gorgeous; the CGI is flawless and the costumes, sets, and overall atmosphere are well realized. This is a polished production worthy of the Enderverse tag. I felt the acting was also quite good. I was worried Harrison Ford might come across as too gruff and wooden, but he actually delivers in one his best roles since well, forever. Asa Butterfield does a commendable job as Ender. And despite her limited screen time, Viola Davis is excellent as Major Anderson, providing a much needed counterbalance to Ford's Colonel Graff.The movie chugs along at an incredible pace; I did not feel bored once. I've read some reviews that described those having read the book being able to ""fill in the gaps"" about the back story when watching the movie. While I was certainly able to do this, I would have appreciated it more had I been able to see it on the screen.Now, the bad: The movie is much too short. An additional 30 to 45 minutes running time is sorely needed for character development and plot. The movie falls flat in delivering the psychological and emotional goods that made the book so amazing. For instance, the brilliance of Ender during the battle scenes is seriously understated in the movie, and during Ender's final test, the gathered crowd politely claps when they should be on their knees and bawling their eyes out.I don't agree with Orson Scott Card's political views, but that was a moot point when it came time for me to decide whether to see the movie or not. Here was my favorite book of all time being converted to the big screen and I absolutely had to see it. Besides, I've recently read OSC won't make any money from the movie, so all of you kids boycotting this film should see it for the cinematic piece of art it is.Those of you who have already read the book and enjoyed it will undoubtedly see it. Those of you who enjoy sci-fi should also go see it. To everyone else, it might be best to spend your money elsewhere.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not bad, but should've been two movies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2899681/?ref_=tt_urv","DarthPaul85","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3118126/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2013","This was a decent movie- the acting was great (especially for kid actors), the script was sound, and the ending hits the right notes. That said, it was also a flawed movie, and I'm somewhat disappointed this film will settle for being ""good"" when the book was so great. This review is from the perspective of someone who read the book- those who haven't read it might feel differently, but here's what I thought.PRO's: The casting, the sets, and costumes. First and foremost, the casting and acting in this film are its best assets. Ender (Asa) is perfect, exactly how I wanted him to be. Gaff (Harrison) is also terrific. This is the most fun I've had watching Harrison Ford in a long time. That said, there were some scenes, some lines that I thought should have been more emphasized. Bean, Valentine, Bonzo, and Bernard are the others who will leave an good impression...even if they change some things from the book.Next, the sets and costumes- again, nearly perfect. Loved the school uniforms and the corridors. The battle room and spaceships are also very well realized- and more or less make the story feel real. The special effects in general are good, but it's so hard to create original special effects these days, so not much really stood out to me (except the zero gravity scenes).CON's: Rushed story, some unimpressive choreography.First my minor gripe- the space choreography and battle room scenes left me unimpressed. The battle room scenes especially kind of let me down- they seems a touch over-simplified, and don't show Ender's genius as well as they do in the book. Another minor gripe- didn't care much for how the aliens looked. It was another run-of-the-mill bug-alien design- seen it before, didn't leave an impression.My major gripe is that the movie moves WAY too fast. Things happen so quickly, they often feel ""too easy"" or insignificant. The whole video game subplot is done in about two scenes. Those scenes in the book are really stretched out, and we see how they torture Ender and wear him down there. But here it's over almost as soon as it begins. Similarly, Ender's progress through the school happens so quickly that we never feel like he's being pushed *that* hard. If Ender isn't really suffering, we don't really care. You could argue that the key events of the story are still there, and that's true- but the book is more about Ender as a person than the war going on in space. And of all the secondary characters, only Gaff and Bonzo are given decent development in the movie- everyone else is clearly there to fill a gap in the story progression (a real shame, since in the book everyone interacted with Ender organically, and nobody felt like a contrived ""device.""). Even Valentine, for all Abigale's effort, resorts to being a fairly simple character- not like the conflicted, emotional yet brilliant person she was in the book. And lastly, Peter is hardly in the movie at all. I suppose if it's from Ender's point of view that makes sense, but we don't get any sense of Peter's twisted genius here- a true loss.So in conclusion, if the same production values could have focused on two movies instead of one, we would have a true work of art here- a film on the level of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Instead, we get a rushed version of a great story- which results in a pretty good movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm a fan of big-budget sci-fi and alien invasion movies in general, so was hoping for an 'us versus them' kind of vibe.I haven't read the book, so perhaps anyone who has will already know what I found out namely that the film is basically all about Ender who's training to fight a second (alleged) alien attack on Earth. And train he does. About 75% of the film is about him in a sort of space school/boot camp. He doesn't do that much fighting of aliens.Apparently we (Earth) need kids to fight for us. This is because er we just do, okay? Moving on And, while these wonderkids are preparing to take on every last intergalactic nasty, they spend their time being bullied. Ender gets bullied at his school on Earth. Then he goes home to his family to be bullied by his older brother. Finally, when he makes it to boot camp he's bullied there, too. And, when he shines out among his peers he's then elevated to a squad of cadets including the biggest (or should I say 'smallest?') bully ever to grace the screen.This film is rated '12' here in the UK and I reckon that if I was still a twelve-year-old boy then I would have loved it. Sadly, I'm an adult now and found it all a little boring.But, it's not all so bad. This boy who plays Ender does a really good job and will doubtless grow up to become a pretty big name in Hollywood. Plus you have Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley – both of which turn in typically excellent performances.Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure it'll find an audience somewhere. Now I just need to know where I can play 'zero gravity Quasar' – I may not be twelve any more, but that looks like serious fun!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Lots of movies have to be changed a bit because there is just too much to fit in one movie, but they didn't just change a little bit. I ended up leaving before the end of the movie because It was so bad. In the book, you cared about Ender and all that was done to him, but in the movie, there was no reason to feel anything for him. They took several years of battle school and condensed it to just a couple of days, changed things that didn't need to be changed. If you didn't read the book, it would make absolutely no sense and if you did read it, it would just make you angry that they would butcher it so bad. The actors were good choices and they did a good job, but the story just sucked big time.","46 out of 99 found this helpful.

In this movie Earth was attacked by aliens and although Earthicans won the battle for the planet they want to ensure that they are never attacked again. To that end, Earthlings have been training child soldiers all the while searching for the one that will lead all Earthians to annihilate the aliens once and for all. Ender seems to be just the one that they've been looking for but can he deliver?The movie is based upon a book written in 1983 by Orson Scott Card. I read the book, and even though there are some deviations from the source material, they adapted it pretty well for the big screen. The director did a nice job bringing to life the events depicted in the book but he didn't do much for the acting. The acting in this movie is atrocious even if they were kids.

Many say the movie is awful, in comparison to the novel, and are also boycotting it because of Orson Scott Card's opposition to gay marriage, and homosexuality in general. I didn't know about this controversy either, but it's obviously a difficult issue to resolve: can we separate the author from its work? And since the movie isn't exactly/only Card's work, should we boycott it? And since nobody seems to have boycotted the books, wouldn't boycotting the movie be hypocritical? Finally, since the movie doesn't deal with homosexuality at all, wouldn't the boycott be pointless? I'm absolutely for gay rights and marriage, but I don't think it's reasonable to boycott this movie.In the future, Earth was attacked by an alien race known as Formics, and it was saved only thanks to the International Fleet Commander, Mazer Rackham's sacrifice during battle. After the aliens were driven away, the International Military started training the best children on the planet for the (supposed) next Formic attack. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited, one evening, by the prestigious Battle School, where he starts training with other children and young adults, under the ever-watching eyes of Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis), a gentle soul who seems to be the only person to consider the recruits what they are – just children.I should start by saying that the trailer for this movie is one of the worst ever: it makes you want to just skip this movie, and it makes the movie itself look awful and boring. The only positive thing it does to you is that, when you actually see the movie, you're pleasantly surprised. Ender's Game deals with tough topics, like violence, relationships among people, war and human psychology. Ender doesn't think it makes any sense to attack the Formics if they are not attacking Earth, and yet keeps on kicking people after he's won the fight with them and they are just lying on the floor – 'to prevent them from attacking again'. He's constantly reminded of this contradiction by the ruthless Colonel Graff and often fights him because of his views on war. The movie has managed to explore this topic in a very good way, which should be praised: it's not just another pointless Sci-Fi, and it's not for children (only).The main character is played by Asa Butterfield, whom you might remember as the character Hugo in the extremely successful movie of the same name. Here, he delivers another great performance and carries the whole story masterfully. Harrison Ford is a very good sometimes-antagonist, and can be truly difficult to take sides when his and Asa's characters fight. It's also interesting to get Viola Davis' character's view on the whole thing – as I said before, she sees the recruits as just children who can't psychologically take the war, and often confronts Colonel Graff about this. The CGI is excellent in this movie, but the thing that I liked the most is that the movie isn't CGI-focused. Most of it happens inside a space ship, and the few views of space and Earth that we get are wonderful. The only downside of the movie happens in the end, but there's no point in spoiling that. All in all, Ender's Game is a movie that will satisfy your need for a smart Sci-Fi, if you decide to see it.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

While the big plot points are shown, some of the underlying pieces that also made the novel so fun are left off. Additionally, the movie draws upon the sequels for some of its scenes - notably the epilogue.This doesn't necessarily detract from the movie, however. The movie generally flows. While it easily could have been lengthened to incorporate some of the more subtle points, there is already a popular book currently being lengthened beyond reason. Removing some of the points, however, does make the movie a bit darker.For example, none of the interplay between the Battle School teams are shown. That interplay was key in making the school seem like a specialized high school. Instead, a serious tone is taken with a constant reminder and fear of the Buggers (who are never called as such in the movie).Fans of the book, however, will be able to enjoy the Battle Room scenes. These are absolutely stellar! The advancement in depicting Zero-G is really coming forth this year and Ender's Game is an excellent example of doing that.Those viewers who are unfamiliar with the novels, should be able to follow the story. At its core, its fairly simplistic. The Earth is training highly intelligent children to be the commander of the next fleet that will launch a pre-emptive attack on an alien race that previously invaded Earth.Other more complex themes, however, such as the use of children for this role, are barely touched. Nor are the happenings on Earth, depicted in the novel through the words of Ender's siblings, ever shown. Such societal commentary is left off to focus on the plot.Fans of the book should not hesitate to see it but should be prepared to feel that something is missing. Viewers utterly unfamiliar with the book can still enjoy the movie but it does not come close to being what it could be.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Little bit like Starship Trooopers or Blade Runner. Beneath a beautiful skin there is a strong social criticism story. You may notice it or you may watch the whole movie as a beautiful sci-fi story. You may see the story as a criticism against USA:s policy to defend itself with prevention strike against anyone if they think to be threatened. In the movie almost fascist like society has tame their youth to make prevention strike without any criticism. They defend strikes justification for their youth just because enemy will strike if they don't strike first. Young Ender's dares to rise against authority and mistrusts that. Ender's Game has a great story to tell, but it is also beautiful to watch. It feels like 3D movie despite it is not. Space landscapes and -fights are gorgeous. It is always a risk to put a child to a leading role at a movie, but Asa Butterfield is a great choice for Ender's role. There is enough of sensitivity, yet enough character in his role. Harrison Ford is great as a General Graff. It is hard to believe that he is over 70 years old. Only thing which bother here is that movie feels to end too soon. It feels like it is a big budget Television show pilot movie. We will see if Ender's Game gets enough audience for a sequel. That really is needed. The great story may just to be a little too clever to its target audience. Visually stunning movie, which is have to watch from a big screen.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/enders-game-2013/","17 out of 30 found this helpful.

This movie also touch base on the topic of bullying and survival, which is prevalent now in this country's school. It's important to know that the only way to battle bullying is to stand up for it, not to be a bystander to watch bullying happening. I read this book long time ago, and I never could picture how the zero G battle room should look like. This film literally brought the book alive with excellent special effects, and great acting by Harrison Ford, Asa Butterfield and Viola Davis! And I love the humor from Bean.

It was a great great great story! Even though it was hard to compress a whole book into a 2-hour film, I still felt the depth of the original book, even deeper and more profound I would assume. It was so good my soul was melted in that world. Story! Story! Story! Story is always the number one thing of a movie, all the other things like cinematography, art design, visual effects, even acting can all be secondary, but story can not. Without a good story, the film means nothing! (However, Asa Butterfield's acting was spectacular. Even just a few seconds close-up on his eyes, he was able to express so much information and emotions. Bravo!) I do not see this movie as sci-fi. The whole communicating-with-aliens part was cheesy and even laughable. I think this is a story about humanity and questioning the morality of the universe. Should we change the rules? because the rules do not apply anymore when it comes to a whole another world. Then, what is ""right""? what is ""wrong""? Or, does it even matter anymore? Great movie. And yes, please watch it on IMAX.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

No, for sure, there can be very exciting movies with such a premise, and the original novel was probably not so bad since it won Nebula. But the film itself was rather underwhelming.Yes, there are a couple of twists, but they don't strike as something original let alone shocking. Of course, the viewers nowadays are used to the most mind-blowing, convoluted plots, and still, there could be more. Moreover, it is hard to root for the main hero. It is a cruel thing to say, but again, the viewers nowadays expect the heroes of sci-fi movies to experience much more suffering and angst. Ender, on the contrary, has caring parents and sister. Usually, a dramatic conflict would be created if parents treat the hero harshly if he fails their expectations , but even when Ender is expelled, he is supported by his parents and by no means insulted by them. From Ender's relatives, only the elder brother is a bad guy, and his character is rather underused no matter how often Ender compares himself to Peter. And, although Ender is often bullied by other cadets, they stand no chance against him.Even solid performances by such titans as Ben Kingsley and Harrison Ford can't make this adventure memorable. The message is right, and the execution is diligent, but somehow it leaves the feeling that not really much has happened here. Also, to feel more compassion for all the victims of this cruel game, one probably needed to know them better, and definitely more build-up was necessary.The most sweet and compelling thing in this movie was Valentine, Ender's sister. It is just such a pity she was not given enough screen time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The stuff with the monitor.The 'drill sergeant' scenes with Dap are where the movie started to lose me. They were just too much of a cliché, and not very intelligent.The battle room visualization was pretty cool. Kind of beautiful, actually. Not much time was spent on strategy, but that was a little vague in the book also, to be honest.Strangely, Harrison Ford's Hyram Graff seemed like a bit of a weak link. Bad writing and direction, maybe. His speeches seem just a little too speechy and on the nose. He's also present just a little too much in the movie, whereas in the book it's driven home that he's a somewhat aloof top-level administrator, rather than someone whom the boys see around every single day.The relationships among the different Battle School cadets all got pretty garbled, but that's natural when you consider the challenge of condensing all that stuff into one movie.I don't know why they made Bonzo such a little guy. He was supposed to be big and scary in the book -- a lethal threat despite being unarmed.I like what they did with Ender's fantasy computer game. Maybe a plot hole here and there, but they condensed that whole plot line in sort of a neat, creative way.He's in the movie for like five minutes maybe, but Kingsley as Mazer Rackham was a fun bit of casting.The spaceship battle scenes are very pretty! Big payoff there.All in all, I'm not quite sure why this movie did so poorly. I can think of a few points where they could have made the dialogue a little less ridiculous, but I don't know if that's the real problem. The book is popular as heck, so I would have thought that would have driven box office receipts a little more. Obviously the studio made the same bet, and lost. Certainly the special effects were nice, but maybe it fell into a weird no man's land by being not sexy enough for some adult audiences, without being a particularly suitable movie for children, either.Anyway, I'm glad I managed to see it before it left the big screen altogether, which happened sooner than I might have expected.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ignore all the trolls on IMDB who are ""boycotting"" this film because of Orson Scott Card's political views, as the film (and the book it's based on, which I highly recommend) have literally nothing to do with them. If you live near an IMAX you should definitely see it in that format. (It's worth the price despite not being in 3D) The scenes in the Battle Room, the space battles, and every scene on the ship cannot be seen in their entirety without IMAX. (Meaning you don't see the whole set in a regular format. IMAX has wider view.) The battles among the kids are just amazing, the inner conflict with Ender is well written, and the ending has a great message that will unfortunately leave you hanging and waiting for the sequel. Asa Butterfield personally would not have been my choice for Ender, but he did pretty well. And if you think Harisson Ford and Ben Kingsley are too old to act, think again!

The acting was top notch.There is a segment in the middle, where Ender unintentionally nearly kills Bonzo and he quits and goes back to Earth. His sister is brought to talk him into going back, and she basically tells him he's a coward. This seems incredibly convenient logic, because Ender is quite clearly suffering an emotional breakdown, and it has nothing to do with cowardice. This is far deeper than that, but it does at least presage things to come.The FX were quite solid, but I really liked the way technology was depicted. Specifically, in the final battle, the way Ender uses his hands to control a massive monitor is impressive and feels very real.As an acting nitpick- late in the film, Ender breaks down crying, which is fine, but the way Butterfield's voice cracks on the line ""you lied""... yes he's a kid, but that's really going to rub males the wrong way. Males, being like 80%+ of the target market for this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Andrew Wiggin (nicknamed Ender) was the youngest of three siblings, an elder brother Peter who hates him and a sister Valentine who is very devoted to him. Ender was recruited by Coronel Graff when he was observed to have the requisite temperament and leadership potential. He defied all the odds stacked against him by his wits and cunning, and finally being able to successfully destroy his targets in the ultimate simulation test. But he finds out that he has done more than the game he thought he was playing.Lead star Asa Butterfield has grown up taller since his role two years ago in the Oscar-nominated film Hugo under Martin Scorsese. It is impressive that he has these two big films in a row, both with him playing the title role. He is obviously older than the book Ender (by 10 years!), but he was still able to show the vulnerability of this character underneath his military tactical genius. The rest of the cast are an impressive mix of Academy-Award winning or nominated actors. Harrison Ford (nominated for Witness in 1986) energetically plays gruff Coronel Graff. Viola Davis (nominated for The Help in 2011) plays Graff's assistant Maj. Gwen Anderson. Hailee Steinfeld (nominated for True Grit in 2010) plays Ender's training pal Petra. Abigail Breslin (nominated for Little Miss Sunshine in 2006) plays Ender's loving sister Valentine. And finally Ben Kingsley (won for Gandhi in 1982) plays Mazer Rackham, savior of the human race in the second alien attack, who also became Ender's mentor.This film is based on the first novel of what would be a series of five books by Orson Scott Card, aimed for the teenage-young adult crowd. The book contained a lot of psychological analysis of children and violence that underlie the action, which the movie cannot possibly completely convey. The book also had much younger characters than what was shown on screen, like Ender was supposed to have been six years old only. The film nevertheless was a faithful enough adaptation, albeit rushed in parts in the name of cinematic license. It was able to bring to life the action in the training hall and the zero-gravity simulation rooms that would of course rely on the reader's imagination in the book.The film's casting of short and hook-nosed Moises Arias as Bonzo Madrid is also puzzling, since the book describes Ender's tormentor in Battle School to be ""a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage."" Arias is nothing like that physically at all, but the contrast of his Bonzo with Asa's Ender was strikingly ironic.I found it strange that a movie about a devastating alien race never actually shows anything scary about these monsters or what they were supposed to have destroyed on Earth in the past. Instead we see a seemingly gentle and graceful leaf-like insect creature, so as the audience, we are not completely convinced about Ender's mission or Graff's true intentions. So, ""Ender's Game"" is good enough as a sci-fi movie with young adult characters in the lead. For me though, the whole film, even with its spectacular special effects, feels strangely generic, and an amalgam of various similar movies in the past. Maybe I am just not its proper target demographic. 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I've watched it 3 times without the book to refer to and can't find anything wanting; not the excellent cast, direction, production design, or compelling story. It stands alongside Pacific Rim and Oblivion as one of the trio of overshadowed summer sci-fi films whose unexpected pleasures will make them favorites to the people who give them a chance on DVD. From the fan outcry I take it Ender's Game fails to deliver whatever fans found in the books and has been watered down on its way to the screen. We all know than adapting a book to a movie is a matter of translating one form to another in the same way that raw wheat needs to be processed if it is to become a cake. Different forms have different requirements and, taken on its own terms, Ender's Game is an excellent film which will have special meaning to young people who can identify with Ender's struggles, hardships, the isolation of school, the expectations of others, bullying, gaming and his own violent temper. Interestingly, other books which were changed in order to be filmed include Blade Runner, 2001:, The Hunger Games, all Harry Potter books, all Shakespeare's works, The Lord Of The Rings books, the James Bond series, Dune, 2000 Leagues Under The Sea, Pinocchio, The Wizard Of Oz, The DaVinci Code and thousands more - many of them became classics just as I predict Ender's Game The Movie will.

The CG effects usage in the entire film are nice, and not too much. While we can expect some decent acting skill from Asa Butterfield, a 16-year-old child.

"8","/10","A Surprisingly Deeply Emotive and Substantive Sci Fi Action Thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4586577/?ref_=tt_urv","tabuno","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0972645/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2019","31 October 2013. Curiously enough Starship Troopers (1997) and Star Trek (2009) have similar parallels in plot outline and action sequences, yet with a huge difference. The dichotomy between even younger cadet students, the focus on younger, more pliable, but creative, out of the box minds and the older, aging generation of warriors offers a fascinating psychological and moralistic interplay. The emotive and deeper substantive emotive and philosophical, humanistic issues at play here provide a much more solid and meaningful foundation making this movie pertinent and relevant to a mass audience.Three minor weaknesses appear in this movie that don't really diminish the overall impact of the quality of this movie: Below average set designs and special effects especially at the beginning of the movie, the less than convincing training of the Dragon Team, and less than emotionally compelling and appealing huge change of Ender's mind in the movie. However, there is a wonderfully interesting and strangely emotionally riveting shot of a world in transformation at the end of the movie that speaks powerfully, much more than a transformative planet scene from an earlier Star Trek movie.Ender's persona is one of the most fascinating to be presented on screen and depending one's perspective this maudlin and politically correct movie or perceptively astute middle way movie that contains an especially sharp edge to both its violence and compassion, usually lacking in most action, adventure movies and reserved for theatrical dramas for the screen. When Orson Scott Card wrote the original novel upon which this movie was based in 1985, it was among the leading edge of sci fi and the fusion of creative ideas of space warfare and alien communication (or perhaps the ""apparent"" lack of it) taken from this book and incorporated into this movie remain fresh and excitingly potent.There is a unique sci fi bench mark set in this movie in terms of sci fi psychology and the human psyche as The Matrix (1999) set in terms of virtual reality and Avatar (2009) and Inception (2010) in terms of visual effects or even Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) in terms of a revealing hard core sci fi alien plot element. Ender's Game might be compared to the youthful version of Gerard Butler's Gamers (2009), a hard-edged futuristic, high-tech, new wave sci fi movie, some resemblance to a less hard-hitting 2002 sci fi movie adapted from the classic juvenile book A Wrinkle In Time or a sci fi version of the parallel fantasy movies The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) which is also based on C.S. Lewis books which focus on deeper humanistic issues.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Whilst some question whether Ender is up to the task, Colonel Graff sees potential in Ender and is determined that Ender will be the next best thing regardless of the costs...The first half of this film focuses on Ender's training and how he gels with his unit; predictably his journey to leadership is met with cynicism and spectism by some of his colleagues, but eventually this leads to acceptance when the team start to see some of Ender's leadership skills. Naturally, Ender's journey isn't plain sailing and his recruitment process causes a lot of physical and emotional strain on his person. As shown throughout this film it is when Ender's fight or flight instincts kick in that he is at his most devastating, but the Military see this as an advantage and a strength in that he can overcome and destroy anything or anyone that crosses his path which is a vital characteristic for warfare.Whilst there's a lot of positivites to take from Ender's recruitment and training journey it's when you see things from behind closed doors that a slightly darker picture begins to emerge; as with many people who are recruited and trained by government agencies the people they recruit are 'assets' and are therefore expendable. Graff for example is an atypical high-ranking official whom is so obsessed by war and the events that happened 50 years ago that his judgment becomes clouded and he sees war as being the only option and fails to think outside the box. This is given a cruel twist at the end in what I can only describe as a 'reverse-placebo effect' which leaves poor Ender devastated.The acting is good; moreso from the younger actors such as Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld - although everyone does their bit. The visuals and special-effects are top notch. The only things that lets the film down slightly is the direction which was a bit sluggish, the script was also a bit dry and the ending was a bit abrupt.Despite some notable weaknesses, Ender's Game is well-acted, contains some nice visuals and also has some interesting themes and ideology in how some people are affected by preparing for warfare (although this has been covered better in other films). Still it's worth a look - just don't set your expectations too high.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I saw this movie 9 years after its launch so I knew it wasn't going to be great.What I wasn't expecting was how true to the book it was. They really captured a lot of the visuals in a way that convinced me that this was made by somebody who also enjoyed the source material immensely.BUT, when transferring novels into films, it can be a detriment. This movie tried packing in every major aspect and so many minor ones that it forgot to tell a cohesive story or do deep dives on pretty much any secondary character or singular element of the book.In this sense, watching the movie felt more like thumbing through a set of vacation photos: ""Remember the cafeteria leaderboard? Remember Graff's layered relationship with Ender? Remember that weird game he played on his tablet? Remember when he met/showed up/interacted with this or that character?""So 5 stars go to really staying true to the source for fans. -5 for ignoring folks whose only knowledge of this sci-fi mainstay comes from watching this movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

You can see it below. What's different? My daughter gave me a copy of the book. This movie never made any sense until I read the book. If you are a sci-fi fan, maybe you are familiar with Dune. That was another great book made into a good (not great) movie. If you saw the movie Dune without reading the book, all the nuance was gone. Same with Ender's Game. If you like sci-fi, read the book by Orson Scott Card first. The movie doesn't work unless you've read the book. Otherwise, I stand by my review below. I ignored the bad reviews. How bad could a movie starring Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley be? The answer is...barely watchable.I haven't read the books. However, if you are going to have young children star in a movie with violence, you need more adult supervision. I hope this isn't a spoiler, but by putting kids in total control of a planetary defense system during an intergalactic war you strain the boundaries of credibility. The kids are all interesting, but not that much. There are literally dozens of moments that don't feel right, are unbelievable or insult your intelligence so much that you cannot give yourself to the storyline. Harry Potter always had adults guiding him. They didn't make Harry the headmaster of Hogwarts when he was 11 years old.The special effects are good. There are many plot devices that almost work. Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley are outstanding as always. You keep hoping that the movie will become intelligent and redeem itself. Unfortunately, the ending goes in the opposite direction. How many good movies end with the audience thinking ""Bullshit!""? You'll end up wondering why they spent $110,000,000 without putting it in front of a focus group.If you can watch it for free and lower your expectations to ground level, there are many good moments in this film. Just prepare to be disappointed at the end.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It stars 16-year-old Asa Butterfield (of 'HUGO' fame) as a genius military student recruited to save mankind from an alien army. Gavin Hood (who also directed movies like 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE' and 'RENDITION') wrote and directed the film. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld (of 2010's 'TRUE GRIT' fame), Abigail Breslin, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley. It's not nearly as good as a lot of the hype it's been getting but it is a decent sci-fi youth book adaption film and it's nice to see Ford in this type of role again.The film is set in the distant future after Earth is invaded by an alien race called formics. A young pilot saved the human race by apparently sacrificing himself and stopping their deadly attack. Now mankind depends on their youth to prevent future attacks, and stop the formics, by training young teens to be violent and brilliant soldiers. Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) is one such hopeful savior and has become Earth's last hope. He's recruited and trained by Colonel Graff (Ford), who sees great potential in him.The film is supposed to launch a new series (following the multiple books) but has been negatively criticized for it's justification of violence and it's author's bigoted views (that he's recently made public). A boycott of the film has been promoted by those offended by Card's hateful vocal viewpoints and other's associated with the film (like Ford) have distanced themselves from the author. The guy seems like an ass but, like with all art, you can't judge a person's work by their personality or personal actions. Mel Gibson still makes good films and gives likable performances despite his disrespectful behavior (so do filmmakers like Roman Polanski). I don't know how good the book is but I enjoyed the movie. In some ways it seems to justify violence but it also seems to take a strong anti-war standpoint (by the film's end). I don't know if the book does this as well but I'm pretty sure the point of the movie was that resorting to violence (without looking for other, better, solutions) is wrong. Ford and Butterfield are great in the film and the visuals are spectacular. It's a little slow and uninvolving at times but not a bad sci-fi flick by any means.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Knowing this was based on the first of a series of novels, what I watched was good enough to be nearly entirely enthralled by. Certainly, veterans Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley give their roles some depth as officers knowing what needs to be done. The teens that dominate are well-chosen. The ongoing score was good at moving things along. I also enjoyed feeling some of the sound effects at the bottom of my seat. And the twist at the end was compellingly dramatic. So on that note, I recommend Ender's Game.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

More science fiction films are being released. That's a very good thing because people like science fiction and a representation of a progressive future. In the future of Ender's Game Andrew Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to win the next great war between the human race and an alien species called the Formics. Wiggin is a brilliant misfit with the right balance of killer instincts and compassion. Butterfield delivers a good performance but, most importantly, makes his character sympathetic. His performance gives the film some much needed soul. He had also done admirable work when he played Hugo Cabret in Hugo (2011). Hailee Steinfeld, playing Petra Arkanian, is another standout in the cast. Her scenes with Butterfield in Battle School are exciting. The simulated war games in an impressive zero-gravity training room could have dragged, but director Gavin Hood managed to make these scenes some of the most entertaining in the film. Hood should also be commended for making an efficient film from a weak screenplay. The film isn't really inspired but with a $110 million budget and a good cast it works surprisingly well. The generally excellent special effects create a visually interesting future world both in space and on Earth. Wiggin's scenes with his sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) are handled well too. It's in the performances of the adult actors where the screenplay clearly shows its weakness. Viola Davis, playing Gwen Anderson, has little to do except look worried while Wiggin deals with one challenge after another. Harrison Ford, playing Hyrum Graff, brings his usual authority to his role but awkwardly alternates between caring and uncaring. Still, the film wins in terms of adapting the very complicated novel by Orson Scott Card. It doesn't have the same emotional impact as the novel though. Ender's Game isn't only for a young audience because it doesn't whitewash politics and war. Adults will enjoy this futuristic action film too. I recommend it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The epic, about genius children being humanity's last military hope for salvation, falls far short of the multi-layered emotional and psychological story and depth of the literary source.From the very beginning of the film it becomes painfully apparent that even characters as key to the story as Peter and Valentine, Ender's older siblings, will be incredibly glossed over, getting screen time of perhaps just 3-4 minutes. Even characters like Bean (who spawns his own novel), Petra, and Ender's other friends and subordinates have, apparently, no importance in the story or apparent affect on any of the events that occur. Because of the deflation of characters the depth and backstory of the film suffers to an insurmountable degree.It can't be denied that the visuals and CG are awesome; the acting is great, good enough that it can't even be compared to 'child-acting;' the moody soundtrack is effective; it serves as a most valiant effort.However there is too much that's wrong to consider the film a worthy adaptation. Gavin Hood, director, has served the film on a platter, coddling the audience, grabbing their hand and tugging them along through the story with voice-overs and a dumbed down story. Hood has cut out so much character development from a story with as many psychological and emotional layers that it could be compared to a Kafkaesque Inception that it becomes increasingly obvious as the film plods along that more care was given for the appearance than for the story itself. It seems that the benefit of having original source material was taken for granted, apparently a common fault for film adaptations.Just as an example of the thoughtless of the story, let's take a look at the set-up of the computer simulations in Command School. In the book it seems that Ender, along with his subordinates, has a control console with which to directly command ships as well as view the battle as he'd like, meaning that Ender could manually command a single carrier ship or view the battle as a whole. In the film Ender is sans console, having something that is instead more of a command podium. Ender has no manual controls, only having hand controls in real space with which to alter the view of the simulation. By necessity, because of his lack of manual control, Ender cannot directly command a single vessel, but must, by definition of this set-up, delegate to his subordinates. Unfortunately Hood has the gall to leave in a scene following a failed mission where Graff berates Ender for focusing too heavily on singular ships, instructing him to delegate more to his toon leaders, whereas this mistaken director somehow has the nerve to reduce the size of a Battleschool army from 41 to 16, a massive oversight and huge depletion of possible development.While the film would no-doubt be a standalone film of notable entertainment and mediocre merit it utterly fails as an adaptation. The barely 110 minute film will eternally serve as Gavin Hood's ""The Last Airbender.""","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I liked the way That Asa used the most powerful quotes in the book, in the film because it made the film more interesting if you have read the book. Although they did miss a few i think vital parts out from the book but otherwise i think it was as close to the book as you are aloud to get.In terms of the casting i reckon that they were all really well thought out. Having Haillee Steinfeld as Petra made the film better as in my opinion she is an amazing actress. also having Moises Arias as Bonzo was amazing as he really caught the violence personality that Bonzo has in the book. Overall it was a film to definitely see i strongly recommend it.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

It just didn't feel right for me and I wasn't convinced at all. The supposedly smart moments and training scenes to justify Enders so called super qualities to make him ""the one"" are average at most if not trivial. The only aspect where this movie shines are the CGI special effects, which you can see in... the trailer. I am a SF and special effects fan but I will give this one just an average overall with a 6/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is a principled man with character, integrity and passion - he has a strong sense of compassion as well as justice.The density of ideas in his novels is right up there with Philip K.

The term was just randomly thrown out there. Hood should have let Ender explain who Peter and Valentine are. The book is in the mindset of Ender, but the movie takes that relationship out.

The Formics are an alien race that attacked Earth, but because of the heroic actions of Commander Mazer Rackham in the midst of a seemingly hopeless battle, the Formics were defeated.Decades later, the International Military is bracing for what they believe is another inevitable invasion from the Formics.Recognizing their earlier victory was the result of some brilliant but unorthodox tactics, the IM has turned their attentions to their best hope for capturing lightning in a bottle twice: children. The brightest are identified in grade school, and their activities and thought processes are monitored with a chip in the base of the neck.The most apparently gifted strategically are recruited to Battle School, an orbiting space station with an enormous, zero-gravity battle room where increasingly difficult war games are played.This is the window through which we first see Andrew Ender Wiggin. He is a strategical prodigy, showing flashes of brilliance from a very early age, consequently arousing the general interest of the IM, and specifically the interest of Colonel Graff.Ender is also painfully shy and introspective, and is often bullied, first at home (by an abusive older brother, Peter) and also at school.His sister, Valentine, is closest to Ender, and her compassion for her brother sustains him at times when he feels most alone. Although naturally gifted in tactical thinking, it is from his siblings that he learns how to sympathize and empathize with his enemy, as well as how to destroy them with ferocity and finality.Colonel Graff ultimately drafts young Ender into Battle School, and a new round of physical and mental abuse begins for the recruit as he learns to navigate the complicated, confusing minefield of power and politics that is innate in the military.Graff is convinced that Ender is the one who can ultimately lead their forces to victory against the Formics, while Major Anderson has her doubts about his readiness.As the impending conflict looms, Ender and his adolescent army are pushed beyond reasonable limits to prepare for war against an enemy they barely understand, and the fate of the world rests in the hands of a child.If I have any real complaints about the way the story unfolds on the screen, it's that the movie seems to have two consecutive endings, and the first one takes a little bit of the oomph out of the second one. Without revealing anything, I can only say that I wish that the two significant plot points had been better amalgamated.Colonel Graff is played with steely-eyed finesse by Harrison Ford. Asa Butterfield plays young Ender, and his skinny frame and doe-eyed face belie his true age.In the book, Ender is younger, but excellent casting of the other students and cadets make Butterfield feel smaller and more vulnerable than his actual years. Ford and Butterfield have a rare and complicated chemistry on screen, and volumes are communicated between them with a sparsity of words.Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley give stellar, supporting performances, but then again, they always do. Nonso Anozie is a very imposing Sergeant Dap, with a fleeting smile behind his eyes that is at once charming and disarming.One might assume that this is a movie about a futuristic war in outer space, about alien armies and rocket ships and laser beams; one would be wrong.This is a movie about a boy. It just so happens that he has grown up in a world on the brink of interstellar war, a conflict that he has been sucked into through no fault of his own. This is a story about relationships and families and friends, and how those interpersonal interactions help form our own personalities and prejudices.We learn how the people we are related to instill in us the very best and the very worst attributes through years of shared experiences, and we must then pick and choose the bits and pieces that we will hold onto, and the ones that we should like to discard.We come to realize that just as we do not pick our families, we rarely get to choose the people we work with or for, nor do we often get a say in the tasks that are given us. But we do get to decide how we respond to those individuals and to those situations.The story is immediately insightful about a host of habits that, left unchecked, can ultimately destroy us. We see the danger of judging others too quickly without getting to know them, and the futility of subscribing to a might-makes-right doctrine.The ugliness of bullying and belittling others for the sake of self-aggrandizement is revealed for the monster that it is, and we also observe how a soft answer turneth away wrath.And we learn that, ultimately, charity and compassion are far more powerful than angry words or weapons of war. Ender, in a tender scene with his sister, reveals, ""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.""We watch movies to be entertained, to escape from the problems of our lives and enjoy somebody else's for a few hours. We also like to learn things, to gain insight and perspective, to walk a while in someone else's shoes.The very best movies both captivate our attention and challenge assumptions. Watch this movie with your kids, then talk about it. Ender's Game reminds us that we can't simply judge our lives based on what we do; we must consider why and how we make those choices. That is what matters, and that is why Ender's Game matters.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

The technology was good enough, using the drone at the first place but the commander tricks ender that the pilot was real and not a drone. Why not straighten the stories with the drone, and why the commander have to lied to Ender that is the real pilots that make sacrifices. Big question there, Enders said that ""after 50 years the alien was flew and never comeback"", fifty years?c'mon and still using pilots for the jets/plane?the US already using a drone dude. Now the stories, it just focused on one person ""Ender's"". there are so many psychological materials there. As example is when Ender's being tested with some bullies from his friends at the academy on earth, and the battle academy for the commander ranks. etc...there are so many messages that we can take, like controlling the anger/anger management.One more, why I was gave this rate, six points, because there are some nonsense alien. The alien was a cockroach or more like a mantis, and look at their legs because no arms. For examples like the queen, how can she hold a cup?even making a huge planes/ships?with laser on it? c'mon...it's make me laugh. The movies is little bit rush I think.

Unfortunately this movie fell way below my expectations, dashed my hopes, and was much worse than I feared it would be. Though I tried not to compare the movie to the book, this movie falls so far short of the book that I am surprised that O.S. Card allowed this movie to carry the same title at all. The most exciting parts of the book are completely missing as well as some of the most important character building elements of what made Ender who he was as a person and as a genius commander. Aside from the poor acting, there are also far too few battle room scenes to even make sense of what is going on there. For example, you can see dragon army rising in the standings somehow, no training scenes of the army, and only one or two battles with dragon army. There was not even a ""skimming over"" scene that could have helped explain why anyone would put the fate of mankind on this boys shoulders. Far too few battles in command school as well. Too much information was omitted to make this movie worth watching. This book should have been split into 2-3 movies to have done it right. I so badly wanted to write a good review for this movie that I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 that it really deserves. Too, bad. Take my advise: If you saw the previews and enjoyed them, then try to be satisfied with those and move on with your life.

Apart from the excellent visual effects and the decent sound engineering, this blockbuster movie actually has a story: aliens attack Earth, humans prepare to fight back. And by humans meaning 12 year-olds. Although I do not subscribe to the notion of children being used as instruments of war, in reality this happens on a wide scale. Be it children who are behind the gun or in front of it. So that shouldn't cause any 'morality-crises' to any self-aware individual. As it appears, in the future (where the movie takes place) things haven't changed much on this aspect.I liked Asa's performance. He's a kid and he managed to pull through a difficult role. Harrison Ford's role on the other hand was quite one- dimensional. That's a clear waste of talent.I would have liked the movie to develop more the weak/human side of the protagonist, to let us understand that he's a kid after all who is asked to become a hero in a few days. It would be also nice to have an introduction on the situation of future Earth and the alien home planet. And most importantly: why diplomacy failed in the first place.Anyway, I think it's a decent movie that pulls you in the more you watch it. 7.5 / 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No matter how convincing the actors are(and Ender's actor is excellent), it still doesn't make for the huge amounts of plot and dialogue that are obviously and brutally shortened here.. they are crammed into very short scenes. And that just doesn't give you enough time to really get invested in the characters and plot and the result? when the final climax arrives you feel like it's there too soon! Now that's the weirdest feeling I ever got from a movie. Instead of feeling amazed I felt confused. The people who made this film could take a lesson from LOTR on how to truly explore a universe. You can't rush with this kind of deep, epic material. It's offensive to the storyline, the actors, and to us serious movie goers who want to be taken seriously and aren't in for a cartoon. Man, it's too bad, this movie could have been a 10 if not for its frantic pace and short length.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, I had the exact opposite reaction to this movie. I read this book in one of my classes in school, and we discussed many aspects of the book at the time. The overall quality of the film allows you to overlook the missing aspects of the book. It was amazing how much was pulled together in a little under two hour movie. I would suggest if you have read the book, you will not be disappointed. Another aspect of this film is its ability to allow you to transform your depiction from reading the book. The visual images created in the film are absolutely stunning. I would have suggested things be a little clearer for those who have never had experience with the story.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Apparently we are now living in a future world where it is normal to make soldiers out of children. The colonel (Harrison Ford) is convinced Ender might be 'the one'. The pace of the movie is fast, maybe too fast. Before we know it Ender is actually at the school somewhere in space, and right after his first training already he is promoted and there is talk of him being a leader almost immediately. Maybe it is just a bad adaptation of the book, I don't know, I didn't read it, but you have the feeling the movie takes place in a few weeks, while there are actually long space travels (years of cryosleep) involved. The kids do not age at all, although Asa Butterfield (Ender) tries his best to do the coming off age development just. This said, I have to say it did not bother me too much and I really enjoyed the movie after some eyebrow lifting (especially halfway through the movie). The overall production design is really good. The zero gravity combat scenes, the mind game and the 'exams' are done pretty mind-blowing and are truly exciting to watch. Asa Butterfield is a promising actor, he is believable in his acting choices and switches emotions at the turn of a dime. I am looking forward to seeing him act in other movies. Harrison Ford gives Colonel Graff the body and motivation he needs. One of the smaller roles that really stood out was Viola Davis as Major Gwen Anderson. She was a great contra weight to the typical male Colonel Graff as she brought the depth and emotions of a woman who might be a mother herself and is questioning the military she works for, using children as soldiers. I would have liked to see a little bit more of her. Overall: the movie was too fast in pace but nonetheless entertaining.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then, Ender goes to training. Then, Ender goes to training again.

None are shown that are convincing.If you are going to show a character going thru training, it helps to show us that the character is actually advancing in the training. But how can he? He's a genius and a prodigy. (Compare to The Matrix, where Neo may or may not be The One).If you are going to put a character at the center of a movie, please make sure he has some degree of empathy and isn't a dramatic lightweight. Here, Ender is unsympathetic and I never cared one way or the other what happened to him or anyone else (since everyone else is equally non empathetic).The great Ben Kingsley is wasted. Harrison Ford looks bored.You know a movie is in trouble when critics hesitatingly credit it for being 'intelligent' and 'full of ideas' yet still largely give it negative reviews. This is because, as the case here, the movie fails as a movie--as a dramatic, engaging experience. Instead some vague ideas are tossed around and an ending tossed on that feels entirely undeserved. Perhaps they want an Ender's Game 2--if so, let's get some real writers, directors and actors, please.","23 out of 52 found this helpful.

In other words, this film was aimed at the proverbial male ""nerd"".I'm a middle aged male who still plays computer games because I think they're fun, like a lot of males my age. I grew up with a generation that appreciated science, but also appreciated a good action film and athletics. There are a good chunk of adult males of a variety of ages who are not protein starved emaciated men who think of nothing but science and games. Those people are a minority.Yet this movie, and the book upon which it was based, treat the audience as if it were the majority of the audience in the theatre. And, on top of that, even goes on to create an ""empowerment scene"" where the young male protagonists stands up for himself in a very physical scene. How tiring.If you go to any college or university science lab, you'll note that the majority of the young scientists in training are regular normal people, male and female. In fact, you'll probably find several jocks in those classes, or even detectives or administration of justice majors learning about basic science as they pursue a career in forensics. The point being that the audience for whom this film was made, does not exist, or does not exist in the numbers both author and film makers think exists.As such we get a film that's slow moving for the sake of it. Goes way overboard in looking at character development. Does not take one moment to look at ""the bad guys"" in any way, shape or form until the very end, and even then it's cursory at best, and leaves the audience wondering what they just watched.Well shot, reasonably acted, and a lexicon that's at the 6th grade level for dialogue, this film is destined to be another early 2000s film that relied way too much on CGI, and did absolutely nothing with basic film making tools.This film, if nothing else, should prove to Hollywood, London, Taiwan, Tokyo, Berlin, New York and even San Francisco, that the age of the sci-fi spectacular is dead. The film industry fell behind computer games (note; NOT video games, but online strategy games for the PC and Apple) in the 90s, and has been trying to grab young dollars ever since with bigger, splashier, and I'll add, a worse slew of films than the awful American International films that came out in the 1960s.I've been playing RTS games since Dunce and Warcraft 1, and continue to indulge in them (though less frequently) with Starcraft 2 and Homeworld. And I can tell you right now that no amount of CGI wizardry replaces good characters and story, which this film lacks. Oh sure, the film makers try to create drama with over-the-top moments for the main character, and an idiotic parable at the end given the nature of the alien attack, but marry these with lukewarm CGI, and what do you have?Finally, this movie attempted to mimic the Kubrick film making model with a nod towards the act structure of ""Full Metal Jacket"", even to the point of trying to mimic a few scenes, but again, there's a reason Kubrick was a genius. Without writing an even larger dissertation, he knew what he was doing. This director didn't.There is nothing cerebral here, though the film makes a pretense of it. There is no high drama here, though again the film makes a stab at presenting the such. There is the story of a young man (boy) who is reared on games, and Orson Scott Card's fear of what that might entail.Boring, tiresome, and absolutely nothing to offer. Avoid.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

While the movie boasts strong performances and stunning special effects, it ultimately falls short of capturing the depth and complexity of the source material, resulting in a somewhat superficial and rushed experience.The film follows the story of Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a young prodigy recruited by the military to train as a commander in the fight against an alien race known as the Formics. The premise is intriguing, and the movie excels in its depiction of futuristic space battles and military training. The special effects are top-notch, particularly the zero-gravity combat training sequences and the epic final battle. These scenes are visually captivating and do justice to the imaginative world Card created.Asa Butterfield delivers a solid performance as Ender, effectively portraying his character's intelligence, determination, and vulnerability. Harrison Ford, as Colonel Graff, and Viola Davis, as Major Anderson, provide strong support, adding gravitas to the film. Ben Kingsley, despite limited screen time, makes a memorable impression as Mazer Rackham. However, the standout performance comes from Hailee Steinfeld as Petra Arkanian, who brings warmth and depth to her character, making her one of the most relatable figures in the story.Despite these strengths, ""Ender's Game"" struggles with its pacing and narrative depth. The film rushes through key plot points, sacrificing character development and emotional resonance in the process. The training sequences, which should be the heart of the story, feel abbreviated and lack the necessary build-up to make Ender's rapid rise to command believable. The relationships between characters, particularly the camaraderie among the young recruits, are underdeveloped, missing the richness of the novel.The film's attempt to condense the complex themes of the book into a two-hour runtime results in a disjointed and superficial narrative. The moral and ethical dilemmas that Ender faces are not explored in sufficient depth, diminishing the impact of the story's conclusion. The twist at the end, while visually spectacular, lacks the emotional weight it should carry because the audience hasn't had enough time to fully connect with Ender's journey.In addition, the film's portrayal of the Formics and their motivations is somewhat lacking. The novel delves into the complexities of this alien race, presenting them as more than just a faceless enemy. The movie, however, reduces them to a simplistic antagonist, missing an opportunity to add layers to the story and provoke deeper thought about the nature of conflict and understanding.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Asa Butterfield is fantastic as Ender and Harrison Ford plays the gruff, ruthless military leader role well. Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley continues his worldwide tour of accents.While some scenes and occasional bits of dialogue descend into Disney Channel movie territory, it is an interesting film on how in an attempt to save the human race, we lose our humanity in the process.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And I thought, as a movie, that it acquitted itself quite well amidst all the news and hype surrounding it.I found the movie story told well enough - children recruited for war and the dilemmas it posed, a colonel with a win-at-all-costs attitude and his independent protégé who disagreed. I read some comments which reviled the movie's pace, but I think it was meant to be that way, keeping in mind that the creator of Ender's Game resisted a film adaptation until he had control of the script. I conclude that the movie must have at least compared well enough with his vision for it.The visuals were well done, even if I had some problems with some of the exaggerated gestures used that distracted me from the battle screens. The battle scenes and views of the fleet were done epic-style, but I did wish there were more of it. I also wished the battle and fight scenes were longer - the rush didn't have much time grow before you're forced to the climax.The standout actors have to be Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Ford is excellent in his portrayal of Colonel Graff - the no-nonsense commander who has seemingly no compassion, whose only goal is to win at any and all costs. Butterfield acquitted himself well in the role, but his emotions seem forced - you couldn't really see the battles in his mind unless they were spoken out loud. This may be a fault of the script - there isn't really a lot of time for character development considering the fast tempo of the film. What time was spent for development wasn't used effectively enough.The other actors in the movie performed a good job. The majority of the main cast are child actors, and they did well in roles which did not allow them to be children.If you don't come watching this hoping to see a 100% faithful adaptation of the book, you will be able to enjoy the movie for its story, its visuals and the acting.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Adaptations usually get a kicking from some minorities. I don't how how good an adaptation, because I haven't read the book. What I can say is, from my unread point of view this film is really very slick and well acted. And the CGI is superb.Asa Butterfield apparently grew two inches while filming; I'm not surprised. He's hardly recognisable from the charmingly gawky 14-year-old in the excellent Hugo. In fact it wasn't until some way through this movie I realised they were one and the same; Butterfield is at that age where his height has outraced his filling out, and it shows on occasion. But his acting range certainly has filled out.Harrison Ford plays the perfect foil to Ender's fragile genius. As the old school military veteran, ready to sacrifice everything to ""prevent all future wars"", Ford still brings humanity and depth to a part that could easily have been much less.The twist, I have to say, I didn't see coming. Perhaps that's because I watched this movie with no particular expectation, and so was pleasantly surprised. I suggest you do the same.I for one will watch it again in a few months.Perhaps I might even read the book..Worth a couple of hours of your time, definitely.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went into the movie with very ow expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Now don't get me wrong it is no Lord of the Rings, but it does more things right than it does wrong and considering how hard the novel is to turn into a movie I have to give credit where it is due. There are cuts made from the novel to streamline the story. The entire subplot on Earth involving Val and Peter is dropped completely. Ender is only shown having a few battles in the battle room where as in the book he has quite a few. It is just under two hours long but it is paced well so it doesn't feel that long. The battle room scenes are very cool I just wish there were more. Ender in the books is shown to be excellent at thinking out of the box and while this is shown in the movie it feels a little rushed. We are told several times that Ender is a genius tactician and that is supposed to serve as enough proof. Ender's Game does nothing special. See it if you liked the novel, but go in with low expectations. If you are not a fan of the series you'll get nothing out of seeing it. It won't shatter your world view. The acting is fairly good, except for ironically Ender's part, played by Asa Butterfield. He has a few crucial scenes at the end of the film that he needs to carry and he just can't pull it off.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have never read the original book(s) to be able to express my overall thought, but over all I would label it as an 'Okay' film. As far as the production side of things, there are areas in the film that a thinker will not let go. Continuity is one of the things that the production team should of looked over in some scenes, and a few action sequences that didn't felt believable, as well as its Sci-Fi establishment. What I mean by that is most Sci-Fi films like to show you the science/technology in the films, at times film makes/writers like to incorporate the science/tech in its dialogue to the point were if its too much it becomes agonizingly annoying. 'Ender's Game' however didn't over explain the science/tech in its dialogue, they focused more on the story (personal opinion). However they tend to over establish a number of the science/tech in scenes, and a number of it will lead you kind of board. But I guess if you have a lot of effects in a film, you kinda have to show what the developers have done. I will give credit to it's message, me explaining it will only ruin the whole point of the film being made in the first place. But its message really is one that makes you think on the outcome of war. And lastly, i'm only 20 right now. This film really isn't meant for my age range as a target audience, but if I had to recommend something to teens and younger, this would be a film that I would recommend.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Formics? do me a favour. Un-original name derived from Formic ants. In the future we are not going to use children to fight. If the fate of humanity rests with one person shouting ""fire"" at the appropriate time, followed by ""I need more time"" ""shields are down"" or whatever, the we are doomed. Today, computers can defeat chess grand masters, jeopardy champions. Financial centres are run by machines trading faster and more accurately than humans. By the time we reach the technology of Enders Game humans going into battle will be a thing of the past. The actors best efforts to add some drama to a terrible script led to a randomly grimacing Harrison Ford and some terrible performances from the other actors. Space battles were done well, but done to death by Star Trek. It's time for Hollywood to stop aping Star Trek and Star Wars and come up with something original. It's not as if there is a shortage of good books to start with. How about ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Ringworld"", ""Have Spacesuit, will Travel"" and thousands more.

Sitting down to watch this cinematic adaptation, I did expect some elements would be cut down or eliminated entirely. Which is what happened, and the cuts made to the story really suffer. The emotional heart of the story - Ender's relationship with his sister Valentine, and the subplot about her going-ons while Ender is away - is almost entirely missing, so much so that viewers who haven't read the book will wonder why Valentine is in the movie in the first place, since she seems to serve no real purpose. There are further cuts that make the movie suffer. The beginning is VERY rushed and will have many viewers wanting more explanation. And the movie never really gets into the head of its youthful hero (or any other character for that matter.) The cast does make a great effort, but there's not much they can do.On a positive note, the special effects and sets are first rate - they do bring to life the backdrop of the novel. Also, I will admit that the movie is never boring - it does move along at a swift pace. But I would have sacrificed the swift speed for a story with more heart and explanation. I think that if the movie ran an additional hour (or had been split into two movies 90 to 120 minutes each), things would have been a lot better. The movie as it is kills time easily enough, but even if you haven't read the book, you'll see potential that was not fulfilled.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The details have been lost in the mists of memory and I know that the following books did not have the same impact, but the first, oh boy, I cried at the end. What remained with me was that the story was essentially antiwar, a cautionary tale against winning a battle while losing ourselves. Antiwar, just like Starship Troopers, and we know how that turned out as a movie franchise.And so I was rather on the edge hoping that they would not mess this up. I am glad to report that they did not... much. True, it would have been impossible to convey more of the book in a film. Even a series would have been ill advised, since the story is, indeed, in the details, but has a major punchline at the end. The book was all about the boy overcoming everything they threw at him: training games, cruel jokes, mind games. There was a lot of space dedicated to his interactions with the computer game, which was adapting itself to the user, revealing much. It was impossible to put this into a film, and this is where there is the pity. Therefore my recommendation is first read the book, then watch the movie, which is a good one, a well made film made by someone who clearly enjoyed and respected the original book.OK, if you are a die hard fan of the book you will start noticing differences in the details or the scene order or even the end of the film, but personally I didn't think it hurt the story much.Now, about the film, I can't really find a fault with it. The cast was perfect, the acting good, the effects well done, but not over done, the music supporting the mood of each scene, but not being exaggerated in any way, the story faithful to the book and the script properly condensed in a movie. I said that there was a lot from the book that could not have been put in the film, but watching it I did not feel rushed, with scenes that make no sense or things moving too fast. Perhaps overall, looking back, it did seem hurried, but I can honestly say that I only realized it when the movie was over and I had to write this review and not during it.I really wonder about the next bit of the story, which is fundamentally different from its start. Will it have to be changed dramatically in order to keep audiences happy, will the screenplay be as good as for Ender's Game and convey to the viewer the emotions and intentions of the book author, thus needing no intervention in the story? And now, while writing this, I wonder if at my age now I would really like the first book a lot more than the rest. Perhaps it would be the other way around.Bottom line: Respecting the original work, the film made me enjoy it even when I knew the plot. I found no real flaw in it, so I am forced to rate it top grade. And what was even nicer, it made me have hope for the next films which now I eagerly await. Good job!","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Also, the movie makes it seem that the initial Formic attack happened in Earth's atmosphere, which is a ridiculous perversion of the novel and basic science. There is also the weird Sergeant character played by Anozie - a meaningless character who doesn't belong as the children are supposed to be largely managing themselves.

Will it be Percy Jackson? Needless to say most of my worries were generally needless as this was a well-made film.Visually the film does what it sets out to do quite well, bringing to life (and to a 21st century imagination)many of the things illustrated in the novel quite nicely. The CG, for the most part, is fantastic. There are a few parts where things look plastic, but nothing too distracting. All in all, looks good.But how's the acting? As expected, Harrison Ford delivers, and the actors playing the children do their job fairly well. My only complaint is the lack of limelight going to pretty much anybody but the protagonist since, for the most part, a lot of these characters are really well fleshed out and interesting in the novels. But for what they were given, they delivered.The film is surprisingly faithful to the novel as well. It is about as faithful as it could be, what with having to condense a 300 page novel that takes place over the course of several years into a two hour film. Naturally some things were cut or streamlined to keep the story engaging, and few parts if any really overstayed their welcome. Some scenes felt a bit rushed, but all in all, the film is faithful to the novel while bearing in mind the need to keep the pace going for an audience that is unfamiliar with the novel.All in all, this was a very enjoyable film from the perspective of a huge fan of the novel, and it feels as if it would be enjoyed by a casual crowd as well, but a few minor gripes and shortcomings hold it back from perfection. 9/10","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was like I was watching something from an acting school when the actors don't really nail their parts yet. Asa Butterfield was great, though. Harrison Ford... well I've never been his greatest fan. Ben Kingsley was a bit weird, i think they should have used him more and better. Again, I don't't think the director loved this movie enough to make it great. I was a bit disappointed. Special effects were nice. The training battles were good.

Taken from the novel by Orson Scott Card, it purports to tell the story of Ender Wiggin, (Asa Butterfield) a young man who dreams of joining the military and becoming a great Space hero like his former brother. However he suffers from strange dreams and bad nightmares which aggravates his inferiority complex, not to mention school bullies who seek him out for sport and ridicule. Still he show so much promise a high ranking Officer (Harrison Ford) believe he has the makings of an officer and a great fleet Commander in outer space. In addition, a powerful and fearsome alien race has already attacked Earth some 70 years ago and is said to be waiting to return to destroy humanity. To this end, Earth has taken to recruit Earth's finest young cadets and is training them to become the last line of defense. Ben Kingsley, stars as Mazer Rackham, a high ranking Officer who sets out to hone Wiggins' natural talents and prepare him to do battle with the Alien enemy. Despite his gifts, Wiggins, doubts himself and his the abilities to become the Future Leader his superiors believe he will become. Finally there are the terrible dreams which nightly haunt him as if warning him of his future. The film is jam packed with action, excitement and phenomenal scenes which nearly memorizes the audience. All in all, it's becomes a great movie and one which not only entertains us, but is thought provoking in it's message. The book delves into far more detail, but the film does it's best and is slated to become a Classic. Highly recommended as a Great Sci-Fi for the future. ****","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's about a boy named Ender who is brought into this military academy to destroy an alien race. It's been a while since I read the book, but when I read it, I enjoyed it. It had a great story, interesting characters, and it was well written. When I saw the trailer, I got pretty excited. Was it as good as the book? No, it wasn't. Let me get that out of the way. However, I still enjoyed it. Let me start out with the acting. It was very good. Harrison Ford did great, Ben Kingsley did great; Asa Butterfield did a surprisingly fantastic job. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heck, all of the kids were awesome in this movie. Usually when there are child actors in a movie, they're usually terrible (Don't believe me? Watch The Last Airbender. You'll understand). Not this movie. There are a lot of terrific kid actors in their! A couple of them were hit and miss, but a good majority of them were great. The story of this movie is still the same as the book and it's still really good. It has heart, it has moral dilemmas, it has conflict. It has everything you want in a good sci-fi movie. What I like about this movie is that they kept a good chunk of it similar to the movie. I'm glad they didn't drastically change the story. I am very grateful. However, some of these changes come at a cost. One of those costs is Ender's backstory with his family. In the book, he had a long backstory about how he was distant from everybody except from his sister and the military was changing that to make him distant from everybody in general. The back story, in my opinion, was one of the best parts of the book because you really cared about Ender. In the movie, the backstory felt one-dimensional. The connection between his family didn't feel believable and there was no character development with his brother or his sister, which happened in the book. That kind of disappointed me. Now, there was a certain point in this movie where I thought, ""Okay, this movie is starting to drag on. Let's get to something interesting."" Yeah, it gets really slow at a point. The book has the same slowness, but it balances story development with training perfectly. This seemed to have more training sequences than it should have. I feel that they could've shortened some of those scenes to make them not as slow and more interesting. Just my opinion. Overall, Ender's Game is a solid movie adaptation of a book. It's well acted, the story is great, the CGI is awesome, and it's well shot. However, Ender's thin backstory and the moments of slow pacing bog the movie down from being amazing. Is this the sci-fi movie of the year? No, I don't think so. That award goes to Gravity, in my books. But, you should still go watch Ender's Game. It's very enjoyable and very cool.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So many key elements left out or butchered. I expected to be slightly disappointed since I love the book, but to still enjoy it.

Its hard to know what the plot is, young people being groomed to be battle leaders, and the leadership seems to be attracted to one young boy who looks like he is about 13 years old. The actors show no human dimension to their characters, they may as well be automatons. Excessively long plot development focused on training. A disappointing finale that sort of skirts by you, like driving past your destination without noticing it. Viewing it in New Zealand, perhaps the most entertaining moment was when Ben Kingsley said his father was a Maori, that elicited a chuckle from the audience. But more than anything else, this is just a long and boring movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Countlessly flip-flopping from fantastic to awful within the blink of an eye, it's an extremely hard motion picture to get a handle on, enjoyment wise. The concept of teenagers leading our world's unified military - adapted from Orson Scott Card's best-selling novel - is intriguing and writer-director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) mines it for surprisingly bleak moments of social commentary, especially in the potent final 20 minutes. For a flick that has been marketed as an adolescent-friendly sci-fi romp, it's assuredly dark and thankfully doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, but, along with some good quality CGI spectacle, this is where the film's strengths largely stop. At the other end of the scale, the acting is woefully subpar. Ranging from lazy and one-note (Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley) to uncomfortable (Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld) to downright absurd (Moises Arias as the prickly Bonzo), there's little to praise in the work of the cast. Mind you, it doesn't help that there's a lot of truly horrendous dialogue that would make even Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis look silly. With the unexpectedly sombre narrative and a gripping finale this should've been brilliant, as is it's a passable futuristic voyage that, frustratingly, doesn't live up to its potential.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Graff"" (Harrison Ford) reckons his reaction to some bullies might suggest he has more mettle than his weedy physique indicates. His bootcamp experiences are much the same with loads of muscle-bound bullies making his life difficult but ""Graff"" isn't interested in making his life any easier, despite the occasional protests of his sidekick ""Anderson"" (Voila Davis). Indeed he actually ups the ante considerably when the young man is introduced to the eccentric ""Mazer"" (Sir Ben Kingsley). A veteran of the ongoing deadlocked war with the ""Formics"" that everyone hopes can train the the young ""Ender"" to break. Butterfield does quite well here as the youngster but both Ford and Kingsley underwhelm with the latter, tattoo-covered, character more hammy than intimidating as the story gradually stops being about the people and more of a video game with great visual effects, but a rather weak conclusion to the story that is inconsistently paced for two hours. I like the genre and it tries to be a bit different in it's approach to sci-fi story with a bit of a conscience.

Not good enough to recommend to a friend who just wants entertainment for 2 hours.I haven't read the book or any other Orson Scott Card works.The movie doesn't waste time in pulling you into the story, but even then it's obvious 2 hours isn't enough to give the story justice. Many subplots/relationships in the story aren't given enough exposure/time to give emotional effect. This makes significant parts of the movie feel weird/rushed. Many questions are unanswered and we're left to assume/suspend our disbelief ourselves to move the story forward. The main plotline is executed well though and the questions/holes in the story apply more to the subplots instead of the main plot, so they did a pretty good job.Asa Butterfield did a very good job as Ender. I hope he doesn't become another casualty of fame because he has a bright future as an actor if he keeps performing like this. Ford, Davis, and Kingsley all also gave good performances. There are some bad performances from the other casts, but nothing so significant they give a lasting bad taste.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Overall, unfortunately, it falls well short of the high standards set by the book.The pacing is uneven throughout, random snippets from the novel appear without any real context to give them any emotional resonance, and important moments are rushed, or poorly thought out. The direction is pretty much mailed in, a stodgy, discouraged, trite affair despite the overall stylishness of the designs and palettes (the few positives) Honestly, it goes by pretty fast, the visuals are pleasant, the story it's based on is interesting, so not a total waste of time if you just want to chill in a theater for a little while....However, if you are movie buff and expect a little more than average Hollywood fare than don't bother, this movie feels patchy, artificial, staged, it has no flow and no it has no real depth.Kudos to the actors for giving this hodge-podge of themes never fully explored at least a vague semblance of heart, but a pretty mediocre effort all considered, definitely below mediocrity in terms of script and direction.Once again, it could have been so much better.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That excitement was stamped on pretty hard when I left the theater. Firstly, the children are too old. Secondly, Enders brother and Sister were hardly covered at all, in fact I think they filmed less than one page worth from the book. The movie moved far too quickly, the first part of the movie was so rushed I sat there and wondered what I just watched, it was skipping the story like a kangaroo on speed. Harrison Ford is done, he needs to retire because there is no character in him at all, very wooden. The kid, Asa Butterfield was great, but like in all movies, he needed better direction from the director. The end was rushed, a video game Ender plays is rushed, with loads missing. In the book he plays the video game for months, frustrated he couldn't get past a level, in the film it was over a couple of days with no point to even putting it in there. The jokes were removed, the bullying was kept to a minimum and timescale was squashed so much so you just sat there thinking, what the hell? In the book he met his Sister years later, in this film it felt like weeks. Terrible. Everything that was good about the book was completely removed.Very disappointing.

Dealing with young Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) , he is a modest young man with vast untapped potential who's recruited by the International Military commanded by tough Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) , Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) and a stiff-upper-lip drill instructor sergeant (Nonso Anozie) to lead the fight against the Formics that have the features and behaviors of ants , they're an insectoid alien race who had previously attemped to invade Earth and had inflicted heavy losses on humankind . Ender receives lessons in training methodology , leadership, and ethics as well . Celebrated by his peers and respected by his superiors , Ender is quickly promoted to Command School. The military school provides him with the knowledge and tools needed to save mankind from certain extinction . As the final battle approaches, Ender prepares to embrace his destiny as one of the greatest heroes in the history of planet Earth.. This is not a game !. The enemy's gate is down !. The future must be won !An agreeable Sci-Fi with thrills , grueling series of FX simulations, impressive battles and set at the near future , when a hostile alien race has attacked Earth in which in preparation for the next attack, the International Military seek to find a future leader who can save the human race , they find Ender Wiggin , and he's trained to lead his fellow soldiers into an ultimate battle that will determine the future of Earth . The motion picture was professionally directed by Gavin Hood delivering a decent filmmaking concluding with a shocking plot twist . For the wirework in the battle room , the actors trained for a month with individual ¨Cirque du Soleil¨ members so they could do the wire performances themselves ; adding breathtaking visual effects from Digital Domain, in fact the house behind this movie created a demo reel of the battle room . Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfeld, Aramis Knight , Moises Arias and several cast members that portray Battle School cadets in the movie went to Space Camp prior to filming to train for zero gravity sequences , including some rigs that were invented for this movie , used to capture zero gravity scenes ; so the actors and actresses had to carefully choreograph their movements , to give the accurate illusion of floating . Parts of the movie were shot at N. A. S. A.'s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans , Louisiana , where the massive external tanks for the space shuttle program were constructed . Main and support cast give decent interpretations . Stars Asa Butterfield as a shy but strategically brilliant young mind who's recruited to join the elite . The always great Harrison Ford as the highly esteemed Colonel Graff. And Ben Kingsley as the fearless International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham who sent fleeing back into the stars , becoming a living legend in the process ; he was first-billed , featured prominently in the movie's marketing , but he doesn't appear until sixty minutes into the movie . Along with Hailee Steinfeld , Abigail Breslin , Viola Davis , Aramis Knight , Nonso Anozie , Moises Arias , all of then give attractive interpretations .It displays thrilling , rousing musical score by composer Steve Jablonsky . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman Donald McAlpine . This gripping and intense motion picture was well directed by Gavin Hood , he is a notorious secondary actor and filmmaker . Overall, this has a good look, some nice action, a little bit of youthful drama and groundbreaking final battles . Director Gavin Hood does a nice job pulling it all together , though it failed at the box-office, though today's well deemed . As a director Gavin has got a large number of hits ; such as : Tsotsi (2005), Eye in the sky (2015) , Rendition , A reasonable man , Ender's Game , X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) , Official secrets (2019) . Rating : 6.5/10 . Above average , well worth seeing ; it is a young Sci-Fi movie but it has a much darker ending than other sci-fi movies .","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't go see this movie unless you like space and battles, preferably together. But you also shouldn't see this movie if you want space and battles for mindless entertainment; this movie tries to delve much further than that, and for the most part, I believe it really succeeded.Visually, Ender's Game is pretty spectacular. There's a lot to love about the visual effects, and kudos to the team that put them all together. It made for great viewing due to that aspect alone. The soundtrack was very fitting, and I enjoyed it all the way through. I gotta love me some epic soundtrack music, and this score really delivered in that department!But of course, it's the story that plays the biggest role here, since it's a book-to-screen adaptation. That alone made me hesitant to see it, since I've been disappointed by many book-to-screen adaptations before. Here, I found nothing I could really hate; the movie feels rushed at times, but in the grand scheme of things, there is far more that I liked than I didn't. I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, and no single mistake changed my viewing experience for the worse.I'll be letting my friends know that this is worth a watch, and I'd be more than happy to watch it again. I'd also highly recommend this to fans of the genre, books, and just good movies in general. While I left the movie feeling like I'd just seen something awesome, the movie left me thinking deep and interesting thoughts. Now that's a good movie right there.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

A buddy of mine loves the novel and has been looking forward to the film adaptation for some time, and I am aware of the recent press the author Card has had with his public praise for male/female marriage, which I admire. Other than that I only knew of what I have heard. I predicted this based on what I knew to be more of a mind games thing than it was. After talking to my friend who read the novel testified to and is the case for many novels, there are many interesting details not present in the film adaptation that greatly fleshed out the characters.There was apparently many more mental warfare scenarios in the novel that are a bit difficult to put together on the big screen. But what's here is pretty good. The character development is decent, although empathy may be a stretch in some scenarios of this science fiction universe, the viewer is probably on Ender's side a majority of the time, especially with the odds stacked against him and many other cadets and bullies out to get him. It's also entertaining to watch Ender succeed in almost every adversarial situation. There is apparently more explanation as to how Ender dissects his opponents in the novel and that isn't explained in the movie. Sometimes it seems far fetched for a lanky boy to maneuver and get out of the situations he does without the explanation of his mental acuity.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The camera feed of Mazer Rackham's destruction of a Formic civilization mother ship ends abruptly, going to black rather than static. The production design is uninspired, not nearly as interesting as that of ""Skyline"" or ""Lockout,"" which were a fraction of the cost. The weapons and weapons platforms are as anachronistic as ""Battlestar Galactica"" (2004), a considerably more profound project than ""Ender's Game"". What ""Ender's Game"" DOES have are great performances by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. In my opinion, this is Ford's best performance, as he gives a human face to a ""monster"". Asa Butterfield is flawless; I have never seen such an assured performance from such a young actor. Heck, many of the most-honored veterans could not pull off such a difficult role. Butterfield and director Gavin Hood manage to make ""Ender's Game"" a near-great, if not great film for the first two-thirds, despite its predictability and other shortcomings. However, when Ender reaches advanced military training the movie begins to fall apart. Director Hood, excellent with ensemble actors, is simply NOT an ""action director"". As producer, Hood should have recognized this and budgeted for John Woo, who proved his supreme worth in handling spectacle with ""Red Cliff"". Then,there is Ben Kingsley, who brings nothing extra to a underwritten role.The horrendous ""secret"" of Ender's Game is obvious from the beginning. Ender, who clearly regrets some of his choices, is disappointingly indifferent to his team, who share his guilt; and should, eventually, at least, feel the consequences. This is the fatal flaw in ""Ender's Game,"" almost profound, but a miss is still a miss.I give ""Ender's Game"" a week ""7,"" based entirely on the acting and message.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I loved it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2910953/?ref_=tt_urv","joethulhu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22076638/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2013","Ender's Game is a very, very flawed film. I would go as far as to say that it is almost definitely a bad film. Most of the actors seem lifeless, the events fly by at a pace that a cheetah would have trouble catching up to, and some of the dialogue is painful. Asa Butterfield's American accent noticeably slips several times. Harrison Ford feels wooden.And I loved every second of it.First of all, the visuals are amazing. This is definitely an effects film. Secondly, although the events of the novel were compressed and (especially towards the beginning) there are a few changes that make me angry, generally it's done well. Small bits like the change in location of a significant object at the end near genius (for an adaptation). Mostly, I think my affection for it comes from my love for the book. This was not a terribly faithful adaptation, and I'll be whining about annoying differences the rest of my life (why are the armies so small? They were more than 40 people in the book) and not everything looks perfect (the battle room is completely and totally inaccurate in every possible way), but as a visualization of the book's contents, it succeeds in most every way.If you're not a fan of the book (which my viewing companion wasn't), you will likely not care for this film. You may hate it. So if you haven't read it, don't see it. It's not for you. If you have read it, by all means, go see this film. You will be disappointed, but you'll also experience a wonderful visual feast that only you can appreciate.Also: The song at the end - performed by one of my favorite bands, so I may have a bit of bias - is fantastic. It's heartwarming and captures the spirit of the book perfectly. At the end, when the score fades down and the song fades in, that's a musical moment no one should miss. There's a whole EP put out by the band of songs based on the book, and all fans of the book should seek it out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I also have read other great books by Orson Scott Card such as Wyrms, The Worthing Saga, The Memory of Earth and the Folks of the Fringe. They are all great reads and very entertaining. Books rely on the imagination of the reader to fill in the blanks and draw comparisons and in doing so they provide a more intimate, insightful and personal experience. Imagining what an alien looks like is probably more personal than seeing how someone else had imagined it would look. Yet movie adaptations can deliver an experience that written word cannot. They are separate accounts of the same story. One promotes interest in the other. I like both and I am glad to have finally been given a cinematic rendition of Cards original vision. Ender's Game is a very good movie. It's not Oscar worthy nor was it intended to be. It is ,however, entertaining and well acted with state of the art sfx, sets and costumes. Maybe they should start giving science fiction movies their own awards much like they do with the books which have the Hugo and the Nebula awards. Why shouldn't genre films be recognized for individual excellence? You wouldn't want a vegetarian trying to critique your wing sauce would you? No? Well, neither do I want high-brows ranking my science fiction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Asa showed why he was chosen and why he led the charge in auditions! Not only did he do the character Ender a solid by performing him to the ultimate vision of author Orson Scott Card but he portrayed on screen hos amazing talent for future roles to come!

While it does live out large parts from the book, that is to be expected, and what they included was the perfect amount to get the story across to me. The visual effects are top notch, but nothing less is acceptable anymore these days. I was also impressed by the acting from the younger actors throughout the film, I usually struggle to take child actors seriously, but these kids brought good acting chops to the table. (But I'm also a pretty bad judge of acting typically, unless it's incredibly sub par). I'm glad they managed to focus the movie on the children, I had fears that it would be more about Ford than anyone else, but he features just enough to be great in my books.

I can understand the frustration. I derived much of my enjoyment of the novel from the deliberate, evenhanded pacing and masterful character development. Condensing this bildungsroman epic into a two- hour film inevitably resulted in some loss of literary fidelity. In that sense, I think the film is a bit of a victim of the novel's success; those who revere the novel will no doubt notice the inconsistencies and shortcuts taken by film. Admittedly, some of these deviations are somewhat vexing. And those who are enjoying Ender's Game for the first time in either medium may feel harried by the film's unforgiving pace and confused given its bare-bones plot exposition.Yet for all the quibbles over where it stumbles, the film carries itself with a stirring gravitas. The art direction is sublime, and Steve Jablonsky's booming score is tremendous, giving me goosebumps on several occasions. Even if I couldn't find myself emotionally invested in the characters as I was reading the novel, the film evokes a sense of wonder which I found to be emotionally-compelling, per se. One might fairly characterize my taste in films as idiosyncratic, but I haven't been as engrossed in a movie's atmosphere since I first saw The Dark Knight.9/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's based in the future and has different rules for the people, like how they can only have 2 kids. This book is about a very young boy, who has a brother named Peter, and a sister named Valentine. Since he is the third child, which is illegal, the government practically owns him.This book also includes bugs and wars. The huge bugs attack the world; and so the government has a battle school and it teaches young children how to fight in a battle. If you're into that, you will love this book.Although I think this book would be good for young teens it is very graphic and uses profanity. If this book was a movie, which it is, I would rate this book as PG-13. I believe the book was a lot better than the movie; almost every book now-a-days are better than the movie.

The motion picture on the other hand, does what it can do to translate a nearly unflimable movie.A lot of the other reviews do accurately capture the quality of the movie. The adaptation does remain very faithful to the book, unlike examples. (such as World War Z, The Bourne Identity, V for Vendetta). The things that they do change make a good deal of sense. Omitting Locke and Demosthenes, making all the characters older, and combining other characters (Crazy Tom, Fly Molo, and those guys are absorbed by Alai and Bernard) were all good decisions. The visuals do a heck of a job, and most of the performances are up to standard.However, while greatly capturing the plot, the film falls short in recreating the heart, but this is consequence of the nature of the novel itself. You see, the main character isn't so much Ender Wiggin as it is the mind of Ender Wiggin. The movie just isn't able to make the complete translation, and can be somewhat stale (somewhat analogous to Watchmen). In addition, iconic lines, such as ""The enemies gate is down"", are delivered with a certain staleness, and only seem to be there just to be there. The movie is indeed too short, and it would have been nice if they showed the passing of time (respects to other reviewers).If you've read the book, then this movie will be a decent 100 minutes of your time, and will bring back lots of great memories. If you haven't read the book (read it!), you're not missing too much.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I hope there is a sequel!!The action sequences were fantastic, the special effects were mind blowing.However the back story of Enders relationship with his brother was glossed over too quickly.

Loved the book ""Ender's Game"" but didn't really care for any of the sequels.Had my drink and popcorn and was set. Then with the previews/trailers it all started to go bad. Great movies coming out shortly and we get to see none of the trailers for them. Instead we get 4-5 trailers that I could not tell you one of now.Then the movie starts and it gets worse. The draw of the book was the character development of Ender Wiggens and the battle school. Both were almost completely left out of the movie. Ender's character might have had less screen time than Harrison Ford. I'd have to sit through it again with a stop watch to make sure but its an even bet. So no empathy developed for the character as he remains 2-diminsional at best.Then battle school and the ""Dragon Army."" 1 battle, 1, yes, ONE, not two, not two or three, one. So one test battle is supposed to demonstrated Ender's drive and brilliance for tactics. Of course it did.It could have been a decent movie but this drivel is not worth watching. I'd expect it to drop out of the top 5 on the box office list next weekend and then nose dive from there. The fans of the book have seen the movie and they are not happy.Skip it and see Thor 2x.

Solid visual effects (and I mean better than most movies of the kind), an entertaining story that doesn't get boring half way through the movie. But honestly that should all be expected! The question remains: How well does it recreate the books underlying battle between good and evil?In my opinion, very well. I am thoroughly impressed by this movie. It tries and succedes in bringing Ender's feelings, both good and evil, to the big screen (or for me my home cinema) in an entertaining fashion. It has been a long time (a very long time) so I hardly remembered anything from the book. The movie brought back everything, the end however still surprised me. I honestly didn't remember.I must however critique one point here and that is the beginning of the end. The end is good, the beginning of the end however felt a bit rushed. The movie could have spent a bit more time dwelling on Ender's feelings there.In closing, the movie is great, the music is good, visuals are fantastic just the end sticks out compared to the rest.

The action taken in the situation presented is definitely controversial which is one of the reasons i liked the film, the action taken leaves space for debate. Depending on your beliefs, the movie highlights a conspiratorial topic asking the question of what we would do as a collective when presented with this situation. There is also a question of morality making you question ones self as to what you would do in the situation.

The adaptation lacks the soul, the wit, the weight of the novel, some will fret, while others will yearn for more details or complain about the way in which certain elements and/or characters have been excised/altered for cinematic purposes.Sometimes, those criticisms feel unfair. After all, nuance and subtlety will almost always be lost in the process of adaptation. Novels have an unlimited budget bound only by the imagination; movies must fit roughly the same narrative into a couple of hours, with monetary concerns dictating the ebb and flow of plot and special effects. Nevertheless, despite extensive changes to the author's text, there have been literary adaptations that have enjoyed great success on both the critical and commercial fronts - The Lord Of The Rings, for example, and more recently, The Hunger Games.So there's room for hope yet with the apparently resolutely unadaptable Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic about the rage and ruin of war. Even if some of its depth and profundity must be sacrificed in changing the medium of story-telling, surely there's a way to do justice to the heartbreaking brutality and rich political dynamics of Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin's rise through the ranks of Battle School.Sadly, Gavin Hood's over-rushed effort is not the film that will do that. On its own merits, this incarnation of Ender's Game feels simultaneously bloated and loose, the plot tumbling desperately over itself as it tells a story almost completely severed from its philosophical moorings. As an adaptation, it is mostly abysmal: it hits some of the right marks, but is almost completely lacking in the novel's spirit and depth.Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is a preternaturally gifted young man who, like the rest of the children in his post-space-war Earth, has been monitored all his life to determine if he is eligible to attend the prestigious Battle School. Unlike most of his peers, including his violent brother Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) and empathetic sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin), Ender makes the cut, and he is swiftly drafted into the military academy under the gruff tutelage of Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford). Once there, Ender must figure out the system of internal battles that pass for training, gaining enemies and allies even as he's groomed to lead an army that might prove to be humanity's last hope.Taken purely as a film, Ender's Game can't help but feel hollow and clumsily rushed. Without the benefit of narration from Ender's point of view, the character lurches purposefully through Battle School with very little of his unique brilliance or insight into warfare on display. His rise through the ranks seems almost too easy, before it dissolves into a final-act twist that seems preposterous in the cinema but was hard-won, inevitable and shatteringly brilliant in the novel.In moving from page to screen, Ender's Game has altered in ways big and small - some of these changes are arguably necessary, like the aging-up of the characters. In the novel, Ender is six years old when he starts climbing the ranks of the army; there's no practical way this would work on screen or on set, and approximately 8-10 years have been added to the characters' ages. It's possible, too, to mourn the excision of an entire subplot in the book - it involved Peter and Valentine establishing online personas who wind up dominating political discourse back on Earth - while understanding that it would genuinely be too much for the movie to feasibly handle.But many of the other changes add up to a hugely disappointing adaptation. The weight and wear of Ender's time at Battle School hardly seem to affect him at all, largely because everything is compressed. In the novel, Ender's crushingly lonely journey unfolds over a few years; it seems to take place in a few weeks in the film. Relationships and characters are sliced and diced, then re-assembled, to frustrating effect: Bean (Aramis Knight), for example, is no longer Ender's successor but his compatriot. Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) has her role in the film beefed up at the expense of the tragic, dramatic heart of the same character in the book.Of course, it would be foolish to expect a film to delve into and portray Ender's inner thoughts and concerns as effectively as can be done in the novel. But the shiny gravity-defying space battles that unfold on screen in Ender's Game look great but come off as silly, rushed and cheap without the undercurrent of loneliness, self-doubt and misery that runs so clearly through Ender's mind and soul.Casting-wise, Ender's Game does well enough. Butterfield is a curiously blank presence in the film, which is appropriate as an interpretation of the character in the book, but makes for an occasionally frustrating lead in a feature film. Ford is suitably dour and determined, with only a hint of Graff's depths shining through his grim façade. Adding Viola Davis to the cast as Major Anderson - a disembodied voice in the novel who's clearly male - adds a welcome (if slightly stereotypical) feminine touch to Battle School.If you've read the book and treasured its words, ideas and characters (whatever you might think of Card's reprehensible politics and beliefs), it's probably a good idea for you to steer clear of Ender's Game. Ostensibly, it's the same story; actually, it's not. Those who've never read the book might find something to enjoy in the rush and tumble of Battle School, but don't be surprised if you, too, feel that something is missing in the film. It hints at big, important ideas - certainly more so than your generic sci-fi epic might - but, ultimately, fails to really get them across.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Only by a heroic action by Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) was the earth saved and the Formics retreated. Earth has now regrouped and 11-year old Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to lead a team of Children Warriors to once and for all defeat the Formics so they would never again be a threat to Earth. Why the decision to go with youth? As Col Graf (Harrison Ford) explains, ""we need a new kind of soldier. One who doesn't think the way we think."" Hmmm.seems to make sense. We find out why Ender was picked in the first place by Col Graf. We follow the training of all the young warriors, monitored, of course, by Col Graf. Cameras are everywhere. We see some hazing by upper-classmen, and friendships made.The acting all around is good and we are riveted. In his free time Ender plays a game on his tablet but doesn't understand why a certain a bird-like creature appears in the game and lures him to a collapsed building. That was not part of the game. He stops the game. The title of this movie being what it is, I thought that Ender Wiggin had a game plan and just needed to complete training to implement that plan when the war was really on. That is what I thought when I watched. But, sadly that is not the case and you will see how wrong I was. But, what happens is very clever. No doubt about it. Yeah, there is a twist here kind of somewhat.. almost.. and it may shock you. The CGI visuals, cinematography were simply outstanding. This may be one of the first futuristic Sci-Fi stories/movies that acknowledge computer tablets and email. Star Trek never did that.

"9","/10","A Faithful Book Adaptation!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3152983/?ref_=tt_urv","g-bodyl","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17646017/?ref_=tt_urv","31 December 2014","Ender's Game is a rather faithful adaptation from the source material, well about as faithful one could hope for. The book itself is a very conceptual book and I was pleased many of the themes were prevalent in the movie. Themes on friendship and war are the biggest themes on display here. The visuals are fantastic and it shows how far the visual effects game has gone. The battle room, which features zero gravity, rendered me speechless at the awe of the film.Gavin Hood's film is based off this kid named Ender Wiggins, who is prone to reactive violence and possess the skills of a fearless leader, according to Colonel Graff. He is also very fond of his sister. Ender finally gets accepted to Battle School, where he is trained to become a leader. One that will follow in the footsteps of Mazer Rackham in defeating the Formics, a group of genocidal aliens bent on destroying Earth.The film has a very strong cast and they do well. Asa Butterfield wasn't exactly the Ender my mine pictured, but he did blow me away. Harrison Ford returns to his sci-fi roots as Colonel Graff and he does excellent, especially when he belittles Ender. Hailee Steinfeld does very well as one of Ender's few friends, Petra. We also get solid performances from the veterans Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis.Overall, Ender's Game is a very good movie with very conceptual themes remaining intact. 2013 was a very strong year for science fiction and fantasy films, and the film continues that trend in a positive direction. The movie, in addition to having a strong story, has excellent visuals. The battle scenes are very well-done. As a YA-adaptation, the film works more of an action movie and that is always a good thing in my book. I would love to see more of Ender as he faces the aftermath of the respective Battle and Command Schools. I rate this film 9/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was indeed something missing. Only those parts of the book that could be converted to movie were used, the rest was skipped or deleted, and that was exactly what I experienced watching the movie.That doesn't mean, however, that this was a bad movie. On the contrary, a great performance of Asa Butterfield and the last quarter of the movie made more than up for it.

Plot - The problem with this movie is that it is too short. I know that not everything that was in the book can be in the movie, but a lot of what they did include was a bit rushed. This kinda makes that overlong boring action scene thing at the end even more annoying. Overall though, this movie retains most of the nuance and intelligence from the book and was extremely entertaining to watch. This movie has an extremely effective twist that is only ruined if you have read the book. Characters - The child actors are actually very good for the most part. Most of the characters are intelligent, making the story very enjoyable. The characters are interesting, though a few of them could've been better developed. Sights and Sounds - The cinematography in this movie is great, as well as the sound design. The effects are all pretty good, except for some dream/game sequences that were so bad that my DVD player automatically decided to skim through them (I didn't touch the remote, the player just skipped past those terrible sequences).Action - The action scenes in this movie are clever and entertaining. Overall, this is a very entertaining movie that I would highly recommend.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

That's because Ender's Game is a much more engaging and visceral story with better character development, while Gravity relies on special effects and characters about as complicated as those in ""Transformers"".This film gets off on the right foot. The protagonist is a lanky tween, (played by Aas Butterfield, who is established quickly. He's a prodigy, sensitive, an underdog who must balance personal issues with a greater responsibility. He's selected to lead against an alien race who once threatened our existence. You might ask where have we seen this before? Hey, at least it's not a prequel, sequel, or remake. And let me tell you something else, you haven't seen earth threatened quite like this.I will say that along the way it gets a little silly. Ender goes into training and the developments seem generic and the games they play for training are pretty confusing. Some of the better moments are borrowed from ""A Dirty Dozen"" and some others seem tailored for children.. That said, this isn't a film for kids. The overall themes here are harsh, even cynical; however, this lends to a more interesting formula than your standard good guy, bad guy, movie.Harrison Ford is powerful as a the captain of this mission to save humanity at any cost. His philosophy is cold, direct, and dangerous. By contrast, our hero is different, innocent, talented, and closer to the delicacy of life. And so there is a gigantic contrast between the two characters and a greater one with the final solution. Despite looking forward to this movie, I almost didn't see this with negative reviews piling in and the recent homophobic rant by the author. However, I was glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt. You might too.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A light-speed adaptation reined in by brilliant visuals and a strong grasp of the heart of Card's classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2903988/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","11 November 2013","It's been nearly 30 years since ""Ender's Game"" etched itself into the canon of important science-fiction novels, and like so many important science-fiction novels, a film adaptation has toiled in movie development hell, with the ""unfilmable"" label frequently cast upon it. Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") has taken a stab at adapting and directing Orson Scott Card's classic, and with a bold vision, he manages to capture its essence in spite of how narrowly he clears the hurdles of the adaptation.Timing could not have been more perfect for an adaptation of ""Ender's Game."" The popularity of stories featuring teens training for battle and alien invasion films in combination with today's visual effects capabilities created the perfect storm to finally warrant Ender a green light. The story takes place after Earth was nearly destroyed at the hands of an alien race called Formics, and decades later, we have prepared by training our youngest and brightest in the event that they return, to find a leader capable of eliminating the threat. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is young boy who has been scouted by Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) and Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) for the military's elite battle school. He catches their eye because he exhibits unusual genius but also has tendencies toward both courage and ferocity as well as compassion and empathy. They push him through rigorous tests of character and skill to see if he might really be the one.Pushing through also appears to be the motto behind Hood's script. He strings together a number of well-constructed scenes that either inform us about Ender or challenge him in some way, but the film bulldozes through them, practically shoving Ender into his destiny. There are plenty of low-key moments that are unmistakably character-building in nature, but the film's forward momentum is so strong that there's little time to stop and look around, to live in the fascinating world of the movie.Surprisingly, the film doesn't suffer that much for its breakneck pace. Although it would have been nice to see more of the captivating zero-gravity battle room sequences, or have more time to completely grasp the budding friendships between Ender and his schoolmates including Hailee Steinfeld as Petra Arkanian, Hood does a nice job identifying the core themes and universal elements of the story and getting them across with effective storytelling devices.Most of this is as it relates to Ender. A victim of bullying who knows how to turn the tide in his favor, Ender is torn between the ruthlessness it takes to win and the monstrous toll it can take on ones conscience. He strives to be the balance between his older brother Peter's (Jimmy Pinchak) aggression and his old sister, Valentine's (Abigail Breslin) sensitivity. The way Butterfield manages to portray this inner conflict, which is the film's only real ""sub-plot,"" suggests he won't be the kind of child actor who disappears after his teens.Entertainment value, however, rates highest of all that ""Ender's Game"" has to offer. Hood's vision of Card's world is rich to look at, with outstanding production design that blends sleek, stylish sci-fi elements with tangible technology. You're never once distracted or surprised by the futuristic elements of the film because they blend so well. Battle room choreography and the other sequences that play off technology benefit as a result.Something dissatisfying lingers and lurks about the film as it goes, like you feel cheated each time it takes a big step forward, but sometimes wanting to see more of a film is not a sign of a failed adaptation but of a great one. It would be a stretch to call Hood's adaptation great, but it's to the point and it manages to do the most important parts of the story — the themes — justice. It's not easy to make a movie adaptation that both meets the PG-13 blockbuster requirements of a studio and effectively communicates the mature themes of the source material. ""Ender's Game"" does it, and in less than two hours at that.Considering ""Ender's Game"" was once difficult to imagine in one's head, the fact that it comes together on screen in something of a miracle, regardless what you think of Hood's decision- making in actually getting it from one to the other. Plot-wise it leaves something to be desired, but the film achieves so much on a visual level without losing sight of the social message that Card meticulously crafted it to say. When it comes to films with weighty expectations, filmmakers have failed much worse.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The book relied heavily on Ender's thoughts and Orson Scott Card's description of the zero-gravity practice sessions and ""simulated"" battles seemed too extravagant to be captured on film. I was dead wrong. The visual effects were incredible and Asa Butterfield nailed the brilliant, conflicted role of Ender. He channeled each emotion without saying a word; shifting from loving to fearful to angry to compassionate to tormented. He has more talent as a teenager than the majority of popular actors who make millions sleepwalking through roles. This movie was a blast to watch and Asa made it look effortless.

I haven't read it - I'm not into science fiction literature so much - so watching ENDER'S GAME was a whole new experience to me; I had little idea of what to expect.It turns out to be a fairly average movie with both good and bad elements throughout. The main character is a young cadet who joins a military training program in order to combat the threat of an alien invasion. The premise that kids are better disposed to be military commanders than adults is a frankly ludicrous notion that's never properly addressed, but this film just expects you to go with it which is fair enough.Much of this film is about training in the academy and the relationships that go with it. I enjoyed the scenes of Ender squaring up to various bullies and rivals as well as the adults in the installation. I didn't realise it was the kid from HUGO at first, but Asa Butterfield is acceptable as the lead character. They throw in a bone for adult viewers with a likable Harrison Ford in support, although Ben Kingsley must be the oddest choice to play a Maori ever.Where ENDER'S GAME falls down is in the training sequences. Most of them are weightless and they make the actors involved look rather ludicrous as they giggle and float around. Later, things progress to pure CGI adventures and simulations, and as usual, the CGI space stuff is bland and formulaic. It's a pity, because there are some good twists here and a neat ending, and a halfway-decent movie emerges somewhere along the line; you end up wondering what could have been.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

I was very hesitant to see the movie since I'm such a huge fan of the book/series, but I caved and (not surprisingly) was very disappointed! The book gives the movie a lot of material to work with, but the entire thing felt (and was) rushed and skipped over a lot (or briefly touched on the subject). Here's the list: 1. Casting..All of the soldiers/students are in their teenage years! If ""I Declare War"" can cast kids in a military-esque movie, why couldn't this movie!? Ender is supposed to be physically less than everyone else. It takes away the sympathy you feel for him in the book. This immediately takes you out of the world that Orson Scott Card created. Major Anderson is played by Viola Davis, a woman. This is a very minor detail, but I don't see the big deal in casting a male, since the source material is a man. His brother, Peter and his sister Valentine are pretty much non-players in the movie (more on this later). Pretty much everyone was miscast besides Colonel Graff (played by Harrison Ford) and I'm neutral about Mazer Rackham (played by Ben Kingsley) and Petra (played by Hallie Standfeld, I know that's not her last name spelled correctly) Even the Bonzo character makes Ender look enormous! 2. Story/Pacing..as I mentioned, the whole movie seemed like a rushed and compressed version of the book. Ideally, they could've made this into a 2-part series, with the ending of 1, when he graduates. Battle School, his relationships w/Peter (especially), Graff, Valentine, Bonzo, his army and friends, other armies/students are all short lived when a huge chunk of the story is exactly about those relationships. Ender is very gifted, but an outcast, physically and mentally bullied by others. Even his interaction with The Game is hit/miss.This could've been a great movie that squandered the source material (for whatever reason(s)). I just hope future movies will take note when dealing with such a highly loved source material.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

For every success like The Hunger Games, we get a movie much like The Host. Based on what is considered one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever written, Gavin Hood delivers an entertaining mix of The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Starship Troopers, with his adaptation of Ender's Game.50 years after Earth repelled an invasion from an ant like alien race called the Formics, Earth's society has become highly militarised, fearing a second invasion. From a young age, children are taught using computer games to develop military skills and fight a future war. These children and teenagers minds have become so advanced and intelligent, that they're able to process data and comprehend much more than most adults can.Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is a skilled cadet at the International Fleet and is being groomed by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) to be the great leader to win the war against the Formics. Ender is taken to Battle School, where Ender rapidly rises up the ranks. Though Ender's tactical ability is never in doubt, he has an internal crisis between his violent and humane sides.Ignoring the controversy involving Orson Scott Card and his vile views, Ender's Game is well structured sci-fi movie. Director Gavin Hood has shown a massive improvement to his previous effort X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with improved storytelling, substance and special effects. Hood assembles a dream cast with the likes of Butterfield, Ford, Viola Davis, Hailee Steinfeld and Sir Ben Kingsley just to name a few. As expected from a cast of that calibre, most of the cast give strong performances, centred around Butterfield performance, given a difficult role of someone who is emotionally cold, highly intelligent and has to show what he is feeling with subtle looks: and Butterfield does it well, showing his talent at his young age. The character of Ender himself does come off as someone who is simply perfect at everything he does.The screenplay does keep to the structure of a novel, as it is easy to tell when chapters would have start: we go from Ender seemingly being kicked out of school, Ender getting emitted to Battle School, Ender joining a team, Ender commanding his own team, etc... Ender's Game sticks very much to its themes about this military society and the effects on the youth. Throughout the movie there are constant themes of manipulation, from Colonel Graff's manipulation of Ender, Ender's manipulation of other students and the culture of competition within teams and against teams. This theme also leads to the emphasis and expectations placed upon Ender, the effects on him and the doubts it might cause, as we look at an extreme of overbearing education.Hood improves massively as an action director and has always shown what he is capable with the dramatic elements. The stand out set pieces are the zero gravity training sequences, as it showcases the evolution of the students and their ability for tactics in a 3D environment, accompanied with Steve Jablonsky's soaring score where he uses his Inception style horns. The final battle is a tense and well crafted sequence with excellent CGI.For a movie based on a popular and critically acclaimed novel that is revered by many, it felt like some parts of the story were only given the briefest look. Moments that were only hinted at were Ender's older brother's violent tendencies and it is only near the end when there is a debate about the Formics and their motives. But Card himself was a producer, so he must have signed off or approved the changes.While Ender's Game does have solid action set-pieces, the movie is at its best focusing on its themes and character development, working as a moral tale and a compelling sci-fi story. For a movie that will be shoehorned into the teen genre, it is a going to be one of the strongest because of the strength of the story, performances and source material.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

We won't bother with characterization, we don't deal with dialog, we don't even need a script! We have a book and we have special effects! What can possibly go wrong? The answer: Ender's Game.

I like the explosions, action, vehicles, environments etc. I get really hyped up when I see a good trailer for a movie especially with good veteran actors. In this case Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley. The trailer for Ender's Game had all the elements I like. And a kid in middle of all, seemed like a good concept. I am also not a good reader. I wait for Hollywood to make good movies from books so I don't have to read them. I did that with Harry Potter, currently doing with Hunger Games. So I had no idea what the story was going to be, neither the trailer gave much. So, why did I gave this movie 3 rating only? Because, When I went to see this movie blank headed and found out that the movie is just an extension of the trailer. There is no extra explosion, action, etc. Nothing extra that could excite me. The movie turned out to be like one of M. Night Shyamalan, trying to have a big twist in the end. That could have worked also but the climax was also expected. every body in the hall had guessed it, and joking about the poor boy.Moral: Never go by the trailer. Listen to your friend who is a big movie buff than you are. And the most Important of all, Read books.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

So, I won't be one of those ""Oh I read the book, here are all the differences that ruined the film"". Instead this will be about the film itself. No spoilers.When I first heard of this film I thought it would be another one of those ""Underdog"" films. And it was. They don't always work, but this one got it right. Enders (Asa Butterfield) was a great choice. His acting will surly give him a decent future. The main reason for me watching this was of course, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford). An uptight, ridged ""bleep"" whose only thought is of his planet. No possibly or maybe. Black and white do or die attitude. Ball Breaker. Different role that I am used to seeing him in, but great none the less. Even the short role by Ben Kingsley was good. Most of the other cast was young and relatively unknown, but every one of them added to the movie is a good way.The training scenes were brilliant, just like you would imagine a military school to be like, except in space. The battle scenes, although few, were great. I can't actually fault the film. The end was surprising, not how I expected it to go. The very end though...not sure if it was left open for a sequel or a bit of a let down. Which is why it didn't get a 10. Overall though, very good film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have tried to like this movie and see it outside the confines of the book, but it's falls so short of what it could be and still makes me mad years later. The special effects were admittedly decent, but the directing and script were filth. Hood talked about wanting to stay true to the novel but he changed really critical elements. Also, I love the cast but they didn't do the film any favours. I feel like Hood cast Academy Award Winners/Nominees in hopes of riding their coat-tails and covering up his abysmal script and lack of vision. The only redeeming qualities is the visual effects.I know everybody always says this, but you're really better off reading the book - or better yet, listening to it.

Besides all that the graphics for the games are beautifully done, the music good, the pace of the plot fast enough to keep you interested.

Ender is a kid who's been training and fighting all his life. So why would anyone cast the least athletic pre-teen on the planet to play him? Whenever he got into his fighting stance he reminded me of my kid sister when she was 6. Don't get me wrong, the Asa gave it a good try, but he never even came close to selling that he was the most tactical, motivating, brilliant leader all of earth had to offer.I give it a five simply because the fx were good and the overall story (regardless of its execution) was still entertaining...ish.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie is the exact opposite - and I strongly believe it will be the same for anyone else who has read the book. Even if you haven't read the book, you probably won't like it anyway. There was just way too many plot points that were cut out, rearranged, raced through and mashed together to make it fit into a movie length. In my opinion, they would need at least 2 movies to cover the book properly - and I think that is the main problem here. The film felt like they only read every 10th page of the book and then occasionally they would skip a chapter or two. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has read the books and is a major disappointment. I know I am comparing heavily to the book, but I think most people watching this film would have read the book. If you are one of the few who haven't, I recommend you don't watch this - the book is on another completely different level and you time and money is better spent reading the book.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

When you finally reach them their flawed execution will only aggravate you further.If there was the option to give a zero this movie truly would deserve it. In fact this movie warrants the adaptation of the rating system so that zero is a score you can give.As a closing note: as someone who has played computer games (or as they call it in the movie simulations) No you cannot control spaceships light years away in real time ever heard of ping. No you cannot control that many units and hope to win the scenario with 10 actions per minute. I wished that the writers had actually done any research into gaming and professional gaming. They would quickly have noted that ping above a few seconds usually renders one hopeless and helpless i.e.: GGWP and that to compete merely controlling a small army on a map possibly 1/100th the scale of the mentioned battlefield one usually needs approximately 300 actions per minute.To the writers: n00bs uninstall.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie appears to quite closely follow the original work -- as best as I can remember.It is never a good idea to compare a lengthy book to a movie as there is simply no way that you can ever cover the same details. The book is 384 pages and would take the average reader over 6 hours to read. It is simply common sense that no 2-hour movie can cover the same material.I found the overall feeling of the movie to be very good with just the right amount of desperation to the storyline. Ideas are presented without the director feeling the need to pound them into our heads. The SciFi purist will be offended by the seemingly unavoidable desire of directors to have noise in space, but we seem to be stuck with that despite the success of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The music is, unfortunately, overdone and intrusive and keeps me from rating it higher.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't let yourself think too much about that or anything else regarding this movie, though. The story doesn't allow for thought. He actually is most likely doing the best he can and it's clearly a monumental effort. The director seems to be trying as hard as he can as well. At least to please the fan boys. Because no one else is going to admire much of what's in this third rate movie. However, no movie is a complete disaster when it offers the chance to see Harrison Ford aging before your very eyes and another opportunity to ask, ""what the heck is Ben Kingsley doing in this mess?""","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

A shame they didn't do a sequel although I understand this was effected by boycotts of the film due to the author's ridiculous and hateful views on LGBT issues. Putting that aside I liked this film a lot.I thought the special effects were great and the scenes of the training room were very reminiscent of a VR game of the Quest. I thought the main actor did a brilliant job as well as all the other actors. The alien creatures effects were beautiful. I would recommend this wholeheartedly.I did not expect the ending and it was thought provoking and interesting.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie never gives information on why these aliens came. It looks like they were just passing and humans started to attack it for no reason. A character explains they were after stealing water but if you had primary school education you may know how far the closest planet that may have life is so until they can come here they can supply lots of water they can use until the universe is no more so it doesn't make sense why would an alien race come to Earth to steal water. If the alien race wanted to destroy humanity they wouldn't send one ship anyway. They can just send a big rocket that can destroy the planet. They left the answer for the audience to figure out or decide but this is not The Matrix that the philosophy is fun to think of in the Matrix. There is no philosophy or decent scientific POV in this movie.So in this initial attack millions of alien space ship cannot attack one military jet of human even though you see they fire at him and he eventually kamikaze to alien ship. It just doesn't make sense.Another no logical aspect of the movie is aliens are literally bugs but how could they even build a spaceship when they lack hands that can do complex stuff with fingers? I had a theory that they were used by another alien race to draw humanity to trap them or something but the story actually doesn't exist. There are aliens and humanity wanna destroy it. The plot is that simple.The initial battle with aliens looked so easy I have no idea why humanity gave the same reaction to it as in real life some countries reacted to WW1 because they were almost erased from history and became slaves of European countries as a race so much for a century their whole society is militaristic and mandatory military service is must for citizens, at least only for males.Technological advancement of humanity doesn't make sense. In a short time like 50 years they can travel between galaxies when the initial attack was made with ordinary military planes of today.I understand it may make sense to whoever wrote the story when they use a child to make them a soldier but the story doesn't make sense so much all the high-ranking leaders of the military look for a kid who can be the commander of the entire fleet that can destroy these aliens. Yeah, among all real deal soldiers who have very high rank what Ender does suppose to be something no one can do but in reality it's not. Ender is not actually a rare person. It's just everyone around him, especially other kids are just unrealistically bad because even though they live in such a situation they act like kindergarten kids even the kids who are supposed to be so special they were chosen for the special school in the space yet especially one of them absolutely have mental issues that in reality he couldn't even past to middle school. So if the story made sense Colonel Graff and the legendary soldier Mazer Rackham could lead the entire fleet.The movie made battle arena games too long while for no good reason focused so much on that. And to make that chapter not boring for pervert guys they introduced a girl that was unusually friendly and flirty to Ender. It just doesn't make sense.One of the guys in this special school is clearly mentally ill which in a real army such people cannot have a rank and cannot be tasked with anything important in war situations. When there is no war situation such people would be kicked out of the army yet for the story point to make things dramatic, even though high ranking officers are aware of the situation they let him basically kill the chosen kid but it backfired so the chosen kid almost killed him. Why he cried like a baby for self-defense that crazy toxic kid doesn't make sense.Around this part of the movie whoever wrote the script decided what happening in the background of the story that they didn't show us. So Ender is sleeping for a 5 seconds but it turns out it been a while like a month. The hell? Not to mention according to the movie time doesn't exist. You can get a sense of everything that happened in 10 minutes or 1 year. Cannot decide which. If you judge the time by scenes and what happens you can say entire of the entire movie takes place at least in 2 months.So we see aliens are coming to Earth and they will arrive in 28 days yet after that scene we watch Ender's Karate Kid-esque ""training"" scene for a long time and after that scene Ender cries they practicing for a month so where are the aliens?That being said aliens were seeming to attack Earth but in reality actually they don't care and they looking for water around the universe.The movie tries to make Ender a genius who figures out stuff magically but it doesn't make sense how he couldn't figure out simulations weren't actually simulations.Ender genocide entire alien species and thus wins the battle without even knowing but loses his humanity by dying inside so they make him faint so he can calm down. After he wakes up and runs outside no one from the base but the girl runs after him. And he finds an alien bug just outside of the base. It doesn't make sense when they didn't scan the area at all. And the alien gives Ender the baby queen alien bug but why the hell they were there in the first place?So we learn that the alien tried to tell Ender where it's and it basically doesn't make sense. Why tell the enemy where you are?Why Ender felt personally obligated to take care of the alien bug and how no one decided to check on what the hell Ender doing doesn't make sense. They basically made him admiral and gave him space ship so he could do whatever he wanted all alone. The hell?Overall Ender seemed like a promising character but since the movie is bad character cannot be good. I especially liked the ""battle orchestra"" scenes around the end of the movie and that's much about it.And finally I have to drop the bomb on the really stupid aspect of the movie. For a long time we watched battle games in the special school in space in which students used their own bodies and pistols to fight but due to the scale and type of the battle they were preparing none of these kids actually used their own bodies and weapons to fight the war. They basically used space ship so they should have invested in spaceship education instead of firearms and close combat fighting. After all in the movie all the power of these alien race is their space ship so no one would ever punch space ships or attack them with fire arms, they have space ships instead after all LOL.Miscellaneous things that don't make sense:None of the students seems like military students at all. They don't have the tough, prideful, protective and caring attitude at all. Not even a cliche American soldier attitude at all.For some reason girls are free to have long hairs even in space.Part of real-life military training involves no distraction that includes no contact with family and no playing games. Books are used to educate soldiers and offer a sense of entertainment for their very rare and short free time if they ever have it. That being said soldiers are intentionally forced to be bored so to have fun they will naturally do their work and educate themselves in any way the army allows them. Yet in this movie soldiers have access to a video game console that they can use to play a game and who knows what. And Ender also sends lots of email to his sister only but the movie doesn't explain why Ender has no care for his parents. Ender seemed to be sexually interested in his own sister and his sister seemed to feel the same. Their whole relationship is never explained and is very awkward.Ender's family and society's take on making babies seems more complex than the movie actually cares to tell. For some reason Ender gives importance to being the 3rd kid and his parents made comments like making 3rd kid illegal or something. I guess people need a licence or permission to make 3rd kids.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Parts of the book were simply left out, which is fine, but too much was missing to fully understand what's happening and why.

Visually, the effects were pleasing and I enjoyed the designs. Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld both captured the essence of their characters from the books, I enjoyed their performances throughout.As is the case with many books made into movies, details from the novel were cut for time and spacing. As a result, some of the finer points get lost in translation such as Mazor Tam's full background and interactions with Ender. The relationship between Ender and his siblings, as well as the background events to Ender's story in the novel, are largely glossed over.In the end, the story remains true in concept to the novel and I think gives the audience something to contemplate by the end of it. If you haven't read the book, please avoid spoilers as the ending will have more impact if it comes as a surprise.All in all, it's a well done movie and I would highly recommend it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Very talented young man. The special effects are also pretty spectacular, really immersing the viewer in the grim world of battle school and the Formics (the ""Buggers"" in the novels) and the movie plot is still complicated enough to be a fun ride to be on regardless.If you have read the books or heard about it from someone else, you know that most of the novel takes place as internal monologue inside Ender's head. This is what made Asa's performance even more impressive as he had to act out these internal thoughts and emotions through the use of only facial expressions, tone of voice and eye movements. There is no constant use of a cheesy narrator speaking his thoughts which the director could have resorted to, but, luckily, did not.For the given runtime of just under 2 hours, they did the best job they could adapting this novel to the silver screen, keeping exactly which was needed, spending more time on elements that were critical for the viewer to understand, and cutting/combining some characters to reduce confusion (otherwise the minor roles really would have gotten too little time and no development). An exceptional job was done developing Ender, basically giving him all the character depth found in the novel even under these time constraints.That said, characters such as Valentine and Peter, who were major characters in the novel, suffered greatly due to the constraint of the 2 hour runtime, as their entire subplot was cut out. Granted, if they did this as a mini-series, it could have been much more comprehensive to cover some of these and other subplots in the book. But if one is given enough runtime only to focus on the main plot of this book (and, that of a book of mostly internal monologues), this adaption is about as good as an adaption could get of this novel under these constraints of time and medium.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

However, not even all the cheap psychology used to dissect Ender manages to make him the least bit interesting, as the boy starts out as a boring individual and only gets worse over the next two hours. The most serious thing, however, is realizing how the film never bothers to justify all the faith placed in the title character by everyone around him - especially the experienced Graff, who seems to believe he is dealing with a ""chosen one"" like Neo from The Matrix. Or a skinny mini-Jesus given to outbursts of violence. ""I've never seen anyone do that!"", says, for example, the major played by Viola Davis at one point, but without explaining what's so special about what the boy did.Likewise, when Graff says that Ender is ""the only one to use his brain"" among the cadets, such a statement (triggered by the boy's laughter) sounds gratuitous and unwarranted. It is frustrating, therefore, to realize that this dynamic is maintained throughout the entire projection, as we often see someone bow before Ender's ""intelligence"" or ""skills"" for some mysterious reason (in quotes for never witnessing them) - and when Sergeant Dap (Anozie) salutes the kid after saying he would never treat him like a superior, we are left to question why this seasoned soldier is bowing down to a kid no more qualified than his peers. Yes, we see Graff look on in awe as ""Neo"" fires his weapons while spinning in zero gravity during a workout, but considering the guy is also being hit by countless bullets, it's hard to appreciate his evasive maneuvers. Inhabited by a gallery of caricatures (the antagonist Bonzo Madrid is one of the worst), ""O Jogo do Terminator"" still invests in clichés such as the beginning of a romance between the title character and his colleague Petra (Steinfeld, so fantastic in ""Bravura Indomitable"" and so inexpressive here), also sinning by seeming to try to become a ""Born to Kill"" Junior through the irritating screaming of Sergeant Dap. To make matters worse, the film still features a Ben Kingsley bordering on ridiculous when we already thought that the card of one-dimensional characters was completely filled.There are several other problems with this film version of Ender's Game, and they range from the linear and predictable script, the unmotivated cast, to the conventional and uninspired direction. With an exaggeratedly imposing soundtrack (courtesy of Steve Jablonsky, the same as the ""Transformers"" saga), the narrative is absurdly correct, without revelations, twists or surprises - everything happens exactly as expected, and it is possible to imagine each step-in advance. If Butterfield has seen better days (as in the Oscar-winning Hugo (2011), Ford's participation is as embarrassing as that of Sean Connery in The Extraordinary League (2003) - a fiasco that led to his retirement before foreseen. We also have two Oscar-nominated teenagers - Hailee Steinfeld, for True Grit (2010), and Abigail Breslin, for Little Miss Sunshine (2006) - completely wasted, in addition to two respectable actors - Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley - appearing in supporting roles. Luxurious.This challenge of compressing the book without losing its strength - which is precisely the passage of time and the repetition of training situations at the academy - is the main obstacle in the path of screenwriter and director Gavin Hood. It eliminates the entire geopolitical and ideological subplot on Earth (which ends up reducing the importance of the Ender brothers to a minimum) and focuses on the zero gravity games, which after all are the big draw of Ender's Game in cinematic terms. The result is a film that timidly flirts with the spectacle and, in the obligation to be faithful to the source material, dilutes the many ideas of the book. It can be frustrating for Card readers, for example, to identify familiar characters from the series and see that they lose their meaning - like Bean, who no longer represents the continuity of Ender's training and becomes just one more in the squadron. Important issues such as the hero's isolation are mitigated: in the film, all of Ender's friends accompany him on his journey, even when he changes teams at the academy. These are specific problems that add up to the main thing: at no time does Ender seem to age (and mature) in fact, physically or mentally. When Card published The Terminator Game, science fiction cinema was already trying to assimilate the new approximation between videogames and reality, with films like War Games (1983) and The Last Starfighter (1984). In the same way that many people question the morality of ""Ender's Game"" (which seeks justifications for the protagonist's bad acts), placing the book in this perspective, alongside other works, helps to remove all the self-importance slime that has accumulated about him over the years.Definitely the film's biggest problem is its lack of believability. The training and portrayal of the children do not lend any seriousness to the film. Everything seems like a video game and children leading star fleets acting and talking like adults is not easy to accept. There is no explanation why children are used for this, whereas they could be trained longer. The feature film could have asked questions, posed questions related to the banality of war (controversy Ing the use of drones), the fact that commanders stayed away from the battlefield, controlling everything as in a game and the seriousness of putting children to war. Instead, we see shallow moral problems, which only at the end give a hint of what they might be.The script's numerous clichés don't help either, taking away any innovation from the plot. This is further accentuated by the fact that the entire film takes place during Ender's training, which ends up taking away the tension and sense of urgency from the much talked about Formics, which left so many innocent people dead (this is repeated almost throughout the film). As if all these elements were not enough, which end up taking away the immersion of the work, making it boring, the film also has numerous letters written by Ender to his sister. In several scenes we hear the voice-over narration of these letters, which are entirely unnecessary - an explanation of what we are already seeing on the screen, as if they did not believe in the intelligence of the spectators.There is a certain absurdity in the plot created that bothers at various times. It's okay that an alien attack is a trauma, but people start to live forever due to a possible new attack sounds strange. And even stranger that after so many years of waiting without an answer, it prefers to simply go after the enemy to attack, instead of defending itself as was the initial plan, making us worse than them. This dubiousness is present throughout the film, especially with regard to the boy Ender Wiggin, who is constantly charged for his attitudes. One moment, Graff is thrilled that he hit a kid, the next, he's screaming that he can't become a ""psychopath"" like his brother. All this, while he himself wants to exterminate a race because it was once a threat to our planet.Everything is strategy, he defends himself. It doesn't matter the act, but why you performed it. What enchants him about Ender is the boy's strategic ability. And this we cannot deny that he has in excess. It's really impressive how he has an overview of the ""field"" of battle and how he creates strategies unthinkable by others to achieve goals. However, even if he is all that, it is very strange the way he rises in rank so quickly. A desperation that doesn't seem justified and that, when the details are revealed, becomes almost sickening. Maybe that's why Viola Davis' character, who seemed the only sensible one, simply disappears at a certain point in the plot. This disappearance is even more strange taking into account certain attitudes of Ender.Without bothering to create a minimally cohesive logic in the photograph, which, cold most of the time, bets on warm tones precisely by focusing on dramatic conversations like the one set by a lake (thus weakening the anguish of the situation), ""Ender's Game"" finally gains some interest thanks to a revelation already in the third act, when he is willing to discuss particularly complex moral issues. (Still, one has to ask - without giving away anything major - why Ender is so shaken, since he should have known, he would eventually have to do exactly what he did.) Sadly, though, even this thematic attempt is soon replaced by a denouement. Fool who, remaining open, appears more concerned with making continuations possible than with tying up the story he has been telling. With one-sided characters, an unlikely theory - the fate of the world is placed in the hands of children thanks to their talent at... video games! - and half-hearted visual effects, ""Ender's Game"" seems content to be an exclusive by-product for fans devoid of bigger and broader references. It speaks of and for a limited universe, as restricted as the result presented.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you haven't read the book, it's unlikely you'll even fully understand it! And for the same reason.The whole thing feels rushed like its a summary of a much longer film. From the quick and pretty uninformative conversations to the shallow characters with literally zero development. Even the music score feels like it was added as an afterthought to give this ""previously on.."" a sense of urgency as you wait to see what's going to happen on today's episode.
I get that its a relatively short film based on a quite meaty and at times philosophical book. I understand that they had to leave out several sub-plots and a few minor character arcs. I'm fine with that. But I'm not ok with ignoring the development of the titular character and completely changing his personality. And I'm not ok with a movie making no sense unless you have read the book.
The source material would have been much more suited to a miniseries style adaptation, or perhaps no adaptation at all. But it certainly fails dramatically as a film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Really Well Done!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2898374/?ref_=tt_urv","sifter42","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6932135/?ref_=tt_urv","1 November 2013","If I sound critical at all, please note that I did really like the movie. My issues with it are more ""nitpicky"" - looking for small things to improve when the overall movie was well done. Off the top I'll give it a 9/10. No spoilers here, no worries about that! ;) For the sake of context, I went to see the movie with a group of 5 friends, 2 of which had not read the book.The visuals and action were spectacular. The book was published back in 1985, so they also made some needed ""upgrades"" to the technology shown in the movie. They did a really good job of re-imagining how everything would function, and making it easier for a person to follow visually. The acting was really well done as well. From what I understand they did have to make the younger characters older in the movie vs. the book. This was apparently done so that the actors were more mature and able to handle the script and the events that happen during the movie storyline. The ""age change"" didn't take anything away from the movie experience though. Since the movie didn't change the overall plot, the storyline itself was as great as I remembered it was (in the book).In the movie, they obviously left out a lot of the details from the book. Even with the movie being over 2 hours long, to me it still felt rushed. According to the two people who hadn't read the books, they didn't feel that way at all. I'm guessing it felt rushed to me simply because they had to incorporate such a large number of events into the movie for the sake of viewing time. Some of my favorite parts in the book were left out, but all in all it seemed like the major plot points carried through loud and clear. The movie basically goes from step to step so quickly that the ""action"" so to speak never really stops. Most of the slower parts of the book were sped up quite a bit (which makes sense of course).The character development was also very very summarized. You don't learn nearly as much about the characters in the movie. For example, some of the characters like Bean have such a good back story and viewpoint that the author went back years later and re-wrote the entire time frame from Bean's perspective (in a new completely separate book). A lot of the friendships between the kids are missed too. The movie focuses heavily on Ender's relationship with one character, and the really important friendships with two of the other main characters are minimalized. Again, I totally understand that they had to limit how much time is spent on character relationships within a 2 hour movie.There were a few script changes between the movie and the book, but nothing major. There was no huge difference to get upset about, and all in all I think they covered their bases well. This makes sense since the book's author also co-produced the movie. I did notice a few things were made ""nicer"" in the movie vs. the books, but with movie ratings and intended audience nowadays - it made sense to me. I won't go into any specifics on the changes between the book and the movie here, simply to avoid spoiling the movie (or book) for anyone. Just rest assured that the movie in no way ""ruins"" the original plot or purpose compared to the book.My only two ""big"" negatives about the movie were the timeline and the characters. For the timeline, I mean to say that it felt like they could have made 3 separate movies instead of just 1. I'm guessing if they had more optimistic expectations of how well the movie would do in the box office - we would had a trilogy instead. I'm not saying I wasn't happy with the movie... I'm just saying that they could have done a more complete job of it if they had 4 more hours to do it with. ;) Hypothetically if they *had* made this book into a movie trilogy, you had better believe that I'd be at opening night for every one of them! As for the character issues, again that was more of a ""we only have 2 hours for this movie"" kind of thing. There could have been a ton more character development; if only they had the time to do it. The other big issue is that a movie can't really convey what a character is thinking (aside form cheesy voice overs in some other movies). An overwhelming majority of the book takes place within Ender's thoughts. The book has so many interesting viewpoints, thought processes, feelings, etc. regarding what Ender thinks about and does. There is a lot of background information and motivations that make Ender follow the paths that he follows in the story. You get some of it due to clever script writing, but a lot of that understanding and character appeal is missed. Like I said I don't really see a way around this. There is a reason why this concept is always mentioned when people say ""the book is better than the movie"".All in all though, I thought they did a great job with the Enders Game movie. It's worth watching no matter if you have read the book or not - it's that good. 9/10, enough said. ;)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

While the story line is followed for the most part, the movie just isn't as convincing as your own imagination.

I almost think they should have changed the story and used characters that were a bit older, maybe than it would be a bit more believable. I wonder if they will make any of the other books in the quartet into movies? Anyway, I guess the writer of the book thought the movie was pretty good and similar to what he envisioned in his head but this movie is for kids IMO.

I'm disappointed in the end. The whole movie centers around Ender, a young boy who's lack of emotions is disturbing. He fights his way up the ranks and the movie follows his path to glory. Enders goal is to protect earth against an unknown enemy, but they could easily have been replaced Nazis's or Americans for that matter. It's a nameless and almost faceless enemy and I didn't really care much about them at all. Instead, Ender does. Which is strange, because he's depicted as a stone cold killer with only a hint of compassion in his body. Yes, I know, he has some trouble with bullies, seems to care about a dude who gets hurt because of his actions and he seems to love his sister, but the acting didn't convince me of that at all. To me, Ender is too one dimensional, a boy who lacks emotion and compassion. In the movie he's a cold and calculating boy and I didn't really care about him. And that is the main problem with this movie. It's almost impossible to picture yourself in the footsteps of the main characters. That makes this a movie I don't care about.

After much internal debate (both for political reasons - which I'll touch on later - and for fear of being disappointed)I decided that I did want to risk seeing it during it's theatrical release.I was glad that I did. This was an astonishingly good adaptation. It managed to avoid becoming yet another action flick set in space, and didn't shy away from the deeper questions raised by the book.(A few scenes were softened: replacing 2 deaths with ""hospitalization"" - which I'm sure was done for the PG13 rating - and making video games deaths far less gruesome.) That being said, this is an adaptation. Film and literature are completely different media and have different strengths. While all the important scenes were touched on, the time frame was very condensed in the film. While in the novel, Ender is in battle school for years, the film gives the impression that this all takes place over a few months.One benefit to this condensation is that it makes the casting of Asa Butterfield far more reasonable. He (and the other actors) are MUCH too old for the characters in the beginning of the story, if one goes by the novel, but are a reasonable age for where they are by the end.I would have liked to see more of the mind game, and also more Peter. But all in all, a much better adaptation than I'd feared.Regarding the boycott: While Orson Scott Card's anti-gay politics are not portrayed in this movie, I will still be donating the price of my and my husband's ticket to the ACLU. I encourage any others who enjoy quality SF but to not support OSC's anti-gay agenda to make a similar donation to the LGBT or human rights organization of their choice.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

He was acting and reacting to things that exist in our world, some more fantastic than others but at the base they were all things that one can find in the world. Ender Wiggin is nothing like anyone he could encounter. A kid, a genius, a master of strategy, an intellectual grownup trapped in the body of a child with compassion and understanding far surpassing his tender age. And he pulls this one off superbly. As he's now Asa Butterfield is one of the finest actors around. The rest of the film is not important, it is a shallowing down of the book, but it does keep the core plot intact. It does some stupid Hollywood changes like hinting a budding romance between Ender and Petra, and since the child employment laws force the age of the actors a few years above the age of the characters in the story, it almost makes sense to shift the prepubescent friendships of the book with a post pubescent budding romance. Luckily they didn't lay to much story lines on this change, and didn't push it too far. I guess the Orson Scott Card masterpiece is such a classic by now that even Hollywood scriptwriters didn't dare tinkering with it too much. Visually the film is of a very high class, despite not using the 3D trick that could be easily justified in this case they still made me feel slightly disorientated more than once when entering the weightless battle room. The bottom line is a long one in this case, it's not the masterpiece the book is, but it treats the story with due respect; it eliminates some of the brightest aspect of the book like forecasting the internet and social networks as early as 1985 and understanding their implications before they were there to see. And still the lead character of Ender is so strong and its portrayal by Asa Butterfield is so amazing that everything else pales into insignificance, which makes this movie worth seeing even as a prelude to reading the book itself.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

First is the pacing. The movie feels like rushing from scene to scene without letting the seen sink in. Second the character development is very poorly executed. This might be because the movie tries to fit a very detailed book (just assuming) into a 2 hours movie for everybody. Besides ender no character seems to go through any development and even the protagonist is most of the time not really comprehensible.
So I rate this movie a
7/10 for the idea
3/10 for the actual movie","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I would love to see what the director could have done with another hour, as time was obviously a limiting factor. But the cuts to the story were surgical and precise, allowing what was left to have its maximum impact.The acting was superb, and made me miss some of the characters even more. But time constraints are time constraints and that's films for you.The special effects were so good that they stopped being special effects for me. Although I have to say some of the zero-G acting was a little off.The ending was slightly changed for reasons I don't really understand, and a big reveal was hinted at a little too much.

Ender is the only one who shows sign of actually engaging a tactical brain seems to be lost on the other bullies whose response to losing to a better boy is to lash out. It actually makes the people running the entire academy look like a bunch of incompetents when there is a looming alien threat.There are some good special effects, Asa Butterfield shows spirit as Ender but this is a franchise that is not going very far.","13 out of 39 found this helpful.

Well Ender's Game is all up there together with Oblivion and Pacific Rim, to clock right in between them. I haven't seen Gravity yet, but what a sci-fi year this is!I enjoyed Ender's game way more than I expected. I haven't read the books, and knew little in beforehand, but the film has triggered my mind into checking it out. The trailer didn't say much, and gives the film a flat form of being a film for youths. Well it isn't - only. this is a film made with both a heart and a brain. What more can you crave and expect? Not unlike ""The Hunger Games"" in the sincerity, but with a lot more to offer sci-fi wise.What's it about? Young Ender, only 12-13 years of age, is so tactical smart and good at playing games in a future world that needs this ability to make sure the drones with win a war of the worlds. young Ender is the chosen one. Together with the kids he gets military training make sure the end of all future wars. But this is Ender's game, isn't it? I had a blast watching this, expecting it to be mediocre after most of the reviews, but it's better than most reviews, and still not entirely top notch. Why? Because the film actually takes itself a tad too seriously. There's too much of the pathos, maybe thanks to Harrison Ford. He does great, but are maybe too serious. Well, I know it's meant to be serious, and dealing with serious and thoughtful matters, wanting you to give food for thoughts. Still I can see that some will find it up for raspberry nominations due to this.Still I loved so much the visuals in this, that I won't hold that against it. The universe of this film is so brilliantly made, that together with Oblivion and The Lord of the Rings this tells me that no illusion is impossible to make. And it looks as real as can be.Imrpressive also from young Asa Butterfield. It's almost impossible for a guy that young being able to hold up a movie like this. He does great, and only falters a couple of times. Still he is to be young, even in the film. That is the point. Even though the seriousness takes over a couple of times, there's no doubt the cast loved the work in this. Harrison Ford is better than for years! This is Gavin Hoods first memorable film so far. He's on his way up! A couple of quotes was enough for me to watch this again. You don't have to have kids to go watch this, but if you do, bring them! You don't even need the kid inside you, because this is quite grown up film making!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not particularly picky with adaptations, I have liked plenty of them, but this is maybe the 1st adaptation I really disliked.Such a long story, with all the character development present in the books, required 3 hours as a minimum, maybe even 2 separate movies or even a 10 hour TV series. After watching this, the feeling I get is that I have just watch a trailer for a movie or a history documentary resuming years of training/war in a small documentary. Entire battles are crammed up in a few seconds, there are only 2 battle room battles in the entire movie, each lasting a minute or less!!! With the exception of a couple of scenes there is very little dialog that help you with characterization.The battle room looks great and the academy too. Other then that you're better off reading the books then maybe watch the movie, just to see a nice interpretation of the battle room.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The movie sadly does not come close to the book, not just in terms of the amount of detail, but most importantly in the development of Ender as a person. In fact, i think, most of the characters in the movie are flat, almost cartoonish. Even Harrison Ford does not get much opportunity to act. Overall directing is low average at best. Another important drawback is the fact that to the people who have never read the original, the movie will probably seem quite confusing and superficial. The Ender Saga is a rare kind of science fiction that draws upon amazing scientific ideas that are just glossed over in the film. The 4/10 rating that i give here is just for special effects.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

If I said this move was dull it would be a complete understatement. It was nearly as bad as Battlefield Earth and that was pretty dreadful (mind you, the book of Battlefield Earth is great). Luckily I went on half price day at the local cinema.Anyway, I'm a Sci-fi movie veteran and sadly Enders Game will be shuffled to the back of my list of memorable Sci-Fi movies. Not right at the back but very close. It reminded me of 1984 movie 'The Last Starfighter' that as I recall was much more entertaining. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford. But why he's in this move I have no idea. What a waste of his talent. He is rumoured for Star Wars 7 and if so, I hope they make him less grumpy in that. I can only liken to his scripted portrayal of recruiting Officer Colonel Graff to Victor Meldrew.in space (if you don't know who that is then look it up). Yet again we see Enders Game relying on the recent and now predictable familiar Hollywood sci-fi movie making format. Basically same ol' same ol' story and loads of special effects. What's worse, nothing new appears to be on the horizon that will mix true science fiction story with today's 1st rate special effects. It appears only The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has really delivered there. Then again that's mythology but then againit's a great story! Saying thatThe Hobbit in 3 movies? I don't think so.Honestly readers, there are hundreds of fabulous Sci-Fi books written by fabulous authors dating right back to at least the 50's. If some of these were sensitively made, they would be so much more entertaining than the dull Enders Game.Conclusion:Some books should remain books forever and never make it to the silver screen. I'm afraid that Enders Game is one of them.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In my case, reading the first nine books indicates my bias. And yet, leaving the movie theatre, I wasn't disappointed, didn't feel misled or cheated. The essence of the story, the challenges Ender faces, are all there. If anything, moral dilemmas that are only hovered above in the book are in the forefront in the movie, easily triggering a good post movie moral discussion. It's a solid 8 movie, maybe 8.5. Why not more? I have a nagging suspicion that unless you read the book prior to the movie, Ender, Bernard, even Peter and Valentine's characters are flat, not really given an opportunity to show who they are. In Bernard's case, his character is practically rewritten, and it feels as if it was prompted by ""let's send an optimistic message about bullies."" I don't like it. This feeling was reinforced by the complete omission of the character of Rose the Nose, maybe for fear of an anti-Semitism/racism cry. With more than enough voices calling to boycott the movie as a protest against Orson Scott Card's views, this may have been a reasonable decision. For me, however, there was no chance for a boycott. I love the cast, truly. Viola Davis delivers a strong character I can only admire, respect, and wish her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Trying to compare the interaction between Hugo and Georges Méliès to the one between Ender and Mazer Rackham led me to nothing. Wonder if there is any interview in which they talk about it. As for Asa Butterfield, this is his third movie that leaves me impressed beyond praises, the other two being Hugo and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. Asa's delivery of Ender's character is, coming to think about it, better than the literal Ender. And I don't think I ever felt this way about any other character. With as many appearances as he has, it is surprising that his only win was the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for youth in film. Maybe it's time it changed. GO!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The script has flattened the story so much, it is barely understandable for those that did not read the book, and even if then only in the most important parts. The rest is just Sci-Fi showmanship or gibberish.The book spends a lot of time on Ender's character development, his relationship within the family and the dynamics of his relations with multiple Battle School characters. The movie shows you only a very small part of it, and usually badly. The casting was not really fortunate: book's Ender was 6 when he joined Battle School, here he is a teenage boy from start; Bonzo Madrid was several years senior and much more developed physically, while in the movie he is a foot shorter... These are only examples. Nowhere you can see the immense work put by Orson Scott Card into describing the way Ender developed his Dragon Army, what kind of a leader he's been, why was he respected by his soldiers, etc. Col. Graff's character is flat, although very nicely played by Harrison Ford.There is a limit to artistic liberty in interpretation of acclaimed works. This film is way beyond that limit. Watch it at your own risk. You may very well like it, but if you liked the book, this is not very probable.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The man who used to be Harrison Ford either desperately needs any money he can get, or he's just so hungry to keep working that he'll take what he can get. Next I expect him to be guesting on the type of show that features the likes of Tonya Harding and Danny Bonaduce. And Ben Kingsley is right behind him. Hey, at one time their name on a flick meant something. What's this about? Okay, it's another alien invasion flick combined with kids who learn war with video games à la The Last Starfighter (the kid from a trailer court), and yet another of those tried and true attempts where a self-doubting person is drafted to take a bunch of losers and turn them into winners. The special effects were pretty good, but that doesn't make up for lack of a good story and people you care about. Nobody in this film moved me. I couldn't get interested in them or their problems or motives or anything else. It's just a shame that people who have, or used to have box office appeal, allow themselves to be dragged into these messes.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The philosophy in this film didn't make much sense for me either and nothing in this sci-fi world felt believable. It was like having to sit through watching my little brother play one of his video games. Gavin Hood has received a lot of hate for his 2009 Wolverine film, but I was a huge fan of his South African film Tsotsi so I did have some hope for this. I guess he should stick to smaller productions because big scale films don't seem to work for him. The screenplay is based on Orson Scott Card's famous book of the same name which I never had heard of so I can't rate this based on its faithfulness to it. What I can say is that there isn't really anything thought provoking about it, which is some of the praise the book received. Here the themes are lost under all the CGI and extended action scenes. There are a lot of child actors in this film, which also hurt it a bit despite how much I like Abigail Breslin, Asa Butterfield, and Hailee Steinfeld. I didn't find anything spectacular form Harrison Ford's performance either, although I understand all the excitement from fanboys getting to see him back in space again. I just found this film hard to endure at times and found it a bit too grim and serious considering the subject matter.Seventy years after an alien race known as the Formics attacked Earth and almost wiped out its existence if it weren't for Commander Mazer Rackham's (Ben Kingsley) heroics, Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) has been preparing a troop for the next attack. He has decided to attack the Formics at their home ground before they come back and destroy them, and in order to do so he has been training young children in hopes of discovering the next Mazer. He believes the one is Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a very quiet and shy boy who has unique strategizing skills. Graff brings him to space to begin his training at a battle school along with other elite kids like Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), Bean (Aramis Knight), Alai (Suraj Partha), and Bonzo (Moises Arias). Ender quickly shows his potential as he masters the training games by understanding the enemy. Despite Graff's assurance that Ender is the chosen one, Ender still fears he might fail because he hasn't quite understood the real enemy's motivation. Will he be able to save the human race? Are the Formics still a threat to humanity? These are questions racing through Ender's head as he begins to dislike who he's shaping up to be.I found Ender's Game to be one of the worst sci-fi pics of the year along with After Earth. There was nothing really thought provoking about it for me and it completely failed to engage me. This seems to be only the first chapter to a franchise I'm not really looking forward to enduring. I don't even feel inspired to write a proper review for this film and I don't really have much to say about it. There is no charm or appeal found here, and I never bought into the drama. The story could've at least used some dramatic tension to draw me in, but I never felt anything worth engaging in here.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

All the scenes were in the future and I felt like that was good because of all the technology It was very creative to think of putting the movie in the future but the question is why? I think that is because the director wanted it in the future because in nearly every alien or space movie it's set in the future. How the battle scenes were set out. The set was amazing it would've taken a lot of mathematical brains to figure out every part that needs math. It's really cool how they made it look like they were actually in space.Special effects were astonishing. I don't know how they made a man in green push them around and make it look like they're flying but that was really good. The aliens looked so realistic and I thought that was outstanding. All the stuff they used like the guns and cars were cool because it made you think if that's what the cars and guns would look like in the future. I really like how they made the alien's face with the special effects. It was awesome. The way they made the battle room was creative. The roles of the characters were alright. I don't think Abigail Breslin played a good role for Valentine. It was just boring every time she was in it. Harrison Ford played a good role because he was good at playing the head of the battle school. Asa Butterfield played a good role because he acted like a leader. Hailee Steinfeld acted well as Petra because she really acted like a good friend and a leader. I thought the main character (Ender) played a good role because he acted like a leader and really took pride in what he does. I don't think anyone else should of played his role because I think he's really a good actor in ender's game. It was strange how the fifteen-year-old children including Ender are that intelligent that they are smarter than Colonel Graff. Out of ten stars I would rate the movie 8.5 because of all the boring scenes. The second reason is they only showed two battles in the whole time when he was in battle school, not including the battles with the aliens. In the movie they left out some characters like Shen and more I don't know why? They left out some parts in the book meaning some chapters and I think that's a bit silly. Despite leaving out some people and chapters in the book, I would recommend the movie. If you like movies that are action and adventures I would guarantee this movie","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved it and all of the action. Comparing this movie to gravity shows that they both take place in space but Enders game is way more in depth and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There were some parts to the movie where I actually had a tear in my eye and that doesn't normally happen. This movie is a perfect ten out of ten. Amazing story, amazing characters, amazing CGI and effects and of course amazing pace that left this one of the best movies that I have watch this entire year.

This film was dire, truly dreadful, it was even worse than Shyalaman's ""After Earth"" and that's saying something! Practically the whole film was taken up by a sullen, pouting little brat and his sulks and temper tantrums, a kind of future version of Justin Bieber. The way all the figures in authority, Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley et al, just indulge the child filled me with the urge to vomit. The whole point of the film, the fight for the survival of the human race, took a back seat to this child. What is the matter with the film industry? Are there no decent directors who can make a good film any more? Most Sci-Fi blockbusters of the last few years have been pure drivel. There have been many good stories written only to be hacked to pieces by very mediocre screen writers, whose end results bears no relation to the original stories.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Do you think a 2 hours long movie can highlight all the details and conversation if the book is really that great and there is so much in it? Do you want to see a sequel (or a prequel, according to others about the lack of background story in this movie). Leave the movie alone and try not to use the book as an weapon to put up against the movie itself, after all, they are two fields of art and they both deserve to uphold their way to tell a story.Ender's game the movie chosen both the right child actors and adult. There's no missing link even to an outsider of the story. The visual effect and graphic design outstanding a lot of Hollywood movies by giving meaning to a lot of scenes. There is not a single unnecessary shot in this movie, very smooth. They gives a brief introduction, and a satisfying ending that i believe most movies fail to do so nowadays even with a great script, who knows why.If you have then watch the movie after reading this comment, and still rate this movie with 1 - 3 stars, i really don't think we have any thing to say here.This movie will rise up to my top 5 favorite, surprisingly.

The original novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel, not an easy feat since few have won both awards for the same book. (""Dune"" by Frank Herbert, ""The Left-Hand of Darkness"" by Ursula K. Le Guin, and ""Doomsday Book"" by Connie Willis are a few examples which are double winners.) After many starts and stops over a 20+ year period, ""Ender's Game"" has finally graced the big screen. And it has been worth the long wait.The screen adaptation of ""Ender's Game"" is one of the best among classic science fiction novels. (By contrast, the original ""Dune"" film directed by David Lynch was an atrocious screen version of Herbert's famous novel.) Where ""Ender's Game"" succeeds (and the original ""Dune"" film didn't) was because the former understood the sensibility of the story. While on the surface, the plot seems simple: a young cadet is in training at a kind of military space school. At the same time, the story is much deeper than merely a bunch of kids playing shoot 'em up in a weightless battlefield. Underlying the setting of a training school for pre-teen space soldiers (written over 10 years before Harry Potter) is the idea of how a youth becomes a leader among his/her peers. Is leadership in-born, or is it taught? Or does it come from facing adversity in which the person must find within him or herself the ability to be self-reliant? The administrators of the space school don't believe that leaders are born, but rather can be forged, like a sword. And Earth needs someone forged for the task to stop the alien meanies who threatened to conquer earth. In the last battle, the meanies were stopped by a hero who had the guts and cleverness to use every resource available to ensure victory. To replicate their former hero, they contrive to offer one of their best students a series of experiences which will instill the idea that he is a leader. And that student is Ender Wiggin. The administrators in charge of his experiences are Harrison Ford and Viola Davis who put Ender through a ringer of impossible situations that would be nearly unbearable to almost everyone else. The story is not only about how Ender deals with these experiences at the training school but also how he grows into something a bit different than what the administrators had planned. And after having graduated to different levels of the training school, he meets someone he thought so much larger than life that he can't believe he has met him face-to-face.A beautiful and moving adaption of one of the great science fiction classics. The cast is first rate all-around with exceptional performances by the kids, particularly Hailee Steinfeld as Petra and the highest marks for Asa Butterfield as Ender. The special effects are fantastic, which is to be expected, but they support the story rather than overwhelm it, which seems to be the trend these days for most science fiction offerings. This is one of the few science fiction films that is simultaneously dazzling and moving. A rare find in the annals of SF filmmaking. And as stated by others involved with this film, the message of ""Ender's Game"" has absolutely nothing to do with the author's opinions on other subjects.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

""Ender's Game,"" written and directed by Gavin Hood, and based on a 1985 novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card (incidentally, a self-professed and obnoxiously vocal pillar of general intolerance of any person not like himself, and homosexuals especially), is set in a future when humanity comes under attack by an ant-like race of aliens and the solution is to draft a bunch of prepubescent kids (all boys and a single token girl, by the way) to use their gaming skills to command the fleet that will ultimately save nothing less than humanity itself. How's that for a storyline? There's really not much good to say about ""Ender's Game,"" unless you're a 14 year old boy whose greatest fantasy is to live in a video game, and there are, apparently and unfortunately, enough of those out there to make it worth spending hundreds of millions of dollars on an epic piece of crap like Ender's Game."" Your average comic book has better character development and plot.Over the past decade more and more ""blockbusters"" have been little more than CGI porn fests and that has come to be accepted, but Ender's game takes it to a new level (and the CGI isn't even that good) by way of a scene in which the main character actually becomes a character in a video game—as in there is no real life actor, the main character himself being a product of CGI. Talk about turning it up to eleven.Ender Wiggin is played by Asa Butterfield, a particularly wooden young actor who has apparently mastered the ability to make his eyes water at will, a fact of which Director Hood makes great use in a failed attempt to imbue his main character with some semblance of life. Young Wiggin's greatest talent seems to be spouting such insights egarding conflict and enemy management as to humble even Sun Tzu. In between dropping these profound pearls he manages to lead to victory a team of completely interchangeable characters in a type of zero gravity, three dimensional billiards table batle ground A feat which so impresses the commander of ""battle""school, one Colonel Hyrum Graff(Harrison Ford), that Wiggin is given command of the entire fleet. Ford's character is a standard issue military hard ass, yet a noble one, who has sacrificed his own humanity for the greater good, understanding that in war there must be an acceptance of collateral damage not limited to loss of life, but including loss of innocence as well. Sound familiar? Ford tries to play Graff as gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic, but comes off as Harrison Ford trying to play gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic. For some unfathomable reason Ben Kingsley makes an appearance as a Maori warrior complete with facial tattoos and the whole bit. It's hard to know what he needed more, the money or a new agent. If he keeps doing things like this, he just may have his knighthood revoked.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I have not read the books myself, but friends who have told me of the differences throughout. Overall, the film provides a smooth and engaging ride for viewers of all ages.The story is fast-paced - apparently skipping/condensing parts of the book which is no surprise - and will keep you interested the whole time. There is a nice blend of scenes with great and intense action and emotional drama. This comes from of course the solid writing and the performances from the cast, all of whom did excellently. It was a treat to see Harrison Ford in space again and the children held their own even with the adults (though Moises Arias as Bonzo was a bit amusing). I'm not sure how I feel about Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham either.It's also not a surprise though that the special effects in this film are fantastic, which is a given with a space and war film. At times, the action may get a bit cluttered with the battle scenes, but if you can keep up, it's quite exciting.Towards the end of the film, it becomes obvious the film's set-up for sequels, and I personally would welcome a franchise. The film stands solidly throughout which is how I would best describe it - it's not the best that it can be, and listening to those who have read the books, it seems to sometimes fall short from the themes and heart of the originals. Regardless, Ender's Game is a good start, and I recommend seeing this for a 2 hours of enjoyment.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I mean, a boy about 13 years old who rises through the ranks of an intergalactic military force to end up commanding a massive army? Sure, that was just so believable as it is as scratching yourself.This movie appeals for a young audience, a very young audience, because anything that even remotely bears any sense of reality or realism is out the window, and there is a young boy wonder who handles every single thing thrown against him with brilliancy and ease. Yeah, I will buy that for a dollar.Not only is the storyline very hard to buy into or believe for a second, then the entire movie bears no particular contents, and it is a hollow experience that is carried only by the spectacular visual effects and the names of Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley.Let's take a moment and look at the combat training, shall we? A bunch of kids playing laser tag in zero gravity, that qualifies for making commanders that will lead the entire military force in space? And these are kids, mind you. The older, seasoned and experienced military officers and leaders just sat back and gave way to children. Yeah, all very, very believable.And for those who suffer through the entire course of the movie, brace yourself for a slap in the face kind of an ending. Now, I am not going to spoil it here by saying what it is, but come on, seriously? That ending was just laughable and ridiculous.I enjoy Sci-Fi, but ""Ender's Game"" was just a swing and a miss, a massive swing and a miss. It scores a mere 4 out of 10 stars from me, solely because of the visual effects and because of Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley.","8 out of 26 found this helpful.

Colonel Graff believes that he may be the leader and savior of the human race, but Major Anderson is concerned with the psychological damages that may be caused to Ender.""Ender's Game"" is a rip-off of ""Starship Troopers"" for juvenile audiences with a story with many contradictions. Ender is trained to kill but has conflictive crisis when he is bullied by the violent Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias). His attitudes always generate negative comments from Anderson and Graff and it is difficult to follow what he should do to please the military. Why experienced commanders would need a kid to command the earthling fleet? Harrison Ford is awful in the role of a tough colonel.

Asa Butterfield is principle as the mighty oak, with no depth in character and no warmth at all as the lead. Ben Kingsley (Pine) has in one film ruined his career. Harrison Ford (Douglas fir) is obviously after one more paycheck at the expense of any artistic integrity...

Based on some of the reviews I read here, before watching it - I almost decided it was something for kids, people with no imagination and overall a poor film.Thankfully, I decided to ignore the majority who saw fault. I'm no film buff, and will not pretend to be. I can only be honest and say, that this was a very well acted and thought provoking film.Whilst it receives a 12 rating, much of the content regarding humanity and the implications of conflict/war are in fact very adult in nature - and presented as such, without a sense of flippancy.There was something else I felt throughout the film - and that was a correlation to the Battlestar Galactica genre. In a vague way admittedly, but mankind vs an alien race, where just who is the better of the two on balance, is unclear. Additionally the whole look of the film, the vessels, the training program for recruits..and a fair bit more - constantly had me thinking of the BSG universe..in a positive way.The acting I've mentioned, was excellent. For fans of pure action, this is NOT your thing. It was more about the dichotomy of what is the right thing to do, and how does a young boy with natural raw talents take on something as overwhelming as the challenges he's faced with as the film progresses.It's definitely one of those films where you have to look, acknowledge and appreciate the true scale of the challenges that the young hero has to contend with. Asa felt believable, tough (though compassionate), caring and disturbed throughout the film. Harrison played his part as the driven, almost tyrannical military leader who recruited him brilliantly.The film skips along at a quick pace, whilst not seeming like a blur of constant action, and certainly not one to watch if you don't give it 100% attention throughout.So that's my short and simple first review. If you ignore the overall rating as I did - and perhaps forget about the book if you've read it - then watch and judge this on it's own merits, because it really is a film that has a sublime brilliance to it and worth the time watching.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Imagine if you took all of the highlights of the first few books and then allowed 3 minutes max for each highlight. No time for character development or connecting each highlight so it flowed logically. Everything felt incredibly rushed and disjointed. I can't imagine how confusing it might be for someone who is unfamiliar with the story. I wanted to love this movie and prayed it would do well so there would be a sequel. They should have split this into 2 movies and allowed the audience to melt into the Enderverse- so they cared about what was going on. I felt the actors did an amazing job with what they had. The end was so sudden and abbreviated you were robbed of the emotional payoff- you didn't have time to invest. Same way I felt they missed the mark with the Mortal Instruments movie.

I know they are children, but some of the characters did not fit the actors. Asa Butterfield and the other kids are very good actors, with a lot of potential. I don't think it is their fault. The producers probably wanted a cast that would sell tickets to an more juvenile audience. In that perspective they have succeeded in terms of box office success. As for the story; It had potential, but it felt rushed, incomplete and as if there were cutbacks. I haven't read the book, so i don't know if the story line is the same. If they ever decide to remake this movie, i think it should be rewritten with a different type of cast. The direction was actually pretty good. I really think this could have been a great movie, maybe even a very good trilogy. If i was 12 years old, id probably liked it.

This should be close to an 8+ overall rating and the 5.8 Metascore is a joke (that's that liberal media the Republicans rant on about). Asa Butterfield... brilliant. Harrison Ford... best role in awhile. Viola Davis... compelling.There were only two major holes in this movie (no spoilers really). The casting of Moises Arias was horrid. A four foot weasel trying to act like a tough guy was appalling, leaving me literally shaking my head and doing everything possible not to burst out laughing. I get that this character was meant to be hated but the performance was all wrong. Clearly one of his uncles must be the producer of the film. The second was a 15 second possible early reveal that could have given away the ending. Take this one scene out and it completely changes things.Other than that, within the framework of a film and only being able to explain so much in an allotted amount of time (leaving out most of the philosophical writing of two major characters for those that read the book) they did a great job with this. Given that most people said this was the unmake-able film, it delivered on all fronts and was well worth the IMAX ticket price.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

What is shocking me the most is how so many people didn't felt the same? Basically what you see is the training of a kid to go to war and kill legions of enemies without asking who they are, why they are here, and basically just killing them, as if it was through a video game. The whole film I was thinking that is not right. If he was an Arab and training in with a A-47 in the hand that would be unbearable, like looking 2 hours of rapes in a row, but here, it sounds acceptable. There is no blood, nobody cries, it is only machines, spaceships fighting. But the weird feeling was sticky through all the movie, with its cold look, with too many CGI and not enough good acting. Harrison Ford is not doing good in this movie, and his end of career goes to the opposite way someone like Clint Eastwood for example. Most actors were OK, and the main character was doing a good job at being close to crying all the time. The whole movie it totally depressing. Should I mention that the end does not have any sense and is the most ridiculous ending I have ever seen? The director does not know where he stands... what is the message? It seems that this movie is a propaganda command from the US army to plug into our head that having our kids learning how to kill with a joystick at school is acceptable?

There are so many lessons for adolescents to pick up from this movie, how life can be difficult, how there are individuals that may want to lead and impose their will on you even though you may be more talented and capable and how they will try to shut you down, but you must shine through and believe in yourself. The strength in friends, in team work, in recognizing others accomplishments and abilities and not just your own. The strength of a leader to recognize the talent and strength of even those that initially opposed them and tried to humiliate them, but latter gained their respect, gain someone's respect, but don't be like them and turn and try to demoralize them as they did you, be the better man.

This is not just another stupid sci-fi cliché special FX-fest.I've loved the book for a long time. I had low expectations for the film as I'd expected the producers to turn it into a special FX stunt show with clichés about alien invasions. But no: overall, I was really pleasantly surprised and moved. I don't know: maybe I'm biased because of my affinity for the book, but I thought it was a really good adaptation. A whole plethora of scenes gave me nerd-thrills, and having read the book I could fill in the missing details.Yes, as you'd expect, the film skims over certain parts: some of my favourite parts of Ender's development are in his progression through Battle School, especially in turning the Dragon Team into the best team. The film slims this section down, not really showing Ender's strategic genius, but more suggesting it instead. Valentine is a bit of a plastic character. The entire bit about her web political writing is skipped. But it still manages to capture the essence of the book. It captures the disturbing nature of training little kids (who, by the way, are the some of the best kid-actors I've seen in a while). It captures the dilemma's Ender's put through, and the way Graff has to treat him. Also, it's beautiful! Well shot and fantastic visuals. Oh, and for those who are talking about boycotting the film for Orson's homophobic views: that's ridiculous. First off, Orson is hardly the only stakeholder in this film, there are so many other people who don't deserve a boycott. Besides which, economically boycotting someone is not the way to deal with views that you disagree with. You show that people's views are wrong by showing that they're wrong and bigoted, not by stifling their ability to express their views at all (not that boycotting the film would even accomplish that). Anyway, we're probably funding so many other corporate criminals and scumbags and bigots on a daily basis with every purchase. And finally: Orson himself might be a bigot but that doesn't mean this film doesn't send a message that is so much more thoughtful and sensitive than most other big-blockbuster sci-film about war and aliens. Watching his film will probably have a stronger moral effect than boycotting Orson will.If you're a fan of the book, watch the film and decide for yourself if you like: the reviews are all so mixed it's hard to tell.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie deviates so much from the book that I can only assume these people haven't read the book since they were a kid 10+ years ago.The movie makes soooo many terrible changes for absolutely no reason at all. Some of the changes I despised, but I could at least see why it was necessary for time constraints - but there are plenty of changes that were just idiotic and unnecessary. Bean and Petra in particular were brutal to watch as their personalities were so radically different from the characters in the book; they may have read lines word-for-word from the book, Bean was displayed as a sociable joker, and Petra a soft- spoken empath. Anyone who has read the book would see how much these characters deviated from the book. And don't even get me started on the casting for Bonzo.If you've never touched the book, or you have a terrible memory, then maybe the movie could be decent. Ford does play an admirable colonel Graff, and even the child actors are quite good - although the characters they are playing are not at all like the characters in the book (but that's no reason to critique their performance).Do not watch this disaster if you're a fan of the book.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Part of the trouble is that Gavin Hood's (Tsotsi, Rendition) adaptation isn't very good, it isn't terribly true to the source novel and there's a reasonable amount ropy acting on screen.Seventy years after Earth has been twice ransacked by an alien race, The Buggers, and foiled by the now-mythical hero fighter pilot, Mazer Rackham, humankind has turned to a new breed of fighting machine: Children. Children have a unique way of viewing the stress and challenges of warfare and are able to approach it in an entirely fresher and superior way to stubborn, caught-in-the-ruts adults. Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield, Hugo Cabret in Hugo) is one such child and is removed from his family and transported to the International Military's academy deep in space where he is trained and subjected to all manner of harsh emotional tests in the hope that he just might thwart the Bugger's next attack and be the savior of mankind.Ender's Game rolls along easily enough. There's plenty to interest the eye and the weightlessness is handled well, though not in the same class as that of Gravity. It will please the kids and pass a couple of hours without too much regret but, by the sound of it, it will really cheese off those who read the novel. Too much has been changed: the parentage of Ben Kingsley's character inexplicably switched, characters in the finale who have long since gone in the novel, and, worst of all for Bag, ""the entire point"" of the ending and Ender's journey is lost in favour of a more palatable end that will allow for a more filmable sequel than the second novel. Take it from me, he was not best pleased.I can't comment, only advise, on that matter. The performances, however, are fair game.Butterfield, excellent in Hugo, has lost his mojo. He might be able to turn on the tears but he sure as hell can't run convincingly. It's a passable performance from a lad carrying the weight of a film but lacks the depth and maturity that he displayed in Scorsese's Oscar-winning delight.But Butterfield is a positive Laurence Olivier next to Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Dap. We haven't seen ham as overcooked as this on screen since Gerard Butler in Olympus Has Fallen. His performance is not just poor, it's embarrassing.Viola Davis gives solid support as Major Gwen Anderson but is barely given the time to have an impact. Likewise, Abigail Breslin as Ender's sister, Valentine, makes her self known adequately without coming close to the standard she displayed in this year's The Call.Thank goodness for Harrison Ford! There's nothing startling about his performance, but it's the Ford of old. He's reliable, entirely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. He dominates every scene he's in and makes for an imposing officer. He has to; by the looks of it, there are only four in the entire academy, and one of those is Dap.Ender's Game is passable entertainment for those who have no knowledge of the novels, but don't expect a life-changing event or anything particularly memorable.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is no mean feat for an actor of his age to carry a blockbuster film.The rest of the cast are very good. I didn't particularly warm to ben Kingsley's character but that was because of the writing rather than the acting.Visuals are excellent and I really enjoyed the score.

The director wasted so much time on the kids training. I struggled to stay awake because I didn't find the storyline that interesting and the kid was quite annoying. Near the end it gets pretty ridiculous and the kid ends up getting over confident and cocky. If the director would have got on with the core of the storyline except of watching kids battling against each other, it might have been a better movie. Harrison Ford didn't get used to his full ability, like Ben Kingsley who plays a strange Australian pilot. Anyway, in all I didn't enjoy this movie at all and I won't be watching the sequel, unless the kid becomes an adult. Disappointing!Round-Up: I had big hopes for this movie, but once again I was thoroughly let down. The CGI wasn't bad and I did enjoy watching Harrison Ford being cold as ice, but the storyline was appalling, along with the whole of the dull tone of the movie. Harrison Ford is the best thing in the movie and in some ways, it did remind me of Star Wars when they were watching over the little kid who eventually becomes Anakin Skywalker. I'm sure that there is going to be a sequel, judging by the ridiculous ending, but it was a waste of a big budget. I haven't heard anything good about this movie from the critics, so I don't stand alone when I say that it could have been much better.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $112millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there zero to hero space movies about a kid saving the world. 4/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A deep, complex and intricate character who in essence is an insecure little boy that when provoked draws upon an internal strength and instinctive desire not only to survive, but to dominate to the point that one battle is the only battle ever.I felt very much as though I were watching the birth of a new space sci-fi movie series similar to the new Star-Trek being born. I could easily see a sequel or two ahead for Ender's Game.The ending of this movie is astonishingly brilliant and was unanticipated, earning it an eight star rating in my assessment.Emder's Game is simply a fun, exciting and intense movie to watch.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I didn't watch any trailers or talk to anyone that had already seen it; i wanted to view it fresh. I remember listening to Card say he had been given offers to make the Ender's Game movie but he had turned them down because they wanted to make too many changes so i was shocked to see a movie with ""elements"" of the story rather than a story with ""elements"" changed for film. Rather than introduce internal conflicts through actions and events they just cut to someone saying what took a third of the book to develop. The casting was terrible; how is it that a person described as twice the size of the main character is cast as half the size of the main character. If you're easily entertained you'll love this but if you have read the books you shouldn't. If you have any sense on the flow of movies you shouldn't either.

At first you think it's going to be another wimpy-kid-coming-of-age story, though set in space. But it isn't. Then you think it's a smart-kid-can't-unlock-the-key-secret-until-he-understands-himself, but it isn't that. Maybe it'll be another Hunger Games, teenager-uses-skills-to-survive-and-then-to-beat-the-system? No, not that either.In the end, it's a film about the rights and wrongs of war, and of training for war. And I do mean rights and wrongs, plural: this is one of the best films for a long time for making you think about more than one side of a complex issue. It also takes a hefty (though mitigated) swipe at video-game culture; but if you think that's a modern politically correct message, remember that the book was written in 1985. Its message is best summed up in one (sligh mis-)quote from the film: ""It's not what you do; it's why you do it."" It's one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen for a long time. If you come out of the film wanting to know more about the issues that the book raises, I recommend the excellent (if slightly academic) book ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"" by Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Grossman. It doesn't tackle exactly the same issues that the film raises (which is good, because that means the book doesn't act as a spoiler for the film!) but it does address the wider issues.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Especially in comparison to the book. This is a film that makes obvious conclusions because it doesn't trust its viewers to draw them. Its tone, pacing and complexity would have benefited with the inclusion of the Demosthenes subplot. Externalizing Ender's emotional fragility in the film was a mistake, especially given that a 16 year old was cast in the place of a 6 year old character. This causes the film to lose much of the punch that the book had. Ender in battle school at 16 is much less impressive than Ender in battle school at 6. Ditto with killing other children and being used by the government to fight wars. Given its sentimental tone (in comparison to the book) and its patronizing attitude towards its audience the film never rises above the mediocre.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The only movie made after a book that has less in common with what was originally written is probably World War Z, but Ender's Game is not far. Everything is changed, from the atmosphere to how Ender looks and interacts with the other characters. Somehow they managed to take a dark, disturbing, hard story and make it into an almost cute story about a boy hero. I found it too soft and polished. It was a disappointment from start to finish, a mediocre movie made worse because it shares the name with a book that is something completely different. What I find most annoying is that small things are messed up. Like the character of Bonzo. I still can't understand why Arias was chosen for the role, given that Bonzo was supposed to be one of the biggest kids around. These things changed the atmosphere too much, just to get that PG-13 rating. I have nothing against book adaptations but this one is very bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has read the book. If you just want a cute sci-fi family movie - it could work.

Now if you haven't read the book and don't plan too it is a brilliant work of teen fiction based using the inner monologue of a child to show the loss of innocence through war and using people as a means to an end. Now onto the movie, it is extremely similar to the book in terms of title, identical in fact, but they took way more justice in terms of substance and meaning. While trying to fit several years of a boys life in book time filled with thoughts and emotions they went with the bold move of having one sentence consisting of five word that covered months of thought processes and advanced scientific explanations. While the quick cut scenes of passing time keep you on your toes, because you're either trying to sneak out of the theater or have no idea what's going on because you haven't read the books, it makes it so no sub plot line is fully panned out but you see that there may have been some connection there in the book. The perfect medium of giving not enough information to satisfy the watcher, but enough to make them notice a better movie would have shown a relationship there. Now in the book they make it obvious that Lieutenant Anderson is the superior to Captain Graff, but the movie took justice with this making it so Harrison Ford could be the boss and that 20 minutes of the movie could be a close up on his face. Lastly onto Ender himself. While I am not an actor by choice (not my choice) I will say the performance was similar to me walking up to a child on a street and going, hey read this sentence and stare at that camera. So after reading the book and expecting some magical meaningful ending, the final meaning of the movie was follow your heart, you're friends are always there for you (even if they only make it into 3 scenes of your life and have no background), and Harrison Ford is kind of a dick. Now I hate to be that guy that points out movie flaws in sci-fi movies but at the end when he's walking on the planet with minimal oxygen and he needs to breath out of that can twice every minute, then has an interaction and just kind of forgets that he needs air to breathe, well I didn't forget and it makes me sad that you did. Now if you plan on going to see it I advise you to not go in thinking this is a good display of the book. In fact I advise you to not go in at all, and eat popcorn in the lobby while you read the book.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

He was talking about how he refused to agree to all these terms and how he was almost cheated into such an agreement with including contradictory clauses in the movie contract and so on. And now this? I don't get it. I'm pretty sure this is exactly the movie he didn't wanted Ender's Game to be. I had to explain to my wife what's going on, because the movie is so condensed and compressed that unless you read the book you will not know what's going on. If you read the book the movie is a pain to watch because it just doesn't work. Again a typical case of ""Hey, we don't really know what to do with the story so let's throw on a bunch of CGI stuff cause it looks good"".

For example, the fact that they had to shorten it so greatly! This 350 page wonder of a book could have turned out a 10 hour movie easily! So I guess the two and a half hour movie we got was satisfactory. Speaking of relation to the book. It was VERY specific. While It didn't follow the book entirely (as no movie ever should) it displayed and gave us every key component to the story we needed....until the end. The end would have easily put another hour on the film alone so I see why they would take it out. Even though I found that all the most important events were in the film. I feel like it missed just one, the relationship building between the characters. Almost all of them were whisked into his life and back out almost immediately. Enough that if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have remembered their names very well at all. And I especially missed Valentine's and Peter's story as they were without ended on earth. But their story could be almost a whole movie on its own... The relationships between Bean, Alia, and Petra were very missed. Because near the end they would do anything for their commander and we are not quite sure why. But that kind of character development would take hours and hours more on the film so I can completely understand why they would want to cut it short. All I all, this movie was one of the best movies based on a book I have ever seen. It is a great movie for those who have read and haven't read the book!!! I can tell that a LOT of money was spent on this movie and I hope they intend to make the second one. But I am worried that they might have missed some key components from the second book which I haven't read yet.I wanted to talk about technical aspects but time is cut short and the story is worth it.

Graff and Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham. The supporting cast mostly comprises of many other young faces, including Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld, and Aramis Knight, which perhaps set it apart from other science-fiction films.The plot revolves around the experiences of Andrew Ender Wiggin in the military academy that trains young and smart students like Ender in the hope that they will be ready when it comes time to battle the Formics—an alien race previously encountered that is believed to be a threat to the human race. Ender's extraordinary strategic thinking skills differentiated him from his peers and elevated him as a potential leader of the entire military force.The movie starts out with a quote from the main character Ender: ""When I understand my enemy well enough to defeat him, then in that moment, I also love him."" The quote expresses Ender's dilemma in struggling between his violent tendencies and instinct to win and his compassionate side. This immediately allows the audience to understand and sympathize with Ender, and from that Ender is no longer just a character. The introductory quote will also serve as an explanation to the conclusion of the film. Although the characters are mostly young, the film is still easily relatable for adults because of the characters' grown up motivations and experiences; in one of the film's critical moments, Ender evaluates whether the manner in which one wins matters more than the fact of winning. If it is lacking in any way, it is probably in the fact that some characters are not given enough time to develop in order to be more understood by the audience, such as in the case of Peter Wiggin. Peter Wiggin is easily seen as evil and ruthless but further depth of character could be given through providing a reasonable cause to his actions; after all, a character with two sides is always more interesting and relatable. Astounding special effects were used throughout the film, from the recollection of the previous Formics invasion to the climactic space battle simulations. Seeing the space battle simulation, one can't help but remember the special effects of clashing spaceships, asteroids, and planets in Star Wars, wherein Harrison Ford also starred. The film score accompanying the special effects-filled scenes only contributed in making the scenes even more suspenseful and exciting. Some features of the film such as the Battle Room, military costumes, and the mind game, serve as unique additions to set the film apart.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Viola Davis is not a stand out either. Asa Butterfield, who plays the title character does a fine job. We'll see more of him in the future.

Ender, a highly intelligent teenager, is selected for the program and must prepare himself, working hard day by day, for an imminent war. It's a very exciting story of a boy which must evolve through work, commitment but also self control, in order to help Earth defeat the enemy who once tried to eradicate humankind. Through intense simulations, he will be able to understand the enemy and be all the time one step ahead, but the question remains how will he manage in the real life scenario. It's a film full of thrill and suspense, managing to transmit many emotions through Ender's superb character, which is, by the way, excellently played. We are made to feel and think that all is a game but the harsh conditions and difficult colleagues will prove to be another challenge for the young Ender which seems to have a solution for almost anything that could have been thrown at him. Besides the captivating plot, we are also faced with a completely unexpected finale, which brings much amazement to the viewer, while also leaving some space for a future sequel. The visuals are also top notch, bringing delight to the eye with every attempt.It's that type of movie which manages to create an unique atmosphere with the enormous help of one particular character (Ender's) which keeps you captivated throughout its entire length and provides an impressive and unexpected finale. It's an excellent movie overall which I cannot recommend enough.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So I don't have that baggage of complaints and nitpicks that movies based on books seem to generate from fans. So my review is strictly based on what I thought of the movie. In short, it was competently put together but boring as hell. I'm so sick of stories about people waiting for a leader or a chosen one to guide them. It's been done to death, Hollywood! Yeah I realize it's based on a book from 1985 but, again, this is a review of a movie that came out in 2013 not the book. In 2013 we had seen literally dozens of movies and television shows with very similar plot lines as this in just the last decade.To make matters worse, I hated the cast. Especially Asa Butterfield. I just can't with this kid. If I have to guess whether you are acting badly or if the part is written that way, then you're screwed. As an actor, nine times out of ten you're taking the blame for that one. Usually rightfully so. He wasn't the only one I didn't care for. Harrison Ford goes without saying. Just retire, Harrison, if this is the best you can do at staying relevant. I disliked the entire supporting cast of no-name actors. They were all bland and colorless. The special effects also failed to impress me. They weren't bad, just nothing that will stay with me over time. Forgettable, like this movie. I can't recommend you see this unless you are really young and haven't seen much yet. Because I've seen this type of story done before and better. Many times, actually.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Nonetheless, I very much liked the film and am kind of sad they are not making anymore movies off the series. So at the start, we are introduced to Ender, a young boy who seems to be just one step ahead of everybody around him. His quick wit and ability to assess the best solutions make him a perfect candidate to lead an attack on an enemy alien force, at least in the eyes of Colonel Graff, who trains him to be the best leader possible. But can Ender manage this difficult responsibility? Overall I was pleased with the story and the performances. Asa Butterfield is a great lead actor in this movie and brings a lot of energy to the film, along with the likes of Abigail Breslin and Hailee Steinfeld. The seasoned actors such as Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley balance the cast quite well and the result is very satisfactory. In the end, I guess if you're looking for a nice adventure filled, family film, Ender's Game might just do fine as the choice.Rating: 8/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This generation's children, limited by mandate like modern-day China, dream of one day participating in the orbital war games tasked with producing the next five-star general, and our protagonist (Ender) is the cream of the crop. Though steeped in lore and a long, rich back story, just like the novel, I was taken aback by just how much screen time was devoted to laying this groundwork. Maybe I'm spoiled by recent films, such as Pacific Rim, who manage to effectively build a similar world in just a five-minute opening narrative sequence, but it seems a colossal waste of time to still be working on the preamble midway through the second act. That gives the impression that we're just getting started when, in reality, the plot is already nearing its crescendo. It's a very literal interpretation of the source, with many lines and plot points arriving verbatim from the printed page, but plays as extremely hollow and emotionally detached. Much of that can be attributed to Ender himself, an admittedly nuanced, complicated character that fails to make a graceful transition to the screen. Despite spotting several flashes of myself in his actions, I never empathized with him as an individual, nor did I like him on a basic level. This is a production that deserves points for tackling an extremely difficult property - I was sure the scenes of the game itself would make or break it, when they did neither - but one that, apart from a thoroughly excellent visual effort, falls just short of the mark in every way. It's not a bad effort, but the lack of warmth, depth and power leaves it with a stiflingly bland flavor.Fresh thoughts after a recent re-watch (9/2019):This long-simmering adaptation of an award winning sci-fi classic stays loyal to its source material, but loses a ton of emotion in the translation. Its version of a future Earth, one generation removed from near-extinction at the hands of an invading alien fleet, isn't a particularly romantic one, but that doesn't mean it has to be this joyless. Everything's so dry and analytical, every plot point over-explained and talked to death, while the book's most exciting chapters are merely skimmed.Where we get them, the special effects come through exceptionally well. The game room, where the planet's unified military force trains its cadets for interstellar combat, doesn't look exactly like I'd imagined, but still makes for a rich scene or two. Space launches have immense power and impact. Zero gravity fight scenes play out in unique ways. There's an awful lot of untapped potential here; ideas and concepts that are properly explored in the novel, merely served as a garnish and tossed aside.And maybe a focus on the human element could have been the right call, given the right cast to really dig in; a good script to touch on the more delicate metaphors; a capable director to pull everything together. Three strikes in that regard. With a stiff, off-putting young Asa Butterfield in the leading role, plus a disengaged Harrison Ford and a barely-there Ben Kingsley as support, nobody seems interested in picking up the ball for a run at the goal line. It's an uncertain film, one that never completely settles on an identity, and it honestly isn't much fun to watch. A missed opportunity.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Awesome film but rushed","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9133827/?ref_=tt_urv","OneAnjel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4413144/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2023","I thought the premise was great and looked forward to the story. But this should have been a series in order to capture the passage of time and the nuances of the moral dilemma. I didn't read the book but I'll take everyone's word that the book is much better. It usually is. There's no way to replace ones own imagination in unfolding a story. Stephen King is known to have said he was disappointed in almost every rendition of his books into film with 2 exceptions, including The Green Mile. I normally don't care for reviews that compare the book to the film since there is zero ways to say everyone else's interpretation didn't meet yours. Therefore, comparisons will always sound like complaints that it didn't meet your personal interpretation. For me, that's a selfish perspective. Belive it or not, the majority of film goers who turn a film intro a blockbuster have never read the book. Sadly though, the majority of reviews on sites like this are from the people who read the book and leave a negative review bars on whether the film reminds them of their own interpretation of the book. Ironically, many producers today come to these reviews to determine if they should continue a series. Many times, negative reviewers who congragate here have the last word and otherwise great series' are not continued. We should all keep this in mind when unleashing our disappointment in a low-star review. Re this film, I'm glad to know there's a book since this did seem like more of a teaser, not even offering enough information to rely on innuendo. It's hard to believe the author chose this screen adaptation to allow his work to become a visual interpretation. There was no lead-in to any of the progressions. The moral dilemma was not well-outlined, particularly since the species previously anhilated 90% of humanity. I feel this is an incredible PG13 film to engage young people's interest but focused only on that aspect. I also felt the cadet and sister looked to much alike without pulling that out, if there was even a purpose. I'd like to see part 2. Especially if Spielberg picks it up.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It wasn't until years later that I actually got around to seeing it. Not having read the book, I did know something of the premise and thought it sounded interesting enough and took a chance on it.I'm glad I did, because it was very enjoyable. It is very well paced, engaging throughout. I'm *very* hard to please when it comes to child actors and I thought the cast all around was excellent here. The action is all well directed with a good energetic score.Fast forward a few years and I finally got around to reading the book, which is excellent. I find myself a bit puzzled though: I see a lot of people saying this doesn't really do the book justice. While it's true that generally source material is better and more nuanced than its film adaptation, I thought they did a pretty great job of adapting this one. Does it contain all the complexity of the novel? No. Did they leave stuff out? Yes. But I don't really feel like anything they left out really damaged the story. The book has a kind of side plot involving Ender's brother and sister back home that is completely absent here. And while that aspect of the story isn't meaningless, its absence doesn't really detract from the core of the story. I also see people nitpicking Ender's age relative to his peers in the training school. Again, not that important.If there's one criticism I could have it's that we don't get a good idea of how much time has really passed at the training school and how much Ender's mental health suffers as a result of everything he's been through. That is important in better understanding his choices toward the end of the film. But this is a somewhat minor consideration. Overall I think this is one of the best adaptations of a classic sci-fi novel I've seen and a worthy film in its own right.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But then, how could it? I agree the story does feel rushed as you watch it. The kid climbs the ladder of success at a dizzying pace, and the amount of plot required to even touch the original story forces the viewer through what, at times, feels like a breakneck sequence of scenes and events. All of that is a nod to the detractors. Now, let me tell you why I liked this movie.Ender's Game has heart. There is a warmth to the characters that nicely counterbalances the coldness of war, space, and technology. You feel with, and for Ender as he tries to adapt to the pain of alienation, loss of connection with loved ones, and the incredible pressure and challenges he faces.The atmosphere of the movie is enveloping. The acting, colors, and melancholy music underscore the dire nature of what's going on . Ender's plight, and at times his character, is reminiscent of Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, another character plucked from obscurity, at times unwillingly, and shouldered with the weight of the world.I also appreciated the lack of vulgarity and bad language. This movie proves you don't need it to tell a fascinating story.The ending was an interesting and surprising twist, and even Ender's reaction to the ""twist"" was interesting. So, yeah, I can understand the reaction of fans of the book, but for someone who was coming into it without any previous frame of reference, I thought the movie was great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The actors also acquit themselves very well. Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield play their leading roles strongly and don't tend towards inappropriate histrionics (and I'll even give a nod to Ben Kingsley who could have played his part as totally over-the-top). Supporting cast such as Viola Davis also does a fine job. So, if FX/CGI and acting aren't the issues, then what is?The entire setup, premise, and scientific underpinnings are beyond redemption. You learn at the very beginning about an armed conflict and later find out about the baddies but, frankly, I don't see how those baddies could possibly have mastered the technology necessary to do those nefarious deeds (especially after seeing their planet). Next, the whole setup depends upon finding a new leader and the idea that you would entrust that much responsibility to that leader is completely 100% absurd...like selecting the new chef of a 5-star restaurant based upon how they managed to create perfectly grilled burgers at McDonalds. Just Silly.The ending is atrocious, too, and a cop out...and you also have to wonder how the colonists on LV-426 managed, all those years, not to check out their environment and find that alien ship until Burke gave them a clue it was practically right next door. ...just a bit too convenient.

The movies is mainly based on EG, but it also takes a lot from ES. I would rate the books 4/5 and the movie 8/10. It is good and entertaining science fiction. The plot is good. I would suggest reading Ender's Game before watching the film.The movie is well directed, the acting is top-notch, although perhaps the character Bonzo could have been better played by a more believable Latin bully. The special effects are excellent.The books are well written and easy to read. Ender's Game is most about Ender and his thoughts. Ender's Shadow is more factual, describing both alien invasions. The reader quickly becomes immersed in the story. However, there were some issues that could have been better dealt (This is for you Orson):1) It is difficult to believe that six year-old could think and talk like Ender and his colleagues, no matter how bright they are. They simply lack the life experience. 2) In the book (EG), the parallel plot of Ender's brother and sister is an unnecessary distraction, the book would have been a lot better without Peter and Valentine trying to take over the world. An alternative is that Ender in his Earth visit confronts Peter and defeats him, and Valentine joins the academy. 3) Also in the book (EG), the political rivalries on earth are infantile. It is unthinkable that nation-states or political-economic blocks would prevail after a) two alien invasions and near extinction of the human race, and b) be tremendous advance in technology and communications. 4) I liked the ending of the movie better than the wishy-washy ending of the book (EG).None of the other books of the Ender saga, except ES, is at the same level of Ender's game; in fact, none really follows closely and logically the story of EG & ES. I don't think there is going to be a successful movie sequel, unless Scott Card writes one in a linear manner from the movie ending and not allow himself going sideways.Overall good stuff, although I think he needs to rewrite and streamline Ender's Game taking into consideration 3 or 5 future movie sequels.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Overall experience is good, and as a fan of Scott card I really loved the movie. I was expecting more though, as many parts of the books are not well described. The beginning for example where Ender is very small, the terror of Peter, the long long boring fights in the military school, and of course the video game that Ender plays, all theses would have needed much more time, but it is a movie so you need to cut things  But definitely worth it!

If you are a kid, at least at heart, read on... This is the story of Ender Wiggin, a young boy (age 11?) to train for a fight against the Formics, an Alien race. The storyline is OK but the whole story is a bit childish - the first hour is almost like kindergarten in space - you wonder if the kid ever grows up. The biggest joke is that Ender becomes the leader of a children's army. That's fine for a children's movie but why is this then rated PG-13? With all the stuff kids can see today, PG would be perfectly appropriate. It's not even very SciFi-realistic. The Aliens, huge floppy insects, can not only communicate properly - how can they operate space ships? The whole story is difficult to believe. It's not even clear why children are playing those roles. Declare this as a kid's movie and it may be fine. 11 year olds saving the world? That's a joke in a PG-13-rated movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm still watching and I have to submit more lines, so let me add that Harrison Ford looks (and acts) like he died last month. Ooh, a teen boy just said ""ten hut."" Sir, yes sir!! Girl still likes hero boy. Whew! They have really cool iPads to play their games on that you'll have in the future. I hope the graphics then aren't as cheesy as they are here. The movie set, by the way, is about as original and sophisticated as the original TV Star Trek set. ""Dragon Army"" -- gimme a break. Now looks kinda like computer graphics from Disney's TRON from decades ago. Boys fighting in the shower just like middle school. Acting-- ""wooden"" is the kindest description. Now teen hero is being stubborn and recalcitrant, sort of like Harry Potter, but he must accept his burden to save the world. Good grief, Ben Kingsley just showed up as tattooed as Queequeg and wise as Yoda. I'm gonna bail here.

Still, it's a beautifully pictured (important) part of the Ender ""saga"", that has excellent prequels and sequels (especially ""Speaker for the dead""), written by a master.So, my suggestion would be: read the novel (the whole series, as a matter of fact) on Ender and then watch this movie. Then and only then it shall be excellent to you as it was for me. Otherwise, it will just be a nice action SF, which would be pointless. Why? There are rarely movies that can picture all the layers of messages and thoughts from a story. There have been several more or worse successful attempts. This one tries to compress something that should last hours into a 100+ minute movie, extracting only the crucial point of the story.

I suppose that helps, because I'm not in a position to be disappointed by everything that's not filmed ""exactly like it was in the book"" or is left out/added to the story. On the other hand, I did remember enough of the story that I wasn't going to be confused by the course of events or any ""big surprises"", so that could be a potential detractor in one sense.Admittedly, I also had my qualms about seeing the movie to further line the pockets of an author who reportedly has some very homophobic traits (unknown to me at the time I read all of the books in the series).All that aside, I decided in the end that I just had to see the movie, and I most certainly was NOT disappointed. I am not an expert reviewer, but I am very particular (some would say downright picky) about the movies I see, and often disappointed by movies others rave about.In this case, I thought the movie's pace was absolutely appropriate, the narration/exposition was not rushed or super-condensed, the concentration on the preparation of the children also absolutely fitting (given the importance and the role this played in the book) and interesting, the effects subtle enough to not be ""in your face"" the whole time and yet fantastic enough on occasion to nearly give me vertigo (I was smiling like a kid on a roller coaster).What's more, my significant other, who has not read the book and was fairly unaware of the storyline, went with me to see the movie, and he also felt the movie was very well done. We sometimes make comments to each other during movies (as couples are wont to do), and I think this was the ""quietest"" we've been at the movies in a long time. He understood everything going on (contrary to some of the reviews that we read later) and I daresay he found it quite fascinating.I do NOT share the opinion of some of the reviews I've skimmed through elsewhere that this was some kind of ""tween"" movie, that it was dumbed down, that it was ""too much information packed into too little time (that lasted too long)"", that anything about it was flat or boring or incomprehensible, or that the acting or directing was lacking in any way.As a matter of fact, I was quite positively surprised that the writer(s) and director were able to make such good use of the time allotted to tell what is at its heart a deeply nuanced story and at the same time make it so interesting on so many levels.To my mind, this was one of the most successful book adaptations I've ever seen (but I do reserve the right to take my opinion down a notch or two if/when I re-read the book and refresh my memory in re the details ;-) ).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does NOT.The pacing is ridiculous, the story too contrived, and the characters two-dimensional. I understand the constraints of the film and time and therefore must conclude that it was a foolish mistake to make a movie out of the book. It would have been better to make a mini-series, with a less known cast, over a longer period of time on a fraction of the budget for the simple reason that ""Ender's Game"" lends itself ideally to that type of cinema.

Somehow I assumed that it would be done sooner or later, and that it would inevitably fail, because the director wouldn't understand what the book is about.Orson Scott Card (regardless of what views he holds) is an amazing storyteller. The book is full of long narrative passages and detailed, verbose dialogue, neither of which would lend themselves to be easily converted to a movie script. The book is also relatively long and contains several different subplots and subthemes.As it turns out, the movie lacks one of my favourite subplots, and it overcomes the wordy dialogue and the narration by moving things around, and by condensing the ideas and concepts into much shorter lines, told by suitable characters whenever possible. This may sound like a recipe for failure, but for me it works just fine.While I need to include a few caveats, like that the movie should have been at least six hours long, that the missing subplot should have been left in, and that I'll concede it might not work so well for anyone who hasn't read the book a few times, to me this movie is as good as I could have ever hoped, and significantly better than I expected.Most importantly, everyone involved seems to have understood what the book tried to say.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It turns into a dark and deep movie with a very very strong message.
Brillaiantly acted, lively caracters, great story and even Mr. Ford didn't look as a derivative of Han Solo.
Should be rated much higher than the IMDB rating and in my opinion a must see !! Highly recommended to all true SciFi fans.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has been on my maybe-to-read list for quite a while but I have never gotten around to read it. Thus I cannot say how well the movie interprets the book but if the book is close to this movie I do not think I will bother reading the book.The entire concept, kids being trained to do the job of experiences commanders, is of course a wee bit ludicrous from the start but the way the movie was implemented did not really help. This should be the school of kids that was picked because they were geniuses but the only one that displayed any intellect to speak about was Ender himself. Worse, the school was filled with bullies that really had no clue and which were not only screwing themselves due to their overinflated egos but was prepared to screw humanity by beating up on Ender when they themselves lost. That utter dickhead, Commander Bonzo, just made me want to wring his filthy little neck from the first scene when he made his appearance.There were some cool scenery in the movie. That has to be said. The weightless combat was not too bad and the battle footage, both the ""archive"" footage and the battle scenes at the end were quite cool.Speaking of the end. What the f? These aliens had apparently come to Earth with the intent of conquering us. Wiping us out for all intents and purposes. I did not really see anything in the movie that said otherwise. However, once it is clear that we (Ender) repaid the favor a bit more successfully it is all boohoo, sob sob. Not only that but he runs outside, finds an egg and goes on some pilgrimage to repopulate a world with Formics. That was just ridiculous.This movie was not what I hoped it would be. I was hoping for some real training at the battle school instead of this nonsensical game then followed by some heroics and suspense with the humans fighting off the big bad aliens. I fail to see what floating around weightlessly taking potshots at each other have to do with commanding carriers, battleships and fighter squadrons? Combine that with a silly ending that tries to make us fighting back be a fault and what could have been a good movie just turned into a disappointment as far as I am concerned.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You could really understand why things were happening and what the characters were feeling and thinking. Ender's brilliance was what made him the key role. The way he would deal with the sharpness that was constantly trying to slice into him. Major plot points were skipped. Ender moved on from scene to scene without much incite into his motives and what he had conquered on each step. Some decent visuals and effects, yet for a highly advanced future it seemed a bit plane. Lack of holograms and such. The holopad being just a tablet seemed too plane. Battle room scenes were quite nicely done. Making battle room scenes with 80 people would have been impossible anyway. I recommend to read the book. It's a work of art and this movie just doesn't measure up.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie, it can stand on it'a own quite well. While there were some things that were different than the books, it was over all a very well made movie and a good portrayal. I highly suggest it if you are in the mood for a movie that will appeal to your intelligence and leave you thinking. Though it also has some fine action and memorable lines. Also I would add that the actors chosen for the roles did an excellent job. There was not one poor performance in the movie. When you see Ender Wiggin in the movie, you don't feel like your watching an actor pretend to be Ender, you see Ender!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I read the book before watching the movie, and the movie does a pretty good job capturing all the details from the book. I have to say I enjoyed the book more than the movie. Though the movie did capture as many details from the book as possible their casting didn't quite fit the descriptions from the book. Given that the movie is approximately one hour and forty five minutes, they did a good job of fitting as much as possible into a small time frame but it makes the movie a bit hard to keep up with. It moves too fast and should be given more time to focus on each scene a little bit more and make it more enjoyable to watch. The movie didn't live up to the book. There was no distinct climax or buildup. This was also affected by how fast the film was moving. It didn't give us enough time to fully process what was happening and build suspense. The movie could've also had a bit more foreshadowing. Everything was kind of a blur. The supposed climax was too late in the movie and it was very anticlimactic. I didn't realize that it was the climax until it was over. A little disappointing. Overall I'd give the film a rating of 5 out of 10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some of the nuances of the novel didn't make it into the film but the movie does justice to the book. There is a PC dimension in the movie that was not in the book. The novel is a favorite of mine having read it twice. The book plot focuses more on the character's sadness than the movie but the movie gets it. This is decent film but I found the novel more satisfying.The name of the main character represents an interesting comment on the main objective of the movie's plot. Ender is in training to end a potential threat to the entire population of Earth. Is he able to pass all the tests? Is he up to the task? He is pushed to his limits at a very young age. One of the significant questions in the movie that was not in the novel is whether our perception of the enemy correct? You decide.The conclusion is the same except for an epilogue that adds a wrinkle to the story line that I like and allows for a sequel. The graphics are good.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But it doesn't take long to realise that this franchise is trying yet again to break into the teen fiction market, with yet another scenario change just enough to make it appear different. But swapping the halls of Hogwarts for a space station, the quiddich game for laser tag, Dumbledore for Harrison Ford, Voldermort for the bugs from Starship Troopers and Hermione, Ron & Harry for three other nameless children is all feel like Harry Potter in Space. The film is watchable, but I have no plans to buy the Blu Ray. The big twist ending even a blind monkey could predict. The child's problem solving skills were nothing any kid playing GTA couldn't have figured out. They were never a real test of ability and sending in a kid playing a computer game instead of a seasoned General with actual combat experience seemed silly at the end. Maybe it made more sense in the book, who knows. But here, if all they wanted to accomplish was win, send in a stealth nuke and be done with it. The plot made no sense as to why proved tested military weapons of today couldn't defeat them, or why the technology of the future allowed telescopes that could see absolutely everything, everywhere or why AI couldn't do the job better. The good news is what took Harry Potter eight films to accomplish, they did it in one. The effects were okay and the acting credible. The bad parts - the future looked very much like today. Its military based cadet school for 85% of it and full of young kids so you have to like your army films. Yet children are visibly killed which means you wouldn't really want to show it to your kids. I guess they weren't too sure who to aim the film at in regards to a target audience. Its okay, but i was hoping for so much more and would definitely liked to have seen more of the enemy and there attack on Earth so as to give us audience a reason to hate them and understand the humans motivation for doing what they did. Instead we felt sorry for the aliens and left the cinema on a bit if a downer, which is never good.","11 out of 68 found this helpful.

As rich as the book is in all its philosophical concepts and thought provoking actions, the movie encapsulates some of that. Ender's character is a tactical genius, yet has the empathy and emotions of human. This causes a lot of internal conflicts between his actions and the morality behind it. In the movie, it captures this. He cries and his eyes get red after fights. But the scenes were subtle. The book on the other hand, had pages and pages of all his feeling and thoughts. I could relate to Ender in the book. I had a hard time connecting with him in the movie. In the end, it brought the book together as a complete movie. I just know the movie is supposed to be deeper. Deeper conceptually, philosophically and emotionally, but that's because I read the book.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

From the start everything is dumbed-down to appeal to a younger audience. Anytime the heroes are kids, and they have more powers than the adults, you know who the target audience is....Plot seems like a ripoff of Starship Troopers, and a very weak one at that.Decent cast, and they can all do a lot better. Harrison Ford has seen better days and probably just needed the money, or any acting role. Viola Davis was probably trying to break out of being stereotyped in civil rights movie roles. Ada Butterfield was good in Hugo and Hailee Steinfeld was great in True Grit, but here they set their careers back several steps. Heaven alone knows why Ben Kingsley accepted his role. The money must have been REALLY good. His attempt at a New Zealand accent is quite unintentionally funny though, as, instead, he sounds South African.

Earth was attacked and near destroyed by an alien race, we beat them... barely. And now preparations have been ongoing for 50 years to fight the aliens. Genius children being easier to mold and manipulate as well as being able to process data at a level beyond that of adults are the chosen ones. And the one shining star among all those children is Ender (Asa Butterfield). This is his journey, the genius boy who with the weight of saving earth on his young shoulders, has to master being a soldier and commander in time to fight the battle for survival.Being a major fan of the book and the entire enderverse series of books I was biased (can't help that). So the first time I saw it, I was just picking up on all the places where the book differed, didn't live up etc etc. But on a second viewing (Yes I did go a second time, because I didn't hate the first screening and a few scenes intrigued me enough for a re-watch), I must say I enjoyed it more thoroughly. Turns out key was to get over ALL the things they didn't do from the books and actually enjoy what they did manage to get across in such a short time and from such a difficult-to-adapt book. So for people on the fence based on all the mixed reviews bear in mind most of the really negative feedback is from fans of the book (not all for sure, but most). As a movie it does hold its ground, CGI was fantastic, acting of the lead Ender (Asa Butterfield) is outstanding, seriously! Even fans of the book, once you get over that this Ender is so obviously much older than the one in the book, you learn to appreciate how brilliantly Asa portrayed him. Do watch it! I was biased but all my friends who had not read the book came out exhilarated and eager to read the book, which is a fairly successful adaptation in my opinion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes definitely, but ideally at least read the short story first, it is posted on hatrack.com (the author's website) hidden a few menus deep.Fans of the book may share my puzzlement on some of the director's choices...I had anticipated much more attention on the ""game"" and it's wonderful premise of laser-tag in null-G. I had expected at least a half hour of battle scenes with colorful dramatizations of each of the commanders and an opportunity to see military tactics visualized in exciting action. I figured it would make kids want to run out and apply for Officer's Candidate School.I had expected to be so energized by battle that I would rush out and buy little action figure ""armies"" for Dragon, Rat, Griffon, etc and stage mock battles; maybe even in a ""battle room"" then sit there and practice all the tactics I had learned.I also thought that the ""simulator"" battle games would be so engaging as to make me salivate for the Xbox 360 version.I figured that the movie would revitalize laser tag centers around the world, inspiring them to redecorate to look like the Battleroom and host tons of kids wanting to relive the movie.Alas... almost none of the military and ""game"" aspects of the story. Instead we got a fairly ""standard"" sci-fi movie focusing on special effects and interpersonal drama. It's pretty good at doing that, and quite enjoyable; I just had hoped that the director would focus on the things that make Ender's Game unique.Note to fans! Ender's Game was also released this month as a 7-hour ""audio play"" (like old-time radio dramas.) See hatrack.com to link to getting it from Amazon or Audible.

Well, the things they changed, didn't really influence the main story but, psychologically, it should be very influential on Ender's development. In movie they skipped so much I almost sorry I watched it... The book is so rich and intriguing and complicated... I would prefer if they would do trilogy: Battle school, Command School and The Battle and not rush through with everything in hour and a half. Acting was O.K., nothing brilliant... I didn't like casting for Ender, Harrison Ford showed only one side, Ben Kingsley was best of them all. Dispassionately, I expected much from Bean but there was no space in movie to even understand who he was. I will give credit for special effects - they were spectacular. The world itself that was painted on screen was amazing. The battle (though very short in screen time) was very well done and engaging. That's why I believe that for those who didn't read the book it will be good movie, not deep enough to grasp the whole notion of the story, but spectacular and entertaining movie.

Their fight is over before it starts.The secondary bully is a big chubby guy but never actually bully Ender in the movie.The fight with the aliens is the same, never got personal, so no one cheers at the resolution because we aren't rooting for Ender as much as we should. Whether he wins or loses, he has as much to lose as everyone else, not a tad more.The movie has no humor.If they added another 15-20 minutes to flush out the characters, it could have make a huge difference.

Reading the book was really enjoyable especially that book doesn't have ""any visuals"" so some scenes were coming in my mind from movie while I was reading. Those were great addition to the book. So to sum up - movie and book gave me a gift of one or two really enjoyable days. IF you liked MOVIE - get a book, you will love it even more.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

A lot of the book happens inside Ender's head - and that is complicated to film.But I was pleasantly surprised as the changes that were made to a book didn't harm the story. The story in a movie still concentrates around Ender's transformation from child to commander. Changes that were imposed by the movie limit the time Ender has to learn - he is no longer as young as he was in a book. Some other choices were obvious - there is no Locke- Demostenes plot and this doesn't hurt the movie. I really enjoyed Battleroom appearance and I think it is better than the one in the book :). The movie is nice to watch and I found some ideas that were added to the movie to be reasonable choices for completing the story. There was however one thing that bothered me after I watched the movie - I wasn't sure how many of the choices and changes to Ender situation were reasonable because I read the book. I am not sure if the way the situations unfold in a movie provides strong enough justification for the resulting decisions in the Battleschool. But I strongly recommend the movie and if you like it - read the book, you will like it even more.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

That's the main problem with the piece, though, that it's just unjustly and uncompromisingly boring from beginning to end. The fact that it never gets out of the gate or backtracks on its one good, gut-wrenching moment become minor annoyances when you simply cannot care about anything happening on screen, since there's no engagement to come from the cardboard characters or clichéd plot and certainly not from the well-rendered but usually stakes-less action sequences. It's an extremely poor effort more adept at putting you to sleep than anything else, and it isn't even all that great at that. 3/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Harrison Ford has seen better days and probably just needed the money, or any acting role. Viola Davis was probably trying to break out of being stereotyped in civil rights movie roles. Ada Butterfield was good in Hugo and Hailee Steinfeld was great in True Grit, but here they set their careers back several steps.Heaven alone knows why Ben Kingsley accepted his role.

Everything looked fantastic and breathtaking on the big screen. Actors did a brilliant job. Asa Butterfield is such a talented young actor. I can't imagine anyone else playing Ender better than him. The movie is not only sci fi it also has real feelings which you don't normally find in any typical sci fi movies (I've watched so many sci fi movies before and watching them once is more than enough for me - simply because they're forgettable.) However the personal emotions in Ender's Game were so delicately communicated by Asa Butterfield. His eyes, facial expressions, and actions reveal all sorts of emotions. While watching the movie I felt like I was really connected to the characters, their thoughts, struggles, and pain as if I were there! Everything feels so real in that movie. To be honest I've watched it multiple times already and my interest level hasn't reduced even a bit - and that's part of the reason I gave it a 10. I wish Ender were real and the leader of our planet. Most people who watched this movie would love this movie, unless they spent majority of their energy comparing it to the book. I hope to see a sequel for sure. They better improve their marketing strategy next time by not making it sound like just another sci fi - the movie has so much more than that! Other sci fi/adventure movies that are selling more simply because they have started marketing since long time ago and the actors are well known. If I hadn't randomly selected Ender's Game to watch I'd never discovered this great movie and the great young actor Asa Butterfield. In an interview Asa mentioned whenever making a movie regardless how big or small the role is just try to leave your mark...and he successfully did it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The CGI effects look great. There is a really fun looking zero G training game. I would love to play it in real life. It looks insanely fun. The actors do a good job especially the kids Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld. Harrison Ford plays the hard nose trainer. The best adult actor is Ben Kingsley with the wild facial tattoo. As for the battle, it all feels very removed. It has the playing-a-video-game quality. It doesn't lend itself for intensity. It looks amazing, but it doesn't feel exciting.The story is trying to mind bend the audience with a crazy moral argument. It does it ham fisted and oddly. Instead of poignant or compelling, it's head scratching and confused. The idea is a little too academic and has little use in reality. If the book was about this one idea, then it fails. 'Hunger Games' asks a similar morality question infinitely better. This is a high concept movie with big budget CGI and soon forgotten.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

Also , i think the story telling is a little fall short and plain adaptation.The movie time is short to me.Also , the 2nd movie is a great idea with more sophisticated adaptation. Consequently , ""Ender's Game"" is a successful movie in Sci-fi movies nowadays.I wish the second movie is as good as the first one.

These movies are made for adolescent boys and adults will have no interest in them. Ender's Game about a gifted strategist teen is about as interesting as any XBox video game. All have plastic characters that move predictably to a predictably dumb ending. I wonder if the writers of these movies realize that the dialog gives the characters nothing to do but recite lines in order. I felt really sorry for Viola Davis for being in the movie because she was the only one that gave her lines some life and emotion. For the first time since Harrison Fords' worst movie, Six day seven nights, I could barely stand to watch him on screen. The character Bonzo was the only other one who brought some real tension to this slow and boring movie. Yes like Gravity this movie is cinematically pretty but I am so tired of movies that just look good but don't feel good, sound good or make you want to see more.

Book and film are such radically different mediums (or ""media,"" if you prefer) that a complete re-conception is required when adapting novel to screen. And no two people will ever agree on the way it should be done. Personally, I appreciated that the action scenes were kept brief and crucial to the story's development. The main characters had more room to breathe than in most action-oriented movies, where they have only about two hours to work with. I also appreciated that they avoided the deadly boring black-and-white contrivance of ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy"" (which utterly ruined Avatar, in my opinion). The ideas of empathy and ruthlessness, preemptive strike or diplomacy, fascism and individuality, winning and the cost of survival, were all interwoven and given authentic voices. The characters were about as nuanced as could possibly be expected in a sf alien battle movie. It's a shame so many people chose to make it about whining over Card's beliefs, which were consistently exaggerated when not outright misrepresented. The homosexual activists seem determined to silence those who conclude, based on reason and logic and not just ""faith,"" that homosexuality is disordered, and that marriage is not a right but an institution founded on human nature and the procreative function that deserves safeguarding from distortion and defiling. There's only one clear and compelling interest that the government has in marriage--the engendering and raising of subsequent generations. Which is impossible between two people of the same sex. Card is on the correct side of the argument, regardless of how unpopular it is with the strident, yowling liberals.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Destruction. Decimation. War, in all its principles, sets out to bring peace through nihilistic chaos. Battles commanded by lieutenants whom implement strategies to garner victories amongst enemies. Followers obeying orders from leaders, like ants instinctively abiding by queens. Brute strength alone cannot muster peace, intrinsic intelligence must also be integrated, creating that much desired harmonious balance.Card's original sci-fi novel sits among the very best of its genre. Portraying tacticians through propagandism. Manipulating the youth into battling endless hordes of simulated aliens. Granting ""Ender"" an opportunity like no other. To lead a galactic army. Hood's adaptation is fuelled with cosmically arresting visuals, grandiose battleships flooding the backdrop of Ender's zero-gravity training montages. Pitted in gunfire tournaments, enabling strategies of war to come bursting through the metallic shielding surrounding the spherical arena. Gorgeously rendered rag-doll bodies obeying the laws of physics when paralysed without any noticeable green screen. Intensely designed swarms of insectoid characteristics rapture the atmospheric skies, providing aerial excitement throughout.Alas, for all its technical merit, Hood's adaptation is unable to tackle the bulk of Card's story in a captivating manner. Ender's Game is treated much like the ""mind game"" that the titular character uncovers. Ender and his peers are all one-dimensional, with the ironic emotional capacities of ants. The morality conflict that resides within Ender, as he becomes occasionally inflicted with rage, failed to exert any kinetic energy. Partly due to Butterfield's mellow pubescent performance, but mostly due to the expositional screenplay that treats its characters like chess pieces. Clinical without an ounce of relatability towards anyone. Seriously hindering the conclusive nature of the story, which just so happens to be a terrible ending regardless.The older generation of actors unfortunately looked bored, particularly Davis and Kingsley. Ford gives a decent enough performance, albeit monotonous. The constant shift between batches of characters, especially the transition between Ender's preliminary training and the subsequent promotion, skewed the pacing even further. And again, that ending was atrocious. Never mind the conclusive narration that unimaginatively left the film open-ended. Just the entire simulated ordeal in itself was handled poorly. Not to mention the obscene absence of authority from all actors involved. Shouting loudly isn't authoritative. It's annoying.In the end (heh heh), this simulated game falls short in the tactical psychology of warfare that Card's novel lovingly produced. Fantastical visuals can't disguise wooden acting and flimsy storytelling. Ender should've just called it quits at the beginning.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have read most of the books in the Ender series and found them fascinating with numerous sub-plots taking place and really rich and well developed characters. Unfortunately in this film you get none of that. I understand that you can't always include everything that is in a book in a film due to time constraints but it basically misses out everything that was important in the story. You find yourself watching it and thinking again and again ""how could they miss that bit out"". It's basically a few action sequences pegged together. I think it either needed to be a longer film or maybe made into two films. I can't imagine Orson Scott Card would have been happy with what was turned out.

I have read many a sci fi book but enders game is one book i have never got round to reading, So i can not compare this film to a book i have never read This film is outright brilliant, in many areas with next to none in shortcomings Lets begin with the story, Brilliantly wrote story of a boy having to deal with isolation and eventually acceptance by and for others, With some amazing emotional elements and very well wrote characters and character development in all aspects.The soundtrack is amazing and sends chills and creates scintillating dramatic themes throughout the film with some very key music placed exactly where it is needed.The acting in this movie is resplendent, I watched this film for the only establish actor Harrison ford, but in the long run found the entire cast enjoyable to watch. They all showed their acting talents in this film, and I'm hoping to see a lot more from these actors and actresses in the near future.A graphically beautiful movie with some of the most spectacular CGI i have seen in a movie ever, The only downfall to the effects in this movie is lack of practical effects which could of been used in the film in key areas Overall i found this a extremely enjoyable film with action emotion and an overwhelming soundtrack 8 out of 10 Damian Hockey","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I imagine this was a great book, it made Orson Scott Card a New York Times bestselling author and went on to become a classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel (I must see if I can find it as an audible book). The movie aged the main character from a 6 year old boy to a teenager, which was probably necessary for practical cinematic demands, as well as to make a character to which an audience could relate. The casting and performances were good. The CGI was convincing. But, my high marks are for the premise itself, well executed.

It covers several years of time from the point of view of a young, growing boy, so having a single, identifiable child actor was always going to be difficult. And many of those years were important so you couldn't just skip over them, although this movie largely did just that, which pretty much killed any value or depth in it.Not that I blame them for doing so, because it could have worked. Asa Butterfield hits that right butter zone, no pun intended, where he is old enough to be a capable actor, theoretically, but he isn't too old for a movie that's all about child soldiers. Compressing the timeline within a year allows Butterfield to play the lead throughout the entire film, though it creates the slightest sense of ""why didn't they start this whole process sooner?"" There's some handwaving involved, but it's not enough. Still, it's a tough problem and I can't blame them for trying.Unfortunately it still leaves us with the problem of there not being enough character development. Ender's Game was always all about, well, Ender. It was his journey, and we followed as he grew up, learned from his mistakes, achieved victories. But when the movie isn't even two hours long - a bawling choice if there ever was one - we don't get to see much of that growth, which begs the question ""What then?"" What else is there to show if the film makers apparently decided that Ender's growth doesn't warrant much screen time? Apparently special effects and flashy sets drew the long stick, as they're very much in front. This creates a weird paradox, because the actual book described to Battle School as a very sterile place. White and cold, a very utilitarian military feeling, yet there was a lot of going on on a personal level. Whereas in the movie there's too much flashiness on a visual level, but the character interactions feel sterile. Not the right call, film makers.I really think that this movie would have benefited from an extra half an hour. Now everything feels shoehorned in and we don't get enough time or space to mull over things. It's supposed to be this big dramatic movie about using children as instruments of war, but the film tries to force the message down our throats through heavy dialogue and exposition. Not the right way to do pretty much anything. If you like the book, this isn't your movie. If you're looking for a visually pleasing scifi film, I've seen worse.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Regarding Donald Armstead's review-Confused as to why he has a problem with height difference between Ender and Bonzo. Actor playing Bonzo is clearly older than Ender, in fact, he is actually 3 years older than the actor playing Ender. Even then just watching them it's obvious.

Ender's empathy is what drives the whole story: it contributes to rapid promotions; allows him to become a leader; & is the single most important tool he uses to find the weakness in his opponent, but it also forces him to connect emotionally to the enemy & results in a great burden to him when he conquers them.Outstanding acting all around from both the veteran actors and the kids. The movie adaptation is less dark than the book which works for me. I want to be able to watch a meaningful, thought-provoking story with my teenagers, one that offers complexity of character and situation that leads to discussion. Most of the special effects and environments were convincingly futuristic and realistic. The soundtrack enhanced the story and added to the emotional weight already there. We loved it enough to see it a second time, and while the element of surprise was no longer there, we enjoyed the movie just as much. We were able to pick up a few things we missed the first time, talked about character motivation, actor delivery, plot, etc. It was very satisfying because there were so many elements to explore.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Great as the movie is, it manages to entirely miss the point of the book it claims to portray.I found the first half (battle-room sequences) which were brilliant, much superior to the last half (the space ships were more reminiscent of ""Transformers"" than anything else). Still, my belief is that if ever a movie deserved a sequel, this is the one. Pity it didn't do better at the box-office.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A four-hour movie would've been too long.The team that put the movie together captured the heart of the story and stayed true to it. The visuals were stunning. The acting superb. And the pacing was riveting.This was everything I could've hoped for in a movie. It revealed the inner character of Ender. It showed his vulnerabilities and told us what he cared about. As with any story that means something to us, the protagonist learned and grew. He became more than he was at the start and his evolution was believable--well-grounded in the events that touched him.We owe a lot of this to the original author, but the screen writer could've botched it. Happily, he didn't.Leaving out details that were in the book seems to have worked in the movie's favor, because it helped us to feel the uncomfortable changes in Ender's life--fast, unpredictable and jarring. With finesse, ""Ender's Game"" could deliver these feelings without jarring us out of the story, in a fashion similar to that of ""Das Boot"" showing us the sailors' boredom without the film itself becoming boring, or like the sentimental nature of ""Casablanca"" conveyed with care without becoming sappy.I'm no fan of shallow entertainment and the fast-food, instant gratification junk that I'm seeing more and more of in so many film releases. But I'm no cynic, either. I don't have to have bigger, better, faster, louder. This film stands on its own. It provides a complete universe and a satisfying story arc.This is the kind of film I don't mind watching again and again. I don't often give a film the highest rating. This one deserves it in every possible category.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The young kids saving the planet is fun in a kids fantasy but that's all. At least the violence and concept weren't revolting like in the Hunger Games.Harrison Ford is a little old for the role. Middle aged actor would have been better than an elderly one. Asa Butterfield from the tedious Hugo has a lot to carry on this shoulders in the role and he does a good job with the role he is given - feisty and vulnerable at the same time. Hailee Steinfeld is suited to her role too. Can't imagine they could cast her as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet though she isn't romantic role beautiful.Overall it's a grandly done kids movie - that's all.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It lacked some character development, but the acting by Butterfield and Ford was pretty good. Now, to the bad part. If you read the book, you won't like the movie. The writers and director changed too many things from the book to the movie for it to be a solid adaptation. Some of the errors made a solid sequel to this movie impossible, as many plot points are missing, or just falsely done. I would've been willing to sit there for three and a half hours if it meant that they could get a solid and book-driven movie. Unfortunately, they didn't. It was almost two hours long, and didn't adapt well at all. There's no reason why they couldn't have gotten more of the plot correct, even in the time allotted. They should have made the movie longer. It was meant to be a longer movie. They didn't however, and it made the movie not nearly as good as it potentially could have been.

"3","/10","Battlestar Galactica meets Lord of the Flies as absurd premise of kid space cadets fighting aliens sinks this flick from the get-go","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3010610/?ref_=tt_urv","Turfseer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0225436/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2014","After watching 'Ender's Game' for the first five minutes and understanding the film's premise, my immediate reaction was 'Yikes!— look's like I'm in for a long ride.' Yes I must confess that my initial impression that the premise was ludicrous, was borne out by the rest of the plot and attendant hokey character machinations. Why exactly does humanity choose to employ children to battle insect-like aliens (aka Formics) who attacked and almost successfully destroyed earth fifty years earlier? That's a good question for Orson Scott Card, the author of the original source material, who wrote the book (of the same title) which the movie is based on. It's an easier question for profit-hungry producers, who speculated that allowing prepubescent kids to act out their fantasies in what essentially is one monotonous video game on screen, would translate into mega-profits at the box office. At the end of the day, 'Ender's Game', only made a very small profit due to its reliance on a slew of computer generated effects.As for the Ender's plot, it revolves around a kid who has the same apocalyptic sounding name (does it mean he 'ends' the threat of the alien invasion or earth is at an end?) Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin (played by an overly intense Asa Butterfield), is a cadet who catches the eye of Commander Graff, who sees potential in the reserved and thoughtful twelve or thirteen year old. Graff is played by Harrison Ford who manages to be unpleasant throughout, barking orders at Ender and generally conforming to the script's call to play the boss as a boorish martinet. While in a regular training school, Ender gets into his first physical confrontation with classmate Stilson, after defeating him in a space ship simulation. He also impresses Graff's subordinate, Gwen Anderson, when he figures out how to defeat a giant troll-like creature in a 'mind game' program designed as a no-win scenario (the CGI-effects here, along with a later scene involving one of Ender's visions, are perhaps the best parts of the film). Ender then graduates to the much more fancy battle school where students fire laser guns at each other in a giant sphere dubbed the 'Battle Room' in a zero gravity atmosphere. Kids who love video games will probably find all of this endearing but for me, most of it reminded me of the typical dated paeans to military school cadet culture (here now with the students dressed up in spacesuits). When Ender is appointed the 'commander' of his own band of 'misfits' and defeats his former commander, Bonzo Madrid (no, not Bonzo the chimp!) in one of those battles inside the sphere, the second clichéd fight occurs between the two afterward, inside a shower room. Ender decides it's 'Bedtime for Bonzo' after he puts Madrid into a coma (again Commander Braff is impressed by Ender channeling his hardly utilized inner Rambo).Ender ends up being promoted to Commander of all forces and is transferred to a base of a former Formic colony. There he meets Rackham, the legendary commander who found the key to defeating the Formics in the epic battle fifty years ago. Ben Kingsley manages to out growl Harrison Ford, as another over aggressive mentor assisting the heralded lap dog, Ender (and yes, Kingsley's atrocious tattoos all over his face, are certainly not endearing at all). I have no guilt feelings about revealing the film's deus ex machina, so SUPER SPOILERS are ahead: the simulation that Ender (along with all of his pals from Battle School) engage in, which annihilates the Formic planet, was for real. Thus Graff turns out to be a true martinet, a stand-in for over-aggressive, right wing, American military types. Ender, however, feels horribly guilty about being duped into wiping out the Formics. He realizes that the earlier mind game scene he involves himself in, is right outside the base and after encountering a dying Formic Queen, he vows to take the Queen's egg and colonize a new world with it. Ender justifies his actions by claiming that the Formics attempted to communicate with him, before Graff and his minions did their 'dirty work'. The problem is the Formics did indeed try to destroy the earth's population but the film's scenarists provide no explanation as to the original reason for the invasion. Therefore, Ender's assumption that their attempt to communicate is not justification enough for him to save the Formic species. Ender is unable to refute Graff, who implicitly argues that any attempt to communicate could very well have been a ruse. Unfortunately, the idea of kids being put in charge of a fighting team in place of adults, seems to be an absurd conceit. And at a certain point, it isn't difficult to figure out that the filmmakers intentionally allowed Ender to take the moral high ground after he gets oh so 'touchy feely' with the that one last Formic egg (damning Graff for encouraging the kids' aggression, deceiving them but not explaining why he was wrong in the first place about the danger of another Formic invasion).There were a few moments here and there which were nicely done, particularly Ender's mind game where he encounters the Formics for the first time inside the castle that was destroyed during the initial invasion. But watching juveniles beat each other up or blast one another in simulated war games, was not my cup of tea. This despite the films' scenarists wishful thinking that killing is bad if you don't give a dangerous, former adversary, a chance to redeem themselves, in the face of the flimsiest of evidence. Others might dub all this 'liberalism run amok'; as for me I'll simply return this disc to Netflix as fast as possible and move on to something more worthwhile!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Movie goers looking to enjoy the emotional and philosophical ride that they experienced in Orson Scott Card's book, Enders Game, will leave feeling flat and unfulfilled. The film manages to adequately document the plot of the book while going above and beyond to create the visual aesthetic. The computer effects, costumes, and art design (if you ignore Ender's eye shadow) are stunning. Unfortunately, the producers did not give the same attention to other important elements in film. Where the book drew the audience in, giving them an internal and external viewing experience, this film simply showed the audience everything they needed to get the gist of the plot. In fact, all of the vehicles that Card used to create depth and wonder in his novel were absent: character development, patience, Ender's personal journey through his computer game, his siblings, and all of his families activities that were crucial to having any empathy and understanding for Ender himself –all absent from the film. The film does not show, it tells. The complex themes in the book are cut down to a simple story of unrealistically quick adaptation and ingenuity. The soundtrack is the same cliché heroic orchestral hurrah that we hear in every TV epic. They might as well have just used the Game of Thrones soundtrack, in fact, they might have. Without the stunning visuals and a few good performances it would be a complete failure. Asa Butterfield is the only real standout as Ender. Other performances were adequate, but unfortunately the writer's didn't give the actors much to work with in terms of emotion or expression of any kind. Films can have the same level of depth as books. It is dumb to expect the same experience in the film that you got from the book, but you can at least hope to see the film done with all the necessary trappings of a story well told. Overall it is a visual joyride, a depiction of Orson Scott Card's plot (albeit significantly watered-down) and little more.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

At least they need to make ""Speaker for the Dead;"" then we can see a better-balanced rendition of what Orson Scott Card is trying to say to us.As with many movies, there is not enough time to portray or even imply what the book tells us. The best we can hope for is a good reflection and not let the movie change the story for its own ends. This is one of those movies that tried in the time allotted to give you not only the feel but to put in as many details as possible.The choice of actors was a pretty good match for the characters. The graphics did not overwhelm the story. The background music did not washout the dialog. Unfortunately, the version I watched did not have a voice-over commentary to add to the experience. We view the story as a third party and never really get into anyone's mind.To many readers, it will never be justified. To people that have not read the book, it may be obscure. But at least they did not try to make a different story out of it. I am trying to restrain myself from comparing this film to classic sci-fi stories. To the movie's credit, they did not dwell on technology. The story here is about people and societies that just happen to take place in the future.The basic story is that it looks like we have been attacked and nearly annihilated. Our only recourse is to do it unto others before they do it unto us. We do not know their intentions but take no chances. In the military we are always taught that no two wars are the same; we can train but must be flexible and take initiative. The prime here are that children are more flexible and amendable to new environments.We are left with a moral question. This question will be better developed in the next book and hopefully the next film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You can read Ender's game at 13 or 30 and still enjoy it, the movie cannot remotely make this claim.This movie takes a sci fi masterwork and turns it into tween plop. It is infantalising nonsense that sanitises the life out of one of the great sci fi stories.The producers have taken a fairly brutal story tackling serious issues and turned it into a video game.

We see this movie theme MANY times EVERY year. If you are white, especially a white male, you most likely LOVE this theme so you will feel at home watching this garbage. We've got Harrison Ford here trying to make a weak white kid violent to serve his purposes(war, of course). Btw, Harrison(Han Solo) was good friends with ANOTHER white male that ""saved the universe "" in a few movies that you've also probably seen. LOL! The movie is full of white males(and white- LOOKING males) intimidating and dominating non-white males(""watch your mouth, Nick"", ""That's right, I'm the boss!"") and ALL of the females in one-on-one situations where they are equally armed/matched. Funny, but I don't see this too often in MY real life but it's an old, old, theme in American cinema. The script has damn near every Black male character picking on the ""smartest kid in the whole outfit"" to continue the practice of using MOVIES to instill fear and hate in whites towards minorities. They also have the Mexican kid picking on him for the SAME purpose and since you often can't tell the difference between a white person and a Latino, they make SURE to have him speak Spanish for a second. Of course, he is eventually defeated by the skinny white kid who we all know the FEMALE love interest would probably defeat in a fight. The ""hero"" goes from not being able to fire a weapon, to being a MARKSMAN after having ONE brief lesson from the beautiful female love interest, who of course, is all goo goo over this skinny nerd. Again, I don't see beautiful females attracted to skinny nerds too often in REAL life either!! LOL!! Later, they have him being promoted OVER a grown Black man who, of course, seems to have no problem taking orders from a KID since EVERYBODY knows that he's ""the One""! Sound familiar? LOL!! Every white male supremacist patterned movie MUST have SELL-OUT minorities, desperate to be celebrities, to play the part of the ""inferior"" characters and in this movie, the MAIN one is Viola Davis. One of the more insidious quotes in the movie is: ""Follow the rules and you lose, choose violence and you win."". The ONLY reason I gave this flick 3 stars is because I like the fact that the star REFUSES to follow orders that go AGAINST his value system REGARDLESS of the fact that a ""superior"" gave the order. I like THIS message just like I respect cops who report the unethical behavior of rogue cops in their department.I didn't write this review to start a debate with whites(or ""Uncle Ruckus""-type minorities) about white supremacist messages in the media. There IS no debating this and I WON'T engage in one. This review is for minorities and non-racist whites who are TIRED of watching these cheap Hollywood vehicles meant to SUBLIMINALLY program the public into their respective ""roles"". I watch a lot of foreign films too and they have WAY LESS white male supremacist/racist messages in their movies. Even though there is supposed to be freedom of speech in America, I'm sure that sooner or later, the elite white male power structure that is BEHIND this ancient ART OF WAR technique, will attempt to shut me down for EXPOSING the OVERT and COVERT white supremacist messages that we have FOREVER seen in American media. I've already read that IMDb reserves the right to choose the reviews that THEY want to choose. But until THEN, I will be the movie critic that you can depend on to call out white supremacist messages in the media. I will ALSO be calling out the minority actors that continue to ACCEPT and PLAY these degrading roles.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

If, after the lights come up, I sense I've learned something new, and if, years later, I run across the film again, and positive memories are reignited, then I consider the film a plus.Many of the reviews on this site focus on the negative aspects of the effort. I'll focus on what I found to be a positive experience.Whether we confront a bully at school, a well equipped enemy at our borders, or are invaded by an alien life force intent on occupying our territory, war sucks. People die, people are maimed, equipment is destroyed, and the psyche of the triumphant as well as the vanquished are both forever changed. And not in a good way.The over arching theme of adults using children to fight their battles is not a new idea. But Ender's Game sets up all the conflicts, internal and external, in a new way. So, though there are weaknesses in the movie, I've never minded them during each of the three times I've enjoyed it.

The effects are well done, the acting was decent, and the storyline, though much different from the book, was not terrible. Still, I found myself disappointed. Perhaps this is what happens when you wait 30 years before making a film adaptation. So, if you've never read the book and don't intend to, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you want the better version, at least in my opinion, I suggest you skip the movie and read the book.

Too many times have movies made from good books failed to accurately portray said books, but likewise many such movies are very good on their own.Surprisingly, this movie actually fits the second description.It is no spoiler to tell fans of the books that the movie leaves many things out. That is a given with most any such movie, because it's simply impossible to fit everything from the book into such a ""short"" movie and still keep the audience engaged. The story IS rushed, and I can understand that some fans will find that annoying enough to talk the movie down.That being said, when I try to see the movie as a somewhat abridged version of the book and just a movie in it's own right, it actually turned out very well.Harrison Ford is good, the kids did very well, the score is fantastic, the cinematography brilliant and the CGI pretty much flawless.It does have flaws in the story which could and *should* have been fixed to maintain the original storyline, so I'll only give it an 8/10, but it's definitely a good movie.Very enjoyable!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Damn good. The book is incredibly well loved: All of my friends have been freaking out over it, so i decided to give it a whirl. This movie has a bunch of kernels of good ideas. Ender's conflict between pacifism and militarism, his siblings representing the downfalls of either extreme, genocide as a means to reach peace, when is it right to exploit a child?... All great discussions for a long movie, or ideally, a series of movies or 2 season TV show. As it stands, trying to cram all of this into a 2 hour movie cripples it. At one point, a man says ""I will never salute you"".. .and ten minutes later he salutes Ender... but why? As far as I could tell, all Asa Butterfield did in those 10 minutes was win at laser tag. Literally. This type of sped up character development is prevalent throughout the movie. There is a plot twist towards the end, and I was just as surprised at the characters. The implications of children in was and the morality of genocide is explored well enough. But again, i think those ideas would have benefited from being explored over a couple of seasons of a TV show to give you time to attach to characters. Again, with the pace of this movie, you're whipped from one place to the next so quickly you don't have time to care, with rare exception On the plus side I love the visual style of this movie. It's gorgeous to look at. If you read and enjoyed the books, you'll probably get a kick out of it like everyone else I know. But as someone who doesn't know these characters, I felt like this movie was too much, too fast.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film delivers: the acting, the CGI, the plot and its underlying strategy: using these kids because their reflexes are better, they're fearless, but keeping the BIG secret till it's over because of the emotional impact. Unfortunate that the sequels were not filmed as well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Time and time again you watch Hollywood butcher something you love, and it ends up leaving you rolling your eyes every time you see a trailer for a book you loved instead of getting excited.. This was my reaction to the Ender's Game trailer. I refused to watch this movie for the longest time. I thought the trailer looked ridiculous, and was positive there was no way to take that book and make it into a movie.Welp, Hollywood you got me this time.Speaking to fans of the book, you have to understand there is no way to take a book and make a movie that is 100% true to the book. It will always be disappointing waiting for something you loved in the book to come across on the screen and that moment never come, and yeah, there are plenty of things that got cut. Unfortunately 2 hours isn't enough time to touch on the character development, or each story that you loved and gripped you so tightly while reading.. but all things considered, I thought the movie was a fantastic portrayal of the book.Speaking to somebody who never read the book, you have nothing to lose in this movie. It is fantastic, and I almost envy the unbiased ability to enjoy this story for the first time in such a great movie.I've learned any book made movie is going to flop with critics, but I ask you to ignore the negativity and give this movie a chance.

Got to watch in 3D, the special effects surely will come more real and cool.2. for the characters. this movie tries to show how the real world is focus on two main characters, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield). - Colonel Graff. He only sees these children merely as a tool or pion to win a war (I'm helping my father raising horses etc. he didn't care about their feeling as long as earth wins (when he cuts ender debate by saying something like I don't care as long as we win). in real life, it shows a selfishness of an adult that ""I don't care anything as long as I win"". - Ender Wiggin. A boy who at first compassionate of becoming a commander and fight these creature (surely destroy them). but as he follow the training and all the experience he had, got a turn point become more rational, hate the war, questioning about the enemy. this shows how in real world when a boy grown up, meeting up new experience and people will shape him and mature him.3. The bad guys. at first i was focusing on the characters, so I didn't care too much about the alien etc. but when Ender finally met the alien, whereas in this movies, it was shown as a creature grasshopper and ant fusion. How on earth and alien world that an graso-ant be able to made a battleship like that, how they build it, etc. I mean do they build it with their psychic power or what. for me it should be a bit more rational bout the creature. but then again this is from a book.4. The ending. for me it would be a good movie if it ends just focusing on how will Ender react after being lied by adult (graff), knowing he merely only a tool to kill. how Ender will facing the rest his life where in one sided he will be known as a hero who save earth for all time, but on the same moment his consciousness will full of guilt of being a murder, a destroyer of a planet, an entire race.This is just my personal thought. Forgive me if there any of my saying insulting or anything.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So, going in I understood that the movie was probably in all likelihood not going to have the depth or breadth a book could have.However, even know this, the movie fell a little flat. The pacing seemed clipped at some parts, and there is no explanation given at all why his brother and family act the way they do. There is obviously a lot of psychological/philosophical stuff that is going on in Ender's head, as well as in Graff's head and the other characters, but since this is a movie we get to see none of that so all their actions felt precursory.The filming style and the ""deep serious we-are-running-out-of-time"" music throughout the entire film just made it feel like one long, 2 hour trailer than a movie with a beginning, middle, and end. The ending felt super rushed, and the ""reveal"" of what the final game is felt predictable.I guess you could say the entire film felt a bit predictable, like some sort of Hunger Games YA story in space- which I know that the books are very much NOT young adult books. And part of that predictability to me comes from not knowing any of the motivations for the characters beyond one-liners as explanations.Not to say that it was a bad movie- just mediocre. As a sci-fi movie, there are a lot better ones, and as an action movie there are also a lot better ones.I think the movie-makers/script writer floundered here. Even as someone who never read the book, I could see that they were trying to fit/adapt something that was more cerebral into a faster-paced dystopian sci-fi action movie, and it failed, especially towards the end. I could see glimpses of where they tried to bring on bigger moral issues into the movie, but given the short amount of time and how much ""action"" they were trying to cram into it they could not afford to linger too long on those issues and so as a whole the movie came off as ""not quite"".Vaguely entertaining, but forgettable. Not bad, but I came in with higher expectations of it being a good science fiction film, and it was only so-so.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In 2013, the young adult dystopian novel adaptations were over saturating the market. After the popularity of ""Hunger Games"", movies like ""Divergent"", ""Maze Runner"", ""Mortal Instruments"" and ""Host"" made audiences think that ""Ender's Game"" was just jumping on the hype train. But this movie goes above and beyond its contemporaries, in quality acting, characters, storytelling and presentation.In so many of these ""chosen ones"" storylines, the main ""chosen"" character is the dullest character of the bunch. They are typically just blank slates meant to be the audience surrogate character. That is not the case for Ender Wiggins. Ender is a master strategist. Throughout the story you see him applying game theory to his various interactions and it is fascinating.The acting from all those involved is absolutely on point, not a bad performance in the cast. The music and action choreography are also very well done.Those who had read the book, have informed me that the book is still the better version of the story. And when the movie comes to the ending, that does become clear. The books and series do flesh out the story a lot more and elaborate on some plot details that the film omits.Overall, I thought this movie was very clever, interesting and unique. I can understand why it wasn't a crowd pleaser, but this was one audience member that really enjoyed the game.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And that is a very good start. Fair music, noticeable right when needed. Could be better, but not all movies are grand movies. And most importantly... something that practically all modern movies totally lack... SENSE! This movie has sense(whether thanks for the original book or not). It has morale, logic, a deep thought about it. And it's not something on the level of Disney drool opera of Avatar scale. Nothing like a big flip off with the purpose of guessing of Promotheos. It's not about victory, it's about the reason for victory. Really something amiss in modern competitive gaming.What could be better? Perhaps a bit more story escalation. Of course, the whole movie is about the genius rising, but the plot looks too much placeholder. Maybe something else, but can't quite figure any other real issue.What's important, is that the movie fits it's motto - balance. Tactical, quality approach. It may not be a grand blockbuster, but it's not another stupid Sci-Fi that you will watch for lulz and soon forget. It's a movie that both entertains, becomes memorable and teaches. I give it 8, it may deserve more, it may call for less. But it should stand out above average low-quality designs.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ppl will nvr be satisfied for movies that are casted based on a famous novel/game etc. The thing is that for a movie that lasts for only 2 hours, of course it can only deliver 5% of the book. You want a movie that follows the book exactly, it takes, idk, maybe 60 hours. It's just impossible.Still, unlike some ppl who like to complain, I'm quite delighted that the most of the key scenes are covered in the movie, altho many details are neglected. But again, some details can only be delivered by words, especially thoughts of the characters. Still, the movie realized some of the imaginations when I read the book about 11 years ago successfully, and for that I am truly grateful.For fans of Ender's series, remember, if you don't expect anything, you will nvr be disappointed. If you expect that movie covers everything in the book, maybe you should pick up the dusted book from the bookshelf and read it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Definitely that goes for The Hunger Games the books were so much better. This is not normally the top of movie I would watch but Ender's Game is worthy of watching more than one time it is a good movie with a good message. I do think the movie would have been better had it been longer and more developed but considering people don't have the patience to sit that long it's definitely an underrated movie. Watch and enjoy. It took me two viewings to really get what was going on since I had not read the book.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can agree with the fact that some parts are left out, but that's just the way movies has to be made. When you only have around 2 hours to tell a a story that took around 8 hours to read, you have to cut stuff out. Having that said, the makers has done a great job to select what parts that should be in the film. It's a total blast of effects that truly does the books descriptions justice. I can't imagine any other way to do this film and make it more like the book.So despite having parts of the text left out and some parts cut a bit short, it's a very good adaptation of the book!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I saw the movie before I read the books so for now I'll just talk about the movie. After seeing the amount of time and effort put into this movie, seeing the actor's actually receive some ""boot camp"" training and Zero gravity experience, the Director went above and beyond to make sure everyone transformed into the role given to them. As for tying into the book, it worked. We have to understand that the only way to get every important detail from the book this would have to be a T.V. show. So they worked with what they had and it was amazing. I've seen Ender's Game a handful of times and will continue to. Awesome job everyone!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Good acting, good story and for the time good effects. The movie has good actors and the pace was good. There are some moral themes in the movie and it shows what would happen to our society when a drastic change could happen. I thought it was an interesting take of how humanity would deal with the problem presented in the movie and the drastic changes the world had to go trough in order to continue forward. It also shows the negative aspects of some of those changes too. There are other factors in the movie that I will not get into, so there are no spoilers.

CGI is good, cinematography is superb. The concept of the movie is good and has all the necessary requirement to make the movie a good and strong movie but the execution was really pathetic.To conclude I am not impressed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is a very short list of movies that I thoroughly enjoyed that had a lot of CGI.This film, however, is easily the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen with a lot of CGI. And I mean a lot.I thought this movie was as visually great as Gravity, if not better, as the cinematography added a lot to the CGI, especially the 2001-like circular shots. The CGI also works because this is a fantasy world. It makes more sense in this situation, whereas in GRAVITY it was supposed to look real.I still cannot get over how brilliant that combination of cinematography and CGI turned out. I have not seen it before or since, including GRAVITY. It was a visual feast.Of course, there is more to this movie than the great CGI. The battle-games, while they seemed random and irrelevant, at first, were again brilliantly captured by moving shots as the kids floated around.The acting and dialogue was solid, from Harrison Ford and Viola Davis to the young Asa. What was especially great was the confrontations between this triangle of characters, and the lack of repetition within these confrontations.Each time they felt tense, because it was tense in the movie. Every time, an argument or confrontation had a point. Add this to the grit that Asa somehow put into his performance despite his baby-face like features. This came to the fore when he is confronted by fellow cadets who don't take a liking to him. It was a strong combination of solid acting, from all the cast.Another big plus was the lack of a meaningless, distracting 'love-interest'. Perhaps that is because it is based on a novel, but it certainly does the movie a favour.The ending was also meaningful, it was thought-provoking while not being a silly 'Sixth Sense' twist, and its emotional strength stands this movie above most others, especially regarding sci-fi.This was a very solid film, better than all the other sci-fi rubbish that hit the screens in 2013, by a stupendous margin.Fantastic!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm against his homophobic views. I still didn't pay for it. The reason why I watched it, was because a lot of people love the story. I hated the book, it was very boring. The whole training was repetitive and ridiculous. I was hoping on screen it would be better.At the beginning they hammered in the whole ""we barely survived last time, but for the hero commander"" thing too much. The battle game rules weren't explained. It's been a while since I've read it, so I was confused at times. Mercifully, the Battle school part was a lot shorter than it was in the book. That was where I gave up, so I was glad. However, the part after that feels a bit hurried, and it's over before you know it. The story of the movie was fine. It wasn't great, though the ending was a bit moving. What was missing was connecting with the characters. It felt shallow. It occurred to me that maybe it was that no character was on screen very long aside from Ender, and he was a hard character to connect to. However, in The Hunger Games we barely got to know Rue, but I was still crying in the theater. Though I believe this problem was also present in the book, and contributed to my not finishing it. The focus was too much on Ender, whom I couldn't manage to like, because I found him a conceited little snot. The other people were just there for Ender, but more like paper cut-outs, than real people.The actors were fine. I don't think that the lack of connection was due to their acting. They tried to amp it up with Harrison Ford, and he was okay. Asa Butterfield did a good job of playing the creepy kid, even if I didn't like the character he was playing. Though he had experience in being the weird child, because he played the young Mordred in the TV series Merlin.The visuals were top notch, though I felt that they were overdoing the space station orbiting Earth picture. Like it cost a lot, so they were milking it for all the seconds they could get out of it. The Battle dome I imagined a bit differently, but this looked much cooler.Overall, a watchable movie. It still didn't solve me the riddle of why some people are so in love with the book, but that could just be me. I really put aside my bias towards the author while watching. However, I still can't give it more than 5 stars, though I almost gave it 3.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ending tends to be a big failure, that after all we think that whats the purpose of this movie5 out of 10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So many crucial parts were left out that take away from the story. The movie felt like a cliff notes version of the book that cut out too many important factors. The story could have easily been turned into a Trilogy and with all of the author's other books, they could have started a franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It makes no effort to really pull its audience in and tell a properly engaging story. I had a complete lack of care or remorse for every character in this and the situation they were in.It is immensely cliched, not doing anything new or interesting, clearly borrowing material that worked in other Sci-Fi or adventure movies, but not doing them in a way that is half as inspired. It boasts a very decent cast, but it saddens me to say that they are all delivering some of their blandest performances. The likes of Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley and Harrison Ford have certainly proven their worth in previous roles, but they can not do anything to save the immensely poor dialogue here. Did nothing to engage or entertain me. Stale and uninspired, it is in your best interest to give Enders Game a miss.
A talented young boy is recruited to lead a battle against a dangerous alien race. 
Best Performance: Harrison Ford
/ Worst Performance: Abigail Breslin","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Although my last reading of Ender's Game was about fifteen years back, I remember it fondly, especially the balance between character development, action and plot flow. The movie has little of that balance. I was left feeling like I had viewed an unedited version, with the transition and character development scenes yet to be added, and the ""catch phrases"" that focused the book, just crammed in, any place they might fit- irrespective of chronological logic or story. As I was pulled from one jagged scene to the next, there was little time to know or care about the characters or the plot (I didn't even care about the fate of the human race- which is a tough trick to pull off). I found myself wondering how anyone unfamiliar with the book could even get anything from the movie experience.Yes, adding another half hour for character and plot development might have helped, some; however, even more important would have been writing and directing that showed some understanding of what actually made the book worth reading. This just felt like a rushed mess.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film had me on the edge of my seat form the moment it started to the moment it ended. and I an absolute Fan. I am reading the books as we speak, I am not usually a fan of these end of the world type of movies but this one had me glued to the screen. Asa with his Big blue eyes and easy going charm made this film a true Gem among so many Hunks of Coal that we have seen in these many years I enjoyed this movie right form the get-co. Even though this film stared kids I would not suggest this for any one under 12 , due to Violence of a graphic Nature IE the fight seen,s, also there are deep emotional things going on hear that a younger child might not be able to grasp. I give this a Ten out of Ten Stars","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Instead, they looked to cash in on great word of mouth (from the book) a high profile headliner (Ford) and some admittedly excellent special effects.The movie is adequate.

This second ending is so contrary to the whole point of the game, and the entire movie, that it literally unravels everything and leaves us back at square one.The director's lack of resolve is exactly what the game was intended to eliminate. This is the driving ideology of drone warfare. It's not about saving lives, it's about removing all the emotional interference that prevents an individual from reaching and committing to the only logical conclusion.I'll give them this, they didn't try to turn it into a trilogy in an effort to bleed us out of every last dime.My rating is based on what it would have been without the weightless interference.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
