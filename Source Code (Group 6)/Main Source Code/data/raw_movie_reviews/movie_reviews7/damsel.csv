LOTR or Willow it is not. I highly doubt it will stand the test of time because it lacks the depth and complexity of great fantasy movies. Even so, it was (for me, anyway) a nail-biter and a perfect low-investment, high-velocity movie for a night when you just want pure entertainment. There are a few missteps that made me roll my eyes a bit, such as Brown's overdone makeup, but I wasn't expecting great art. My only regret is that I watched it right before bedtime, because it was so exciting that I had a hard time falling asleep and sleeping deeply.","51 out of 66 found this helpful.

This is not an indie Oscar Winner movie and it doesn't pretend to be neither.Stop trying to look for art in everything, like there are Bethoveen masterpieces and Tomorrowland EDM music to just jump around there are also movies to admire with all your senses and movies to enjoy on a Sunday evening.The movie is good and it doesn't deserve to be bashed because people were looking for another Schindler's List on it.","432 out of 655 found this helpful.

Once it actually gets to the central idea of cat and mouse between a Princess and a Dragon it's a lot stronger, powering through on the momentum of the endless chase.Despite a few big names in the supporting cast, Millie Bobby Brown really carries this. There's some really clunky lines of dialogue here and she delivers them with enough conviction to make them work. Shohreh Aghdashloo voicing the Dragon is inspired casting that really helps it get going after the weak opening.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's direction does a lot to help this Netflix original come closer to looking like a real movie compared to a lot of what's come before. It essentially spends the entire run time alternating between some solid sets, locations and distractingly low quality CG with some good individual set pieces and ideas which remind you this is the director of 28 Weeks Later.","213 out of 340 found this helpful.

Is it for everybody. No. But. For what it is and intends to be. It is quite good. Elodie is not a Mary Sue. She is not perfect. Not all knowing. And. She has an arc and growing pains in her story. I will be the first to admonish companies like Disney and the Ilk for interpreting beloved characters for modern audiences. This movie does none of that. It has created a heroin that has to use her wits and smarts to win and conquer her setbacks. In a good way there are cringe lines and
moments. But. For the most part. It's good writing and it serves the story. I know we have been fooled once too many times. But. This is not one of those. The acting is good for what the story needs. We need to be accepting of new takes on old stories. As long as they don't try to change a beloved story or character to push their message or what their beliefs are. Again. Not for everyone. It is enjoyable.","99 out of 155 found this helpful.

A straight forward simple plot, basic dialogue, and surface-level only character development in keeping with the kind of fairy tale stories it is based with a little twist on the old tales in that the princess finds her own strength and makes her own choices.Locations, sets, costuming and CGI were all well done and everyone delivered solid performances.It's not ""Reign of Fire"", more like a ""Snow White"", so don't overthink it or expect anything groundbreaking and just watch an entertaining movie.","20 out of 27 found this helpful.

I like that kind of stuff so I was entertained. Millie Bobby Brown is still a young actress and since the excellent series Stranger Things it's obvious she will get a lot of roles in the future. She's definitely eye candy and isn't a bad actress. The movie is mostly about her so she has a lot of screen time. The special effects and CGI's were of good quality. The story is simple and easy to follow. You just have to be a fan of the Fantasy genre otherwise you won't like this movie.

Sure it was corny and predictable, but sometimes you want that in a film.But it also held my attention for the entire run time - which is kinda impressive considering my short attention span (normally I'd be on my phone after the first 30mins or so).Plus the dragon was brilliant. I loved everything about it. It's design and animation was cool and Shohreh Aghdashloo's voice was perfect fit for the dragon - Gravelly, but still matronly and feminine.If you like female heroines kicking butt, dragons, fantasy and pretty special effects and just want some mindless entertainment - give it a try.","62 out of 89 found this helpful.

He's a film critic who gives his reviews while pretending (I think) to be drunk. He absolutely eviscerated this movie.However, I quite enjoyed it. It took a basic principle of the damsel in distress and added a new twist. Millie Bobbie Brown is the damsel of the title, named Elodie. She is the oldest daughter of the King Bayford (Ray Winstone). Elodie has a younger sister, Floria (Brooke Carter) and her stepmother is Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett). Their kingdom is very poor, so King Bayford betroths Elodie to Prince Henry (Nick Robinson) from a rich kingdom run by Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright). The problem is, Queen Isabelle's ancestors tangled with a nearby dragon (Persian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo provides the delicious voice of the dragon) and are forced to offer a sacrifice to the dragon in the form of a princess. By having Prince Henry marry someone from another kingdom, they can sacrifice that poor girl instead of one of their own. So, naturally, Elodie gets hurled into the dragon's lair after her wedding.However, Elodie is not your typical damsel. She is smart, resilient and resourceful. She plays a cat and mouse game with the dragon trying to stay alive. Along the way, she discovers the truth about the dragon's history.Ms. Brown is very good as Elodie. She does not come off as a girl boss. She is determined, scared, brave and vulnerable. Angela Bassett also has a nice turn as the stepmother who is anything but evil. Another trope twisted, as she is a fierce ally. Robin Wright is elegant and vile as Queen Isabelle who is willing to offer up innocent girls to save her kingdom.The sets are beautiful and the action is well directed. The story moves along and is very compact so we learn everything without having to have it explained to us via exposition (a very common thing with today's writers). There is no fluff in this movie and its runtime of 110 minutes moves along quickly. The one negative in this movie is the dialogue. Its not terrible, but its not great either. Some of it is corny and some of it comes off as copied from an old folk tale. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it does make you chuckle for the wrong reasons.I gave it a 7 because of the dialogue and some of the scenes are so dark you can't tell what's happening.","22 out of 33 found this helpful.

This is truly a most mediocre movie, a more or less soulless rehash of well-known and overused stories, woven together without much skill and intelligence, creativity. Anyway, Damsel is like too many movies these days - produced, directed, and written by people without any heart for the art of movie-making. It's no more art but work. What else? Production and acting are sufficient, special effects meandering between solid and rather bad computer game cinematic. Final words, Damsel is boring, redundant, generic, and as plastic as it gets - not one character one really cares about, because, well, they are all just a copy of a copy of a copy. And the revelation or twist in the end is so predictable, that it is really just lame: a couple of days ago I put Krull again on my plate - it's (almost) Citizen Kane compared to Damsel. Exact rate: 3.5.","495 out of 752 found this helpful.

Granted, the sorry is fairly simple and somewhat shallow, but the action is incredible. The cinematography is fantastic and the special effects are phenomenal. Everything is seemless. Director Fresnadillo did a masterful job. I fell in love with both Elodie and the Dragon. (Millie Bobby Brown is much better here than in that lame role as Eleven in Stranger Things!) And if you find yourself rooting for the Dragon, don't give up! Not sure I like the very end, but I can't come up with a better ending myself, so I'm quite satisfied.I don't recommend watching this with very young children.","35 out of 61 found this helpful.

I only ended up giving it a chance, was due to its relatively good trailer that made me very intrigued.I didn't have any expectations going in, hope for the best but expect the worst. Overall this film is decent. It's not splitting the atom and not gonna redefine cinema in anyway however it does its job. Good acting, easy story to follow, great CGI and production design plus finishes in under 2 hours.Off topic but if this isn't an audition for playing Wonder Woman in the future, I don't know what is. I thought Millie Bobby Brown was very comfortable and believable in this lead role. More action centric roles in the future?60% out of 100, its not just Netflix trying to be Disney, there is a bit more to it. With the correct target audience this film will blow up probably. Not every film needs to be pushing the boundaries. This one certainly stays in it's lane and delivers a solid product.","59 out of 118 found this helpful.

A really simple story, so i had low expectations, but they were exceeded at almost every aspect.First of all, the dragon. My god, the dragon was pure perfection. Best design and CGI i have seen for a dragon, and that includes GoT. Amazing.The atmosphere was also spot on. Especially with how the backstory worked out to be. The dressing department also needs a raise. I also loved that there were moments of gore that i did not expect this type of movie to have. Thank god that directors are starting to let their movies have a more realistic tone.Millie was pretty good, not great but also not bad. When she acts like a heroine she pretty much nails it, but when she acts like a normal person i find her a bit too bland. The father and the queen mother were also pretty good, everyone else was okayish.It is a great movie for an evening that you want to get lost to a (quite dark) fairytale story.

It is as predictable as it is slow to get going, but I at least enjoyed the production and visuals throughout! The cast is okay, and nothing else. This would make for an excellent short, where many elements are trimmed (the ""Augur of Ebrietas"" slugs).. as most characters are as simplistic and shallow as shown immediately after their quick introductions, so the rest of the story would remain intact.Personally, I don't appreciate movies that have little to nothing to say.","278 out of 440 found this helpful.

It won't break records, it won't be remembered within a few hours of watching it, but it did it's job for the most part, and that was entertain... well it did for me anyways.The good things about this movie are the visuals. The CGI is really good considering this is a TV movie. The costumes, set design, and dragon design are all fantastic. It's a good film to look at. The action scenes are well shot, and there are some very well directed scenes. The flaming bird scene for example. I was surprised how violent this was considering it was rated 12. There were some gory scenes, and some really graphic burning moments.The characters, the world and pretty much everything else is poor. The acting is flat by everyone, even the greats like Angela Basset feel wooden, but they can't exactly do much with the bad dialogue they are given. Millie is ok, I guess. She's not bad, but not good either. I will say this, her character wasn't this boss bi*** like Hollywood have a habit of making these days. She get's beaten throughout the movie, and only has her smarts. You won't see her flip some 6 foot man while wielding a greatsword, instead she uses her wits. This made her a little more likeable.The biggest praise goes to the dragon. This character had more development than any other in the film. Voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo, she brings a very well needed thrill to this otherwise dull flick. All of her scenes were all done.But that's where the praise ends. I'm sure the writers and director wasn't trying to make some masterpiece, obviously, but they made a reasonable flick here. It's just fine. There are worse things out there.6/10.","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

The two Enola Holmes films were great... and this next one was action packed again... Makes me so happy that she is choosing these types of narrative's of strong characters that need to fight back...She would be great in a new Alien film...!This story centres on the ye old medieval times when the kings and lords think they can send out the 'weak' as a sacrifice or to appease the gods or what ever they think will keep their own peace and happiness... Not the happiness of the common folk... This is where the films gets interesting, because a character that has nothing, has nothing to loose when they know their internal character is telling them what to do...And fight is that response... I really thought the special effects were done well, including the dragon... It's not the best fantasy film ever made but I felt like it had enough originality to be engaging. Millie is often at the centre of the frame and flying solo in many of the tense scenes, here she does well. I would have liked a better, bolder ending...

It feels like all of her Netflix movies are the same and yes you can argue about genres and plot but with Enola and now this all of her characters are very, almost impossibly strong and unbeatable no matter in what circumstance they are under. The characters that she plays are way too same and unrealistic. This is not to upset Millie or her fans. I think Millie is very talented, but she also has to be open for more diverse and complex roles. The movie was okay, I guess, I think younger girls will enjoy it more.","164 out of 261 found this helpful.

Millie is growing as an actress, and though there are times you can feel a slight disconnect with her character throughout the film, she still manages to give it just enough to keep the audience on her side. The only balance I was distracted by was the walk between this being a youth fantasy film vs young adult/teen fantasy film. At times it seems like the targeted audience was a much younger crowd, but then they would push the boundaries a little, making it difficult to decide where this film should actually fall.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

Elonie has a heck of a time rescuing herself from this vengeful dragon which has a good reason for its ways. The dragon was pretty fearful and liked taunting Elonie as she's being hunted. When the truth slowly draws forward, this story takes the sharp turn and it makes you understand the whys for the dragon and the story. So great to see Angela Bassett and Robin Wright playing such interesting characters. Bobbi shows some good moments of pain, battling and coming to understand what the whole deal is and then going from a damsel to a bad ass warrior.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

Even the overweight parents that were there because they were apparently starving to death. And finally, the one scene in the film where they crammed a woman of every ethnicity in so that they can tick yet another pc box off, without actually offering any benefit towards what they were trying to be pc about. The ending was beyond rushed and definitely the highest cringe point of it all. Worse than cowboys riding into a sunset. Can't call that a serious movie.

Damsel's dragon may be the coolest movie dragon l've seen since Smaug. If it wasn't for the ending which I felt was a little cheesy and heavy-handed, I would say they completely knocked it out of the park with this Netflix film. The rest of the movie is good fun. I love a good adventure/fantasy flick and this one delivers most of what I was looking for.Unlike with most adventure/fantasy films, Damsel is contained to a relatively small space and it has a relatively simple plot, and it's refreshing, exciting, and suspenseful at times. It's a beautiful movie to look at. I'm talking landscapes, costumes, colors, the creativity with the lighting, and the overall picture quality make this movie eye candy. It reminded me a little of 2008's Journey to the Center of the Earth in how imaginative it gets visually.The design of the dragon is splendidly ferocious. Her voice and dialogue contribute to her menacing presence. Millie Bobby Brown exudes confidence and determination and gives us a character we can put confidence in.I like that this is a grittier film than it could have been. No unnecessary humor. It takes itself seriously and gives us some good PG-13 violence and dragon action!","189 out of 336 found this helpful.

The film explores themes of self-reliance and courage as Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown) embarks on a journey to save her people and herself after finding herself in a precarious situation after a rushed marriage proposal takes her to a distant land.Overall not bad, as far as fantasy movies go, but for some reason it is not allowed nowadays to make movies in which everyone has the same skin color (even if its a remote made-up land) so we are forced into the regular inclusivity woke story, but whatever.At points it was definitely felt like MBB was there just so that the production can put a big name on the actors list, her name is so big it makes Angela Bassett looks like a tier-C actor. But I was not crazy about either of these casts, they were 'ok' but didn't really carry and served more value for the production than the story.Need to point out that the CGI in this movie is phenomenal, starting from the great sceneries all the way to the creatures and monsters. It is done well, and not overdone. It's too bad that the story is a shallow (no real character exportation) and narrow (mostly happens in one place) so this is no 'lord of the rings', not even by a long shot.In essence, 'Damsel' is an entertaining fantasy movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family (beware, there are some bloody death scenes and scary scenes, so not suitable for small children). There is noting really new to be told here, but at least its beautiful and engaging. Exact score: 72 / 100.","17 out of 37 found this helpful.

Good job too, as she is carrying a good 95 per cent of the screen time!After literally being thrown into the Dragon's Den, our Damsel in-a-dress goes into full on action mode as she tries to escape her perceived fate as a sacrificial lamb-to-the-slaughter. The question is, can she fight fire-with fire or will her flame soon flicker out...Though the story starts well, it begins to plod while certain elements of the screenplay leave the viewer pondering its overall depth and continuity. However, it still manages to keep you engaged and interested enough to see how things play out.The dragon itself is impressively evil and sinister, which perhaps leads to the films biggest faux pas - it's rather too scary for kids, yet not adult enough for a more mature audience.All in all then nothing particulary new or groundbreaking, but still decent enough for a one-watch on a rainy day... a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire as it were...","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

My biggest complaint is the main character has Lora Croft, or Batman levels of plot armor. She survives several situations that should have left her dead or at least crippled, noy to mention the other convenient circumstances. The movie tries to be smart, and portray Elodie as whitty by the end but it mostly feels like the writing is cheap and lazy. It's a fun story and the beginning is done well and it has a likeable ending but the middle feels a bit lacking. They should've made the movie a bit longer and fleshed it out a bit more.

It also contains a timely message about seeing the other person's side in conflict and understanding the root cause of people's actions.Considering the family friendly nature of the movie, I found it refreshing that stereotypes were subverted and the good guys didn't always play gentle.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

She should stay away from these kinds of movies that will only turn her into a one note type cast actor. Her agency is riding her to the bank like every other young up and coming actress in Hollywood today who are quickly fading into obscurity because their agency keep casting them in these AI written movies.Show you have more versatility Millie Bobbie Brown and play a couple of dramas, a comedy, a horror movie, thriller. Stop turning your carrier into an staircase...

The girl that faced her fears, and realised that it was all a lie survives. Not a particularly original concept, but a good story overall.

"7","/10","A mixture of Ready or Not by way of Dragonslayer, Damsel manages to be a well-made, but familiar, inverted fairy tale.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9665453/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2024","In a northern land ravaged by frost and famine, Lord Bayford (Ray Winstone) is sent a letter from Queen Isabelle (Robin Wright) of the Kingdom of Aurea requesting princess Elodie's (Millie Bobby Brown) hand in marriage to her son Henry (Nick Robinson). Once in Aurea Elodie and her family are taken aback by how rich and elegant the kingdom is while Elodie's stepmother Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett) feels something isn't quite right. After Elodie and Henry are married and engage in a ceremony commemorating a tragedy that befell Aurea from an ancient beast that resulted in sacrifices to maintain prosperity with Elodie now the latest sacrifice as she is tossed into the caves. Within the caves lurks a fire breathing dragon (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and now Elodie must repurpose her royal trappings and use her wits if she wishes to escape the caves with her life.Damsel sees Netflix reteam with star Millie Bobby Brown and producers Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum with the streaming having worked with Brown on the very successful Stranger Things TV series and Enola Holmes films while Roth and Kirschenbaum previously gave them the YA fantasy film The School for Good and Evil. Netflix secured the rights to Damsel shortly after the success of acquiring Enola Holmes in 2020 and after waiting for Covid conditions to die down and shoot the film and having its release delayed by the strikes last year, Damsel is now available on Netflix and if you're looking for a straightforward but well-made inverted fairy tale this is reasonably entertaining.Much like prior Joe Roth fantasy productions, Damsel features some polished looking kingdoms with ornate and elaborate sets and costume designs but the movie is at its strongest when it steps away from those trappings and instead opts for grittier and modest surroundings like Elodie's winter-ravaged northern kingdom or the elaborate cave system that serves as the dragon's lair. In many ways it feels like it's not too far removed from the universe of Joe Roth's films like Snow White and the Huntsman or The Huntsman: Winter's War even down to Robin Wright's Queen Isabelle inviting comparisons to Charlize Theron's Queen Ravenna from those films (while also being the least interesting part of the movie proper in what's a pretty thankless role). Where the movie exceeds however is in Shohreh Aghdashloo's vocal performance as the dragon who creates a memorable, menacing, and often times frightening antagonist and making herself a welcome addition to the pantheon of cinematic dragons (especially ones that speak). Not only does the dragon sound good, but it's also well designed with a striking, distinct, and expressive face that the effects team are to be commended for crafting.But this of course leads us to the titular Damsel of the film and much like Millie Bobby Brown's prior headlining features she's no less good here and shows strong presence in lengthy stretches where she's the only character on screen and has to react to effects that will be put in later. We've certainly seen this kind of ""anti-princess"" fairy tale setup before with the Joey King movie The Princess coming to mind as a recent example, and while its become a well-worn trope at this point Damsel doesn't linger too hard on it and keeps its focus primarily on the survival game which is its strong suit. Angela Bassett also feels like she's kind of wasted in a role that has promise with her being a more benevolent stepmother in contrast to the fairy tale trope, but unfortunately like Robin Wright it feels more like a placeholder role that doesn't allow too much.Damsel creates a memorable antagonist and a solid hero and pits the two against each other in entertaining and often brutal ways in an efficient and effective manner. Some of producer Joe Roth's tropes with the fantasy genre are showing their age with diminishing returns, but there is enough new added elements especially with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's taught direction that fans of grittier fantasy fare such as Dragonslayer will find plenty to appreciate.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

As the plot developed, when she has to survive from the terror all alone, Millie managed to make us care for her character. And in the end, I almost cried ""DRACARYS!"" just to cheer Millie!Overall, Damsel was quite a pleasant surprise. It surpassed my expectation, especially the CGI parts. But, I refuse to believe that in the far cold north, even in a galaxy far far away, there would be a black woman who was chosen to be a queen.

Millie Bobby Brown acts as if her every movement or line is worthy of eternal praising. It becomes so dramatic and calculated that, even though her performance is entertaining as the damsel not-in-distress, you just see the actress and not the character. You can distinctly see Netlix's mark in this production. It is too mechanical and artificial that it becomes flat, losing - or never earning - its soul. On a more positive note, Robin Wright's performance was just great, those piercing eyes made me reminisce as Claire Underwood in House of Cards. Great was also the voice of the Dragon, scary and revengeful but not overdoing it. The special effects at times immersed me more into the story (the castle was beautiful), occasionally though were a bit too much. Is it cheaper to recreate green fields, then to actually film in real ones?

Could there have been a little more to the movie? Yes. But was it still a really cool idea, beautiful scenery, awesome main character, amazing dragon, interesting plot? Yes! I thought it was pretty cool. Finally a movie that makes sense for me to pay the ridiculous cost of Netflix. The dragon was so cool. I loved their bond at the end after they discovered the truth together. Millie Bobby Brown did a great job at her part and she looked like a badarse. Only thing I would've done different is more to the story with the baby dragons and maybe a happier ending like there were more of their kind someplace and then maybe more to the end of the ""curse"" and how the people ""got what they deserved"", specifically the queen. I was really hoping the prince would come to. But. He didn't. And he took it like a champ at the end, so there was that at least.This is a pretty good movie. Action. Sacrifice. Constant running and chasing. And a coming together at the end.I thought it was great. So did my kids. (=","58 out of 101 found this helpful.

A like how director took the story, specially the part with Elodie being victim of a dragon in search for souls to take. I will not write spoilers, and I think you will enjoy this film. Effects are great too and done the right way. Caves, creatures etc. Are also great. My lady and I enjoyed this movie of a warrior girl in search for the truth. We enjoyed this film. It is a dark fairytale, so don't look for errors in it, just enjoy the movie and don't fall for negative reviews. Negative reviewers try to be smart, so they babble you into oblivion.

The only predictable things were what you saw in the trailer anything besides that there's no way you would've predicted the rest of the movie lol. I do wish in the trailer they wouldn't have put as much information, because like somebody else said in a review, you already knew what was going to happen so the first 30 minutes were as exciting. Other than that I thought this movie was good! Definitely give it a watch! Millie bobby brown was an amazing actress throughout the movie! I'm not someone who cares for it to be perfect dialogue, so maybe others who read a lot more into that's stuff think a little less of the movie. The fx was also really good in my opinion! Also I HATE when a good movie doesn't have a satisfying enough ending but I loved the ending!

Just like Enola Holmes before, it has high production quality and it's quite entertaining. All but the ending.One complaint against this film was the pacing and I agree. This is basically a collection of three parts that have nothing to do with each other: a very long setup, a creature feature and a ""moral of the story"" ending that fails miserably because it negates a lot of the rest of the film and goes so far down the girl boss path that it just cleanly breaks off and feels like a slap on.So I have to rate this average.

It's a female lead with castles, pretty dresses, and a dragon. A badass princess is always appealing. Plot is thin and simple. It's like riding a rollercoaster you rode before, you already know the bumps and twists but it still gets your heart racing.I like Millie's acting here. She carries the scene even alone. Though I do lament that there's not enough scenes with the side characters to establish more from them. I did tear up in one scene but perhaps that's me being easily pulled by emotional goodbyes.The highlight to me, aside for Millie, was the dragon. The Dragon was perfection. The visuals were great I didn't have any trouble seeing anything even during dark moment. The ending was both satisfying yet lacking...like I wanted more? There's some wonky moments but yeah overall it's actually a fun watch.

We're so used to modern TV and movie's tendency to have random things happen to propel the plot, that we forget how classic movies used foreshadowing to set up key plot points. Just being something is unpredictable, doesn't make it good, and vice versa.Damsel sets up practically everything. ""Chekhov's gun"" is movie element that introduces something that at first seems unimportant, but later plays a key roll in the film. This movie has Chekhov's clothes, lamp, knife, worms, armour etc etc. Without spoilers, in the third act the hero revisits a dozen elements that were previously introduced and it was great to see these elements reintroduced. It means that everything in this movie has purpose and everything is done for a reason.I'm not saying this film offers a master class in story telling, but I simply want to give it credit where credit's due. It's solid, with great build up and payoff. I loved where the ending was going and it wrapped everything up perfectly.I feel a special shoutout needs to go to the CGI team as well. Not only is the CGI genuinely great (save maybe one scene) but the ""monster"" design of the dragon is excellent. We don't even see it until half way through the movie (like any good monster movie) and I just love it. The cat-like body, the dextrous thin tail, the rattling scales, the crown-like mane. It all looks great and is actually memorable.As for the plot, no it's nothing mind boggling, but it's new enough to be interesting and keep you on your toes. The pacing is fast and it knows when to end. It's an easy recommendation for me for anyone looking for a good time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Usually because of too much CGI and explosions instead of story telling, but mostly because it has replaced smart scripts with political agendas and vehicles to promote and push sequels to every new franchise it tries to launch. Super hero movies are idiotic and serve more as platforms. Comedies are insulting and unfunny. Historical dramas care more about inclusion than history. And the list goes on.It was therefore quite surprising to see that for once they went the other way and instead of selling one more scifi or fantasy movie that would hopefully (for them) serve as a vehicle for some new trilogy, they opted to make a classic good old fashioned movie with a beginning, a middle and an end.Damsel is not one more CGI fest, it has no twists or surprises, but follows one of the most classic plots of the genre: ""good princess gets betrayed by evil queen"". Millie Bobby Brown gives a very physical performance and she is really good as you can see she out her heart in making the pain and effort completely genuine, she reminded me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard, so kudos to her.Do not expect something outstanding in terms of originality: Damsel is pretty straightforward. But it is shot with passion, energy and the purpose to tell the story right, and as such it is a great fun watch for the whole family.However, at times it becomes a little scary and violent, so I would not recommend it for kids under 10.Damsel is really good because it succeeds at being exactly what it's meant to be: a fairytale not gone bad.8/10.","100 out of 188 found this helpful.

She holds her solo scenes well and convinces you she's seeing the CGI you are seeing on screen. Also, I love the bravery and heart this particular heroine has.

"6","/10","Pretty pretty good. Not great. But not awful either","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9778747/?ref_=tt_urv","julesfdelorme","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73554187/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2024","There are those actors who I've never caught out in anything that wasn't very good. Despite her young age Millie Bobby Brown was shaping up to be one of those actors. Granted, I've only seen Stranger Things and the two Enola Holmes movies, but I like them both a lot, and I like her a lot in them. Damsel is not a bad movie. Not exactly. It has a wonderful cast including the divine Robin Wright, one of my favourite British character actors, Ray Winstone, and Angela Bassett, though the latter is given absolutely nothing to use her considerable talents on. And Millie Bobby Brown, up until now, has been that rare combination of a very good and very likable actor. But a very good cast cannot save a script that has nothing new to say or to show us, a dragon that never feels real and whose voice and dialogue verges on just plain silly. And Millie Bobby Brown herself, and maybe this is just me, but I think it isn't, seems to be putting on an accent despite being British. All of that makes it sound like Damsel is an awful movie. But it's not. It's good. But it's just good. And it has all the elements and the cast to have been a better than just good movie. And the presence of Robin Wright and Ray Winstone, who seldom make anything but very good or great things, and of Millie Bobby Brown herself suggests it started out to be something better than it turned out to be. Maybe they polished down the script until it was too generic, until it had no edges or quirks. Or maybe the direction went for glibness and hallmarks rather than texture and uniqueness. It just feels like Damsel wanted to be a much better movie than it turned out to be. As a star vehicle, which it was obviously meant to be, Millie Bobby Brown is just not given any moment to exercise her considerable charm. We don't see that almost goofy laugh or that smile. And maybe she herself wanted to try something more serious. But it's a mistake. Because we don't end up caring about or liking her character deeply the way we did in other roles. And similar things can be said for the other superb actors in this cast. We see little of Robin Wright's range or her command of subtlety. Ray Winstone has some moments, but they are few and the film definitely does not make use of this this actor's presence. All these actors are cast as types. Not characters. And the same can be said of Millie Bobby Brown in the lead. And again I'm making Damsel sound like a terrible move. It's not a terrible move. Many people will quite like it I'm sure. And then they'll go on to forget it. Who knows. Maybe the actors did give better performances and it all ended up on a cutting room floor. Well, they don't do that anymore. But you get my drift. Maybe some editor, the director, or some producer just took it and made it as generic as inoffensive and as safe as possible, and in doing so, cut the soul right out of this film. Or maybe they just made and settled for a good enough but not great movie. I don't know which would be worse. That they made this sort of good film on purpose. Or that something or someone happened to make Damsel less than the film it wanted to be. I'd give it a 6 out 10. I think there are enough good elements to raise it above 5. So, you decide.... If you're a Millie Bobby Brown fan, you'll probably still be one, just a little bit less of one, after watching Damsel. Or, if you want to remain a big fan... Maybe give Damsel a miss. At least for now...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

They don't have much vegetation, and cant seem to grow any, probably because the princess keeps cutting everything down for firewood.Then the movie just keeps going.This is one of those movies that will please no one. In my opinion it is based on a book written by a gender studies graduate who was kicked out of the living room when her older brother invited his friends to play Dungeons and Dragons every other Thursday. She complained to her parents, but they said he could use the living room for that. And because her Social Studies teacher explained to her that any time a boy is allowed to do something that inconveniences girls, it must be avenged no matter how long it takes. So she is taking revenge on all lovers of fantasy with making of Damsel.","34 out of 63 found this helpful.

This is a story about sacrifice, bravery and unexpected twists of fate. The plot of the film, based on a classic fairy tale, is reinterpreted in a new way and complemented by vivid characters and spectacular special effects.This is a story about courage, loyalty and love, which makes the viewer experience a whole range of emotions. The painting stands out for its visual beauty and dynamic scenes. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has created a world that is both alien and familiar, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the plot with their heads.* Idea, plot, dialogues:The idea of the film is original and unusual. The storyline that follows Princess Elodie develops unexpectedly and fascinatingly. The dialogues of the characters are worked out to the smallest detail. They are bright, expressive and match the genre of the film, which makes the characters lively and memorable.Elodie's dialogues with Prince reveal the depth and complexity of their relationship, showing different sides of each character.* Key actors and their characters:* Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has created a vivid and spectacular film that impresses with its beauty and atmosphere. He works masterfully with the frame, creating a unique visual impression.Fresnadillo masterfully controls the pace of the film, maintaining the tension and interest of the viewer throughout the entire viewing. Thanks to his talent and professionalism, the film becomes unforgettable and leaves a deep impression. One of the scenes in which the kingdom is shown to us is spectacular and beautiful. It creates a feeling of flight and freedom.* Script writer and director:Dan Mazo, the writer of the script, has done a great job creating a fascinating plot and vivid characters. The script of the film is thought out to the smallest detail, it is logical and consistent. Dan Mazo's script is a strong link in the film, offering a fresh look at classic fantasy motifs. The scene in which Elodie fights a dragon is characterized by dynamism and tension. She captures the viewer from the first seconds and does not let go until the very end.* Cinematographer Larry Von has created stunning shots that seem to transport the viewer to another world filled with wonders and dangers. His cinematography in the film is done at the highest level. Each scene is shot with great skill, creating a unique atmosphere and mood. This can be observed throughout the film, where the main character, realizing that her fate is to become a victim of a dragon, makes a desperate and exciting escape. This moment is full of tension and demonstrates the strength and determination of the character.* Dave Fleming's music adds epicness and helps to highlight the key points of the plot. The musical accompaniment in the film is performed at a high level. The music blends harmoniously with the plot and helps to create the right atmosphere. When Elodie meets the dragon for the first time, the audience experiences a mixture of fear and admiration.

It's smooth and logical. The composition of the frame is thought out, and special effects add special magic to the film and are used skillfully and unobtrusively. The battle with the dragon at the end of the film is a visual spectacle that demonstrates the mastery of special effects and the choreography of the battle scenes.* Comparison with other films:The film can be compared to ""Game of Thrones"" for its political intrigues and to ""Harry Potter"" for its magical element, but ""The Maiden and the Dragon"" has its own unique charm.* Advantages and disadvantages of the film:The advantages of the film include a fascinating plot, vivid characters, excellent acting, high-class directing and cinematography. Despite the fact that there are practically no flaws, upon closer examination, you can find some minor flaws in the graphics and action of some characters.The film is unique in its approach to depicting dragons and the relationships between the characters. He is also logical in his plot development. However, there are some points that raise questions. For example, the scene with the ritual where the princess and the prince seal their marriage with blood. Later, in another scene, we see how the dragon feels the royal blood of the prince in the veins of the princess, but does not feel her own blood. It seems that the princess was immediately given a blood transfusion and replaced, which causes the main problem of the story.In another scene, there is a feeling that the dragon has no sense of smell, and she cannot find the princess by the smell of the very blood that we saw earlier. There are still some scenes with the dragon, where it seems that she is not the smartest and wisest, as is usually the case.* Is watching a movie exciting in one go?The film is really exciting and allows the viewer to watch it in one go thanks to a well-choreographed rhythm and an interesting plot.* Unpredictability, suspense:Despite some predictability, there are moments in the film that keep you in suspense until the very end. The viewer can never be sure what will happen next.* Emotions, thoughts after (or on time) watching:The film leaves strong impressions, evoking emotions from excitement and delight to sadness and compassion. After watching it, there are many questions and reflections that make you think about the value of sacrifice and the power of the spirit.* Personal impressions:For me personally, ""The Maiden and the Dragon"" has become one of the most vivid and memorable films of this year. I rated the film slightly above average for its visual appeal and acting.""The Maiden and the Dragon"" is a movie worth watching for its visual splendor, good cast and fascinating plot, despite some predictable moments.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Brown's hand has been promised in marriage to the scion, Nick Robinson, of a neighboring & more affluent kingdom negotiated by the machinations of Robinson's queen mum, Robin Wright & Brown's king, Ray Winstone (nice to see you again!) even though Brown's stepmum, Oscar nominee Angela Bassett, has doubts about the union (being done since their own kingdom is in dire financial straits) yet Brown's younger sis, Brooke Carter, is all for it. Upon the final wedding vow (where slit palms & comingling blood seal the deal), Brown is tossed from a precipice into a series of caves where she awaits her fate to be food for the beast as a talking dragon, voiced by Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo, makes her case to be fed (we've witnessed in the film's opening salvo a king & his men tried killing her but not before destroying a trio of her eggs). Brown realizing her situation (& surrounded by victims that didn't make the grade) sets off on a lengthy battle between her & the fire breathing monster where all truths will be exposed & Brown can save her own hide in the process. Brown smartly continues to enrich her relationship w/Netflix by picking savvy projects which fit nicely into the persona she's cultivating (I wouldn't be surprised if a third installment of her Enola Holmes series is announced soon) where she wisely tapped into a genre which is very popular but not something which apes something else (like the glut of big screen fairy tales like Snow White & the Huntsman & Mirror, Mirror from a few years ago) making Brown's prospects rosy for some time to come.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Later she also played in the Netflix productions of Elona Holmes and played in the unspokably bad Godzilla II: King of Monsters. The titles mentioned don't immediately make me eager to watch Damsel, but the trailer decided to do it anyway. Next to Brown, we see Robin Wright as evil queen Isabelle and Angela Bassett as Lady Bayford, Elodie's stepmother. The direction is in the hands of Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also directed 28 Weeks Later and did so not undeservedly after Danny Boyles 28 Days Later. Throw a budget of a sloppy seventy million dollars and you should really have a good base to make a nice movie. Well, unfortunately that is not often the case with Netflix productions. In fact, I think there are only a handful of really good films made from the Netflix stable, which do a lot better in the field of series.Fortunately, that is not the case with this film. Despite a lot of negative criticism of this film, I don't really understand that, because Damsel has become an old-fashioned fun adventure. Still, the film needed half an hour of start-up time, where I even considered turning off the film after 20 minutes. This was more because there is a large prince and princess content that you normally get to see in sweet royal comedies. Fortunately, that's just working towards something, because after this half hour the film comes off well. When Elodie is thrown into the dragon's den, it will take a while before we get to see the dragon. Perhaps the dragon could have been a bit more imposing, but the dragon's fire spitting has been well thought out. It's not a normal fire, but when the fire hits things it turns into a kind of lava-like substance, so that when the dragon spits fire you can't hide almost anywhere.The film has a neat playing time of an hour and 45 minutes and that is a perfect film length for a film like this. It all shouldn't have lasted any longer, giving the film a good balance. Elodie is the great heroine of the story and when it finally becomes clear how the fork really seems to be in the stem, Elodie swears revenge and that leads to the final fight between Elodie and the dragon and that can be called quite exciting. Perhaps the film is just a little too exciting for too young viewers and there are a few pieces in it so that the film has rightly received age advice of 12 years and older. If you want to watch this with younger offspring, it is advisable to check the film yourself in advance whether it is possible.Damsel has finally become a good Netflix production for young and old. Millie Bobby Brown plays the tough damsel Elodie who has to take on a dragon and escape from his cave. The effects are very beautiful, where it is mainly the fire spitting of the dragon that is very nicely animated. The dragon itself might have been a little more imposing, but good. If you make a movie this way, it's a little thing to take for granted. These kinds of films were actually made on a large scale in the eighties and nineties for the last time, then dragon films went a bit in a different direction, which is why Damsel is a welcome surprise where you will have a very entertaining evening when you go to watch it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Millie Bobby Brown does it again, as the damsel Elodie, first hopeful and naive, then scared and losing hope, then fierce and brave, as she fights for what she believes in! I also enjoyed Ray Winstone's, Angela Bassett's, and Robin Wright's performances as well, and I was also introduced to an Iranian and American actress for the first time, named Shohreh Aghdashloo, whom has a chilling, excellent voice role (won't go into those details, so as not to spoil anything)!Scenery and costumes were so lush, lavish, and stylish! So was the directing and cinematography; those elements of the movie mixed together beautifully with the scenery! I love how Elodie improvised with bits and scraps of her own dress to use to her advantage in the quest.Pacing was perfect, taking its time to gradually tell the story, while preparing for the thrilling climax.Overall, I enjoyed Damsel. Not exactly what I was thinking it would be, but a nicely crafted, moving adventure nonetheless, with thrills and chills to spare. I'd say you'll be entertained for sure.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I kept waiting for the Dragon to yell Holden! Anyway, this was a well made movie with a fantastic crew at the helm. The production values were excellent and it looked great in Dolby Vision and sounded great in Atmos. The effects also looked great. The story was a lot darker than I thought it would be. A warning for younger kids. But I didn't mind the darker tone. At the end of the day it's a Damsel against a dragon fantasy film.

Which by itself isn't a bad premise. Imagine if this were a comedy during which the new princess is confronted by her husband's crazy family; so crazy that in the end she decides to return to her poverty in the proverbial pumpkin.Alas, this isn't intended to be funny. Instead, we've got a dragon that speaks human language and, equally important, understands it as well. We've got an underground cavern which as though by miracle turns into a sky-high precipice. An evil queen. A weak-kneed prince. A guy in a bad toupee and a crown who I assume is the king but does not have a single word of dialogue. We've got important plot points that are, for no good reason, withheld from the viewer.On the plus side: The dragon flies real nice.Milly Bobby Brown is our heroine 'princess' and I guess she's OK in the role, though I doubt this film is going to do her any good. I have a hunch that there hasn't been a lot of film offers coming her way and so when this one did, she took it. Which does not explain Robin Wright accepting the role as evil queen, or Ray Winstone as the princess' scheming father. These are established talents. They have reputations. Both of which are now sullied. Finally, Angela Bassett as a good-hearted step-mother (as opposed to the tried-and-true evil step-mother); she's fine. I guess.Confession: I watched the entire silly thing.Confession #2: And I'm absolutely ashamed of myself.","33 out of 66 found this helpful.

Damsel is, in my view, comfortably above average, but its real benefit is in the lead actor/character.Millie Bobby Brown in Damsel is a very capable actor, but I think she is a bit let down by the directing and the script. Strong female leads in these films (who aren't horrendously over sexualised) are lacking, and she does a damn fine job of addressing some of that gap. Her role was definitely the best thing about the whole film in my view. The soundtrack is a close second.There are quite a lot of downsides, though. The plot is fairly flimsy and its changes in pace can be odd. I don't think production really knew who they wanted their audience to be. It's a bit too mature in themes for some younger viewers, but also lacking in depth for older viewers.If the intention was for a non-challenging, female-led fantasy action with the propensity for a wide-ish market then those boxes have been ticked. It's ideal for passing a bit of a rainy afternoon or evening. But I don't recommend going out of your way to watch it, and I think few will find it memorable.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

This latest fantasy-adventure offering yet again sees the 20 year old actor take centre stage.Millie Bobbie Brown (engaged to Jake Bongiovi, son of rock legend Jon Bon Jovi) plays Elodie, a princess married off to save a kingdom but at the potential cost of her own life. She is the damsel, but it is we the audience that is very much in distress, this was a terrible movie.Let's break it downStory and PlotThis laughably predictable fantasy-adventure written by Dan Manzeau who brought us such classics as Fast X (2023) and Clash of the Titans (2012) is stuffed with ""Yawn - we've seen it before"" plot points that leads to the inevitable conclusion. The biggest complaint is it just didn't feel real at any stage. Talk about low stakes, this had no stakes, There is a complete lack of tension which put this movie firmly into Sand Timer territory (See 4 Types of Movies at top of homepage). Despite all of Elodie's hardships and obstacles which includes being chased around a series of caverns in scenes pretty much ripped from The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug (2013), you just know she is never really in danger, and that everything will be just fine in the end.CastMillie Bobbie Brown is a very good actress as is Robin Wright and Angela Bassett is an acting legend but the clunky stilted dialogue stunts the casts performances. The great Ray Winstone is staggeringly miscast and as a result along with the rest of his peers phones in his performance. What's more I just couldn't get over the fact it looked like actors just playing dress-up, it felt I was just watching a very bad pantomime.CGI and Look of the MovieWhat added to the story not feeling real, was the way the movie looked. Set sometime in the 17th-18th Century the look is way too clean, the locales and vista's are clearly CGI, the movie was most likely shot directly on a lot with backgrounds added in post. The reported production budget was $60-70 million so once you take away the salaries of the star heavy cast, that may have left precious little for anything else.ActionYou've seen it all before, heroine in danger, heroine escapes, she get's into more danger, and oh my god she escapes again...rinse wash repeat.Music and ScoreMusic was by David Fleming. It's a nice enough score but pretty run of the mill. Surprised to learn it was produced by Hans Zimmer.A paint-by-numbers misfire for both Netflix and Millie Bobby Brown. This desultory fantasy-adventure is more fatal than femme fatale.","30 out of 62 found this helpful.

This was an extremely entertaining movie. The buildup in the beginning was cinematically beautiful enough to be immersive, and while I did not stop trying to guess exactly what was going on I did forget I was watching a movie. All characters actions and scripts were on point with what would be expected in the given situation. They also did a great job of constantly switching between a sense of wonder and horror. Its a shame that more people could not get past whatever tropes they thought were cliche' especially since there are not that many movies with smart and capable women such as this.

Thought at the most it might be at least entertaining.. Or considering what I've heard from Millie Bobby Brown, it could have been an angsty coming of age story. Something positive to honour feminists or those with more liberal sensibilities. Sadly not.The storytelling was some what lacking, from the start it felt like a take on the Grimms fairytales.. However it proved to be more confused, fumbling and failing to hit the mark it was obviously trying too hard to achieve..The characterisation and acting also fell short in this way, proving inconsistent. At first I thought it could be the writing but I was proven wrong but Browns performance. She gave what I believe to be her poorest role. And ended in a somewhat peculiar way. Feeling more like her telling the world 'I am now a women.' Leaving behind the childish image we have of her from Stranger Things.Despite the odd musing, I stand by my comments and say don't waste your time.","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

This is the way.In DAMSEL that I see reflected that essence of empowered woman with a judgment, logic and cunning. It is no coincidence that it will be released on Netflix on March 8, International Women's Day.The protagonist is not the typical heroine. She proves to have cunning, intelligence, a lot of intelligence and of course courage and heart. Millie Bobby Brown is perfect for the role of damsel in distress, used to perform action scenes, she plays it perfectly, although it is true that the role of fairytale princess before the cave does not suit her so much. Her characters always stand out above the rest, such as Eleven/Enola Holmes. Although in general it may seem a simple role, the interpretation she makes in several moments in the cave are very impressive, full of feelings and emotions that keep you fully involved in the plot.The rest of the characters contribute nothing or very little to the film. The movie is predictable, we could say that the movie starts from the moment the princess is thrown into the cave. And since it starts this is a joy or enjoyment for anyone who likes fantasy, adventure, dragons, heroism or epicness.CAVE-DAMSEL-DRAGON key to the film. I love the images, shots and scenes in the cave. The Dragoness has an incredible level of detail, her design is beastly, the textures and finishes look great, shape, color, plus she has an identity, voice and thought of her own.The development of the narrative around the protagonist seems interesting to me, the contributions of different discoveries in the cave shape the film and the construction of the story.Correct direction, good work, correct editing, good sound, soundtrack a little fair, it does not stand out too much. Good photography in the cave scenes. The VFX and special effects are well done. Scenery and setting in the cave is very good.FINAL NOTE 7 The film stays in the dragon, the cave and the damsel. The rest does not matter and almost detracts from the value of the film. As for the story it is simple, predictable, but enjoyable. It could have been so much more, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The filmmakers have assembled all the constituent parts of an interesting fantasy adventure film - genre-bending premise, a starry cast, locations with character, and some creative creature design - but the connective tissue is paper-thin. A weak script and boring performances make the Netflix fantasy film Damsel a real slog, torpedoing its attempt to be a subversive spin on classic adventure tales. Any sense of wonder or magic is diluted by cheap-looking CGI and its overly repetitive action sequences. Rather than being any particular person's bright idea for a girlboss fantasy revenge caper, this lousy romp was obviously hatched by an algorithm, and might just as well have been directed by AI.My Rating : 3/10.","26 out of 54 found this helpful.

A lot. You can tell from very early on that Elodie, played by Millie Bobbie Brown, is not a damsel who will need rescuing. She's smart, tough, clever, charming, and very much her own person.While it does employ many of the tropes expected in this genre -- a dragon, people of questionable intent, myths & legends -- it does so with a much fresher take and direction. Brown is terrific in the role, and Robin Wright, as the queen of a neighboring kingdom, does a great turn as a (semi-spoiler here) really despicable character. Angela Basset is under-utilized, though, and really wasn't given as much for her talents to work with as I would have liked. Hers could have been a much more important character that was allowed to be here.There are some solid ""Heck YEAH!"" moments that are quite satisfying, especially as we see Elodie find ways out of her predicament.Definitely a fun flick.","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

This is a rather enjoyable flick that knows it's demographic. It's a young heroin stuck in a ""Damsel in distress"" situation that she's gotta save herself from. It was indeed rather predictable, and I did feel the first act kinda dragged on considering the previews really didn't try to hide it's big twist, they could've cut some of that and tacked more on the ending IMO. But Millie B, Bassett, Wright and... All the cast really. Nailed the material they were given. (Shohreh Aghdashloo especially was an absolutely genius choice for the voice).The CG work was fairly solid, but did have some slight dips if you're really looking for them, if that's going to be your dealbreaker that's a you problem. They were never so blatant that I couldn't get past them for the seconds they were there.This isn't an Oscar contender and at no point did I get the feeling it was trying to be. But if you've got a couple hours to kill and you and your kids (I would say 12+. That dragon was pretty spooky at times) like fantasy media. Give it a shot. If you're some lonely dude that's hoping they put Millie in a plate mail styled sports bra and spends the whole movie being sexy, you're not the demographic it's trying to please.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

She is miscast here plain and simple. Her English accent is Irritation, Spotty and of such a sound that its what an English accent sounds like from an American actor emulating a description of upper class English. Its TERRIBLE.

She oozes arrogance whilst supposedly the good, kind daughter of an empoverished father/King. Due to this her whole role feels phoned in.

MBB and Robin Wright are both actors I've enjoyed in the past so figured this would be a fun watch.The good:
-The costume design was stunning and I loved all the attention to detail. There are a few visually striking scenes that are fun to look at.-Robin Wright is a glamorous yet ruthless evil queen. Also Robin Wright can do no wrong so maybe I'm biased here.-The dragon VFX were pretty good in my opinion. At first I was taken back by the voice but it grew on me throughout the movie.-The premise is intrinsically interesting, and the setup was reasonably solidThe bad:
-Like I said, it's an interesting plot and started pretty strong and they could have done something really cool with it. Instead, it was annoyingly predictable and you can get the entire story from the trailer. Whatever you assume will happen...is what happens.-After MBB gets thrown into the chasm, there is a ridiculous amount of grunting and yelling. Like, she is trying to evade a dragon but literally every movement is followed by a tennis grunt lol. It was pretty distracting. I guess she did the best she could with what she was given, but there really should have been another factor added into this to prevent a good 30-45 minutes made up entirely of MBB grunting/talking to herself to steer the plot or the dragon speaking.Overall, it was still okay to watch.

It ends with a classic badass ending or at least they tried to. Millie Bobby Brown really delivered but the writers sold the movie with the cringe dialogue and scenes in the conclusion. The movie was good but the ending sold it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

My opinion didnt get much better after watching it, but lets say that it'is not that wast of time at all.You'll see something that reminds an a old argument but with something ""original"", quite predictable and with some holes in the story.

The actors were great and the story was good for how short it was. However, I do understand why the reviews are so split. You can immediately feel the political side of the movie while watching it. Girl power and diversity where for example every princess is from a different ""race"". I am usually all for it, but it should never feel forced, as a lot of movies have felt lately. But I decided to look past that for this movie since I did get more involved in the story than the forced elements within it. And by doing so, I really felt like the overall story, acting and CGI were above average and that's why I will give it a 7. A bit politically forced, but still a well crafted movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Stop Making Movies Like This.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9668728/?ref_=tt_urv","mrlegiitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156941110/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2024","I recently subjected myself to the cinematic catastrophe known as Damsel (2024), and let me tell you, it was an experience akin to watching paint dry on a medieval castle wall. If you're considering watching this film, I implore you to reconsider. In fact, I beg you: please stop making movies like this.The premise seemed promising-a damsel in distress, a dragon, and a royal wedding. But alas, the execution was more disastrous than a jousting match between blindfolded knights. Let's break it down:Weak Script: The dialogue felt like it was penned by a sleep-deprived squirrel with a typewriter. Characters spouted clichés and platitudes as if they were reading from a medieval fortune cookie. I half-expected someone to say, ""May your quest be as fruitless as a banana tree in Antarctica.""Boring Performances: Millie Bobby Brown, bless her heart, tried her best. But her portrayal of Elodie-the damsel who transforms into a makeshift MacGyver-was about as captivating as watching grass grow. Nick Robinson as Prince Henry was equally uninspiring. I've seen more chemistry between a rock and a moss-covered log.CGI Disaster: The dragon, supposedly menacing, looked like it escaped from a PlayStation 1 game.Repetitive Action Sequences: Elodie's escape attempts from the cavern were like Groundhog Day with a medieval twist. She'd dodge the dragon, sharpen her corset busk (yes, you read that right), and repeat. It was like watching a medieval version of ""Wipeout,"" minus the water and the humor.Missed Opportunities: The film had potential to subvert fairy tale tropes. Instead, it clung to them like a barnacle on a shipwreck. The dress transformation scene hinted at something deeper, but alas, it remained as shallow as a puddle after a light drizzle.Damsel left me yearning for the sweet release of a dragon's fiery breath. If you're ever tempted to create a movie like this, I implore you: please, for the love of cinema, reconsider.","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

We have the requisite caves; an ancient symbol of rebirth, magical beings which can heal (slugs), a fiery dragon, the symbol of a chthonic goddess embodying the Earth mother herself. However, the dialog is weak, the plot transparent, and the acting horrendous. So no, no deep delve into our ancient psyche, just a sorry excuse for filmmaking and a complete waste of time and resources.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

But instead I was rather pleased that we had an actual character with a hero's journey arc.So I do my best not to spoil so I will just give my rough synopsis.The plot was simple and reminded me of a sort I would have been seen in 70's and 80's. I felt the story did a more digestible young woman with a strong and witty personality and not a superiority complex. I'm better than everyone else. This was good because she was more relatable to a larger group of watchers.The pace of the film was just right for the story that was told.I rather liked the dragon, a quite menacing air and the CGI was good and flowed well with most of the scenes. A couple of obvious green screen moments. But considering it was a made for Netflix movie. It doesn't even really hinder the story.A couple of good actors and actresses helped give weight to the overall film. Good casting.I will say, if this movie was made in the 80's I would have had it along with my other classics like Conan, Dragonslayer and Beastmaster. I know some of you might not agree on those being good. That's fine. But still enjoy them.As this is not a remake or if it is I'm unfamiliar with the original. I was able to over look the funny new super diversity quota. It doesn't harm the story and it's a fantasy so you could have one of everyone. I usually only forehead slap when it's historical stories or if it just doesn't fit.That said, if you like dragons and a simple but decent fantasy plot.Sit back and enjoy.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It wasn't made for it to be predicted, Damsel has a strong female protagonist who uses her survival instincts to keep herself safe and grounded in a life threatening situation, and I really admire that they wrote her so well. Elodie is a character to look up to, she has grace, charm and wit and I think the team on this film captured that well. It was not a film based solely about revenge which I thoroughly enjoyed, and it was nice to watch something that carried out a positive message with a positive ending that showed that people can change, and revenge is a dish best not served at all, and lies and deceit gets you nowhere.Idk, I thought it was great, made me cry and the ending was happy 😊","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's just so strangely off and weird, like she's trying to do an English person's idea of an American Doing a Royal Family Accent. It's distracting. Not quite from the Dick Van Dyke School Of Accents, but it's not good.Luckily she's not in that much of the movie, the first 30 minutes or so.And that's when the film starts btw. You could fast forward the first 30 minutes, watch it on 4x speed and get a perfect idea of what's going on.The rest of the film gets progressively more predictable and clichéd from there.If I had to sum up this whole movie in a couple lines, I'd go with:
""That's a tough situation, gonna be hard for her to get out of that one""
""Actually super easy, barely an inconvenience""
""Oh really?""But I don't wish to spoiler anything.The cgi is meh.The green screening is, meh

No such thing can be found in a fairytale where the good always wins over the bad since Disney started changing Brothers Grimm tales.

And while she is called a Damsel (in the title), she can handle herself quite well. Mostly dialog wise (and she is quick to say something back to you), but she also has the will to survive ... which I reckon is quite important.The numbers game (how many before her that is) is one thing - I am not sure it checks out, but then again, I really didn't care that much about it. The movie was quite obvious, even without having read anything about it before. So quite predictable - but it does look good. Also has too good actors in it.That said, the effects are good and the voice over from one actress in particular is quite special ... if you've seen movies with her, you will recognize the voice!

Basically there is not much positive about this film ...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had fun watching it and I was very invested in the story. Great acting, storyline was exciting and scary at times. I will say that it was very predictable. I had not seen the trailer, but I could guess all the time what was going to happen.The costumes were amazing! And the action scenes too.The big problem I have with this movie is the makeup!!!! Why make an epic fantasy movie and make the main character look like a Kardashian did her makeup???? I could not get carried away by the story in parts of the movie. I just kept looking at the red lipgloss, countoring and eyeliner... while she's in the fight of her life, but she obviosly had time to freshen up her makeup.Look at Snow White and the Huntsman. At least she looked natural and like she was actually in the forest, fighting and in danger. You can make an actress look pretty without making her look like an influencer.Anyway, the ending was ok. All in all it was an entertaining movie and I enjoyed it, except for what I mentioned above.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

This is the fiest twist in the story that shows an innocent girl becomes the victim of a mean dragon who wants to take revenge against humans. This was the regional king invading her home in the mountains. This dragon seemed quite mean and terrible at the time and continued to chase the young lady throughout the movie, but in the end, this dragon was not as terrible as I could have thought in the beginning. There are some more twists I will not identify here.The adventure part with Elodie was quite interesting and reminded me to die hard. She is very good in rather risky cases. She learned by her life to struggle for the lives of her people in a place where food was missing, and this marriage was a good reason for her father to earn some money for 'selling' by some means, his daughter.PS: What I can doubt in the movie. How can this dragon live so long? How can she talk with humans? Centuries later? Next to it, can it be the same for the family of the groom as long as the dragon lives? There is a map somewhere inside that means someone from the 'jailed' girls has attained to get out of the mountain, and thus she returned back to design the map. And finally, there was no smarter girl before her to solve this puzzle with the dragon. There are possibly many other questions to be answered, but these are my early thoughts at the time of writing this article.As a result, I can rate this movie 6-7/10. Its quite entertaining and possibly a bit silly not replying to these quite reasonable questions.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I felt like not much actually happened or everything happened all at once. It would have been nicer if the pacing was slower or there was more character development. Pretty obvious ending too. I feel like they wanted two things in this film, dragons and Millie. They ran with it and unfortunately it was a poor execution. Although it may have a different story, this idea has been used a thousand times.

The plot unfolds in a disappointingly predictable manner, with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. In fact, the word ""generic"" doesn't even begin to describe the lack of originality in the narrative.Throughout the film, the audience is taken on a journey that feels like a rehash of countless other fantasy adventures. The characters, plot points, and resolutions all feel like recycled elements from mid-level storytelling, leaving little room for surprises or genuine emotional investment.While the film may hold some appeal for a younger audience who may not have been exposed to a wide range of films over the years, it fails to offer anything new or compelling for more seasoned viewers. For those accustomed to the rich tapestry of storytelling found in cinema, ""Damsel"" may come across as little more than background noise - a forgettable addition to the fantasy genre that lacks the spark of creativity needed to truly captivate its audience.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a film that struggles to break free from the constraints of its own predictability. While it may find a place among those seeking a simple and straightforward fantasy tale, it ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression or offer anything of substance to those looking for a more engaging cinematic experience.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

What spoils it the most is simply Milly Bobby Brown.I don't know why casting directors get it so wrong sometimes, but a film can be made or broken by their decisions. The decision to use brown who is simply not skilled enough to take on the lead role bemuses me and saddens me also, as this could have been a much better film.In the first half she's passable, but the second half all she does is screech and yell, and her screeches and yells are so unbelievable they just raise ire.Her delivery is so poor she could have been reading ingredients from a sauce bottle. Elle Fanning would have been the natural choice for this: impeccable acting abilities and better looking too.If you are a massive Milly Bobby Brown fan you may enjoy this more than I did.

-The actual story structure itself is logical. Shocking in this day and age. There's a setup, motivations for each character, a twist that actually makes sense and a (predictable) resolution. It's not Madame Web or Thor Ragnarok level stupid.-The director actually makes use of the environment. Gusts of wind, bioluminiscenct life forms, some scenes have a good texture to them. And the environment is also used in a clever way in a pivotal action scene. Good job!-Some of the side characters are more fleshed out than they need to be. The prince for example is given little character moments that set him apart of his ruthless mother. I liked that.-One theme from the soundtrack was decent-Color grading was good. That's a rarity these days as well.-The twist with the Dragon's motivation works.Now the bad:-As usual with these films, the actors are on tiny greenscreen soundstages, with a few real props and the rest of the background being CGI. The costumes and environment feels small, generic and cheap. A royal wedding takes place with a crowd of maybe 12 people. It looks ridiculous.-Forced diversity. Naturally, a story taking place in what looks to be medieval England or Sweden features countless African Americans... who did not even exist at that time in history.Sure, they turned it into a fantasy setting. It's still as stupid as that google AI generating black Nazi SS officers for diversity's sake. Just stop it, you're embarassing yourselves. If you want a diverse cast, set your movie in today's day and age. Or in regions where there was racial diversity at the time, i.e. Medieval Spain or ancient Egypt. Or if you're going to make it a fantasy setting, then make it feel like a fantasy setting and don't just use English and German architecture, clothing and aesthetics.-The pacing. As so often, this movie is *slow*. But not throughout, which is different from usual. The beginning and end are quite brisk. The slow part is the middle part, where the heroine has to fight for her survival. Unfortunately, it's the central part of the movie, but it's also the least interesting, because the plot grinds to a halt. Yes, we eventually learn of the twist, but for the next 25 minutes that doesn't change the dynamic of how she interacts with the dragon. The chase just continues. Which brings us to-the writing. Dialogues are terrible almost throughout. The entire opening scene is a clunkily delivered exposition dump. She watches her own father and 3 men get killed by the dragon, when she could have simply stopped it by revealing the truth. A truth she and we as the audience had already been sitting on for a while. When you give the audience information, you want it to advance the plot. This doesn't happen. After the killings, we get yet another chase and confrontation scene between her and the dragon. It takes forever.And that's the central problem with this story: The middle part is garbage. The setup is great, the ending is servicable, but there is no middle. To make matters worse, all other characters disappear from the plot. It's essentially a one woman survival show. Except this isn't ""The Revenant"", and Millie Bobbie Brown isn't Leonardo DiCaprio-The lead actress. She's not terrible, but she's not good either. She lacks the physicality for the role, having absolutely no muscle tone and lacking the agility to convincingly pull off the role. The opening scene shows her chopping wood, to show her as a tough girl. But those noodle arms never chopped wood in their life.Her acting is hit and miss. Bad during the opening, good in the romantic scenes with the prince, really good in scenes of sadness, terrible in scenes of acting though, good in scenes where she is injured, terrible at the very end (though the script does her no favors).Much of the movie's acting is hit and miss. Angela Bassett does the best she can with her role. Robin Wright shines as usual. Ray Winstone phones it in, seemingly between drinks, and the guy playing the prince does a fine job.-The dragon is overpowered. A common problem in these types of films. In an attempt to have impressive CGI shots for the trailer and make it scary, they make the movie monster unstoppable - until the script needs it to be vulnerable. This would have worked better with the dragon not being an unstoppable killing machine.If one were to condense the middle part down from about 50 minutes to 15, it could be watchable. Certainly better than the usual Netflix dreck.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

Just some determination and a bit of luck - and the story does contain enough elements to show that others have faced the dangers before and perhaps been not quite as fit or quite as lucky.There's some less believable grandstanding, but that's hardly unusual in the genre.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The result is an enjoyable action-fantasy romp as she battles for survival.You can't tell a story like this without invoking Alien, and this film does so on several occasions. Millie Bobbie Brown is a convincingly bad-ass action heroine who deserves an even bigger vehicle than this one. And whilst the homages to Alien are clear, it has other connective tissue to the superior Ready Or Not, a film which is elevated above Damsel by managing to find more than a dash of wit when this is just a bit too po-faced to really sing.The dragon is beautifully realised (and voiced - when the dragon started to speak I wasn't sure it was going to well, but it's carried off well). The film sits squarely in the young adult space, and light enough on gore to be appropriate for the intended audience; there is a world where we see more of the gore, and the film becomes more of a horror story. But what we have is what we have; we already knew from Stranger Things and the Enola Holmes films that Millie Bobbie Brown has the capacity to carry to a big franchise. Damsel is another feather to that bow; I'm intrigued to see where her career carries her.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now, that's fine if you have a tight script, strong character backstory, and believable/internally consistent storyline but this film doesn't. They should have taken a lesson from Robin Wright and added a couple doses of Princess Bride. Regardless, there is action and the story moves.

The film didn't try to be anything it wasn't.The cinematography was outstanding, surpassing Netflix's already superb standards of filmmaking. The CGI in this film has set a new standard for a good looking film, which isn't surprising for its budget, but it still made for a satisfying experience. In this day it is certainly off-putting to see bad CGI in a new film, because the whole point of CGI is to look real.My only major problem was the writing - it came across as bland and basic at the best of times, and at its worst it was quite cringeworthy when it broke the rule of 'show don't tell'. The worst part was that it DID show, but then it proceeded to have the character say out loud what has just been shown. Or even worse, the character is explains her character development to the audience in a way that is laughable; for example, ""im through with being told what to do.""However, the actors absolutely made the best of a bad script. Millie Bobby Brown was great in her role as 'Elodie' (marking her 3rd time she's played a character who's name starts with 'E') by giving her charisma and a sense of quiet confidence. I do like how this character is actually very clever, and not just a ""kick-ass woman"", although she is certainly that too. Millie Bobby Brown has a history of being good at playing those kinds of characters.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There's also a great cast, led by Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully frigid Robin Wright, who are completely wasted by an underdeveloped, very predictable script with no surprises and some poor lighting choices that opt for artificial phosphorescence where darkness and shadows would have been better.

Millie Bobby Brown, though undeniably blossoming into a beautiful young woman, delivers a performance that's lacking the nuanced depth the role demanded.Thankfully, the film doesn't completely descend into the realm of unintentional laughter. The visual effects, particularly in the fantastical dragon's lair, are a saving grace. They provide a splash of wonder, a reminder that this isn't your typical princess story.So, is ""Damsel"" a shining example of cinematic brilliance? Not quite. However, for those seeking a light-hearted fantasy adventure with a dash of the bizarre, it might just be the dragon's hoard you've been looking for. Just don't expect a performance fit for a standing ovation.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Audiences could clearly feel her joy, her optimism, her pain, and her anger. Her interactions and banter with the other characters were clearly indicative of the different relationships she had with each of them.It was never a mystery that the story was going to take a dark turn, yet the transition was thrilling and eerie. Watching the main character undergo a series of painful trials was as brutal as it was exciting.Even though the story was easy to follow doesn't mean it wasn't without its twists and moments where it raised the stakes. Watching a main character develop and grow into a fearless warrior was inspiring and badass. A truly empowering character. This film captured all that and more through its excellent storytelling, characters, costumes and adventure.","23 out of 42 found this helpful.

Nothing against her personally, she's just so far up Netflix's butt the way Lin Manuel Miranda is so far up Disney's. The screenplay originally has a young woman of Asian descent described and there's already such minimal opportunities to POC let alone the Asian community that they really should have gone with someone of that community. Perhaps a fresh face rather than one that's been played time and time again. I fear they may wash Millie out, and she's still so young. Mediocre acting from everybody involved. Could've been the direction, could've been the dialogue. The scenery was beautiful and the stunts were great, but lately that seems to be all we've gotten from Netflix. I was honestly looking forward to this and it just ended up being pretty one dimensional and underwhelming.

Despite its visual prowess, the storyline relied heavily on clichés, such as the symbolic cutting of long hair to signify a transition from weakness to strength. This trope felt contrived and lacked practical significance within the narrative. It begged the question: must all women sacrifice their hair to assert their strength?Moreover, the protagonist's journey towards empowerment felt shallow and unconvincing. Despite lacking any prior training or battle experience, she miraculously transforms into a skilled dragon slayer through a mere display of wit. It undermines the authenticity of her character development and the film's intended message of empowerment.Furthermore, the narrative's reliance on pitting women against each other perpetuates harmful stereotypes rather than challenging them. By framing women who do not conform to the protagonist's archetype as incompetent, weak, or even malicious, the film reinforces gender norms rather than empowering women. True empowerment recognizes everyone's unique strengths.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and penned by Dan Mazeau, this film is a mesmerizing journey into a world where ancient debts, dark secrets, and mythical dragons intertwine with the fate of a young woman named Elodie, portrayed with unparalleled depth by Millie Bobby Brown.At first glance, ""Damsel"" might seem to tread the familiar path of fantasy and adventure, promising a tale of noble quests and daring rescues. Yet, it quickly distances itself from the traditional narratives, plunging the viewer into a story that is as dark as it is enthralling. Elodie's journey, from accepting a seemingly innocent marriage proposal to realizing she's a pawn in a sinister game to repay a royal family's ancient debts, unfolds with relentless pace and intensity.Millie Bobby Brown delivers a performance that is nothing short of captivating, embodying Elodie with a grace and tenacity that is both inspiring and deeply relatable. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone as the troubled father and Robin Wright as the malevolent queen, bring layers of complexity and intrigue to the tale, with Wright's portrayal deserving special mention for its sheer villainous brilliance.What sets ""Damsel"" apart is its unapologetic departure from the typical fairytale narrative, despite its own self-aware tagline, 'This is not a fairytale.' The inclusion of a dragon, both convincing in its portrayal and unreal in its existence, serves as a powerful metaphor for the challenges and beasts one must face in the quest for freedom and identity. This element, while fantastical, grounds the story in a timeless struggle, blending the lines between reality and fantasy.The film's direction, script, and cinematography are executed with precision and artistry, creating a visual and narrative feast that engages and entertains. The pacing is particularly commendable, ensuring that the viewer is ensnared in Elodie's world from the first moment to the last, with no respite from the unfolding drama and suspense.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a fantasy-adventure that defies expectations, offering a richly woven tapestry of courage, betrayal, and redemption. It is a story that resonates on a deeply personal level, reminding us that within every tale of darkness and danger, there lies the potential for heroism and hope. For those seeking an escape into a world that is both fantastical and fiercely real, ""Damsel"" is a must-watch, providing the perfect backdrop for a lazy afternoon-or any time when the call for adventure beckons.","19 out of 34 found this helpful.

Milli Bobby Brown is sadly only good in scene where she has to scream, fall, or fly throught the room, like in stranger things. The dialogs are so poor, that kenny from southpark seems rich next to them and you cant even understand what he says. Your time is better spent smocking crack, what would make watching the movie probably enjoyable. The scenes and cgi effects are lame. Look like a scene from skyrim, a game that is good, but old by now. This movie gots to be the most souless thing ive ever seen. I just hope there will be no second part.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

I am giving it 1 star for it being disappointing that it didn't stand up to what they promised. It has nice visuals and everything but story wise it's just blah and I think they could have cased someone else other than Milly Bobby Brown. Her acting felt more like drama than it feeling like a real character. Overall feels like something which was pictured in a small time. Feel they could have done way better by making small things better and keeping the story engaging. It just felt like the story kept beating around the same bush.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Developed her acting skills in any way since her teenage appearances. What can't Milli Bobby Brown do? Carrying a (sustainable) film. But she's a cinematic pop star, at least for now, and we're only talking about 15 days of streaming fame, not an entry in the history books. And what or who is supposed to portray her stepmother here? Well, it's a fairy tale, and then there's Netflix. Accordingly, the film came more or less out of nowhere, with CGI instead of real substance. The direction doesn't quite reveal itself, I had the feeling of a Sunday afternoon TV fairytale the whole time. After the first third, however, it becomes less child-orientated. So it's most likely a fairy tale for adults, especially women, see the constant strong-girl tones. I don't believe in a successful direction, but no matter, the main thing is that the agenda is right. Not to review only negatively, there are positive things too, most notably the dragon. This seems to be where the main animation budget was invested, and with really good results. The story itself isn't bad either, as far as I know it's an adaptation of a novel. What Damsel means, however, is withheld (at least from German viewers).","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

From the laughably contrived plot to the embarrassingly one-dimensional characters, this film is a prime example of lazy storytelling and uninspired filmmaking.Let's start with the protagonist, Elodie, whose name seems ripped straight from the pages of a hipster baby naming book. Because, you know, it's just not edgy enough to go with a regular name like Melanie or Emily - no, we have to strip away the first letter and pretend it's somehow avant-garde. Newsflash: it's not. It's just stupid.But Elodie's absurd moniker is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the film's many flaws. The so-called 'plot' is a nonsensical mishmash of tired tropes and clichés, with more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. We're supposed to believe that Elodie, a supposedly 'strong' female character, is duped into marrying a prince who promptly tries to sacrifice her to a dragon. Because nothing says empowerment like being treated as dragon bait, right?And don't even get me started on the supporting characters. From Elodie's simpering stepmother to the bumbling nobles of Aurea, it's like the filmmakers raided the discount bin of stock character archetypes. There's not a shred of originality or depth to be found anywhere in this sorry excuse for a cast.But perhaps the most insulting aspect of Damsel (2024) is its clumsy attempt at feminist messaging. Rather than offering genuine insight into the complexities of female agency and empowerment, the film relies on tired stereotypes and ham-fisted plot twists to convey its half-baked message. It's about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, and just as painful to endure.In the end, Damsel (2024) is nothing more than a misguided attempt at relevance, with all the subtlety of a toddler throwing a tantrum. Save yourself the agony and skip this dumpster fire of a film - your brain cells will thank you.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

In return, he would receive a fortune in gold, capable to help his people from his depleted land. Elodie agrees to help her father and accept the marriage. Lord Bayford, his wife Lady Bayford (Angela Bassett), Elodie and her younger sister Floria (Brooke Carter) travel to Aurea, and they meet King Roderick (Milo Twomey), Queen Isabelle and Prince Henry. Lady Bayford learns that Queen Isabelle is an arrogant and wicked woman and unsuccessfully tries to convince Elodie to call off the wedding. After the ceremony, Elodie and Henry head to a cave for an ancient costume of his family, and Elodie finds that she will be sacrificed to a dragon to keep the prosperity of the kingdom. Elodie begins a cat and mouse game with the dragon inside the cave, searching for an exit while learning about the tradition of the royal family.""Damsel"" is a movie that follows the standard manual of how to make a movie by Netflix. The queen of a Caucasian family in a fairytale is black. The powerful villain is another queen from a different kingdom, and her husband, the king, does not open his mouth the entire movie. The powerful destructive creature is a she-dragon that warriors and kings fail to destroy. But the damsel succeeds, without shield or weapons. The lead character is funny, making noises and screaming while hunted down by the she-dragon in its cave. Another funny scene is the escape route that Elodie discovers. Why would the escapee return to draw the map? The film is also too long, predictable, and boring in many moments. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Donzela"" (""Damsel"")","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Plot has reasonable depth for a fantasy film and made complete sense. There were a few points where I thought there were going to be plot holes but they filled these in reasonably. Good pace, although could have even been expanded and been longer. MBB kicks ass and could be a good Red Sonia replacement. The Dragon CGI in the open air let it down a little bit otherwise I liked the creature design. The use of Shohreh Aghdashloo as the voice of the dragon is an excellent choice. Ray Winston is reasonably used and puts in his normal gruff appearance, although there could have been more use of Robin Wight and Angela Bassett.

Similar movie like The Princess with action pack fight scenes, martial arts, etc.. was shear awesome. Yet this film has very limited action scenes.Most of the film is about the main character trying to escape the cave. So is this a survival film? Not really. I guess the best way to describe it is that it is a fairytale, a fable, even. But if that is the aim, then again the plot must be the strength.So overall, I don't seem to know what is the point of the film and why it was made.

Unfortunately, the experience that unfolded was nothing short of a letdown, embodying the epitome of weakness in filmmaking and acting.From the onset, 'Damsel' struggled to establish a compelling narrative. The plot, riddled with clichés and predictable turns, failed to captivate or maintain my interest. It felt as if the script was an afterthought, lacking depth and originality, which made the viewing experience excruciatingly dull.The characters, who could have been the saving grace, were instead flat, unrelatable, and cringy.Princess Elodie's character development throughout the film was minimal, rendering the journey and struggle uninspiring. The interactions felt forced, and the dialogue, which aimed for wit and charm, often landed with a thud, further detracting from the overall enjoyment of the film.Is emotionally fake a thing?Visually, 'Damsel' did little to impress. While Netflix productions are typically known for their high-quality visuals and effects, this film felt lackluster. The cinematography was unimaginative, and the special effects, where present, did not meet the standards one would expect from a platform that has previously set the bar high.The soundtrack and score, often an area where films can redeem themselves, added to the sense of mediocrity. Instead of enhancing the emotional weight of scenes or elevating the narrative, the music felt disconnected and at times, intrusive.In reflection, the frustration of having invested time into watching 'Damsel' is palpable. The notion that time is a precious commodity we cannot reclaim feels particularly relevant here. My disappointment with this film is compounded by the fact that it represents a significant misstep for Netflix, a platform I had come to trust for quality entertainment.Please don't let a film like this get released without reviewing it thoroughly first.The only right thing about this movie was Robyn Wright.To reiterate , 'Damsel' was a profound disappointment. It serves as a cautionary tale of the pitfalls of lackluster storytelling, uninspired character development, and mediocre production values.For those considering watching it, I recommend setting your expectations low or better yet, choosing to invest your time elsewhere.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Sounds good, doesn't it? Sadly, the film never quite gets off the ground. With no unexpected turns, the narrative reads like a recycled version of well-known fairytales. All of the characters are quite uninteresting, even the evil Queen. The entire thing feels a little phony due to the excessive use of green screens, which overshadows some very amazing CGI moments in the otherwise mediocre special effects. Even gifted performers such as Brown are cast in shallow roles.Certainly ""Damsel"" could amuse you for the evening if all you're seeking for is something simple to watch with some action. Given that there isn't any really graphic violence and the plot is rather simple, it might also be appropriate for a family movie night with teenagers. If, however, you're in the mood for a complex, thought-provoking fantasy movie, you should probably search somewhere else.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The casting directors should've been smart to cast the actress who plays the younger sister as the main character rather than Miss Brown.

It keeps the viewer immersed in a well-done, solidly developed story. Set in the medieval era, the story unfolds naturally and focuses on details. It provides wonderful landscapes, well-designed costumes, and special locations that transport the audience to another time
One of the highlights of the movie is the meticulous attention to small details, especially in the rich costumes that highlight the historical environment. Although the dialogues are scarce, the narrative is based on deep scenes accompanied by appropriate background music, which helps maintain the viewer's attention throughout. The well-executed gradual transition between the representation of the medieval era and the science fiction elements, gives the story originality and mystery. One of the most relevant and valuable aspects of the movie is the prominent role played by female characters.However, it is important to mention that there were some dark and prolonged scenes that make it difficult to see clearly. This may affect the viewer's experience. In the same way, inside the mountain, there could have been opportunities to explore more fantastical scenarios that could have enriched even more the second part of the movie.Highlighting Eodie's shining performance in the lead role, the movie captivates audiences with a combination of stunning visual elements and a satisfying conclusion to the story. In conclusion, this film is a work of art that delivers an exceptional cinematic experience.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

What a ruined potential adding those details that not merely entertain but also send the political message. What a pity to mix a fantasy medieval world with the contemporary american society and what an irritating propaganda to add all those details in attitude and behavior of the protagonists or just cast those actors that represend all kind of people and races of the modern USA with no practical reason or point to the narrative..
Well, the good things with this movie are the innovative story, the special effects, the nice performance of Millie Bobby Brown and the different environments the plot took place.The bad things are: The extraordinary strength and training required aspects that gave to the damsel. The non- realistic falls that should result in death that happened (or implied that happened again and again). The non-realistic (almost idiotic in terms of the choices the dragon did) fight between the damsel and the dragon. Escpecially in comparison with any other fight between the dragon and other protagonists or past soldiers. The interracial couples that were the norm in the movie. Instead of creating a kingdom of Asians for example, or black africans for example and suggest that different kingdoms of different races people coexist peacefully and the plot could invest on that aspect, if they truly cared in representing people, they choose to mix people in a hypothetical world that there is no specific homogenous kingdom in terms of race and that it's a mix of multicultural global society.Lastly, some details that posibly try to send the message, for those who take care in detail: The damsel transformed during the movie from a beautiful feminine typical princess (apart from the self-confidence and the doubtful spirit she used to be) into a fighter with masculine characteristics. She even cut her hair to declare that transformation, something that some women who become radical feminists are used to do. Another message is that: The dragon and the dark past that connects it with the kingdom (I don't want to spoil so I don't define more what I mean) is also redefined in the present but now with an excuse that a deal with the devil if it's meant to be for the good reason it's justified. Lastly, the damsel's transformation into .... (again, I don't want to spoil) reminds the choice of lonely women who reject the world and the norms of the society and choose their own path.I don't say that is a bad thing. Everyone makes their own choice and it's respected. I just say that a movie should be politically free and don't contain too much societal message. Especially movies that don't class in a social genre, but instead in a fantasy, medieval, science fiction, family destined genre. That's not ok. Even, if most people won't super-analyse all the above aspects, it's still annoying for the typical viewer and it's still obvious that something has changed the last decade and movies don't entertain, or at least don't merely entertain, but also they lecture and send political messages.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I understand why people say its premise was obvious (you can get the initial plot from the trailer!) but it had enough twists and turns to keep you interest and rooting for the heroine. BB played it as if her life depended on it, which of course it did for her character! Took the usual fairy tale vibe and turned it into something much darker and more entertaining. Great effects, real jeopardy and an enjoyable film. Perhaps we have stopped just enjoying films for being entertaining, what more could be asked? I hope this signals more Netflix films to come that entertain and empower.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It embodies the epitome of mediocrity, a narrative that regrettably treads the well-trodden path of clichéd tales, lacking the finesse and originality to captivate. Alas, Damsel epitomizes the modern cinematic landscape, crafted by individuals who lack the passion and dedication requisite for true artistry in filmmaking. It has devolved into a mere industrial product, bereft of soul. As for its technical aspects, while production and acting suffice, the visual effects vacillate between adequacy and the reminiscent aesthetic of subpar video game cutscenes. In conclusion, Damsel stands as a monument to tedium, redundancy, and banality, bereaved of characters that evoke genuine empathy, for they are but replicas of replicas of replicas. The denouement, so painfully predictable, renders it nothing short of insipid: I recently revisited Krull, a film that shines brightly in comparison - it approaches the stature of Citizen Kane when juxtaposed with Damsel. The precise evaluation: 3.5.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

""Oh, it's not because it's a woman, it's just BAD."" Which we all know is code for ""no seriously, women should only exist in film as eye candy."" While I love Stranger Things, I've never been a fan of Millie Bobby Brown in particular - probably because I'm way older than her usual demographic. Still, I figured I'd thumb my nose at misogynists and give the film an extra view or two by having it on in the background while I did other things around the house.I was surprised to find myself quickly engrossed, and was literally on the edge of my seat several times. Aside from two scenes involving animals being hurt by the dragon (and MBB's flawless eye makeup throughout the film's entirety,) I have no complaints. If I were 25 years younger, I would be cosplaying Elodie at the next DragonCon. She's intelligent and determined, and with a depth I hadn't anticipated. Plus, MBB was amazing in this.Bravo.

Logic is nowhere to be found. The dialogue is awfully written, and I'm sorry but I do not think Millie saved this at all. I find her acting obnoxious, and same goes for every other actor involved, minus the voice of the dragon. Every few minutes dumb decisions are being made, yet we are led to believe Elodie is ""smart"". She leaves behind valuable resources, constantly screams, doesn't know how to bandage properly, and only decides to get her hair out of the way in the last 10 minutes. By cutting it. Because apparently buns aren't a thing. Not that you should want to save your long locks at all cost but... Making a bun is a whole lot easier than cutting your hair with a sword. The only thing I liked in this movie is the betrayal of her new husband throwing her into the pit. That carried some emotion, despite the execution being lackluster. It would have been even better had the royal family not explained exactly what was about to happen word for word. Overall, I would skip this movie.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Although it should be noted that both lean heavily on CGI, but nevertheless are skillfully crafted.The main idea of the story is that Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown) is not a damsel that needs saving. Rather she is a resilient, loyal, and compassionate woman thrust into circumstances beyond the realm of fair.The movie is at its strongest when Elodie and the bereft dragon share screen time together. It takes far too long for the central elements of the story to begin, and sadly relies predictably on common character tropes like a wicked queen, a morally torn prince, and a father who chooses wrongly before embarking on a redemption arc.For the age group this film is aimed at, I think they've done an acceptable job.

It feels like a fast moving fantasy film of medium quality, with good visuals of castles, ocean voyages, and palace interiors. The acting seems forced, even by the skilled actors, but that bit of amateurish technique doesn't hinder the arc of the first segment.Then: SCREEEEECH! All of the film's intro segment skids to a stop when the Princess gets tossed into a dark cavern with a dragon. The next hour and a half is her stumbling around in the dark, in sequence after sequence of boring and meandering attempts to escape. It was so dark and pointless I lost all interest in how the film turned out, and fell asleep several times to the sounds of 11 doing her Stranger Things cry for help (which is a MUCH better project in every way).When I awoke there were some bad CGI segments of the dragon, and then PUFF! It was over. It leaves you wondering if the production ran out of money or something. In sum, this odd Jeckyl and Hyde mash-up doesn't work and should probably be avoided. Stick to the fantasy classics that all have great stories and consistent momentum.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A woman that didn't need a prince to save her and her family, but instead had a dragon to help her do the job.There is far more to love about this movie than there is to poke fun at. Damsel took those contrived fairy tale tropes of a female in peril and completely flipped the script. Elodie had herself, her smarts, and her ability to feel empathy to rely on. Not to mention a stepmother who was the complete opposite of what that character has been portrayed as in every fairy tale ever. And a family that was imperfect, yet still cared about one another, even to their own detriment.I loved how this film both fit the bill for a classic damsel in distress set up, but also broke every single one of those rules. The dragon was very reminiscent of Lord of the Ring's Smog, but more evolved and able to overcome prejudice, a truly incredible character in it's own rite. And Elodie was so badass I just immediately wanted her and the dragon to become bff's.I also loved how Elodie became a princess version of Sarah Conner. Plus, I'm a big fan of the usage of bugs as a night light, reminiscent of the film Pitch Black, which also had a badass leading lady at its center.I'll put this film up there with Hulu's The Princess, which yes, I also enjoyed. How wonderful is it to think that this young generation of females growing up is being given princesses that don't need to be saved, but instead do the saving. I'm truly jealous and awed. Lucky them.","18 out of 34 found this helpful.

It looked distracting in many scenes as if they're constantly trying to make her look sexy despite what she's been through which takes you out of the immersion. At some point around the end, they swapped the side where the scar on her chest was supposed to be in the cave versus at the castle scene, showing continuity issues. There was even a scene where a servant was talking the previous princess around 13:30 into the movie without moving their mouth. There was really no character development throughout the entire movie. The ending went downhill and was cheesy. The flame dragon was defeated with flames. Every princess survived a major drop from a crazy height. Plot armor was thick, and there was lots of plot holes too.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I decided why not and watched it.It was a bit below average and predictable. The special effects were decent and where a large portion of the budget went apparently.Some of that money should have been spent on the script.A king desperate to save his kingdom agrees to hand over his oldest daughter's hand in marriage to the prince of a kingdom offering enormous compensation. From the beginning this deal stunk from the way the future mother-in-law treated the bride's stepmother to the cryptic mention of rituals at the nearby mountain.Angela Bassett and Robin Wright are A-listers given very little to do in the means of great lines of script... That's a waste of talent and this movie could have used them better here. 'Damsel' lacks any surprises so having these two interact more with better lines would have been more than welcomed.Millie Bobby Brown was miscasted as the lead - she simply didn't give that great of a performance. Stiff, one note and inadequate.No spoilers here - you don't need any once you get through the first 75 minutes.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

In fact, although the heroine does demonstrate an evolving set of survival skills, the dragon is the most complex character here, actually evolving with experience. And extremely well drafted and acted.I guess the idea here was to underline that women can succeed despite an intimidating environment, but Angelina Jolie is more successful in that objective and more entertaining as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not this one. Millie Brown has a lot to learn when it comes to acting. She wasn't bad by any means and of course part of her performance is partly to be blamed on the director. However, she wasn't great and was barely good, particularly towards the end of the film. Such as when she was confronting the queen in front of the 3rd sacrificial bride. It was straight stupid, poor writing and ignorant direction on performance.As for some of the comments on 'moderninity', I typically only view that with ethnicity (forcing different skin shades where they don't belong). Yes, there were 2 'out of place' black characters but you have to remember, this is a FANTASY land. It has a totally different timelime and happenings than our own. I personally didn't have any issue with any of the cast in that sense because this movie is not claiming to be historically accurate. I like Angela Bassett but I didn't care for her in the role she had, she is far too strong of an actor to be playing a character that, essentially, is weak. Not to mention it's a small role and she deserves bigger and better. Yes, I know she chose to take the role.The CGI was really goos, I could only notice a few things that were a little blurry or otherwise not perfect, but ultimately it doesn't matter because I can't remember what they were the next day. I enjoyed the dragon having a slightly different form to traditional dragons. She was by no means the first of her design but it was refreshing to see something different, yet not ridiculous, that wasn't limited to video games. The voice actor was a good choice, obviously feminine but still held the weight of a large, not-to-trifled-with beast with some gutteral sound.I hated the visions of previous princesses, it really took me out of the moment. I think this would have been better as a short series and probably would have enjoyed it much more. A shame they went for the short movie time instead, really takes away a lot of opportunity and visual growth. I will never watch it again, and while I gave it 4 stars I would recommend it to anyone interested in fantasy.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Damsel tells the tale of Elodie, the princess of a faraway kingdom, who gets duped by her fiance, who throws her into a cave as a sacrifice to a vengeful dragon. What happened next? Why did they do this to her? Did Elodie survive? The answers to these questions form the rest of the story.I did like the pacing of Damsel; It did not take a long time for us to get into the story and Millie is a fine actress; She shows a great deal of emotions on her face, which are compelling and fits the rebellious nature of Elodie. CG was stunning at times, glitchy at other times, but appreciate the effort put into it.Characterization and storyline is a huge 'meh' for me. The screenplay is an ancient cliche, you always know what's gonna happen next and like all other fairy tales, Damsel does not differentiate much between its characters. Every one has two-dimensional traits.Damsel is also a women-centric movie; In the sense, men don't play much part in it. The protogonists and the antagonists are all women. Felt like I was watching an Indian drama, to be honest.To conclude, Damsel could be a film you watch to pass time on your weekends but it does not leave an impact. On the other hand, the film might be a little scary for children to watch.VetrrichChelvan

Elodie embraces her destiny as a member of the royal bloodline, but her life is not solely determined by the existence of dragons, royal families, and obedient villagers.

It surpasses this one in every single aspect and has one of the most beautifully portrayed romances I've seen on film.That being said, I gave this a fair shot, even though I knew it's going to follow the girl boss formula I despise.The set designs and especially the costumes were pretty great, the music was beautiful and Shohreh Aghdashloo's voice acting was superb as always.I found the writing pretty weak, they kept missing opportunities for an emotional punch. The acting was a bit over the top from the 3 main female characters and on a personal note I don't like Millie Bobby Brown's breathy deliveries in particular.The violence felt out of place somehow... I'm not sure how to explain this, but it felt like it's gritty for the sake of being gritty and it took me out of the movie rather than reel me in in some satisfying way.Overall, It's a decent time waster, but there are so many great movies to spend your time on instead.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Probably girls will love it more ( the female protagonist is the hero).The starting is so visually pleasing ( the gowns, castle, scenery). Millie looks exceptionally pretty with brown hair.The action is good. VFX are great. Storyline is solid. It's like a new version Disney story, where the female lead is bold, smart and strong ( damn, the crystal climbing looked tough: inspired me to start doing rock climbing). The cinematography is perfect.It is not that childish and I think even adults would enjoy it. Overall a nice fantasy watch.","26 out of 54 found this helpful.

A lot of big actors were in the film and only those big actors seemed to carry the weight of the movie on their shoulders. Millie Bobbie brown is overhyped and unfortunately drove my rating down. Her accent wasn't consistent and every line she said was flat. Her facial expressions also did not match what kind of girl she was supposed to portray. Millie has never been that great of an actress to begin with and this just drove it home for me. Unfortunately the other actors do not appear in the movie much since it is about the damsel. So much potential only wasted with subpar acting.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not much acting needed in those shallow scripts and that's what you're getting.But there's a massive problem I have with movies that are supposed to be medieval. WHY ARE THEY WEARING FULL FACE MAKEUP!?!?!?!? And they don't even hide it. The main character has a full smokey eye, lip gloss and bright pink lips..obvious blush and highlighter. Not even mentioning the bleached wite teeth everyone is spotting. Like, oh yeah we don't have running water but sure, makeup and high profile dentists are just... Heavenly sent I guess.Yes there was light makeup back then but NOT to that extent! I just don't know why they try to fool us.. Maybe because they can right.We don't want pretty, we want actors who can act.So overall, it's okay for what it is.

Picture this: you're settling in for a cozy movie night, hoping for an engaging story with some stunning visuals. But as the film unfolds, you quickly realize there's a major hiccup-the protagonist's constant screams. Seriously, they're relentless, and it's like nails on a chalkboard throughout the entire movie. Now, I'm all for adding suspense and tension, but this just feels overdone and takes away from the overall experience.But hey, it's not all doom and gloom! Despite this glaring issue, the movie still manages to hold its own thanks to its original concept. I mean, kudos to the writers for thinking outside the box and bringing something fresh to the table. It's definitely a breath of fresh air in a sea of predictable plotlines.And let's not forget about the special effects-they're nothing short of spectacular. From jaw-dropping CGI to heart-pounding action sequences, the visuals alone make it worth the price of admission. Seriously, there were moments where I found myself on the edge of my seat, completely immersed in the world unfolding before me.So, is it worth a watch? Absolutely. Sure, the constant screaming may leave you with a headache, but if you can look past that, you're in for an entertaining ride. Just be sure to bring along some earplugs, because you're going to need them!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Observations: Costumes like The Princess Bride, Robin Wright's character meaner than Claire Underwood in House of Cards, Millie Bobby is pretty much Eleven but older and more shapely. The cave - where most of Damsel takes place - seems like a knock off of The Upside Down. Throwing in the ghosts of previous sacrifices is a convenient way to check off the diversity requirements. I did not give up on it and turn it off, but it sure could have used more of a plot.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

And actors don't seem engaged much into what's happening (or perhaps what's happening is not much to engage with) - it looks more like a inexpensive theatric play rather than a movie, despite the actors' potential.I'd not recommend this one - it's not even entertaining, unfortunately.

Pros
==================
-It's entertaining
-Good decorations
-Good photo
-Good costumes
-Good locations
-Good CGI
-The Voice of the Dragon is played by a good actress with a very identifiable voice played by actress Shohreh Aghdashloo.==============
Cons
==============
-It is predictable
-The king of the kingdom doesn't matter. Not a single line of dialogue
-The role of the King falls to the queen.-The protagonist does not stop screaming in the cave.-The main character ends up being RAMBO.-The male characters have flaws, and are treacherous.In Damsel it tells a story of betrayal and revenge. Not a hint of optimism. Dragonheart is much more sentimental, Featuring a rogue dragon, who gives his life to save the kingdom. Quite the opposite of this movie. As for the Damsel soundtrack, it seemed generic to me, while the Dragonheart soundtrack is very good.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It swayed my emotions and really tug at some personal places in my heart where normally nothing can touch. The sounds practically thrummed in sync with my breath and pounded against my lungs like a heartbeat. It really saddens me to see people overlook the movie and have such negative feelings about it. Sure, this movie did have a few parts where I cringed a bit or was slightly duller than other scenes. But like all the other wonderful movies out there, despite being very unique, they all have one thing in common. Like all the other masterpieces to ever have been born in history, there are always flaws or mistakes. Whether if they're small or little, there is something bad about every movie. And that's NORMAL. I know this review may sound really cheesy or overly exaggerated, people need to understand that there is no such thing as someone or something being perfect. People really need to also view the things about the movie through multiple lenses. If you look very closely, there are lots of deeper meanings or multiple meanings about something. There is also LOTS of symbolism involved. I would say a lot more about how amazing this movie is, but there are infinite things about it and there is way too much for me to talk about. Thanks for reading, and I'm wishing ever single one of you the best in life!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The primary issue lies in the film's excessively dim lighting, which, although atmospherically accurate, hampers the audience's ability to engage fully with the visual storytelling. It's a movie, after all, and a certain level of visibility is essential to connect with the characters and understand the narrative.The scene set in the dark cave could have been an excellent opportunity to use creative lighting techniques to suggest the environment's gloominess without plunging the entire scene into near-total darkness. Subtle illumination, perhaps mimicking the faint glow of bioluminescence or the soft gleam of a distant light source, could have provided just enough visibility to keep viewers invested in the unfolding drama.Moreover, the sound design, while clear, left me straining to associate the noises with unseen actions, breaking the immersion that visual storytelling offers. It's crucial for a film to balance its auditory and visual elements, especially in scenes where the setting plays a pivotal role in the narrative.In conclusion, while I appreciate the filmmaker's commitment to creating an authentic and immersive environment, I believe a more nuanced approach to lighting would greatly enhance the viewing experience. It would allow the audience to remain engaged with the storyline and characters, even in a setting as challenging as a pitch-dark cave. The essence of cinema is to show, not just tell, and finding that balance is key to crafting an unforgettable viewing experience.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Millie's performance as Elodie in 2024 ""Damsel"" is rather annoying and grating.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9667710/?ref_=tt_urv","jaysonpajaronvistal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158145467/?ref_=tt_urv","9 March 2024","Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, ""Damsel,"" the 2024 fantasy adventure, is a movie that's difficult to pin down, both in terms of genre and quality. It's one of those films that, despite its ambitions and a sizable budget, seems to fail in execution, leaving audiences scratching their heads as to what exactly they've watched. Audiences are invited on a captivating journey filled with a talking dragon, regal families, and the sonic enchantment of Hans Zimmer. Yet, it leaves audiences to be in distress and unamazed rather than in awe and astonishment.First of all, let's address the dragon in the room-literally. Yes, ""Damsel"" includes a dragon that speaks. Now, in the world of fantasy, dragons that talk aren't necessarily a deal-breaker. However, in this film, the decision feels as if the creators threw darts at a board of fantasy tropes while blindfolded. The dragon's dialogue does become more coherent as the plot progresses, but its initial introduction is jarring and unfortunately funny, leaving viewers to wonder if the film is intentionally leaning into absurdity or if it's a misstep. Moreover, the CGI used to bring this dragon to life is, sadly, not up to par. The CGI rendering in ""Damsel"" still grapples with occasional disparities, as certain scenes suffer from a noticeable lack of visual refinement. Despite the technological advancement right now, the portrayal of a talking dragon reminiscent of early video game graphics, remains an uninteresting choice. The creature's design is less 'majestic' and more of like a 'lackluster Komodo dragon'. It's unfortunate because the dragon is pivotal to the story, yet it lacks the visual appeal one expects from such a mythical creature.Millie's performance as Elodie is annoying and grating. While she brings her face card to the role, her tendency to default to shouting is a choice that quickly wears thin. The overreliance on shouting to convey urgency or distress becomes annoying over time. That's not to say she doesn't have her moments, however, her portrayal could have been more effective. The movie feels heavy-handed and unnecessarily verbose. The dialogue succumbs to overexplaining the situation, undercutting the film's visual storytelling and downplaying the audience. Instead of allowing the audience to engage with the film's world, the dialogue spoon-feeds information, stripping away any sense of discovery or wonder. This tendency to over-explain is perhaps most obnoxious when Elodie spells out her observations, literally. In a particularly on-the-nose moment, she points out ""crystals"" and a ""bird"" to an extent that feels unnecessary. Even her uttering the letter ""V"" as she sees the name ""Victoria"" written on the stone is very unnecessary. It's as if the film doesn't trust its audience to understand the plot or the setting without a constant explanation. This choice not only disturbs the overall pacing but also negates the potential impact of the visuals and the performances.The film's narrative is a patchwork of concepts that appear intriguing on paper but are poorly woven together on screen.""Damsel"" seems to struggle to find its identity, unable to find a consistent tone. Is it a children's movie? A dark fantasy for adults? It tries to be both and ends up serving neither well on both demographics. The darker elements feel out of place in a movie that also includes scenes clearly meant to be whimsical and lighthearted. This tonal disconnection results in a confusing experience. The strategy to be ambiguous, at times, results in a narrative that lacks a defined direction. The dialogue's shortcomings are a significant factor contributing to the film's crisis. It's a script that can't seem to decide whether it's aiming for the simplicity required for a young audience or the sophistication that might appeal to adults. The result is a mishmash that's unlikely to fully satisfy both audiences.The musical score, crafted by the renowned Hans Zimmer, introduces a symphony that struggles to integrate with the film's overall ambiance and atmosphere. The composition occasionally borders on obtrusive, disrupting viewer immersion rather than enhancing it. It's a rare misstep for Zimmer, and one can't help but wonder what drew him to this project. Overall, the movie's threads come loose in nearly every aspect. The CGI fails to dazzle, the dragon's dialogue and design are distasteful, Millie's performance is marred by an over-reliance on shouting, and the narrative is a jumble of confusing elements. Even Hans Zimmer's score, which one would expect to be a redeeming feature, ends up feeling out of place.Lastly, the ending of ""Damsel"" is as predictable as it is cliché. Without spoiling too much, the film's conclusion leans heavily into the 'Mighty One' trope, even cheekily nodding to the ""Game of Thrones"" series by making the main character ""the mother of a dragon"" or in this case, ""sister of a dragon."" It's an ending that could have used a twist or a more original resolution. Instead, it opts for a safe, familiar wrap-up that leaves no lasting impression. In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is an odd film that never quite finds its footing. It's a mishmash of ideas that could have been something special had they been executed with more care and cohesion. In the end, the movie is an uneven ride, occasionally entertaining but mostly perplexing. It's a fantasy film that's unfortunately more forgettable than fantastic.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

""Damsel,"" a film that attempts to subvert the traditional narrative of the damsel in distress, is a bold endeavor that both captivates and confounds.The film opens with a promise of enchantment, as we're introduced to Elodie, portrayed with a blend of innocence and fortitude by Millie Bobby Brown. Her journey, ostensibly to find love and save her family's dwindling fortunes, quickly becomes a quest for survival against a backdrop of betrayal and draconian tradition. The visual splendor of the film is undeniable, with lush landscapes and a royal court that dazzles the senses. The costume design is particularly noteworthy, with each stitch and hue contributing to the film's fairy tale aesthetic.However, the film's ambition is not matched by its execution. The narrative, while initially engaging, soon unravels into a series of predictable plot points. The attempt to modernize the fairy tale with a twist is commendable, but the film struggles to maintain a consistent tone, vacillating between a serious critique and a light-hearted adventure.The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Nick Robinson, deliver performances that range from compelling to lackluster. Winstone's portrayal of Lord Bayford is imbued with a gravitas that anchors the film's more fantastical elements, while Robinson's Prince Henry lacks the depth necessary to make his character's actions believable.The film's central conflict, involving a dragon that serves as both a literal and metaphorical obstacle for Elodie, is where ""Damsel"" shows its most glaring weaknesses. The creature, meant to be a formidable foe, is rendered with computer-generated effects that fail to convince. This, coupled with action sequences that lack tension and originality, diminishes the impact of Elodie's struggle.""Damsel"" does succeed in moments where it allows its heroine to shine. Brown's performance is the film's saving grace, as she brings a tenacity to Elodie that is both refreshing and inspiring. The scenes where she employs her ingenuity to overcome challenges are a testament to the character's resilience and the actor's skill.""Damsel"" is a film that reaches for the stars but falls short of its lofty aspirations. Its visual beauty and strong lead performance are overshadowed by a faltering narrative and underwhelming effects. It stands as a reminder that even the most well-intentioned tales require a steady hand to weave their magic effectively.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

A fresh twist on a classic fairytale! Millie Bobby Brown shines as Elodie leading the charge, this movie transforms a familiar genre into a unique and exciting viewing experience.Initially, ""Damsel"" may seem to follow the typical fantasy and adventure storyline, offering a narrative of heroic quests and bold rescues. However, it quickly diverges from conventional tales, immersing the audience in an ominous and captivating story. Elodie's progression, from agreeing to what seems like a harmless marriage proposal to discovering she is a pawn in a dark scheme to settle an old debt of a royal family, unravels with unyielding speed and tension.Millie Bobby Brown gave a remarkable, compassionate, and strong portrayal as Elodie, blending empathy with a vigilante-like determination. Meanwhile, Nick Robinson's performance as a prince struggling to break free from his family's traditional values and sense of honor enhances the overall impact of the film.What sets ""Damsel"" apart is its bold deviation from the traditional fairytale storyline, despite its self-aware disclaimer, 'This is not a fairytale.' The presence of a dragon, appearing both authentic in its depiction and mythical in its being, acts as a strong symbol for the obstacles and monsters encountered on the journey towards liberation and self-discovery. This fantastical element anchors the storyline in a timeless conflict, blurring the boundaries between reality and fantasy.The movie's downside is the inconsistent CGI used throughout the film. Apart from the predictable storyline, the film is quite enjoyable. Overall, the film's direction and cinematography are carried out thoughtfully and skillfully, resulting in a captivating and enjoyable visual and storytelling experience.In conclusion, if I could watch this movie with the same awe and wonder as I did the first time, I would, because it was absolutely breathtaking. I totally recommend it!!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Acting was my least favourite still good though but went beyond of my expectations.","16 out of 32 found this helpful.

Although I did have a pretty decent nap during this one. So all around it's still a -2.3 rating. Good for the background noise to help with insomnia or other sleeping issues. If you're looking for a good movie this is not your choice. I've watched some horrible movies and I will watch them again. This one I will warn people not to watch. Even better I will never utter the words of this movie that I have forgotten the name of while writing this right now.Rum rules!

Putting it here up front because it's apparent from the start that the director is enamored with GoT. But, if you can get past that...Damsel is a tragic requiem for girlhood, and a beautiful tribute to womanhood. It subverts trope after trope, carried on the back of one of the finest actors of her generation in Millie Bobby Brown, and manages to genuinely surprise at least twice. It's the reverse of a fairy tale - the prince does not get the princess - and a reverse of so many similar fantasy movies - the heroine does not ""save"" the day.The music is exceptional, the special effects are above average, and there is one scene that will pull tears from your eyes. Overall it's a little rushed and there are a few clear continuity errors, but for a movie where there is essentially one person on screen for 80% of the runtime, it works really well. Credit to Millie for her ability to play fierce and vulnerable at the same time, especially with the after-effects of dragon fire.Highly recommended for those of you looking for something just a little bit different. International Women's Day indeed.","20 out of 42 found this helpful.

It does everything better than this movie. Better writing, better story, better acting, and in my opinion better action and visual effects.The premise of this movie seemed interesting, and there are parts that I enjoyed, but as a whole I would not watch it again. I think the weakest part really was the writing. The dialogue in most scenes wasn't very good, and the structure/pacing of the movie didn't keep me interested. Even the ending wasn't very satisfying.Watching this also made me think of ""The Princess"", a movie about a captured damsel who has to fight her way through her captors. That movie had HORRIBLE dialogue, but at least the action was fun. ""Damsel"" has better writing and acting, but less compelling action.Like I said at the beginning, I think if you want a more enjoyable experience from a movie, watch ""Prey"".","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's creative - has its own story, which wasn't made before or did in so many different ways you could tell how it would end, or be bored to watch. The story could get a bit deeper, some dialogous could be longer to build out connections, but besides that they were really good and good to understand. Also the visuals were stunning, and I heard that the landscape of the kingdom is actually real, which shows that this movie doesn't need endless CGI to work, showing the love made to this movie. Millie B Brown did a really good job with her acting, would say one of her best performances, while she did her stuns by herself. This movie wasn't just made, it was made to entertain and getting our interest. I would've thought it would be a characterless/pointless feminist movie, but it also came out on womens day, but it DIDN'T.Don't listen to people who talk bad about this movie, it would be boring or not original. What many people forget is that a movie needs to get into the story, and just telling is boring to some, but the visuals make it also really interesting. So give it a chance and you will enjoy it!","52 out of 125 found this helpful.

It's a decent addition to the genre, delivering exactly what you'd anticipate, albeit with some flaws.In terms of performances, the cast delivers an okay rendition. Millie Bobby Brown shines, though her penchant for screaming might test your patience. Angela Bassett, while undoubtedly talented, tends to lean into her signature style a bit too much, resulting in a performance that feels more suited to theatrical performances rather than on the screen.Visually, the CGI holds up, seamlessly blending into the fantastical world without becoming distracting or unintentionally humorous. However, the story is of the standard hero's journey with only minor deviations from the well-trodden path.Overall, it's a serviceable fantasy adventure that provides a decent amount of entertainment, even if it doesn't break any new ground. If you're a fan of the genre and in need of a popcorn-worthy escape, it's worth a watch. Just don't expect any groundbreaking revelations along the way.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It didn't have to. It stems from a simple story, yes, but the twists and turns were the perfect amount and way to keep us guessing. And the story has the right amount of depth. Interesting and not confusing. And you'll care about the story and characters.Every actor was exactly right. No over the top drama. The right ppl were the right amount of emotional at exactly the right times. They didn't force us to know their motives or showboat a specific trope of personality, which is so correct and breath of fresh air. And no one over acted. All the actors did an excellent job!The cast was perfect.The dragon was a multidimensional character and not just a terrorizing creature. And her voice(can't remember the name of that phenomenal actress) was perfect.The main character is portrayed throughout with a particular character trait that I don't want to mention here but it played absolutely perfectly for such a remarkable story arc.I love a movie that takes what seems like a simple story - and keeps it simple. I know that seems weird. But though it's simple - it is 100% not like anything else. It wasn't slow. It wasn't shallow. It wasn't trope-filled. This is the kind of movie that I would actually like to see a sequel of.Millie Bobbie Brown just brings it. She must be a strong person because she shines as a strong brave kind intelligent hero.The story also wasn't convoluted by a narcissistic director. Those ppl like to put it so much extra fluff to draw out a timeline and this director refrained from doing so. They knew they had just the right amount of everything for a good film. And that it's a perfect example of a good film it gets 10 stars.I truly enjoyed watching this film.","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

That's your target audience - others need not apply.I shouted ""Oh, come on!"" at every derivative plot point, bad choice, and impossible action. Others have detailed them, so I won't (except to add that humans typically can't fall more than 20 feet without breaking a bone. Just sayin'.)To be fair to my daughter, she shouted at the main character to stop screaming and wailing, understanding it was very unwise under the circumstances, so she wasn't completely taken in.We watched this right after Spy Kids, one of my daughter's favorite movies, which just served to underscore Damsel's lack of pacing, intelligence, and wit (and Spy Kids is no Oscar contender.) But for MBB, she was willing to forgive most everything. It was an action adventure with a powerful, intelligent female lead, and for that I give it 3 stars.I award a fourth star for a stepmother who loved and cared for her stepdaughter.

But, the movie is very generic. I think they were trying to go with a new thing by capitalizing on this idea of a damsel in distress. Very commendable, but it made the plot easy to figure out and that means it's just a run of the mill movie. But, the dragon looks amazing! And Millie Bobbie Brown does not disappoint in her role. She's a strong female character and does bring out the inner strong woman in all of us.If you want a fun movie, this isn't a bad way to go. But, I just wouldn't expect anything out of it. It's one of those that you might have up while doing something else.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, after watching the film (In parts, couldn't give it a straight viewing) I was left with a harsh blowout.I'm game for the fantasy genre. I have been introduced to it in recent years, and ever since then I have invested my time in watching different films, shows, games and even books, most of which are pretty good. In this case, I find that Damsel is a derivative, boring facade of a film. Having little to nothing to show for it other than a castle and a dragon.Most performances here I found to be either over dramatic or choppy and robotic. Nothing really felt authentic. Millie Bobby Brown stars as the lead, and she's fine in regards to the rest of the cast but still isn't good enough to salvage this film. I like Millie and I think she has wonderful performances in other projects. A lot of scenes here had me feeling like I was heading into a side quest in an open world RPG game, that's the vibe if you catch my drift.Visually, for a Netflix production this film looked good. Some of the wide shots with the castle were stunning to look at as well as shots with the mountain. The dragons CGI could have used a little bit of touching and sharpening but overall was solid.Damsel to me was missing the magic that fantasy projects so dearly need in order to draw attention. I want to be invested in the plot and to be taken on a journey. I want my curiosity to sparkle and here it just didn't. I did not enjoy watching this film and would recommend you spend your time and energy elsewhere.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has a good cast and the premise, while nothing new, has potential to be really good.Instead, the movie doesn't use those brilliant actors to their potential, tries too hard to be too many things at once, and convolutes a simple, fun premise in an attempt to give it a twist even though it lays it out within the first few minutes.The actors do the best they can with what they're given, but the writing is clunky and the characters aren't even cardboard cutouts because cardboard has more depth to it. That is a real shame too, because of the caliber of actor they crammed into those paper-thin roles. I feel like they could have saved on their casting and put that money into other areas where it needed it like the CGI.Millie Bobby Brown really tries to elevate this but there's no real progression or growth to her character even though she's on the screen for like 95%of the movie. She goes in as a smart, stong-willed, independent, female protagonist and comes out the exact same just with shorter hair. Even her wounds are conveniently healed almost instantly, so there's never really much of a struggle or danger that isn't resolved within a few minutes. Of course, that's what happens when you try to cram the premises of multiple stories into a movie with a shorter runtime than most of the movies it's ripping off.There's a few scenes of pretty settings, and the costuming is well done, but then it dives into a dark soundstage with mediocre CGI that just underwhelms. The CGI just seems to suffer even more when the dragon is no longer hidden in the shadows of its own cave.For the sake of spoilers, I'm not going to really discuss the ending other than to say that it may have been the most disappointing part of all.If you can ignore the mediocre script, paper thin plot, even thinner character depths, lackluster CGI, and have never seen any of the classic fantasy movies this tries to be, I guess it could be ok. Unfortunately, I've seen so many movies that did better at all the things this tried to do, so it severely paled in comparison. I'm giving it an extra star because I do appreciate it trying to bring a strong female lead to a genre with nowhere near enough of them, I just wish they had done a better job with it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The moral of the story is black and white the whole way through without any captivating grey area, which is a huge missed opportunity when you think about the nature of sacrifice and the motivation behind most of the characters' actions.Overall it needed more complexity and nuance.

I understand the critics, but for me, it is a brilliant movie, and I'll explain why.The ""damsel in distress"" trope is one of the oldest narratives in human civilization, recounted in a million variations over the last few thousand years. Yet, we've never seen it portrayed in its most essential form in a movie. Of course, we've encountered many variations-stories that are more complex, set in different times, and different environments. However, these adaptations never captured the true essence of the story, because no studio had the courage to present the foundational tale in its simplest form, which is, of course, straightforward as a nail. Not a complicated story, but the real, original, simple one.I believe this movie presents us with the original version that was born in the early humans' minds as a tale, nothing more. That is why I think this movie occupies a niche of its own.The scenery is breathtaking, with wonderful performances by Millie Bobby Brown, Ray Winstone, and Robin Wright. The dynamics are thrilling. And the story is simple as a nail, which is something we could never fully appreciate until Damsel.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

With the prince and his family sacrificing every princess into a mountain. Where lays a dragon that is bent on revenge against the royalty family.The plot was okay. The script is a bit cheesy with the narrative in the beginning. The visual effects are okay worthy. The action sequences is also okay as well. Nothing too epic to make it memorable. The acting is a bit stale with the cast ensemble. Performances were flat that made it seem like it should have been buried in the mountain.The film spends most of the second act with Mille Brown hiding in the caverns and trying to escape the mountain.

""Damsel"" aspires to refresh the classic fairytale princess tale by introducing a female hero into an action-packed plot. The concept is alluring, hinting at a brave deviation from the norm. However, the film's realization falls short, hampered by a failure to fully deliver on its innovative promise.**Screams Amidst Silence:**
A glaring misstep is the film's reliance on an outdated cliché: the incessant screams of female characters in response to pain, fear, or surprise. This is not just a tired stereotype but also a narrative flaw, especially when silence would be crucial for survival. It's baffling why these otherwise empowered women would revert to such counterproductive outbursts.**Visually Pleasing Scenes:**
Despite these criticisms, ""Damsel"" features aesthetically pleasing scenes that likely shine on the big screen, backed by a clearly generous production budget. The narrative is captivating and well-constructed, deserving a solid 7 out of 10, if not for the previously mentioned flaws.**Cinematic Missteps:**
Beyond the screams, the film includes a series of illogical details and blunders that further diminish its credibility. These range from minor continuity issues to significant plot holes that leave viewers puzzled.**Family-Friendly Entertainment:**
Nevertheless, for a family audience, ""Damsel"" might just suffice. It provides a mix of adventure and fantasy that can keep the younger audience spellbound, making it an adequate, albeit not exceptional, choice for a family movie night.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Netflix's Damsel starring superstar Millie Bobby Brown is a film that I had high hopes for. The early marketing material painted a picture of an ambitious, female-led fantasy adventure.Millie Bobby Brown's acting prowess is admirable, creating a career full of potential since the mid-2010's. With her strong roles in the past, it only made sense that she would set into a role in another period piece that is chock full of suspense, violence, and very expensive CGI. However, her acting skills, along with other recognizable and respected talent, were not enough to save this movie's script from becoming soggy from the waters of the oversaturated fantasy genre.I struggle to find anything of lasting substance in this one. Most of what we endure is a survival montage listening to Brown scream for several minutes consecutively. I feel there are missed opportunities to create these segments in a way that reveals more about Brown's character, the world she inhabits, and revelations about her current situation and how she ended up where she is. Instead, these revelations are made in a very matter-of-fact and plain way that removes any mystique or emotional weight from this pivotal moment that should serve to change her outlook on her world as she sees it forever.I found the most immersive elements of this film are the beautifully mystical world that we explore, even if we don't get much time to spend in it before we are plunged into a bottomless fissure for well over an hour. This combined with a beautiful score and sound design do offer a world that feels alive one moment, and cold and desolate the next. The way this mirrors the cast's journey does add to a more visual narrative, even if everything that is happening is explained to us verbally when no one else is around to hear it.I'm surprisingly disappointed by this one. The aforementioned promise it showed didn't hold up, but regardless, the cast tries to breathe life into a fairytale that already feels ancient.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It might be a cute option for younger viewers.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They run around the cave for eternity.Milly bobby brown is not a good actress she moans so much during this movie that it could be a porn soundtrack, has 4 facial expressions and all of them are forced. The rest of the cast is about as good as her.The only good thing is the voice actress of the dragon hats of to her.

Although it's all incredibly basic and feels similarly cheap in that specifically 'Netflix original' way, it does feature a number of effective moments (the highlight is a brief but notable claustrophobic crawling sequence) that keep it from being an overall bad experience. These moments don't elevate it beyond general mediocrity, but they do just enough to spark your interest every now and again. They also somewhat counteract the clunky dialogue, predictable plotting, unconvincing acting and flimsy special effects. Therefore, the flick sits firmly in the 'fine' category. There's not much else to say about it, really. It's the sort of thing that you'll forget about as soon as it's over, but is mildly diverting while it's unfolding onscreen.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am stupid enough to understand their arguments.Millie Bobby Brown has done a good job, in my opinion. This was a fantasy movie, and I guess fantasy does not require any logic to justify. That is why it is fantasy. All actors, as for me, have done their jobs decently. The camera work was good. We got to see breathtaking locations, and I personally loved that. The film was not slow, the story was sufficient to establish a fantasy world. I think it was a job well done.I liked the villain-turned-hero kind of sentiment, I am a big fan of Disney animation movies, and I like the moral-oriented storylines. I understand when things come to the protection of children, situations can go haywire. So, the hero's perspective was good, and so was the villain's perspective.Watch the movie.

I actually liked this horror aspect between the main character and the dragon. I wish we had more of that in here. Its a type of fantasy we don't see very much. Imagine the movie Alien but instead of a Xenomorph in space chasing you it was a Dragon in a labyrinth deep in a mountain chasing you.

Everything is sort of competent, or okay, but this could easily have been a 30min movie and a tv episode. There is no reason to drag things out as much as they do. And since everything is so predictable this is just a chore to watch. Of course we also get some obligatory diversity, and coupled with the clunky dialogue that part feels more off than usual.The best with this is the dragon which was voiced to perfection.I give this a 3/10. If you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you do not mind a bit of dragged out dullness then perhaps give this a go. If you want quality, great acting and a more fun entertaining movie I suggest you go watch Ready or Not instead.

I like the idea of sneaking through the cave, but this was not that. This was dodging fire blasts. The last scene was confusing and the lore left me with some pretty basic questions.

Plain silly and not hiding it.As often nowadays, all male characters are either corrupt or - no matter - here they are all corrupt (even if they regret it later).Well, at least the dragon was good (yes, there is a dragon, but that is general knowledge since the trailer dropped): slimmer and meaner than most.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

She doesn't have her Stranger Things superpowers, but she DOES have determination and resourcefulness. This dynamic is what makes this film watchable. The ending (and overall message) are good, but there are problems.Millie wears a LOT of make-up. I'm not against make-up in principle, but it's actually distracting here, as is the modern dialogue. In NO way do the characters sound like they are from a different time or place. I wouldn't have been surprised if one pulled out a cell phone. Millie's character actually says she was ""guilted into marriage"". Using guilt as a verb is a recent development (slang or not).The first act is SO SLOW (made worse by Netflix teasers that rob the main plot twist of any surprise value). Also, Millie's character has limited depth -- I'll be generous and call it two-dimensional.While the story has some plot twists, it's still weak -- just strong enough for the Netflix assembly line. There are a LOT of wooden, one-dimensional characters. To be fair, the step-mom (Angela Bassett) and the evil queen (Robin Wright) are both decent. Ironically, Robin Wright's excellent stage presence emphasizes just how weak most of the other actors are.The dragon was OK; the CGI and personality were decent, and of course it's a major story element.This COULD have been an exciting and fully satisfying (8-star) tale of betrayal, survival, and vengeance. But remove one star for the slow start, another for the wildly inappropriate modern dialog, and another for the pervasively (perhaps blatantly) contrived vibe. That's five (5) stars total.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Think instead of Oriental Dragons: they are regarded as keepers of Knowledge and Wisdom, better befriended than hunted as they were here.

The story plot aligns with the course of the movie, the movie also kind of gave me anxiety for the main character. Because the main character is doing her best to survive from the dragon and being thrown by an evil royal family. And, the main younger sister I sense that she has good soul and deeply cares for her older sister. The queen the main character just met I believe she has heart of a bad person. After I watched the movie, the main character sort things out with the dragon and avenge her babies from humans with a bad heart. The dragon understood there are humans with good and bad souls. The dragon spooked me however I like the dragon's personality, although hostile I feel like deep down the female dragon is a good soul who cares for her kind as a dragon. If only things were different between humans and dragons the story plot would be rewritten differently. However, I like the movie as it is without making any changes to the film. Also, I am an artist who loves spiritual and fantasy movies. I feel inspired to do a painting of the main character who serves as role model for woman and girls that our weaknesses is what makes us stronger. Although, we human women and girls are weak, fragile, and sometimes unhelpful that's not true to me and I feel that our kindness, empathy, compassion, and bravery is what makes us stronger than someone with judgment, criticism, and being rough. I think the message of the movie is that you need to let go or avoid letting bad people into your life, and only let in people who have good soul and heart. By the end of the day, we are just humans that are doing our best to become the best version of ourselves. Do inner work and shadow work and let go or purge your old self because it's key to become the best version of yourself which becomes your new identity. Your identity becomes your reality and new behavior. If you want to let go of the old self and current version of yourself let go of it, and embody the person you want to become. My rating for this movie is 9/10 and this is my honest review not biased.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was never drawn into the film until the very end.At one point the story changes from the beginning theme to a brand new one that lasted a little bit before moving on to a third idea that really seemed to come out of nowhere as it didn't add up to things that were already shown in the movie.Then there was this part that just made no sense and I think was added just for an emotional response.The ending was good, finished up the one theme well and brought the main character to the desirable conclusion. The story was 2/10, as there were a few stories with essentially 2 characters. But overall I like it and found it entertaining if I took it piece by piece and ignored the overall story/stories and would give it like 7/10.

Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and penned by Dan Mazeau, the film promises an intriguing premise with elements of suspense and fantasy.With a cast that includes Ray Winstone, Nick Robinson, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Bassett, and Robin Wright, ""Damsel"" boasts an impressive lineup of talent. Millie Bobby Brown's portrayal of Elodie is likely to be a highlight, given her track record of delivering compelling performances.The film's streaming debut on Netflix on March 8, 2024, drew mixed reviews from audiences and critics alike. While some viewers may find themselves captivated by the film's blend of dark fantasy elements and suspenseful storytelling, others may feel that it falls short of its potential or lacks coherence in its execution.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, ""Damsel,"" Netflix's latest foray into the genre, falls significantly short of those expectations, stumbling on several fronts that detract from its potential.First and foremost, Brown's performance in ""Damsel"" is a contentious point. Known for her ability to bring depth and nuance to her roles, Brown seems to miss the mark here, delivering a portrayal that leans towards overacting. While her commitment to the role is evident, the excessive expressiveness detracts from the authenticity of her character, especially in scenes that demand subtlety and restraint.Moreover, the film's attempt to maintain a polished aesthetic for Brown's character, even in the most rugged settings, feels incongruous. Whether she's exploring a dark, damp cave or engaging in a fierce battle with a dragon, her makeup remains immaculate, a choice that undermines the realism and immersion of the narrative. Such details might seem minor, but they accumulate, pulling the audience out of the story and highlighting a lack of attention to context and continuity.The script and writing of ""Damsel"" are other areas where the film falters. The narrative feels underdeveloped, with dialogues and plot progressions that often lack the depth and complexity one would expect from a genre rich in possibilities. This issue is not confined to Brown's character alone; the overall cast delivers performances that range from passable to mediocre, suggesting that the problem lies more with the material they were given rather than their individual talents.While the actors, including Brown, show moments of potential, their efforts are hampered by the film's lackluster script and direction. It's a classic case of a movie that could have been much more, had the writing and character development been given the attention they deserved.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a disappointing addition to Netflix's lineup, particularly given the streaming giant's capacity for producing compelling content. While it might offer a few entertaining moments, the film ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a captivating, coherent fantasy adventure. Viewers might find themselves watching till the end, but more out of a sense of completion than genuine enjoyment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's well filmed and there are not many dull moments but it has a very unoriginal plot and it is very shallow without any complexity in terms of plot or character development, similar to marvel movies. Maybe I should have read up but my conception of fantasy shows and movies is that it's normally layered upon years and years of story told throughout various books but this is kinda just an action movie dressed in fantasy clothing.

Except the script. Oh boy, the script!I don't know how you manage to turn that mush of overused, cringe ideas into the least innovative, 100% formulaic, boring and predictable heroine trasher imaginable. They could have taken it, ironed out the kings without much effort - because the issues of the stories are already well known - and turned it into something good. Unfortunately, they kept it at copy-pasting the bad and stupid stuff and seasoned it with more cringe.The only thing that kept me from laughing at how bad it was done was the absence of a kissing scene between the princess and the dragon at sunset in the end. And to to be fair: such a kissing scene would have been more memorable and innovative than the rest of the movie.4 Stars, because the movie looks nice and some people really made an effort.

From what I understand from the comments viewers make on social media, in general, expectations for productions are too high to be met. Maybe this is because new filmmakers are constantly trying something different and out of the ordinary, and end up being disappointed at the box office. However, a good story, good acting, and a well-adjusted storytelling style will always work. Damsel is a good example of this. Unfortunately, it is clear that it will not please the generally dissatisfied teenagers or the overly artistic masses, but they have created an entertaining and watchable film by applying the formula I gave above in a classical sense. What was the general rule? You can't please everyone.I don't want to be misunderstood, I'm not saying it's the best movie of the last few years and a masterpiece, but it's an entertaining and engaging movie that has what a movie should have and leaves a smile on your face when the ""the end"" credits roll.** The current generation, which has not experienced the cinema culture of the 80s and 90s, is quite ruthless and destructive in their criticism of films, as they are in everything else. They need to learn that they won't find the meaning of life in every movie they watch, and sometimes they just need to sit back and enjoy the moment.Damsel is nothing more than a dark fairy tale of a young princess whose life begins enchantingly and unrealistically well, and then turns into a survival fight against an ancient and very powerful dragon. Damsel, like every fantasy fairy tale, contains intrigues, lies, and hidden agendas, and presents them to the viewer in an entertaining way. You can guess where the story is going while watching it, but that's not always a bad thing. Not every story has to have very clever twists. Sometimes you wonder how the ending will happen even if you can guess the ending, and that's honestly the case with Damsel.As I wrote at the beginning, you will not find the secret of life in this film, nor is it a masterpiece that has a special place among the films made so far, but you will return to the fairy tales that we all watched, read, or our families told us in one way or another in our childhood years. If fantasy movies are not for you, then Damsel is not for you. Damsel, which has a well-adjusted, satisfying acting and a flowing story, features my favorite fantasy creature, the Dragon, and not only features it, but also shares the lead role. If you are into fantasy genre then give Damsel a chance.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Once the Dragon came and along side came the horror genre elements, the movie changed completely and my damsel got distressed and baled on me... leaving me alone, in order to complete the mission on my own.Well...challenge accepted...or not completely. The day after she came back, learned that she is a cowered and completed almost all the rest of the film, that was...pretty stupid. Straight forward and almost shoved into each and every viewer's thought. Nothing new from this one or its genre.An almost classis case, for PC era, of roles Reversal, that takes out men almost completely out of order and leaves women to take charge on all of leading roles of influence in the movie. We've got an evil queen mother, the damsel that got distressed and prevails, a female dragon and a whole bunch of men that are doing wrong or doing nothing to prevent all wrong stuff.As I started to say, the first half of hour is kind of an exposition and it completes all genre rules to get the show started. After this time, it's a girl fleeing from a dragoness for each and every direction possible, just to get a second round with it / her. Nothing to be excited about or loose anyone's sleep over it (especially not my wife's).Millie Bobby Brown never proved to be anything else but a pretty growing face in Hollywood and she does it(?) again this time also. We got several has been actors that just watching their name as part of the cast makes me goosebumps.Ray Winstone, Angela Bassett and Robin Wright are absolutely wasted here, but did the job for an 80's kid like me, that will not settle for young Millie Bobby Brown only, in order to check out another collaboration, that she is marking with streaming faltering giant.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The narrative doesn't bring anything new to the table, recycling familiar tropes without any fresh twists or compelling additions. While the lead actresses display commendable physical fitness and commitment to their roles, they are let down by subpar dialogue that fails to capture the depth or nuance necessary for viewer engagement. Perhaps the most jarring element is the anachronistic makeup worn by Miley from ""Stranger Things""; her heavily modern makeup feels out of place in a period setting and distracts from the historical authenticity one might expect. Billie Eilish's makeup, too, is distractingly overdone, pulling attention away from her performance and undermining the film's credibility.

Firstly, the film's pacing struggles to find a consistent rhythm, oscillating between sluggish scenes and rushed developments that leave the audience feeling disconnected from the narrative's emotional core. This erratic pacing undermines the storytelling, making it challenging for viewers to fully invest in the characters' journeys.Moreover, while the movie attempts to subvert traditional genre expectations, it often does so in a manner that feels more contrived than innovative. This approach results in a tonal imbalance, where the film's efforts to blend different genres come off as disjointed rather than seamless. The intended humor and satire, which could have been the film's saving grace, often miss their mark, leading to a sense of awkwardness rather than the intended wit or critique.The performances, although earnest, are hampered by a script that lacks depth and nuance. The characters, meant to be complex and multi-dimensional, often come across as one-dimensional and underdeveloped. This lack of character depth makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with their struggles or understand their motivations, further distancing viewers from the film's narrative.Visually, ""Damsel"" shows some promise with its cinematography and setting, offering glimpses of what could have been a visually captivating experience. However, these moments are overshadowed by the film's overarching issues, including a storyline that feels both predictable and unfulfilling. The potential for a compelling critique of traditional roles and expectations is evident but ultimately not realized, leaving the audience with a sense of what could have been.In conclusion, ""Damsel"" attempts to challenge conventions and offer something new but is hindered by its execution. The film's pacing, tone, character development, and humor all contribute to a viewing experience that feels lacking in both substance and satisfaction. While there are fleeting moments of potential, they are not enough to elevate the movie beyond its fundamental flaws.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I became familiar with her through the series Stranger Things. In Stranger Things she played an abused institutionalized child, and so her acting was intense and vulnerable. Here Ms. Brown plays a very strong young women full of courage, tenacity and intelligence, and even nobility. Moreover, she carries the movie since she is in almost every scene. She does it brilliantly and with aplomb.Another actress that helps raise this movie is Robin Wright who is obviously channeling Claire Underwood from House of Cards.

Not that it needed to be much gorier, they got away with a ton of violence visuals for a pg13, they just would or could have looked better if they werejust that extra bit more realistic, vs meeting a rating.The plot wasn't new or anything groundbreaking, but it works. They did a good enough job with the story that it didn't need to be an entirely new one.I did feel a couple things things she did didn't seem true to anything. Like cutting off her hair to make a rope.Falling in the crystal area and not being absolutely shredded.Overall though, as a pg13 nearing an adult rating, it was a great adventure, with a phenomenally well done dragon. I would rank the dragon a 10/10 for being a D&D representative. Not sure which species, but this was a vindictive, dangerous apex predator with a motive.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

You can find fault with it all you want, be it the plot, the story (yes it is a familiar one), the make believe, the fantasy. But is that not what we need sometimes? My troubles disappeared for a couple hours and I smiled and smiled in that time. If you expect award winning acting and what all else, then sure, you will be disappointed.

Camerawork is really good. No shaky nonsense crap. Each shot and scene were a pleasure to experience, to watch and enjoy. Most don't care or notice as they get used to watching blurs on screen and it's great for a change to see a movie where you can pixel watch every scene . Halo show is an example of the worst camerawork created due to poor directing and camerwork where it's 1/10. This show is 10/10 as even at 24p, you can still see the details!2. Solid directing on every level.3. Very strong acting. Many of us know the actress and she has a bright future as she was captivating the minds of many for a few years now. More hair suits her better ;)4. Good fairy tale-type story that was very well done. The script was very good and it carried the movie without any issues. Scripts often can break a movie and I am glad to see they took a story that wasn't that unique overall, then they made it unique, made it the way it was never done before.At present, the movie is highly underrated. Lots of haters didn't like the fact the lead characters is a female so they've been down voting it.. It's unfortunate we still have petty folks who can't just enjoy a movie without either trashing it due to their own insecurities, racist or other views.9.3/10 I can see myself rewatching it sometime in the future again.","35 out of 90 found this helpful.

I truly wish they would make far more movies like this. Reminds me of the great 1960's oldie movie called ""the wonderful world of the brothers Grimm"". And how they searched far and wide to get the ""lost"" stories and get them in a book. This story is well told and fits right into that genre. It has excellent characters and acting and the dragon effects are stunning and unique and not like any other dragon I've yet seen in any other movie. The story unfolds with a promise and them flows into a great deception, you figure out what that is. It's all about ""telling the truth"" and how a lie can be very very dangerous. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and was riveted to the screen the entire time and was reminded a little of ""Daenerys"" from ""Game of Thrones"" and how she had command of her great dragon. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. Nothing questionable, no nudity or any foul language, some blood and a little gore. Ok for the kiddos.

Millie is excellent at action, I believed everything she was going through.Angela Bassett was also great as the stepmother. Other characters were fine, they weren't fleshed out very well, but they weren't the focus, and they still give you enough to know what kind of person they are and what motivates them.The effects were also very good, the dragon and the flames were very realistic. And the scenery was gorgeous! As well as the costumes. Beautifully shot movie. The sets all looked fantastic and realistic, and fit the mood and vibe of the movie perfectly.

There was a ton of CGI in it, but it was not the movie.Millie Bobbie Brown, an actress I first noticed in a sci-fi show ten years ago called Intruders. She was the only reason to watch it, I predicted then would be a great star, stars in this. She is the lone actor in at least two thirds of the movie and carries it fantastically.If you want to see a movie with great action and adventure along with acting, plot, and story, this is it.I hope this wins many awards next year.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

I just wished we had more after win scenes.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Not the most over complicated story line but that made it even better. The tenacity and will to survive! The kindness to find way to forgive and let the pain heal! Truly able to see what women are capable of if we believe in ourselves. The strength and determination to move forward even through the pain. Millie Bobby Brown did a wonderful job! Her character was in pain and struggling, it wasn't easy but she pushed forward. Just love it! Just wonderful and would watch it many times!","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The plot reminded me of an episode of the Original Star Trek (actually, a few episodes).And there are other scenes that will bring a little deja vu from other movies and shows you may have seen over the years.Give it a few minutes.

I like the way something earlier in the movie does not seem important and near the end of the movie it's a vital item. I won't say what it is you need to watch it all the way through. Every time you think you know what will happen next it doesn't and something more amazing happens instead. The last 20 minutes of the movie is worth waiting for its unexpected ending. Millie Bobby Brown starts the film as your average fairytale princess but by the end of the film she has turned into a Zena Warrior Princess like character. Maybe not suitable for very young children but older kids will love it. Don't miss your chance to see it on Netflix.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The special effects were pretty good. The dialogue was nice, a bit choppy though. The pacing was great, I was engaged and not bored at all throughout this movie. However, I will say it was quite predictable. I guessed every single plot twist in here. Not very original, but it still was fun to watch. I didn't really like the ending, it was a bit...unsatisfying and predictable. Towards the end, it was a bit slow, but I didn't really mind it. Damsel had a lot of potential, but it fell short a bit. Definitely not the most original movie, but I think Damsel is still a fun and adventurous movie anyone could enjoy if you're fine with a pretty predictable film.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

There's just something so nice about seeing a story being told you haven't already seen before. It feels fresh and exciting, no matter what the plot actually is. And don't get me wrong, I love a good remake, but I also really appreciate it when a new story gets told.All in all, this movie seemed to combine the vibes of a classical fairy tale with heavy doses of the adventure, fantasy and horror genre, while also adding a modern, feminist twist.

That first cave scene had me feeling trapped and ready to run but wanting desperately to see what thing lived inside. Couldn't imagine how they would pick up centuries later but they somehow did. After the initial scene, the pace slowed quite a bit but eventually picked back up. Angela brought the drama like only Angela can but I wish she had bigger parts. Also, it's not too clear why she was sent to marry given all the time they had to explain it. Still a good watch.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

The soundtrack, VFX, and writing were all top tier. Millie Bobbie Brown did a fantastic job as the lead actress, especially given that it was, for the most part, a solo movie. How this movie received such bad critic reviews simply serves to prove that the ""professional critics"" do not know what the people like to watch. It was filled with suspense, despite some parts being readable a little in advance. Not to discredit the faults that some people have found, as many of those are to personal taste, but they have taken some plot points that can come across as overused and made them into what is, in my opinion, one of the earliest cinematic masterpieces of 2024.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was never going to sell well in today's modern box office. 20 years ago it would have been a 350 million dollar film just in the USA but steaming changed everything. People don't go to the box office just to be entertained anymore. They need an event to get them off the couch and this was not an event film. It was however entertaining in a way you rarely see these days because Hollywood won't take the risk on just entertaining with the budget this film obviously had.If you like fantasy you'll love this. It hits all the marks for a 2 hour movie. Exactly the right amount of time spent on backstory character development and the action. To often today 80% of the movie is backstory and character development leaving the plot to be compressed into the last 20 minutes. Blame GOT. Movie producers now think they need to make this show into ever fantasy movie they make. It's impossible. It would have ruined Damsel. But thankfully someone in charge saw that and made the movie that needed to happen. A star studded cast mostly wasted on a story line that mediocre but good enough to keep you interested. A plot that has holes. Action that can feel a bit forced. Actors that defintely feel forced. And all of it blended together perfectly to make a movie you can just enjoy.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

There was tension and intrigue throughout the story and I enjoyed routing for the main character and let's just say, the villains get what's coming to them, which was very satisfying.The visuals are stunning, both the scene setting and the wardrobe - the artists and stylists did a really good job.I would recommend giving this a watch, it is a brilliantly done film and an absolute 10/10.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

I believe the choice of actors was well thought out as well as the voice of the dragon.Damsel isn't without its flaws but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and would absolutely watch it again.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I always love seeing Robin Wright and Angela Bassett, Millie was also great. But the real standout is the Dragon, voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo who's voice I just adore.The visuals in the movie are stellar and what they are able to accomplish with just Millie on screen is fantastic. I do wish the backstory had been better fleshed out and I think they should have done more with the prince. I have read that the book does a better job with both.This is definitely a B movie but it's a good time and people should watch it in that vein. It's a fun movie with a nice ending.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I believe it truly shows how strong and determined a woman can be when she puts her mind to it and truly embarks on a journey it may seem impossible to do alone. I did believe that this movie was a tad over foreshadowing and the trailer giving away most of the plot, giving not much to the imagination. It was repetitive at times and I believe there was over acting (as one would do for theatrical play) to show the emotion; It reminded me about the end of sleeping beauty but changed to a different time and character arc, but overall I would give this movie a 8/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So even if you dislike this movie, there is enough going on for 5 stars. If you need arthouse, mega intelligent cinema with twists that noone is aware of ahead of the time, don't watch a mainstream production with the hot shooting star (""hot"" as in ""agent has a lot of work reading all those scripts).But this one is not bad, it is cool and intersting.

No, it is not, but if you want a nice family event in front of the TV, it is by far good enough.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This one somehow went straight to Netflix and bypassed theaters, but now that I've seen it, it doesn't matter because it exceeded any expectations I could've had. The words that immediately came to mind at the end were, ""that was bad ass!"" There's not many movies to say that about these days.The story is a breath of fresh air in the fact that it is an original plot, for once. It takes bits and pieces of classic favorite elements and brings them together but it doesn't ""copy"" anything. The movie makes one heck of a statement and makes it tastefully. The acting is top shelf, MBB gives an amazing performance where you just want to root for her. All of the characters are likable and the scenes are beautiful. The music by Fleming and Zimmer is flawless, creating a deeper level of atmosphere and meaning in every scene. The movie gives off mysterious nostalgic vibes in many areas that take you back to the magic of watching a movie as a kid again.Don't pay attention to any bad ratings or the critics... watch it for yourself and see what you think. For me, it was an awesome surprise and an extremely fun ride, and the ultimate (badass) anti-fairytale.

Millie Bobby Brown I have always found an amazing actress in everything she does, but in this? She kicks ass and takes names.

I'll go on a limb and say, ""Nope."" It's not that her acting was bad, it was just good.While I've been waiting for it to hit since I saw first trailer and wondered why Stranger Things was taking such a weird angle of El v Vecna, it was everything I hoped it would be. A great popcorn movie I could kickback and enjoy. The story, the action, the visuals all met what I want in this type of moment: a good time. Were there plot points I figured out quickly? Sure. There were also nice dips and dives that made me wonder how things would wrap up ... which they did and didn't play out the way I thought. Which is a good thing. Which is why I like this movie.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Not the best i have seen but with the emotion, action, adventure, and revenge points it was great to watch with wanting more. Anyone can find the negatives in a movie, but for the limited amount of run time for a movie... good job.Evidently this is too short of a review, so... let's mention the emotional impact. Happiness, sorrow, fear, etc... All the elements of an epic theatrical adventure. Cheering for the main character and hoping for the best, Millie's character used her own inner strength to fight and stay alive. With the element of forgiveness and hope in the midst of doom she using that to help her persevere.Nuff said.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

First, I don't look at directors/producers/cinema critics artsy stuff. I want a movie with a sound plot, good acting (which makes it believable), good special effects, good costuming and a beautiful setting. If a horrendous movie is a 0, then an ok movie would be three, average 5, good a 7 & 10 amazing.Actually, I might have rated it a little low! The plot was good. There were no holes & it made perfect sense. Costuming was beautiful. The landscape was absolutely breathtaking. The acting was great. There wasn't any bad acting. I don't know what another reviewer was talking about the y King being ""ok"". I think all he did was nod his head once. I don't remember any lines now.The special effects were really good. I didn't notice any size difference in the dragon. Of course it would look smaller or larger according to the size differences in the caverns.All in all, it was a really good movie. Highly recommended.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The moral of this movie is that woman are strong and independent, we are smart and elegant. Elodie starts the movie by saying this is not a movie where damsel in distress (woman in dager) is saved by a prince. Through this movie we get to understand that quote, the prince is a total wuss and the innocent ""princesses"" are smart and saves themself. Not only was Elodie a smart woman, but all the woman before her.

All actors and actresses did an excellent job in portraying their character however Milly had to cover a moltitude of different emotions and feelings for most of the film. For example, when she was lost and scared, she looked lost and scared; when terrified, she looked incredibly terrified; when outraged she looked ready to kill just by her own glance. Her skill in portraying emotions is outstanding given the fact that she was the only human and couldn't utter a single word to express herself. The story is quite original, actually perfect for a computer or PlayStation game. Throughout the entire movie, the only time when I raised my eyebrows was for the CGI effect when in a couple of occasions the fire and the dragon looked totally fake they almost reminded me of the first original Japanese Godzilla's movies.

A real twist. The acting was 99% I found Millie Bobby Brown to be an excellent actress for the part. She was the most lovable in my opinion. But as in real life there are faults to us all. As well as in this movie. I found the characters to all have the moral dilemmas of their own. Which made for excellent pay off when resolved.I think whoever rates a movie like this a 1 star has an alt motive. My parents and friends all liked it and rated it an 8 at least. We are very picky as well. It does drag on in the middle where she is in the cave. But for me, it redeemed itself closer to the end. This was where you don't want to miss the details. I love how everything unfolded naturally and they used a lot of ""show don't tell"" so if you're a fan of this style where a main character is a selfless heroine you'll enjoy this movie.People who rated this 1 star are people who probably would rate it 10 if it was a male lead. Like I'm sorry but why does this being a strong woman lead make this left? Don't bring politics into my movies boys. I give the 1 star ratings one star. They just political. Why can't we enjoy movies anymore without politics! Millie Bobby Brown is an excellent actress for her age too!! She was only 18 or 19 when this was filmed. So good! Anyways, I hope you get to enjoy the movie and have an amazing day or week!

Yes, very much so. But, if you love fantasy with an awesome dragon, it is worth the watch.If you want R content like GoT go elsewhere. This is an action fantasy w/ a Damsel, trying to survive. Hence the title Damsel. If you have never been around or believe there are women who can do things even many men can't; this is not for you. I, however, have seen these women while in the military. If that hurts your man card, don't watch this. If you just want to see a decent fantasy movie, one with an awesome dragon and a Damsel without the Prince, whatever,,l it kept my attention. This while in chronic pain, it helped me be preoccupied and lesson a bad day pain.I believe so many movies with a damsel, that can fight and or survive, is almost always going to get worse critical reviews than one with a guy(s) in it. It is a fantasy movie, that is PG13. It doesn't have any sex, nudity, and such. Mostly violence from a dragon. If that is not what you are looking for go watch GoT.

Just remember how many on-screen stories we have seen in previous decades which invert the common tropes of fairy tales: Into the Woods, Shrek, Maleficent, and many, many others.The parallels with The Game of Thrones are also banal but inevitable. Elodie comes from the North where the living conditions are extremely harsh. The winter is coming... or, rather, the winter was always there, probably that is why the daughters of the North are every moment ready to become maiden warriors. Naïve and excited Sansa comes to the Southern lands, to be fooled and betrayed by her Joffrey. Then, Millie Bobby Brown ardently cosplays Arya Stark. At last, she gets an ending which, as many think, Daenerys should have gotten. The idea itself is not bad, but the plot feels too rushed, so there is not too much place for character development.But the biggest problem with Damsel is probably one message, which is disturbing, at the very least. Elodie presents herself as innocent because she doesn't really belong to the family which wronged the dragon. But would the princesses from that very family be guilty, would it be right for the dragon to sadistically torment and kill them? It is like something from the Old Testament: ""or, some your grand-grand-grandfather committed a crime, so you must die in an especially perverse and horrifying way"". Again, such reasoning would be no problem in a world alike to that of The Game of Thrones, but Damsel is too conventional for it, and should better have a conventional moral.In effect, this hybrid of very dark fantasy elements and family-friendly moments is not something epochal and doesn't match such witty, inventive and timeless classics with dragons as Dragonheart or Shrek. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and gets some things right. Damsel overcomes the trope of an evil stepmother, it doesn't have something as cliché as a romance with the dragon as one of the participants, and sisterly love provides some touching scenes.Even if Damsel is not too original as a fantasy story, it can be good as a grim metaphor of a young girl suddenly finding out that her prince is not the person she thought him to be. A personification of teenager fears before starting an intimate relationship. A cautionary tale against judging a person or a place by their looks, however gorgeous they may be. It is also very important.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

""This is the magical 'SOMETHING' of 'SOMETHING' (or 'SOMEONE') in order to apparently give it (item? Sword? Canyons? Swamp?) more importance.For eg; ""This is The Sword of Layman"" OR ""The Canyons of Gi-ord"" OR ""The Sandwich of the Almighty Subway!""
My Goodness.. Give it a rest.. & let me watch ""The TV of Andrew !!""
DAMSEL is not like this at all.It's has an awesome twist to this genre.Worth every second.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

Ever.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9676272/?ref_=tt_urv","e-sandoval20325","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45146808/?ref_=tt_urv","13 March 2024","It's a metaphor for life!! I won't spoil it, but my god this is an excellent film. A real tribute to those going through difficult times. You can see the temptation to give up, but the ultimate reason why you never should.If you like period dramas but are keen to see a woman kick arse, this is for you. Keep going through the beginning - it will absolutely lull you into a false sense of security.I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I was actually shouting at Elodie telling her what to do - don't think I've been this involved with a film for a long time. I honestly cannot recommend enough. My only criticism - I wish it was a series so I could have had more of it.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

I mean let's face it she could war a shoe on her head for the entire duration of the film and you'd still like it. So if you're a fan then you gonna like it.For everyone else I am sorry to disappoint you but the movie is not great. Brown's performance is poor, the plot is lame, and the movie is largely garbage. The lead acctress pioneers an entirely new type of strong female role: the cute giggly girl with a hidden fire that bruns brighter than a Dragon's fire. And the entire movie she shoes her inner fire by hiding behind rocks.Rating: landfill.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
