"7","/10","This Circle is not quite golden, but it doesn't collapse","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3811673/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","22 September 2017","Having really liked/love Matthew Vaughn's previous work, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was one of my favourites from him and was surprisingly brilliant, with only the somewhat tasteless ending disappointing. The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.Like some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.Especially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.As enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.However, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.Action-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.Regarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.One has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.In conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","91 out of 124 found this helpful.

This standoffish move is meant to further separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', yet it only successfully provides both categories with a much worse experience. While I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or at least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't want a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered the weakest aspects of that piece - elements which were only mitigated by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of its subtle yet witty satire and its surprisingly well-developed characters. These pieces of the puzzle are now missing. Though this picture is, at times, passively entertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers 'save the world' plot and a string of odd action set-pieces seemingly incompetently put together. There's abhorrent use of rampant speed ramping that makes things literally look like someone hit the fast-forward button, and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them look like cheap cartoons. In his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn disappointingly squanders all of the good will he had built with his predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on, wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters instead of working with the better characters already expertly established at the end of the prior title. He also reintroduces a previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning franchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain its relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood.After revisiting this recently, I can safely say that it's far more fun than I originally gave it credit for. Perhaps it's because my expectations were on the floor, but I really enjoyed the film this time around. Its narrative issues are still present but somehow far less bothersome, while its action is actually really well-achieved for the most part. It leans into its ridiculousness and knows exactly what it is. It's actually a lot of fun. I guess I have to eat the words of my original review (which I'll leave above for posterity's sake), but I gladly will; after all, who doesn't want to enjoy a movie? 7/10.","190 out of 300 found this helpful.

Action, humour and special effects are all in abundance and visually it's very impressive. The plot is decent, especially for a sequel, but it never quite reaches the same level as the first film. The British/American theme works well though and there are some very funny cultural jokes and references.As someone who loved the first 'Kingsman', I'm pleased that the sequel didn't disappoint. It remains true to everything that made the first film such a success, including taking some big risks and thinking out of the box. The end result is an imperfect and at times messy film, but a rewarding and highly entertaining one nonetheless. 'The Golden Circle' is much better than expected but just not quite on the same level as the first film.","216 out of 370 found this helpful.

Taron Egerton stars as ""Eggsy"" aka Agent Galahad of the Kingsman Secret Service, a clandestine British intelligence group. After the Kingsman organization is decimated by a surprise attack, Eggsy and tech wiz Merlin (Mark Strong) head to the US to connect with the Statesman group, their American counterparts. Together they must find and defeat the Golden Circle, an international drug cartel headed by the chipper Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore).While not rising to the high-spirited, manic fun of the first film, this is still worth a look for fans of fast-paced, comedic action films that don't take themselves seriously in the least. In many ways the plot and the villains are a rehash of the prior film, and while the Statesman characters have possibilities, they aren't fleshed out enough. The return of one character that very clearly died in the first film is something I won't go into, although the advertising made no attempt to hide his return. Elton John, as himself, has fun with his role as the unwilling prisoner of Moore's drug lord who's forced to perform his greatest hits on command. This film's centerpiece action sequence, set to John's ""Saturday's Alright for Fighting"", is well done, but fails to match the first film's Lynyrd Skynyrd ""Free Bird"" bloodbath.","9 out of 11 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Enjoyable, but lost the charm of the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3812708/?ref_=tt_urv","Darryl_Lazakar01","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62055502/?ref_=tt_urv","23 September 2017","Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the surprise hit of 2015. It's unexpectedly good, with great humor, acting, action, and chemistry with other actors. So when director Matthew Vaughn decides to do a follow-up, I was pretty excited to see Eggsy and co. kicking ass once again. Being dubbed as a ""proper"" spy movie, the movie has since build a lot of excitement, but does it lived up to the hype?The answer, is a simple no.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is indeed enjoyable, but it has plenty of flaws that makes the movie fail to deliver it's promise as a ""proper"" spy movie.To start, everyone did very well in delivering their roles. Taron Egerton once again stole women's hearts as the likable Eggsy. Colin Firth returns as Harry Hart and his reintroduction is actually made sense imo, and he did a great job portraying him. Mark Strong did a great job as Merlin. Hally Berry, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal also did a great job, though I'll admit that Channing Tatum's character is just a simple plot device. Julianne Moore as Poppy, though not menacing, also did a very good job. The biggest surprise is Elton John. He's the ""Joker"" in the movie, and he did very well.The action scenes were over-the-top, sometimes idiotic, but very enjoyable, though this brings to one of my cons. The cinematography is fantastic it's very well shot, though the action scenes has plenty of angle cuts, and the editing was also great.But, as stated before, the flaws in the movie makes the movie fail to meet our expectations. Most of this is because the terrible marketing campaign, that reveals some of the twists and turns of the movie that should have worked (even Matthew Vaughn agrees). The CGI is mostly used to blend several cuts into seemingly one single shot, and despite it actually worked in the first movie, it failed here because the transition is so noticeable. The action scenes were also over- stylized, featuring more slow-fast- zoom camera-work that again, worked on the first, but failed here because it's overused. There's also a sex scene that I felt out of place, and it's most likely brings a lot of controversy. A character (nope, not Tatum's) in this movie is also very bad in terms of her character because it serves nothing but motivation for Eggsy to save the world again, and the worst part, is that this character is not even a important character in the first movie, but she has more screen time than some of the main characters from the first movie and even the new characters as well.(SPOILER ALERT. not really, but if you think it was, there you go) Also, the movie takes a unnecessary and questionable move by killing not one, but TWO main characters from the first movie (three, if you include another memorable thing from the first movie), in which one felt very unnecessary, and the other felt like the character has to die.Overall, the movie is entertaining, indeed. But the movie lost it's charm, and just nowhere near as good as the first one. For casual moviegoers, this is an enjoyable movie, but for a Kingsman fan like me, it's disappointing.Final Score: 7/10","34 out of 58 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A solid follow-up to the 2015 film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3810914/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","21 September 2017","Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the sequel to the 2015 film Kingsman: The Secret Service. Once again directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, X-Men First Class), it is a solid sequel that contains just as much enjoyment and humour as its predecessor.One year after the events of the first film, the Kingsman's spy headquarters is fatally attacked by an unknown entity. With most of the organisation now dead, the surviving agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and his trainer Merlin (Mark Strong) travel abroad to team up with Statesman, their American counterparts, in an effort to bring this mysterious new enemy to justice and save the world once again.Featuring the same ridiculously over-the-top action and unique British charm, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a worthy follow-up to the 2015 film. Matthew Vaughn's slick, fast- paced direction showcases his talent for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and quirky comic relief, which few other directors would be able to replicate successfully. I am hopeful that he returns to direct the third installment. However, similar to Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2, the film does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the original, plus its runtime of 141 minutes does make it drag at times. The cast of characters, both new and old, lend themselves to some highly entertaining situations, including a hilarious performance from Elton John playing a fictionalised version of himself. The real stand-out, though, was Julianne Moore as the film's villain. It's so rare to see her play such an evil character so effectively and so much fun to watch, considering her reputation for usually playing likable roles.I rate it 8/10","105 out of 201 found this helpful.

It knew when to be serious and when to be so serious it was funny. That, combined with some excellent cinematography, made The Secret Service a thoroughly enjoyable film.The Golden Circle has all of these things as well, but while still fun it just comes off feeling like a lesser imitation of the original.Which is where the second count of familiarity comes in: 2017 had another one of these sequels repeat the same formula with lesser results, namely Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Curiously, both original films (Kingsman: The Secret Service and Guardians of the Galaxy) premiered in 2014 with both sequels coming out this year.Now, that's not to say that Guardians Vol. 2 wasn't fun, and The Golden Circle has plenty of fun as well.The film finds the Kingsman on the receiving end of a ruthless Julianne Moore as Poppy, a leader of a drug cartel who wants all drugs to be legalized. Her leverage: her drugs will kill all of its users, of which there are hundreds of millions worldwide. With the Kingsmen's UK resources destroyed, it's up to Taron Egerton's Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin to team up with the Statesmen, the US intelligence service featuring Jeff Bridges's Champ, Channing Tatum's Tequila, and Halle Berry's Ginger Ale.There are fast-paced, well-shot action scenes throughout, as with the original Kingsman, the standout being the taxi chase at the beginning. The dialogue is fun, but it hits a few sour notes along the way, especially in its parodying of a certain political figure which comes off as ham-fisted and forced.The pacing of this film is a problem. At 2 hours 21 minutes, it definitely feels too long, especially when there are one too many big set pieces that feel like they should be the stage for the finale but end up being not.Finally, there's a right way and a wrong way to do callbacks to the previous film in a sequel. It's OK to be overt, as long as it's balanced with other, more subtle references as well. Unfortunately, The Golden Circle tends to pound you over the head with callbacks, including literally splicing in footage from the first film in reference to characters who are supposed to be important, but for the life of me you can't possibly remember where they popped up in the first film unless you watch it right before seeing this one.Overall, I would say that there is nothing truly objectionable about this film (although throwing in lots of F-Bombs doesn't automatically equal comedy), but this film may just serve as a reminder of a much more solid film that came before it rather than standing on its own merits.","65 out of 123 found this helpful.

I really loved the first film. It was unique, original, and just damn fun. Matthew Vaughn really has that knack. I went in with great expectations for the sequel and walked out really liking it, though I didn't love it.From a technical standpoint this film looks amazing. Matthew Vaughn can craft great action sequences and film them with a hand-held camera where everything remains in plain sight. His special effects and visual effects teams are spot on in handling such scenes, and the set design is also really cool, especially the headquarters for the Statesman. The acting is also really good. Colin Firth, Taron Edgerton, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, and even Halle Berry who I don't even like as an actress turn in really good performances. You can tell they are all having fun with their roles which they should because it's a ridiculous action movie, and I think that really let some of the weaker links like Berry to shine. Julianne Moore is also an actress I don't like, and I did think she was overselling her performance a bit. My problem with the movie has nothing to do with the technical aspects like direction, camera work, acting, editing, or visual effects. What it really boils down to is the writing and how some story elements are handled.For instance, it feels like this film is trying way to hard to harken back to what made the original so great without coming up with any fresh ideas of its own. This movie takes everything everyone loved about the first one, puts it in this movie, and makes it bigger by trying to be better. Yeah, it is bigger...but bigger does mean better. An example of this is towards the end of the film when there is an action scene that is trying to replicate the church scene from the first one, except the scale of the action scene in this one is bigger. There were a lot of scenes like that in here and I don't think Vaughn really thought of how to make things better while still being bigger. The villain was also kind of a drag. It was just Samuel L Jackson from the first one, but instead of him it's Julianne Moore. Her overall plan just comes across as ranging from silly and ridiculous to pretentious and overstuffed. That's where the film really falters and at times it does have some pacing issues especially towards the second act. There's some stuff with Elton John that both works and doesn't work, and that switches up the pacing at times.Like I said, there is nothing wrong technically with this movie. I just think it needed some rewrites particularly with its villain and its story.Overall I am going to give ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" a B.

It was full of action, fun, jokes and the actors did a great job. I came into this movie theater hoping to delight myself with a sequel that would at least match the first installment. As soon as the first scene came on the screen, I knew I had been fooled and it would end up being some of the most dreadful 2 hours in my movies watching history! I was right. This movie might have some actions but every moment is ""telephoned"" long in advance. The story is absolutely stupid. I wish it would be possible to request a full refund when a movie is that bad and that each refund is counted towards its overall success/failure. It is not fair that people are getting paid with my money receiving millions of dollars for such a poor performance. The day this option becomes possible we might finally see some serious work being done in the movie industry!","239 out of 371 found this helpful.

A movie about a chav piece of trash becoming a secret agent? Riiiiight.Yet somehow, someway it worked. From it's fantastic supporting cast including Colin Firth and the excellent Mark Strong to the script to the hyper energetic over the top action sequences.I almost hated myself for enjoying it so much and going into The Golden Circle I kind of hoped it would fail, instead it excelled and even beat it's predecessor.With the same cast plus the additions of Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry and the entirely awful Channing Tatum the movie knocks it out of the park once again with the same formula (Now with 50% less chaviness).Our hero now takes on the evil drug baroness Julianne Moore and features lots of cameos including Elton John and Keith Allen. Robot dogs, laser lassos, killer dance drugs, all the same level of over the top'ness remain and it all works so very well.I don't want to like this franchise, I shake my fist in the air and curse to give it such a high rating again but Kingsman is pure gold.The Good:Great cast (Not you Tatum)Well writtenGreat action sequencesThe Bad:Channing TatumStill chavvy Things I Learnt From This Movie:Elton John needs to stick to singingHeadshots are easily fixed with clingfilm","29 out of 55 found this helpful.

The fights are really cool, very choreographed to the point of getting me amazed by what I see in the screen. It's got many big names too, and even Elton John who provides much comic relief.

Things start out with a bang with a thrilling car chase and there are sporadically scattered action scenes throughout but those expecting a finale as eye popping as the first film or even a scene that matches it with famous church fight from the original will be left disappointed.It's possible we were just spoilt by Vaughan's first foray into the Kingsman universe as the ability for the film to remove itself from reality yet remain grounded around robot dogs and dancing drug addled victims with glaring blue veins is quiet the feat, while Vaughan's handiwork when the action kicks up is second-to-none, and even though the film could've chopped a further 30 minutes in the editing suite, it's hard not to enjoy a frenetic finale in a bizarre 50's Americana setting while seeing renowned actors like Julianne Moore having such fun with their roles makes sure Golden Circle is always a cut-above even when its flirting the line of losing itself within its self-created whirlpool of colour and insanity.Final Say – Ticking all the Kingsman boxes that fans of the original will be seeking to check off, The Golden Circle may not provide on the same level of the first film but anyone that loved Eggsy's debut in the high body count adventure will enjoy this new trip, while those that weren't fans should stay very far away from this freshly minted exercise in the hyper-real and super energized spy caper.3 freshly cooked burgers out of 5","22 out of 43 found this helpful.

I enjoy his movies, but I think some constraint would help this movie feel more impact-full. Because there's a lot of emotional elements in the plot who don't really hit home due to the tones jumping around. ""The Secret Service"" was a fun movie that poked fun and celebrated the spy genre. However, the sequel may have crossed the line of jumping into the comic book zone in some aspects. It makes me wish Vaughn would make ""Kick-Ass 3"", but I guess you can see this as the replacement. He's got his fingerprints all over it when it comes to the wide-lens cinematography, the yellow color palettes, quirky characters, extremely over-the-top action and of course shocking moments, which will probably have people complain that; ""everything was fine up until that scene happened!"" If you like those elements then I'm sure you will have a good time with ""The Golden Circle"". I can't decide if I really like it or just think it's OK. I'm sort of in the middle. The entertainment value can't be denied, so that counts for something though.The stakes are high when it comes to the story. The characters find themselves in desperate low points, which in my opinion would have called for some scaling down on the craziness. It's fun when it needs to be, but I think I would have cared more if they sometimes took it seriously. The action scenes are a blast. The coordination and creativity is fantastic. It's just that each one of them is set to the backdrop of some song, so it makes it look like a music video. It doesn't work for every big action sequence. Especially when the moment leading up to it hasn't kept to that fun vibe. I would prefer that when the action hits you'd be more invested and perhaps even fearful of the lives of our characters. I didn't feel a single punch because it's all seamless and flows by like it's nothing. Sometimes it works if the scene calls for it. But, if you have people on the verge of dying with time running out (and these are people with emotional connections to the main characters), then you should feel the danger and the intensity of the situation. Instead you switch to the ""fun entertaining mode"" and what could have been a dramatic tension-filled scene transforms into a ridiculous video game. Again, I think some restraint would have helped the movie. I enjoy those extravagant moments a lot, but there was some potential that was lost. The part at the Italian ski resort was the one I liked the most. Just because it was one of the few scenes that actually had some tension to the action.The cast is excellent, Henry Jackman's score is great, the transitions from scene to scene were top notch. The movie kept my interest for the most time. There are moments where it borderlines on being a step too far, but it usually snatches back before it gets out of control. The Statesmen were nice and I would have liked to spend more time with them. I did hear that an earlier cut of the movie was 3 hours (!). I'm curious to what was deleted, but I'm sure a lot of it is more time spent developing the team-up between the Kingsmen and the Statesmen. The father and son bond between Eggsy and Harry is still the heart of the series. I'm glad they found a way for that story to continue. You overall get to see more range from the main cast, which was a nice surprise. I had some issues with the experience and there are for sure many things that will shock or irritate the audience. If you shut your brain off and forget some logic you will enjoy the roller coaster. It's a ride that never drags, so be in the right mindset if you decide to check it out.","18 out of 36 found this helpful.

And the sequel is more of the same: why mess with a crowd- pleasing formula?The fledgling agent Eggsy (Taron Egerton (""Eddie the Eagle""), curiously called ""Eggy"" at various points in the film for reasons I didn't understand) is now the new ""Galahad"" following the demise in the first film of the original, played by Colin Firth (""Magic in the Moonlight"", ""Bridget Jones' Baby""). But just as he's getting into his stride the whole Kingsman organisation, now headed by Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") as Arthur , is ripped apart by an evil drugs cartel called ""The Golden Circle"" headed by smiling but deadly Poppy (Juliane Moore, ""Still Alice"").Eggsy and Lancelot (Mark Strong, ""Miss Sloane"") in desperation turn to Statesman – the US equivalent organisation – and together with some surprising allies set out to defeat the evil plot to poison all casual drug users.Subtle this film certainly is not, featuring brash and absurdly unrealistic action scenes that are 90% CGI but – for me at least – enormous fun to watch. As with the first film (and I'm thinking of the grotesquely violent church scene here) the action moves however from 'edgy' to over-the-top/offensive at times. The 'burger scene' and (particularly) the 'Glastonbury incident' are the standout moments for all the wrong reasons. You can only hope a stunt vagina was used for this scene, else Poppy Delavigne (older sister of Cara) is going to find it very hard to find credible future work. One can only guess what tasteful interlude is being planned for Kingsman 3 – – a prostate- based tracker perhaps?The film works best when the core team of Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and Colin Firth (yes, Colin Firth!) are together. Jeff Bridges (""Hell or High Water""), Channing Tatum (""Foxcatcher"") and Halle Berry (""Monster's Ball"") all turn up as key members of 'Statesman' – adding star power but not a lot else – together with Pedro Pascal (""The Great Wall"") as 'Whiskey', who I expected to be someone equally famous behind the moustache but wasn't!There's also a very entertaining cameo from a star (no spoilers from me) whose foul-mouthed tirades I found very funny, and who also has the funniest line in the film (playing off one of the most controversial elements of the first film). It's fair to say though that others I've spoken to didn't think this appearance fitted the film at all. Julianne Moore makes for an entertaining – if less than credible – villain, as does Bruce Greenwood (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") as a barely disguised Trump. None of the motivations of the bad 'uns however support any scrutiny whatsoever: this is very much a ""park your brain at the door"" film.I really shouldn't enjoy this crass, brash, brainless movie fast-food and I know many have hated it! But my guilty secret is that I really did like it – one of the best nights of unadulterated escapist fun I've had since ""Baby Driver"". Classy it's certainly NOT, but I enjoyed this just as much as the original.(For the full and graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

The chapter one of this movie is amazing, as well as this chapter two. The differences are the actors, the actions, and the plots. At the sequel, there are at least three great actors being played: Julianne Moore, Hally Barry, and wowwww, Elton John, ladies and gentleman, Elton John!! Based on my feeling, the budget of filming these sequel movie is really expensive because Elton John appears not just once as cameo, but few times, even he is part of solution of the plots. Big applause for Elton, yeah love you!! The actions in this sequel are quite unpredictable, we never know what happens, who kills, who is being killed, who betrays, and who is being betrayed. Everything uncovers until the end of the plot, so don't worry you can still enjoy all the actions in the movie with popcorn on your hands, without being confused. There are also new machines, new technologies, and new guns that are more modern and more impressive that make you want to be a Kingsman in your real life. The equipment is so cool, like those presented on the Spy Museum in Berlin. Some surprises will come, but you will know what the ""Golden Circle"" means. Then, last but not the least that I want to review, is the plots. While in the chapter one, Kingsman is trying to change an ordinary bullied boy to be a handsome gentleman of Kingsman team and everything seems right after, these sequel offers the problems from the beginning until the end and everything seems complicated. Some critics will say that the plot is quite ordinary, about the hero and the villain, but more than that, Kingsman: Golden Circle is about honesty, loyalty, and intelligence between the state, intelligence team, and boy/girlfriends. This is a recommended movie to be watched with the one you love and how you make it proportional between all of those factors, because manners maketh man, and this time is with Elton John :)","43 out of 86 found this helpful.

From the opening car chase, to the ridiculous robot dogs, to the stupid cable car scene, The Golden Circle suffers from far too much unconvincing digital trickery.The film panders to the American market by introducing the US equivalent of The Kingsman, Southern secret agents The Statesman. The first film possessed a wholly British charm; this one doesn't, and suffers greatly for it.Julianne Moore. Superb actress, but totally miscast as the film's villain, drug baron Poppy.Bringing back Colin Firth as a confused lepidopterist was a really bad move. From badass to befuddled butterfly collector. Why bother?And what was the point of Halle Berry as wannabe Statesman Ginger? She is given absolutely nothing of interest to do throughout the entire film.Worst of all, we have Sir Elton John, not in a brief cameo (THAT, I might have forgiven), but in several supposedly funny scenes so utterly diabolical that they simply have to be seen to be believed.

It is a sequel that marvellously continues from the ground breaking 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. Whilst the main antagonist Poppy may not have been as symbolic as Valentine, her sidekick certainly made up for this. The fight scenes were spectacularly done, with numerous sequences that were particularly memorable and whilst none of these were as good as the famous Kentucky Church Fight Scene, all of them displayed a significant level of action, violence and of course bloodshed. Furthermore, the plot itself was fantastic, with many twists which as predictable as they may have been, did not diminish the performance in any way. On the contrary, it enhanced it to incredible standards, with brilliant performances from Taron Egerton, Colin Firth and Mark Strong. This film also produced one of the saddest moments that I have witnessed in a very long time, which made me appreciate the film even more. My only criticism would be the amount of romance in this film which I believed to be rather unnecessary. However, this was made up for by the great deal of comedy that was portrayed by both old and new characters, in levels that greatly exceeded that of the last film, making it even more enjoyable. The film turned out to not be as americanised as the trailer led me to believe, thus displaying the Kingsman characteristics which made the film so brilliant. To conclude, I must admit that this film is one of, if not the best film that has been released all year. In comparison to the first Kingsman film, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is similar in many ways, but the greater amount of comedy, action, unique characters, significant moments and plot development, makes me take the view that the sequel is indeed better than the original, a rare occasion in the film industry, but something which I must congratulate Matthew Vaughn for achieving. I certainly recommend everyone who has watched the first film to head straight to the cinema, you're in for a treat!","21 out of 39 found this helpful.

Almost all fights are CGI and even when it would have been cheaper to put a real object in place, for some reason they chose to replace it with terrible CGI.If you try to use CGI, learn from Neil Blomkamp & Oats Studios, otherwise, GIVE MY MONEY BACK.

"","","Purely An Exercise In Excess. And A Terrible One At That.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3870184/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","29 November 2017","What exactly was so special about Kingsman: The Secret Service to warrant a sequel this overlong, bloated & nonsensical? Sure, the first movie carried a fresh vibe and was amusing & entertaining to an extent but everything that contributed to its success and made it such a fun ride is lost in this follow-up chapter that's purely an exercise in excess. And a terrible one at that.Set one year after the events of the first film, Kingsman: The Golden Circle finds Eggsy teaming up with the only other surviving Kingsman agent after their headquarters is completely destroyed. As the two head out to find the ones responsible, they stumble upon an allied spy organization & a familiar face, but both agencies must work together if they are to save the world from a new threat.Co-written & directed by Matthew Vaughn (best known for Kick-Ass & X-Men: First Class), the sequel is an absolute farce from beginning to end that takes the over-the-top action of its predecessor to such levels that it becomes downright ridiculous. The new characters are awfully written & poorly integrated into the story while returning ones have nothing new to offer.Everything that was fresh & kinetic about the first movie is exaggerated to such extent that it loses its value here. The overly-stylized action itself fails to create the same level of interest and is a tad too cartoonish this time. The story revels in foolishness but crosses that line beyond which things aren't fun but a chore to sit through. And its 141 minutes runtime doesn't help the cause either, for it is severely felt.Coming to the performances, Kingsman finds Taron Edgerton, Mark Strong & Colin Firth reprising their roles while the new additions include Julianne Moore, Pedro Pascal, Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry & Elton John, and other than Strong, every one of them is terrible in their given roles. The stupidly named characters they play are not at all interesting, and it's clear that they all only signed up for easy money.On an overall scale, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is an exceptionally inferior entry in the Kingsman series and is one of the worst films of the year. A dumbed down version of the original that doesn't even remember what made its predecessor click and falls flat in nearly all filmmaking departments, Vaughn's latest is a dull, rotten & atrocious piece of work that's too full of itself, and certainly isn't worth your time & money. In a word, forgettable.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

The over the top action, the comedy and of course the (main) characters. So I was really excited for this movie. And does it live up?Yeah! It's not a masterpiece of any kind but it's a great sequel and actually how I wanted it. It has the same vibe as the original but simultaneity adds new elements to the table. Exactly how a sequel should be done! But how does it hold up to the original?Well, the characters has much more to them in this movie and it does have some emotional scenes. However I did feel the villain was kinda weak. Valetine whilst the way he talked was kinda annoying, actually had some charm. I did not feel like the new one had. Instead it's more of a over-the top villain you find in the James Bond movies. However I think it's better to have main characters with depth and a villain without instead of having the opposite. So they are pretty equal but The Golden Circle is slightly better.Overall I think it's a great movie. If you want a goofy, fun movie with great action and humor I do really recommend it. If you're going into this movie expecting a masterpiece I think you will be somewhat disappointed. But if you're just going into the movie just have some fun, I think you will!8/10","23 out of 45 found this helpful.

We engage in an aggressive business strategy, invest in the latest technology and take strict, disciplinary action. . . .Our world leaders have let us all down, so we are coming out of the shadows and taking over.""Poppy (Julianne Moore) This installment of the Kingsman spy spoof, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is absurd beyond even prevailing satires of the spy genre. It is rife with the usual outrageous car chases and equipment, no doubt homage to the much less mechanically-intricate James Bond series. Yet, something else is afoot in this delightful comedy, something that makes a message where one usually never exists, say in Jason Bourne or Bond for that matter.The odd turn of the screw is the denigration of drugs and the rapacious pharmaceutical industry. I know I have your interest, but I may not disclose too much, given that a fluffy film like this trades mostly on surface charms and enhanced CGI. Ultimately, the set pieces and wacky characters come together like a tight Savile Row suit.Poppy's mega company controls world-wide drugs and forces the president of the US to sign legislation that would legalize drugs so the pharms could expand markets. It's almost counter intuitive to our usual notion that drugs must be busted except for medicinal purposes.Along the way millions of users have been infected by Poppy's Golden Circle so that her industry can provide the antidote as soon as the president orders the legalization. Splendid that the film shows the effects of addiction, to such an extent of physical and mental breakdown that a message may go forth to the young audience about the suffering of abuse.Meanwhile Brit agents Harry (Colin Firth) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton) confront US booze company Statesman, a cover for spy work itself, and eventually both move on Poppy. Along the way are small roles by Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, and lo and behold, Elton John (You have to see him to believe him, though maybe not so much . . .).(Also, a tacky moment of placing a tracking device in a babe's underpants is just too far with the odd. Director Matthew Vaughan and writers stretched here and lost.) In a light hearted and funny satire, those cameos are welcome amid the tropes, loud music, and absurdity. The cooperation of the Brit and US agencies with one of the locations, a Bondian Swiss Alps ski resort, is a stew of laughs and gimmicks, Just as James Bond would approve.Now, successful director Matthew Vaughan should work on reducing the over two hour time. Under two does it better.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

The production values are still high but the script and story line head for the gutter as usual when they try to Americanise quality English productions. This was obviously tailored for the US market so they had to DUMB it down because as everyone know the Americans have no sense of subtly, everything has to be spelled out for most of them in Bold Face. The movie had its great stunts and some very humorous moments but stooped to unnecessary crudeness at times. At 2 hrs 21 minutes it was about 45 minutes too long.

The film combines British style with American swagger and certainly doesn't pull any punches both updating the spy genre and being a parody of it.The film begins with a brilliant and heart pounding action sequence which immediately sets the tone of the film. The action sequences are very consistent throughout the duration of the movie and with an English action director like Matthew Vaughn I would expect nothing less. Kingsman 2 is very enjoyable and is an excellent film if you just want to sit back and watch an amusing film that doesn't take itself too seriously. However, I would say that the film has been highly Americanised for a mass market. This is a positive and a negative. It is a positive as we get a lot of excellent American/Englishman banter. However, that being, said an aspect of the original film's charm is lost. The acting is in general very good with Taron Egerton returning as Eggsy, once again delivering an assured and confident performance. Old favourites also return to the cast along with a few new members each giving first-rate performances. Julianne Moore stars as a megalomaniac villain called Poppy. The character is a caricature of an archetypal villain but because of the film's light and humorous tone this doesn't matter too much as the movie is just so much fun. Overall, the film is a really entertaining and although it isn't quite as good as the original, it is still definitely a worthy sequel. Kingsman: The Golden Circle incorporates brilliant British humour which is packaged up for American audiences. I would give the film 7 out of 10.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

With this collection of images, memorable moments and Henry Jackman's original score tying all the knots together - you could say it essentially turned 007 up to 11.This perhaps bodes well for the opening of Kingsman: The Golden Circle we open with an action upon a car chase - a spectacular five minute section which thanks to the effects team pulls off all the polish, all the moves and the quick reactions from the first. Our chavvy hero Eggsy looking sharp in a Kingsman bespoke suit, he's living happily with his girlfriend (a keen well-praised return for Hanna Alström's Princess Tilde) and his adorable pug JB. Previously we had him defeating Samuel L. Jackson's evil billionaire - here he really has nowhere special to go. That is until there is a threat of destruction and he has to go to the Kingsman's American counterparts - The Statesman. There's a none surprising return for Colin Firth's Harry Hart, who's now an amnesiac who studies butterflies, and he's fitted with an eye patch which surprisingly the 57-year-old pulls off sharply. There are keen differences that manage to shine their way; one in particular is that the Kingsman's headquarters' looks like a tailor's shop with the agents' code-names coming from Arthurian Mythos - The Statesman headquarters looks like a Whiskey distillery with the agents being named after specific alcoholic drinks. Firstly there's Tequila (Tatum who after his sterling introduction is left as a second rate player), secondly we have Halle Berry's Ginger Ale (she's the computer technician for the organization), third there's Whiskey (Pascal he's essentially the organizations cowboy who comes equipped with a light-up whip and a lasso), finally last but not least there's the leader of the team Jeff Bridges' Champagne or champ for short. Then of course there's Julianne Moore's 50s obsessed drug kingpin Poppy Adams sadly like Tatum after her introductions she's left underused. These different players do their best to keep the story flowing - but sadly despite the star-studded cast the film fails to be as in-depth as the first. Previously director Matthew Vaughn wasn't afraid to take risks specifically with that show-stopping church scene, but sadly Kingsman: The Golden Circle is left softer like a cushion which ultimately leaves the blows feeling painless. Plus at 141 minutes it's longer than the first which Vaughn cleverly uses to unveil new techniques and new tech, unfortunately this takes a drastic toll on the pacing it can feel a little slow at times.Emphatically as you'd expect from Vaughn the action is fun, they shine the brightest often thanks to some of the new tools, there's a robotic arm, the aforementioned electric whip is stunning and there's a suitcase gun. That said it's an enjoyably fun espionage sequel which shines in its action, its tech and all-star cast but ultimately fails to grasp the original energy from the first.VERDICT Fun and energetic if you want more of the same action - but this espionage sequel fails to grasp the energy which is left gasping for more.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

I'm sad they chose to take the low road every opportunity they got.","12 out of 15 found this helpful.

There are overused plot from first movie. Just like Guardians of the galaxy here also So many cheap jokes and at very very wrong time. (some spoilers ahead)Starting and ending of movie is action packed and very good. Rest are crap & boring story is just OK. They used so many cheap jokes. That scene when Kingsmen's all locations destroyed and they promise each other not to cry like b**** & take revenge but then there is fun part and they start drinking beer. Feels great when action starts but same time that funny guy (singer) started fighting with bad guys. You can't do both action and cheap fun at same time. People can't focus on both things. When there is serious scene, Don't ruin it.Everyone in theater started cheering when there is similar scene from first when Harry Hart closes door teaching about respect and starts fighting but here, he fails and they made fun of him. was this necessary? Fans start expecting good actions and exactly at same time movie team adds funny part.Plot was not good. Blue rash appears. victims starts dancing. Using antidote rash disappears instantly. Butterflies flying Scenes. Really? :( All bullshit.Villain Poppy is also not live upto expectation. always keeps smiling and making fun of everyone. Doesn't feel like villain at all.All over you may enjoy it one time but won't ask for second time. Easily Forgettable. First part will be remembered for long time.","21 out of 47 found this helpful.

Sure it had its issues and mistakes, but if you go into it knowing that it might not be a good as the first film, then you'll end up having a great time. Yes the antagonist is poor, the opening exposition is rushed, and a lot of characters are just thrown into the background, but even with that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is still a pretty good time to be had. Contrary to popular belief, I really enjoy Vaughn's unique style of directing, and although some might find it immersion breaking, I think it's a great way to help differentiate the Kingsman series from other films within the genre. Egerton was great again as Eggsy, and both Strong and (surprisingly) Berry provided some great performances and character depth. Although critics might disagree with me on this one, I decided to give Kingsman: The Golden Circle a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. But with all that being said, The Golden Circle is still a sequel shadowed by its beloved predecessor. It's not a film to break the sequel curse, but it does do a pretty damn good job at trying to.Read more at theVade.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Tries very hard to recapture the magic of the original, partially succeeds","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3826998/?ref_=tt_urv","jamesclarke-30450","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80425866/?ref_=tt_urv","9 October 2017","Even though I have never reviewed the original Kingsman film, I would probably give it an 8. For me, it came from nowhere and hit hard with style, beautifully filmed action and consistently strong comedy. Understandably, this sequel (which I'll say now was fantastic for a sequel), tries to recapture what made the first film so special.This leads to my biggest problem with the film; It relies heavily on references to the first film to strengthen it. Much like A New Hope and The Force Awakens, the plot feels painfully similar. The creators advertised this in the trailers, calling back to what the first film described as being the best type of 'spy movie', with a colourful megalomaniac, exotic gadgets and that sort of thing. However, this is literally the framework used in the original.As the film reaches it's final sequence, there are more and more similarities, down to the last fight scene using a piece of music which builds similarly with the action as Free Bird did so effectively in the church from the original... But it doesn't feel like it works as well.Having said that, the film is a massive amount of fun. The comedy isn't as consistent as in the first and the use of CGI feels a bit more noticeable, especially in the impressive opening sequence, but it's a great film. The story is interesting, the 50s style of the main villain's base is attractive and the acting is as good here as it was in the previous entry. Elton John's part in this film is surprisingly prominent and so ridiculous that it becomes hilarious.To fully enjoy this, you'd need to be willing to suspend disbelief and get carried away. Also, ideally, to avoid seeing the parallels between this and the original, you would need to try and forget about it, but there's so much crossover that it's a difficult thing to do.Overall, while not as funny or as original as the first film, The Golden Circle is a strong sequel and is definitely worth a watch.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Moore was just as colorful and megalomaniac as Jackson was in the first one. I loved the goofy science of all the gadgets. So many things seemed like a playful wink at James Bond details.

"6","/10","Much less class than the first","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3846716/?ref_=tt_urv","thefilmnotebook","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81839754/?ref_=tt_urv","31 October 2017","If Kingsman: the Golden Circle managed to uphold the standard Kingsman: the Secret Service set, it would have been an above average movie. The elements presented in the Golden Circle are too familiar, and too comfortable. The Secret Service was exciting because it was inventive, and infused with the commanding presence of first class actors like Mark Strong, Colin Firth and Michael Caine, it was an elegant classic.In the Golden Circle, young Kingsman recruit Eggsy (Taron Egerton) returns, along with Merlin (Mark Strong) and Harry (Colin Firth) – his return was well known before the film's release. However, Matthew Vaughn makes the fatal mistake of replacing the characters that gave the first film its gentlemanly charm and decorum with drunken American cowboys. Although this transposition provided some degree of novelty – I was intrigued at the US version 'The Statesman', as compared to the Kingsmen, disappointment does set in when you realise they just ain't as classy – not to mention that profound waste of talent to cast Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges and Channing Tatum.I missed the iconic scenes that defined the Secret Service. There just aren't any memorable scenes in this one. Julianne Moore's Poppy Adams is quite fascinating at first – she does well embodying a dual sinister and pleasant demeanour, but once I found that she is just a loony psychopath, but loves putting people through a meat mincer, that's all that I needed to know about her. For the rest of the film, she just waits and waits, for people to get her. She also kidnaps Elton John – played by himself – who was immensely painful to watch. Why did you do this to yourself Elton?Overall, the little freshness this movie offers wears off quickly and the pleasure is momentary. Vaughn's decision to divert focus from the Kingsman to the Statesman is catastrophic for the characters, and for the story. The magical touch from the Secret Service is lost and all there is left is excessive zest and energy, which is great for loud, mindless fun, but not so good for preserving the gravitas that kept the first one grounded. But, if you love routine action with a tad too much embellishment, you might enjoy this.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

There's no complex dialog or character development, but it's a ""slap in your face"" type of comedy with one crazy thing after the other and it takes things a few steps further than the first instalment. The big hero of the film isn't Taron Egerton as Eggsy, nor is it Edward Holcroft as Charlie or Mark Strong as Merlin, or any of their American counterparts. The biggest hero - and the culprit of my almost broken ribs from laughing too hard, is Elton John himself!!! Putting one of the most flamboyant and colourful artists in a shabby track suit, cursing like a shav and giving the middle finger to the left and right - and then delivering a hilarious fight scene that would make Jackie Chan proud - that's a winner for me 7 days a week, and the reason why I'm scoring this movie the highest ever possible score - a 10! I've only ever done this once before but Kingsman: The Golden Circle deserves it for almost sending me to the hospital tonight!Matthew Vaughn did a splendid job here and he developed his skills producing and directing movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Harry Brown, Kick-Ass 1 & 2, Kingsmen: The Secret Service and Eddie the Eagle, and now he was given the task to direct this sequel which he did very well!.This is British humor at its best if you ask me and if you're after a big laugh rather than something complex and deep, this is the one for you!","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Once again easily outperforming similar effects that required special glasses only a few years ago.As for the plot, the fish out of water theme is not quite as strong as the lead has somewhat adapted to his environment. This may be part of the disappointment for fans of the first film.

This was what was happening in the first 10 minutes, until we got to the change of venue at Poppy's hang-out. We are introduced to the psychopathic opponent, Poppy, who does not flinch when one of her ""soldiers"" is committed into a meat grinder. She calmly makes a ""humanburger"" out of the hapless sub- opponent; dares her next ""soldier"" to eat the thing, while the audience tries to avoid vomiting. Not necessarily because of the disgusting concept of grinding a human being and then filming the ""humanburger"" for all to see, but because of just plain grossly overplayed attempts at humor with a classless script. Billed as action/comedy, this script continued to exacerbate the patience of an audience that actually was relieved by the special effects/blood/carnage/ destruction/body parts flying - I noticed the audience turning on their hand-held devices and catching up on e-mails, which was even more obnoxious than this script. The Hero, a young recent recruit into the secret service, simply did not have a believable story line. As with the genre of Mythology, this Hero set out to smite the dragons, one after another, using tools, weapons, impromptu devices, sci-fi gadgets, etc. This type of writing is predictable because after slaying one dragon, the rest are ho-hum going to be slain. There are no surprises in this script, other than a vast array of curious characters who enter and then depart. The Opponent, Poppy, is not particularly opposed to the Hero for any particular reason. She is not blocking what the Hero attempts to do because so many other unrelated characters march in and out of the script, as if they were tacked on to increase the Narrative Drive. This technique did not work. The audience attention was not on the Hero's character arc because the vast character displays with no significant web to speak of kept taking the audience OFF of the Narrative Drive - the exact opposite desired effect. The dialogue was in your face, with very little subtext. Predictable character development, to the point where except for the British crew and the British accents vs. the southern characters and the whiskey drinkers and down home brawls - The characters could have been interchangeable they were drawn in such a surface manner. Colin Firth, with temporary memory loss, did a superb job as usual because he is a fine actor. Jeff Bridges also did what he could with his whiskey saturated good old' boy routine leading a crew of men who all want to fight on the side for good vs. the evil ""out there."" Poppy, the opponent, was so ridiculous, the attempt at parody was lost. A good opponent works punch-counter-punch with a good Hero - back and forth, constantly giving the audience Reveals. This was not the case with this script. The result - Very boring, predictable, and clichéd.","113 out of 187 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a Good Spy Flick That Falters in Comparison to the Original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3812605/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","23 September 2017","Kingsman: The Golden Circle brings back all your favourite characters from the original and brings many fresh new characters to the forefront. I must give the movie some credit here, the idea of the Statesmen could have been really hokey but as the movie goes on, you become more interested in the Statesmen agency and the major players within it. They give some added dimension to some unexpected returnees from the first entry (although the subject matter of their relationship was a little iffy, I was pleasantly surprised they brought back Princess Tilde in such a large role) and Eggsy hasn't changed too much from where it counts. There's one glaring exception to my praise though, they bring back one of the biggest and best characters from the original and I think they really fumbled the ball. It was so disappointing to the point where I almost regretted his inclusion in this sequel.With a good chunk of this movie taking place in the U.S.A and the jungle, they also introduce some engaging set-pieces and locations. I didn't get the reasoning behind Poppyland completely but it looked cool and added something distinctive. The Statesmen headquarters was a little hit or miss but it was also better than expected. Most of the CGI and visual effects in the movie are largely well done and they help sell some of the more outlandish bits.The best part of this movie is that the excellent action scenes from The Secret Service carry over. There's nothing to match the church/Free Bird set piece (which despite controversial subject matter is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen) but there are many smaller scenes that carry that same flavour. They don't waste any time dropping you into it either, 5 minutes into the movie and you're getting a neat car chase/fight sequence. So, while I can't say it topped The Secret Service, they continue their great action work with very little decline in quality.Taron Egerton came out of nowhere to capably carry the Kingsman franchise. Another positive thing I can say is that this follow up shows that his leading man chops from the first one wasn't a fluke. He is this character and he's earned the right to continue playing it. Mark Strong returns as Merlin, he was an underrated part of the first one and he's solid again here. It was nice to see Edward Holcroft again as Charlie but I was disappointed that Sophie Cookson had such a small roll. Channing Tatum slips into his character Tequila nicely but the movie didn't advertise his role properly. The surprise MVP is Pedro Pascal as Whiskey. He nails his part and he steals almost every scene he's in. They didn't give Halle Berry or Jeff Bridges much to do as Ginger Ale and Champagne respectively. I think Julianne Moore was an inspired choice as Poppy and she does a good job but she's let down by how her character is written. She's just not given as much to work with as Samuel L. Jackson was. To avoid spoilers, I'm not going to touch on the surprise return of a certain character or the big celebrity cameo.The most common complaint I've heard from fans of the first movie is that this movie is just a retread of the original. You can see parallels but I wouldn't agree with that assessment. I think this movie suffers from the next problem most sequels face. They feel the need to go bigger, to outdo themselves and to ratchet up almost every facet. There were plenty of good ideas and aspects worth praising in The Golden Circle but the movie also felt needlessly goofy. Eggsy was a semi-realistic character in the first one, he was a good kid in a tough neighbourhood that was in an even tougher situation. His rags-to-riches story was very heartfelt and it kept the movie grounded. He's turned into James Bond in this and his problems (minus The Kingsman Agency blowing up) seem much more conventional and less threatening. The rules and lore surrounding the Statesmen aren't well defined and they're importance/effectiveness seems to wildly fluctuate. Poppy isn't more over-the-top than Valentine but she seems to be way too playful and it's hard to take her seriously. The movie wants to say something about the war on drugs but the message feels vague and at the same time very heavy handed. These are just a few examples of the inconsistent nature of the movie and while there's the requisite action and comedy, this one leans into the absurd humour to the point where it detracts from itself.I unabashedly love Kingsman: The Secret Service. I thought it was so special the first time I saw it and it has gotten better upon repeated viewings. It payed homage to the classic spy movies but delivered an unconventional and fresh viewing experience. I would rank it among the best movies I've seen not only in 2014 but of this decade. But I was willing to spot this movie as many points as I could, I wanted this to be the next great entry in this franchise. Critics have been harsh on The Golden Circle but if you enjoy the first Kingsman, a lot of the successful elements in that movie are brought back. You still have the thrilling action and although I didn't like choices they made with the characters, the creative team introduces plenty of new things and they expand upon the world. The Golden Circle is absolutely worth seeing and I think most people will get a kick out of it. I just couldn't help leaving the theatre a little disappointed, Secret Service was so awe-inspiring for me in many ways and this won't have the same staying power. I would give this a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10.","20 out of 40 found this helpful.

It worked because THAT movie was conceptualized and executed as a parody to all spy films that came before it, surprising us by juxtaposing the irreverence in the plot with actual character moments that served the gravitas required to bring the entourage to life. In this second outing, the frenetic nature of the action remains intact, but in fleshing out it's own universe, the movie gives up its predecessor's singular ability to poke fun of the quintessential spy film; sacrificing the meta nature of the plot and resorting to a random nature of plot progression. Comparisons with the original momentarily put to rest, The Golden Circle is a wild wild ride with interesting(if underused)new characters and creative(if messy)action set pieces. It's fast paced with amusing dialogue interspersed whenever our titular characters are not landing blows at each other.We waste no time in catching up with Eggsy and the story gets going right off the bat. Over the next couple of hours we're treated to some interesting cameos by top billed actors, with barely veiled call backs to the best parts of the original. For better or worse, it is in these moments of nostalgia that the The Golden Circle is at it's best. Taron Egorton and Colin Firth put in fine performances continuing their characters' interplay from the first movie. For all the things it does right, it ultimately misses the mark. The wayward plot lends to an incoherence that betrays any suspense, and the bursts of gleeful abandon do so at the expense of having any real stakes whatsoever. The bombastic music that accompanies every action sequence plays fervently and frequently enough until it devolves into an overbearing mess. Where Samuel Jackson's Valentine was a great tongue-in-cheek villain, Julian Moore's Poppy is campy and bizarre at best. To conclude, Kingsman The Golden Circle is a fun riot with the simple fault of becoming the very movie that the original attempted to parody. Wild and loud enough to hold your interest but not nearly nuanced and nimble enough for you to care.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Original, witty and uniquely BRITISH. Yes, I'm American, but I loved that the original was anything BUT completely Hollywood! So many crappy movies come out of Hollywood every year with the exact same formula and exact same actors. The original Kingsman was refreshing and uniquely different with it's approach and ensemble. This one, not so much. Jeff Bridges?? Julianne Moore?? Halle Berry!!!??? Ugh!! Been there, done that! This movie didn't need their star power (as fading as it may be). It already had what it needed! They could have easily found an actress as talented as Julianne Moore to play the villain (and much cheaper too!). Jeff Bridges? I love this guy (Crazy Heart,The Big Lebowski) - but for every great movie he makes - he's in 10 horrible movies for a paycheck!! I can only surmise the ""Great American Sellout"" came down to money. Sad. Why do sequels so often go astray from the formula that worked so well with the original??Beyond all of this - it was still a fun movie to watch. It was good, but could have been great. The only other complaint was ELTON JOHN's role in this film. I'm still scratching my head. Yes - he's a musical icon - yes he's about as famous as it gets - but his scenes were just silly and stupid. It was like the writer was a huge fan and figured if he wrote enough flattering scenes he'd get the big guy. Well, I guess it worked - sadly for the film.Like the original? Then watch this one, but don't expect that same European flavor - distinctly British feel - and uniqueness. This is clearly an American franchise now.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie is very long at over 2 hours. It sucks when the sequel of a movie cannot live up to the same quantity of its predecessor. The first Kingsman film was a surprisingly fun, cool, movie while this sequel was too flashy, big budget and added too many stars like Halle Berry and Channing Tatum who were probably not needed. And the special effects / CGI were really awkward and stood out like a sore thumb.Overall, an average movie that is a bit long and doesn't match the charm of the first Kingsman movie.Skippable.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With one-armed former Kingsman trainee Charlie, she destroys the secret society with a barrage of missiles. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) are the sole survivors. They find help from the American secret society Statesman located in Kentucky which has made its fortune in whiskey. It turns out that the Statesman had saved Galahad (Colin Firth) a year earlier which left him with amnesia. Poppy unleashes a laced drug upon the world with her holding the only antidote. Eggsy is partnered with agent Tequila (Channing Tatum) until his drug use leaves him with the debilitating blue rash. As the sickness spreads in the population, Eggsy and new partner Whiskey have to find the antidote to save millions.The original came as a big surprise. It's fun and fresh. This sequel is more of the same but much less in other ways. Colin Firth returns for obvious chemistry reason but it isn't something that makes sense. The problem is that the chemistry is all changed up with his amnesia. Also in terms of chemistry, one expected Tatum to be the new partner and there's a jarring misdirection. All in all, the cast chemistry is not as good and I'm surprised that Roxy got killed. On the crazy action, the movie doubles down on that aspect. There is more of it keeping faith with the rule of sequels. Overall, there is more of the similar action and I like the movie less than the original.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

These three by far had the most entertaining scenes and lines throughout the film with strong character developments from all three. You grow to have strong emotions for each of them as they have their stories explored.The movie itself brings back the incredible use of long shots in action scenes and they are as enjoyable as before. However, the techniques were noticeably very dodgy during the initial action scene with some quite obvious use of CGI, so much so it enters 'uncanny valley' territory.Another criticism is the under-use of both Jeff Bridges and especially Julianne Moore, both of whom seem incredibly intriguing and have a lot to offer the story. Instead we are given an honestly quite weak and annoying performance by Colin Firth, who was arguably the best part of the first film. Edward Holcroft also returns to this film as the Kingsman reject from the first, Charlie. He is the worst part of the film for me. Not spoiling anything, he felt like he was shoehorned into the plot and could've been replaced by pretty much anyone.The movie itself does however set itself a bit further away from the original, entering new territory and not just wallowing in the success of the first. The movie has to be greatly commended for this as well as having a lot of story lines from the first that are greatly continued and wrapped up.Overall, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' receives a rating of Good from me and is definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the first. The movie can feel a bit overlong and some scenes and actors just seem to be there for the sake of being there and maybe could've been edited out, but overall it did everything it needed to and we are now guaranteed a third movie is this honestly very well done franchise.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

On the one hand you want to maintain a level of familiarity to replicate the original's success. On the other you inevitably have to bring something new to counteract the natural lack of novelty and freshness. Kingsman: The Golden Circle almost pulls this feat off. Fans will still enjoy the hyper-stylised violence, the delicately balanced humour and the charisma of Egerton still on-form as loveable rogue Eggsy. The new element, our friends across the pond in Statesman, just about works thanks to an array of Hollywood's finest. That said the plot hardly strays far from that of the original - more of a stretch here would have been welcome. The foul language is dialled up a notch for some unknown reason and whilst one scene is unnecessarily crude, the fun of the franchise isn't at all diminished. There's just about enough freshness to make The Golden Circle stand on its own two feet (principally down to a very likeable cast, and one particular cameo clearly loving every second). If there's a third instalment, which I hope there is, a bit more originality in the story would help proceedings.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film features, most of the original cast reprising their roles from the first film, with the addition of Julianne Moore, Halle Berry, Elton John, Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges. It follows the Kingsman needing to team up with their American counterpart, after the world is held hostage by a drug cartel. It was a financial success but got mixed reviews from critics. Some critical concerns were the addition of new characters, over-stylized action and the extensive run-time. It's funny you don't get these complaints about other comic book movies. The new characters open up the possibility of an extended universe on par with Marvel. The stylized violence both sets it apart from other action movies and is an innovative way to give homage to the source material. Runtime is arbitrary. A longer film is acceptable, if shaving the run-time down would significantly affect the plot. I'll never understand why the longer run-time is always questioned when it's an action or comedy, but they're perfectly acceptable for the Oscar nominated films or an epic fantasy. The third Kingsman film is being projected, and with their success, there is interest in making a Statesman spin-off. This is a solid sequel, keeping true to the original and expanding the tale.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But has some problems too.Starting with the good points. The movie bring once again the beloved characters from the first one (even Harry), and they (of course) are amazing. Eggsy is charismatic as always, Harry is (in one part of the movie) the elegant gentleman of the first movie, and even Merlin get more time in the screen this time. Besides that the movie has some amazing action scenes, and funny moments, that really hold the audience to the history. Some scenes between Harry and Eggsy really warmed my heart too.But the movie isn't just flowers and happiness, it has some problems too. The thing that most bother me at first was some of the special effects. Some scenes have so much chroma key on it that really take you out of the movie, and in the most part of those scenes, the effects aren't even necessary (aka all the shots in the stadium). Some actions scenes fall in that same mistake too. The characters did somethings that really bother me at some point too, because I think that this isn't the way that they will act in those situations.Well, in short, I believe that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a good movie, in some parts it falls in some clichés of the big franchises, but in a bigger picture still a fun and very entertaining movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Colin Firth is, happily, back - early on and for the gentlemanly duration. Taron Egerton is his same cheeky, twangy East End self, and Mark Strong does what he always does which is to glue things together. But the real stars in this upside-down, turned-around totally nuts piece of entertainment are Julianne Moore as the completely loony drug-peddler and.. yes. No less than Elton John Himself, making a complete pig's ear of every scene he's in but camping it up as only 'Eejay' can do. This is a Marmite movie. For anyone who doesn't live in the UK - that means you'll love it.. or hate it. It'll really depend on the mood you're in when you sit down to watch it. But watch it, you should. It's not normal Hollywood. It's crude, it's nuts, it's fast-paced, it's funny. It's a lot of things, and fails at most of them but not too badly - except the end-game which is frankly stupid and ridiculous. But I watched it with a bottle of good red wine, suspended my disbelief and just laughed my fricking socks off in the second half.

I don't think so. I enjoyed Kingsman: The Golden Circle a lot, although it had so problems as well as the first one.The first movie is arguably the best, and this is basically the same movie. It does almost everything again, but in another way. The first 30 minutes (which was the recruit scene from the first movie), is now a continuing of the first movie.The movie is great, although nothing is perfect. It opens with a stylized action sequence and a car chase throughout the city. After that, we gets introduced to a great cast and characters. Everyone from the first movie, along with Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street), Pedro Pascal (Narcos), Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Julianne Moore (The Big Lebowski) and even The Dude himself, Jeff Bridges. It even has a cameo from a famous old music artist. I don't want to spoil who it is, but it's Elton John. It's on the DVD Cover. The only problem is that everyone doesn't get enough screen-time.Some of the action scenes in the movie, is overshadowed by the action scenes from the first movie. It's more talking than fighting, and the movie's way too long for that.Besides for that, the movie is great and underappreciated, so check this movie out.

Some would add British, but not exactly I guess, as this generalization changes lately. Included are even several kinder eggs for those who can recognize them. There are some soft spots; but being primary entertainment movie meant for child in us, this is funny, not-too-complex, gadget-full story (including ironically approached global and contemporary issues like new technologies, politics on drugs and terrorism). Great acting on part of colorful characters and their interaction through dynamic story-line. For me it's all just right and was nicely spent 2+ hours of watching.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

At least Elton John gets to deliver a more wittier version in the sequel.In Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) returns, this time every inch the gent. He is even living with the Scandinavian princess and he very much impresses her parents but with one just hiccup.The Kingsmen have been under unprecedented attack, Merlin and Eggsy visit the USA and seek help from their sister organisation, Statesman headed by Champs (Jeff Bridges) and they also find out what happened to Harry Hart's body after he got shot in the last film.The big bad this time is Poppy (Julianne Moore) who just wants to be recognised for her achievements, that being the leader of the biggest and most profitable drug cartel in the world. She issues an ultimatum to a Trump lite president.The film should be a James Bond film on acid, but this one suffers from its long running time where you notice the lack of action sequences and this makes the film feel stodgy which its quirkiness cannot hide. When it is in full throttle it is fun but some of the plot contrivances are glaring.Still the film managed to get five Oscar winners on screen.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

The action is amazing, original, well-shot and thrilling! It gives you the same adrenaline kick as in the first film. I will warn you though.. there is no scene that is on par with the church scenes. don't expect a 4 minute slaughter of another church, because it simply isn't there! It is asking a lot though from this franchise, so i didn't mind. 10/10 for the action. Characters.. Well this is hard. Eggsy is great. Agent Whiskey is so good in this film. He caries like 3 of the best action scenes. He was SO American. Poppy a.k.a. julian moore's character fell like she overdid it. Channing tatum's character was barely in it, which was disappointing because he had an awesome action-setup and then he vanished. I can't talk about the rest of the characters, but agent whiskey, along with halle berry's character, eggsy and of course.. the OG galahad were great. Some characters got rid off and it didn't have to. 8/10Cinematography: in times to cgi-ish, but overall fantastic. 9/10Story: The story itself is great. the screenplay however disappointed me. Moments where i needed to feel it weren't there. The story in the first one is about eggsy. this one is as well, but i needed more emotional moments to really adore him again. we did something else though that was very endearing. I liked the villain's motivation... 7/10All in all, it's such a fun time at the theaters. as we know critics don't like fun, but we action-junkies, movie-lovers and vaugn-admireres enjoy it all! do see it in the theaters!!! 8/10.

So I walked into the sequel without big expectations, just that I'll probably have a good time. Well, it turns out I had a blast. It was hilarious, completely ridiculous in a good way, and filled with weird and creative ideas that no one would dare put in a more typical franchise. And I love how it revels in its R-rating, making all the extreme violence quite funny.I liked Kingsman: The Golden Circle better than the first movie. The first one mostly stuck to its James Bond parody premise, whereas The Golden Circle subdues the James Bond clichés and instead steps out and does its own thing. I loved the introduction of the American themes and characters to the franchise. The whole British stereotypes vs American stereotypes theme never gets old.First movie left me questioning whether the kid, Taron Edgerton, can carry on as the star of this franchise without Colin Firth leading the way. Well, the kid definitely proves himself in Kingsman: The Golden Circle; he's thoroughly engaging as the lead, very funny, and handles himself fine in the action scenes.And Pedro Pascal, playing an exaggerated cowboy stereotype, is easily a highlight of the film. Everything that guy does in this movie was both awesome and ridiculous.And finally... once again, the critics are wrong, as usual. Don't listen to critics. This is a great movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The two organizations must join forces to take on a common enemy.Right from the start it's obvious 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is going to be bigger and louder than its predecessor. The movie offers more over-the-top fight scenes, more gadgets and more characters. Sadly more doesn't mean better. At 141 minutes the movie is a bit too long. The opening scene is fun for about a minute but quickly becomes annoying. Not to mention the robotic dogs who should have never seen the light of day (along with Jar Jar Binks and that dude Mutt from the latest Indiana Jones to name a few). The story isn't all that great but writers Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman do their best to tie it up with the original. While the rather silly ""world domination/drugs plot"" is something you're more likely to see in 'Austin Powers' than in 'James Bond', it is fun. And that's what 'Kingsman' is all about. Although it lacks the punch of the original it's still a fun ride.The star-studded cast has a lot to do with that. Taron Egerton is eggcellent as Eggsy. He's a charming leading man and the combo with Mark Strong (Merlin) works a treat. Pedro Pascal as Whiskey fits right in but it's Julianne Moore who steals the show. Moore is cast as the villain (Poppy Adams) and she looks like she's having a blast. Too bad some of the new characters are underused. Channing Tatum as Tequila and Jeff Bridges as Champ come to mind.Vaughn who's back in the director's chair maketh yet another solid movie. The Zach Snyder like fight scenes look just as spectacular (hello electric lasso) as they do in the first movie, the jokes hit the mark more often than not (the dining scene) and the soundtrack only adds to the fun.If 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' wasn't your cup of tea you better stay away from this one. But if you loved the first you'll appreciate the sequel as well.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

With that considered, it's such an overwhelming disappointment that too much of the picture is inferior filler. The latest additions to Vaughn's spy universe, the members of alternative spy organisation Statesman, unfortunately succeed in continuing the disappointing trend. They simply lack character development, and so have the impression of being aesthetics as opposed to fully fleshed out characters. Additionally,I struggled to determine whether the disturbing, brutal acts performed by Juliane Moore's drug kingpin Poppy were examples of intelligent, dark comedy or deprived shock value aiming at leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. It's fortunate then that, despite not being delivered in an abundance, the film's signature stylized, graphic action sequences, accompanied by unconventional soundtrack decisions are so incredibly compelling and enticing. Overall, The Golden Circle lacks consistency and too frequently delivers underwhelming content, however in it's highest quality moments it's enthralling.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I really liked the first film as I found it to be very fun and unique with some spectacular action sequences. While this sequel unfortunately does not quite reach the quality of its predecessor, it nevertheless is still a very entertaining comic book romp. What made the film fell short were a meandering plot and messy pacing which unnecessarily padded the running time to nearly two and a half hours. The Golden Circle introduces so many new characters and subplots only for them to be disappointingly undercooked. The end result is a film that has interesting ideas, great action and characters, but was ultimately betrayed by the script and editing.The film's greatest strength by far is the action sequences. The Golden Circle took the style of the awesome Westboro Church massacre scene from The Secret Service and applies it generously here throughout. The zoom-in, zoom-out and slow-down effects used gave a surreal, visually appealing look to the whole thing. The sequel takes a complete comic book turn with characters now battling with bionic arms that extend and smash through walls, lassos that electrify and slice people in half, robotic guard dogs, as well as the other Kingsman gadgets you know from the first movie. My favorite scene is the opening with two characters fighting in the backseat of a moving vehicle.The acting is very good from all involved. Taron Egerton as the lead really surprised me as he managed to bring a sense of gravitas and weight to a world of complete zaniness. I really liked how unpretentious and down-to-earth his character is while at the same time sweet and loyal. Colin Firth and others also did very well with what they had to work with. The standout of the film goes to Julianne Moore who plays the main villain, is crazy and psychopathic but superficially extremely polite and well-mannered. I love her evil smiles and head- tilts right before she does something heinous.The film presents many new elements, but aforementioned a lot them goes absolutely nowhere. The biggest new component as witnessed in the marketing campaign is the American counterpart to the Kingsman, the Statesman. Without spoiling anything, this secret group is utterly wasted with all the American actors not getting nearly enough to do. Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges did not feel like big Hollywood names performing, but instead zombies sleepwalking to their paychecks. A small role for a famous celebrity was also included in the film that was meant as a surprise to all his fans, but I just found his entire part to be awkward and unfunny and felt it should have been cut. There is a way to do surprise celebrity cameos, but the filmmakers took the wrong approach here. The finale takes place in a diner and feels really small in comparison to the escalation the film was taking. In my opinion, it could have upped the ante a little with a bigger location and the villain putting up more of a fight.Overall Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a very fun and entertaining movie with top-notch performances by Egerton and Moore, but alas was bloated by subplots and poor filmmaking choices.

Since I loved the first, I had to take a chance. Thankfully, it paid off. Golden Circle was just as fun and just as action-packed as the first. Some parts were a bit over-the-top, but that is part of the franchise and what I expected. Even the over-the- part scenes were great to watch. I took my teenage son (older) to see it and he also loved it. There were some great new characters and some great villains. It made fun of itself in an entertaining manner. If you're expecting Macbeth, you will be disappointed - but if you are looking for some fun, over-the-top, action-packed filmmaking - with great characters, great effects, laughs and excitement - this is the film. I think the best gauge to see if you will like this is if you liked the first.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

While this sequel still maintains some of the fun and humor of the first one, much of the charm and goodwill is lost on bad screenplay decisions. Lets talk about what went wrong first: The original spent an entire movie building up this intriguing underground organisation with deep history and roots,processes and tradition, much like the ""John Wick underground universe"" ...and then they WIPE ALL THAT AWAY in the first 15 minutes to make a weak plot device. The Statesman , the U.S. counterpart to the Kingsmen is rather poorly introduced and underutilized and made up of bad American caricatures rather than truly interesting characters, they are supposed to be based in Kentucky yet all sound like Texans. Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry are completely underutilised and their roles could have been played by ""nobodys"". The original had an almost anti-liberal ,un-""PC"" plot that was very refreshing, this one tries to get too preachy and political which I HATE in movies. The "" bad guys"" in this are really not all that bad and even kind of likable, I could sympathize with the motivations of Poppy, the President and especially ""Whiskey"" Pedro Pascal, who did not deserve his gruesome fate . The action scenes in this instead of being just ""awesome, stylized and over-the-top"" like the original go into ""over CGI-ed, absurd and completely ridiculous"" territory. Too many beloved primary cast members killed off again. What worked: The opening action scene , though too overblown, was a lot of fun. The final action scene with Eggsy And Harry back together again was also a lot of fun, ..and actually Elton John as the comic relief is actually a lot of fun and he shows himself to have some real actual comedic talent and gets more combined screen time than Jeff bridges, Channing Tatum or Halle Berry. Overall there is enough good stuff to warrant a ticket purchase, but it's just a shame that they squandered opportunities to include the Statesman while also erasing too much of the Kingsmen.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In the case of ""Kingsman"" you have a lot to compare to. Cameras, effects, story, drama, characters... Unfortunately, ""Golden Circle"" feels inferior in almost every manner.TL;DR: lack of new and original effects, story, personalities, things to remember; bad self citations. Cool Poppy. 7/10.The first ""Kingsman"" scored 10/10 for me. Eleven out of ten, even. ""Kingsman: Golden Circle"" did not score as good.The story is not as good, first of all. I will not go into details, but the script of ""Golden circle"" contains quite some rabbits pulled out of metaphorical hats. There're too many ""why""-s that come to my mind after the final scene. Minus one point here. Ah! And total lack of drama too, and music doesn't help.The second thing that surprises me is a lack of those cool and funny effects we had in the first movie. Both CG and cameras. And now fight scenes are not exceptionally cool anymore, they're just average cool. We can see such scenes in any AAA action movie. Another point goes here.I have also to take away one point for princess Tilda. What did you do to her, you heartless ba...d people?! Where's that princess Tilda we know?! And this point will also pay for all the boring personalities in the movie. All those people who say their lines and land their blows being totally out of context and meaning, being just a handsome face and and pure functionality, not a real character.And yet one more point for bad self-citations. No, really! You can do such things when you resurrect a franchise that is dead for decades. Like Transformers, or Star Trek, or new approach to Harry Potter... But citing from your own movie three years old?! And how many new scenes do we have for citing in the future sequels now? I'll tell you: zero. I'd even tell this deserves yet another point fee!Now, on the bright side. We have some good political jokes, one really cool camera angle, and Poppy. Who represents the only real thing to remember. This all adds up to one point given back. Only one...So the math is this: 5 points taken away, one given back. Even if we say that initial score was eleven... it is no more than 7 out of 10. And average score for an average AAA-movie, Which is really terrible for a franchise that started as outstanding.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The movie scores for an engaging blend of stylized, hyperkinetic violence and subversive humor, even if it fails to reach the height of its predecessor","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3821472/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2017","Agent 007 receives a stylized, over-the-top treatment once again in Matthew Vaughn's follow-up to the sleeper hit spy action comedy 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', a movie that swiped the classic spy genre and cranked it up with an audaciously shocking spin of edginess and gut-busting departure from realism. Like the predecessor, this film aims to be as irreverent and over-the-top as possible without hitting the breaks on absurdity. Somewhat unsurprisingly, the level of audacious appeal Vaughn hit with the first film perhaps doesn't quite reach the peak. A few calculated flaw are that is a little less funny and less effective on its subversiveness. But when it comes to delivering the sweet action thrill elan, it earns its badge. In this case, the positives significantly outweigh the negatives, and the movie holds a special place in its heart for the filmgoers who were ecstatic about the first film. Taron Edgerton reprises his role as Eggsy, who is now a rookie agent of Kingsman and is in relationship with his sexy Swedish sweetheart Princess Tilde (played by Hanna Alstrom). When the Kingsman headquarters are destroyed by missiles launched by the devious Poppy Adams (played by Julianne Moore), he and Merlin (played by Mark Strong) must collaborate with another spy organization The Statesman, headed by Ginger Ale (played by Halle Berry). There, they join forces with fellow agents including booze- drinking cowboy Tequila (played by Channing Tatum), lasso-wielding Whiskey (played by Pedro Pascal), and the operation leader Champagne (played by Jeff Bridges) on a mission to stop Poppy from smuggling a hazardous drug that is killing millions of Americans. Along the way, they are met with a mysterious encounter with Harry (played by Colin Firth) who miraclously survived the last film, and an exotically disguised Elton John (playing himself) held captive by Poppy.One can always count on Matthew Vaughn to delivering the excitement of gun-blazing and Pedro Pascal whipping his lasso in a frenetic ass-kicking frenzy. The absorbing energy of our character facing down the baddies has all made its return here, with just slightly less edgier side. If you happen to one of those who was alienated by Colin Firth slaughtering a congregation of baptist churchgoers in the last film, don't worry, you don't get anything like that here. However, the film does absorb into a wild, hyper-kinetic with two major action sequences: the opening car chase sequence and the the bombastic raid in the Poppyland village, both of which are complete with a spicy soundtrack to amp up the high-octane tone. These aspects manage to stand out among the flaws that hinder the narrative, particularly with the overabundance of subplots that slow the pacing around the halfway mark. When the story takes characters to Kentucky to unite with the Statesman, it opens doors to some witty moments of humor, which mainly focuses on poking at southern lifestyles. While some of the jokes work, others come off a bit ham- fisted. Some, however, will get a kick out of Channing Tatum yattering with a heavy southern accent. It's only too bad he doesn't share much screen time. On the bright side, the returning cast including Taron Edgerton, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth remain charismatic as ever. Julianne Moore, on the other hand, makes for a less than compelling villain, unlike Samuel L. Jackson who stole the show as dubious Valentine who held a plan that is about as diabolical as what Moore's Poppy Adams. Many can agree that Moore subjects for an odd choice as a darkly funny villain with a dubious streak of smuggling drugs and shoving people into a meat grinder to serve them as a hamburger. And what about Elton John? Well, he manages to crack a few laugh-worthy moments. Then there is Bruce Greenwood playing a fictional President of The United States, and let's just say he is portrayed in a way that will leave some with a cold-shoulder. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is fun-filled journey that, while not scaling the peak of its predecessor, scores for a solidly appealing blend of stylized over-the-topness and irreverent humor with a palpable sense of self-awareness. It is bold, it is violent, but most importantly, it is all made for fun for those willing to leave their intelligence at the door.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

She is one crazy villain with hideouts designed like vintage and uses robots on the other side. She has style and her own world and she is cunning and definitely brutal behind her Charm. OK, other than a vicious villain the movie had some Solid VFX and good action choreography (particularly the cable car sequence ) and a star cast who essayed their roles perfect.

It was subversive, hilarious and chock full of super-stylish and ultra-violent action; no one saw it coming. This sequel delivers more of the same, which, element of surprise now absent, means it has lost some of its bite. The world is again being held hostage, this time by Julianne Moore's deranged drug kingpin, and Kingsman agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) must join forces with their American counterparts at the Statesman agency. Featuring an adrenaline pumping car chase sequence through London, a clever bar-set fight showcasing the awesome lasso skills of Pedro Pascal's Whiskey, and a climactic all-out assault with as much slow-mo and speed-ramping as one could desire, the action-based thrills are certainly present. Yet nothing matches the sheer audacity and seared-in-your-brain memorability of the original's church bloodbath. And this is the movie in a nutshell: everything it does well, its predecessor did better. Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman litter shock and awe moments throughout—Eggsy 'infiltrating' a mark, Poppy's distinctive method of making burger patties—garnering the expected queasy laughs, but they aren't as wittily incisive as they could have been. Supplemented with Jeff Bridges as the head of Statesman, Pedro Pascal and Channing Tatum as his two star operatives, Halle Berry as their deskbound eyes and ears, and Colin Firth as the resurrected Harry Hart, our group of heroes led by Eggsy and Merlin are a fun bunch to hang out with. The same can't be said about the antagonists though. Moore's annoyingly bubbly villain is the cinematic personification of scratching a chalkboard, whilst henchman Charlie (Edward Holcroft) is a blend of total blandness and utter nothingness. Paling in comparison to the original and at almost 2.5 hours it's way too long, this follow-up nevertheless offers a healthy dose of kick-ass action and politically incorrect amusement.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Just as good as in the original, if not better.That being said, I do not like how this film feels the need to raise the stakes so much that it actively makes it harder for the franchise to continue because they burn down so many bridges in their search for maximum drama.Julianne Moore is also a fine actor, but I have a bit of a hard time buying her as a villain.Still, as far as comedic spy action films go, this is still crème de la crème.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Kingsman: The Golden Circle does not live up to its predecessor, that's not to say that it is bad though. So both Taron Egerton and Colin Firth return in this sequel to the surprise hit Kingsman: The Secret Service. Both were really good in this film too even though personally I feel that bringing back Colin Firth's Harry Hart was a really bad decision. The explanation they gave was simply way to bizarre and just takes away all the stakes from the movie. While I enjoyed the action very much in the golden circle I really didn't like the amounts of action and the amounts of CGI that was in this sequel. The opening scene alone sets a tone for the movie to be high octane, but the CGI in that scene was so poorly done that I could not believe that I was seeing it. I enjoyed the action and CGI in the first film for what it was but this was simply too much, and more is not always better. Another issue that may be considered spoiler is: the amounts of death in this movie, meaningless and completely out of the blue deaths. There's so much of it. They killed off fan favourite, Mark Strong's Merlin and Sophie Cookson's Roxy to 'raise the emotional stakes?' The Merlin scene I sort of understand even though it did not make much sense at all and seems like a blatant waste of his character, but Roxy's death was just so glossed over and bland that it really doesn't do the character justice. I conclude that out of these two major supporting characters to have died only one should've died. The franchise cannot afford to lose both characters .The loss of Sofia Boutella and Samuel L Jackson's presence is also felt in the sequel to the big hit. Samuel L Jackson plays the over the top villain so well in the original whereas here, Julianne Moore is simply fine. The Sofia Boutella knock off however was just boring and this sequel really is missing that really strong antagonist to go up against the Kingsman. Finally, the addition of the Statesmen is definitely the highlight of the film I found each of them very interesting and they have a potential to be very interesting characters in the future of the franchise. Despite, having basically left out Channing Tatum's Tequila for the entire film; although, I really enjoyed that character. So, my verdict is that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is fine, it was fun and I did have a blast watching this film but there are certainly many flaws. The addition of new characters do show promise for an expanded universe that could play on other cultural tropes and I am looking forward to the next installment.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Put them in a room and told them they had 1 hour to write the script for Kingsman 2, this is the sort of movie they'd make, except theirs would have probably been better.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Kingsman: The Golden Circle expands its cultural boundaries to America, but it is still a British film at heart. Mathew Vaughan leaves no stone unturned to make this one of the most entertaining franchisees of this decade.It is harsh to compare this movie to its predecessor. The movie might not score big in terms of the story but it excels in most other aspects. In this movie the Kingsman tie up with their Western counterparts The Statesman to save the world from an evil drug lord (who also happened to have kidnapped Sir Elton John). The way Eggsy and Merlin go about seeking answers and collaborating with the Statesman lead to some of the most hilarious moments. While the action sequences are much more over the top than the first part, they are still a treat to watch. This movie also continues the recent tradition of action sequences with classic songs playing in the background. It is not surprise that most of the humour is centered around the British and American cultural differences. The guns, gadgets and the cars get much advanced and the cheeky alcoholic references add to the fun.Kingsman thrives on the uniqueness of its characters. But this time around the introduction of too many characters doesn't give enough scope for some of the top actors. But hey, big franchisees can afford that these days and there is nothing much to complain about it. Taron Egerton continues his merry ways as Eggsy but this time around has more of a mature role. The entry of Galahad (Colin Firth) doesn't seem much of a surprise bit his role lacks the charm as compared to the first movie. Mark Strong is brilliant yet again as Merlin and has a lot of contribution to the humour of the movie. Julianne Moore tries her best to be the classic over the top negative character but she is no match to the Samuel Jackson's Richmond Valentine of the first. Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry are fun to watch in their limited screen time. Pedro Pascal adds one more big movie to his gaining popularity. Sir Elton John as himself and Bruce Greenwood as the president of the United States add to some uncanny humour in the film.Kingsman The Golden Circle is a movie that needs to be admired for its grandeur and style. It celebrates old school storytelling with the present day film making.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

It would take a small miracle to top it.The Golden Circle is not that miracle.Think about what made the first movie so entertaining. The dry wit, amazing action sequences, endearing characters, original story, even a badass soundtrack. It was totally out of the blue, and everyone ate it up. The Golden Circle suffers from ""sequel syndrome"", where it takes pretty much everything that worked in the first, and amps it up to 11. Imagine taking a sports car and making it go impractically fast, just to outdo the previous model. Try driving it, and you'll probably just end up with a sad mess. That's what happens here. ""Oh, you liked the church fight scene? Well here's three more versions of that!"" ""Oh you laughed at the kinda uncomfortable sex scene? Well here, have one that's waaaay more uncomfortable, and pretty creepy!"" The film feels like two hours of the same stuff, watered down to the point where it's no longer entertaining to watch.This movie tries so hard to be bigger and flashier than its predecessor that it loses track of what made the first one good- spectacle in moderation. Everything in this film is HUGE. Some people might like it, but I certainly didn't. It loses the charm, the personal and intimate touch. The stakes are blown to such enormous proportions that they become unbelievable and pretty silly. Not only that, but despite the insurmountable odds, there was rarely a moment where it felt like the protagonists were actually in peril. They always seemed to keep their cool and take out every villain they encountered. In the first one they were actually overwhelmed, and narrowly avoided defeat. In this, they even have time for silly quips and one-liners as the world ends around them.The characters themselves are oddly detached from the first movie. Eggsy in particular has lost his blunt but endearing personality, and acts way more arrogant and mean-spirited. There are some moments of genuine empathy for him, and then he brutally murders a guy. Charming... Julianne Moore's villain is curious and could be genuinely interesting, but she has the depth of a sheet of paper. There's almost no interaction between her and the heroes, and whenever we do see her it's through some unnecessary sub-plot that's only there to remind us she exists. She tries to pull off the kooky eccentricity of Sam L. Jackson in the previous film, but it comes off as unrealistic and goofy. She'd be more at home as an Adam West Batman villain.Colin Firth's Galahad is back, thanks to one of the laziest Deus-ex-Machina's in recent films. He doesn't do much, and half the time he's on screen he's just stumbling around trying not to die. Seriously, he went from being this elite super-agent, to this bumbling fool who takes a backseat to Eggsy.The story is bland, over-the-top and generic. You've probably already seen it in the first Kingsman, and most superhero films. There's not much more to say because there isn't much to it.In the end, while it's not terrible, it's not great either. It tries too hard to be the first one but bigger, and loses much of the appeal and potential it had. I'm rather disappointed.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Kingsman 2 in short has the same problems as its predecessor but it also gave me more of what I liked from the first one. It was batsh*t insane which is exactly what I wanted. However, just like the first it really pushes every female character to the side and it's still a disappointing writing decision that they have made again.

Once upon a time, one of them was like a proud and dignified parent and the other, a stubborn and rebellious child. After that child left home and matured, the child became stronger than the parent, to the point that the child protected the parent when the parent was being attacked by dangerous enemies. But the most important characteristics of what is often called their ""special relationship"" are their common heritage, their mutual affection and their cooperation in good times and bad. In fact, this parent had several other children and has many more cousins and neighbors, but none so closely aligned and so highly regarded by others. So, in spite of the strong disagreements that arose between them and warring against each other more than once, but because of their common language, culture and military, political and economic interests, and having fought common enemies on multiple occasions, it makes sense that freelance spy agencies from the United Kingdom and the United States would work together in the action- adventure-comedy ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (R, 2:21). In fact, much like the countries that the story's different spy agencies represent, 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and 2017's ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" are the same, but different. They're both based on the British spy action-comedy comic book series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons (debuting in 2012, originally called ""The Secret Service"", but renamed ""Kingsman"" when the movies started coming out). Both films focus on the character Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the young thug who became a gentleman spy and works for the highly secretive British spy agency known as ""Kingsman"", headquartered in a nice but unremarkable tailor shop. Key characters in both also include the Kingsman IT specialist known as Merlin (Mark Strong) and an experienced agent (and mentor to Eggsy) who is called Galahad (Oscar winner Colin Firth) even though he was apparently killed in the first film. Both also co-star a cultural icon: ""Star Wars"" legend Mark Hammill in the first, music legend Elton John in the second. Maybe most importantly, both films were co-written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn and directed by Vaughn.A year after the events of the first film, Eggsy is doing what Eggsy does – romancing the girl, hanging out with his friends, fighting off bad guys and standing ready to save the world, if so needed. As he's leaving work one evening, he's attacked by Charlie (Edward Holcroft), a former Kingsman recruit gone wrong, whom Eggsy almost killed in the first film. But this attack isn't just about revenge. Charlie is a man on a mission – a mission to entirely eliminate the Kingsman organization – and he nearly succeeds. While at dinner with the King and Queen of Sweden (the late Björn Granath, in his final film role, and Samantha Womack), the parents of his girlfriend, Princess Tilde (Hanna Alström), Eggsy learns that Kingsman locations around the U.K. have been attacked. He seems to be the only surviving agent and Merlin, the only surviving staff member. Together, they pursue the Kingsman ""Doomsday Protocol"" which seems to be about drinking an old bottle of whiskey from the Stateman distillery near Louisville, Kentucky, USA. Eggsy and Merlin head to the states where they discover that, like their tailor shop, the distillery is a front for a super-secret spy organization. The good ol' boy American version is headed by a man named Champagne (Oscar winner Jeff Bridges), who wants to be called ""Champ"". His agents include Tequila (Channing Tatum), Whiskey (Pedro Pascal) and their IT specialist, Ginger Ale (Oscar winner Halle Berry). Champ puts all Statesman resources at the disposal of Kingsman and both groups work together against the sweet but ruthless international drug kingpin (and leader of this film's titular organization) Poppy Adams (Oscar winner Julianne Moore). Poppy has built a 1950s-inspired lair out of ancient ruins deep in the jungles of Cambodia – and she has kidnapped Elton John to be her personal entertainer! She's the kind of person who will have one of her new thugs throw one who broke her rules into a large meat grinder and then make the new guy a hamburger out of the remains. She's the Happy Homemaker meets Scarface. And, like Richmond Valentine before her, Poppy is pursuing an agenda that could lead to the deaths of many millions of people around the world. Defeating her evil plans will take every bit of toughness, skill and bravery from the Statesman and Kingsman organizations – including that of Harry Hart, who is now living at Statesman headquarters, but isn't the Galahad whom Eggsy and Merlin knew.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" has all of the action, attitude and appeal of the first one, but improves on its own formula. The gadgets and the fight sequences are as delightfully over-the-top as the original, but the violence is (appropriately) just a shade less gleeful (no heads exploding into fireworks set to music). And, even though there's still a strong us-against-the-world vibe, this script is a little less mean-spirited and doesn't try to make every single person and group outside of Kingsman (and Statesman) into evil caricatures. This sequel may still be a bit excessive in certain areas for some Movie Fans, but it has an even better cast (including Sir Elton in action sequences!), even better direction (including some great set pieces) and is more fun than the first one.

It has as much - or possibly more - action, gun battles, explosions and spinning-camera shots. The star is, once again, Eggsy (Egerton), who's the still humble but now more sophisticated secret agent, and his trusty sidekick, Merlin (Strong) who brings plenty of class and exposition. This time, the 'baddie' is Poppy (Moore), a drug kingpin who blackmails the US President to make all drugs legal so she can become legitimately rich and famous - she has fun with it & is almost as over-the-top as Samuel L Jackson was!There's still plenty of Bond elements - suits, jet-setting, martini's, spy gadgets - but it's all done 75% more hyper and with 100% more tongue-in-cheek. Forced on the run from the UK, Eggsy & Merlin seek refuge with ""Statesman"", their US counterpart, where Champ (Bridges), Ginger (Berry), Whiskey (Pascal) & Tequila (Tatum) come into it. Bridges, Berry & Tatum barely have five scenes between them, but Pascal is good and Harry (Firth) is reintroduced here (through very dubious means!) Elton John has more scenes and is hilarious - an excellent cameo choice, and a fight set to 'Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting' is superb. Tilde (Alstrom) is back as the girlfriend and gets a few good moments.There's plenty of humour and jokes throughout, and I found myself smiling more often than not. It's probably a bit longer than necessary (140min) and has some slow points - and lots of dumb/unbelievable scenarios - but that's half the fun! The action and comedy are balanced well again - still in for the third film!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Anyone who thinks this movie is silly or not up to the original really wasn't paying attention to the original. It was plenty silly and had much the same character dynamics as this one.

Quite frankly, I just don't have time for anything that's serious or realistic because I get enough drama in my own life, I don't have time for drama coming out of my TV too.

Raising the stakes on the evil plan was nearly impossible, and packing that same level of fun was never going to get there on the same level, as you risk duplicating jokes.All that aside, it's a fun movie, though it suffers from its predecessor's downfall by being about twenty minutes longer than it needs to be. Trim a little bit and you come out with a more compact film that still gets the job done.The plot line is reasonable, and Julianne Moore gives a performance that reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in the first film, up to and including their love of burgers. Though the first scene in the diner is disturbingly funny, it seems to have minimal effect on the remainder of the plot.This is the part where I have to discuss Elton John's role in the film, which is truly spectacular. He curses, he's funny, and he kicks ass. I don't know whose idea it was to bring him on board, but particularly for a non-actor, he steals his scenes every time.The fight scenes are much like the first one; oddball music choices set to bullet-time heavy sequences. This time, the final fight doesn't feel like it drags on forever, but as aforementioned, the stakes are not there, so it almost works against itself.Ultimately, though, the movie is fun, funny, disturbing, and worth taking a look at.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This review is my opinion only. Your mileage and tastes may vary... but personally I would leave this one alone. It is truly AWFUL!I loved the first Kingsmen movie, which was stylish, and beautifully executed. This one is an over the top unbelievable, and frankly rather boring mess. It starts with what has to be the most unlikely steroid pumped car chase in the history of car chases.Quite aside from the impossible physics, and a seemingly indestructible cab, which can drive off after hitting a bollard so hard that it actually tips over, the plot that the follows is so unlikely that even a willing suspension of disbelief rapidly started to fail me.I really wanted to love this film after the first brilliant episode, but sadly after the first twenty or so minutes, which contain one scene which was so revolting that it may even have spoiled my enjoyment of American diners for life, I had to concede defeat.I confess that for only the second time in my entire life, I gave up on this film (and also disposed of the disc.) If I could give it a zero I would.Like I say your mileage may vary - but for me this is probably the worst film I've ever seen.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Both were ripe with humor, but this one seemed more in-your-face. The action, too, especially by the end. While the plot was even more extravagant this time around, there was a little bit of cleverness to it that the first lacked. This creativity was elaborated upon with the villain Poppy, who Julianne Moore played essentially on the same level of oddity as Samuel L Jackson did in the previous film. The only thing this one was short on was charisma; it wasn't all about the laughs and over-the-top action, however, it was at least seventy percent of the movie. Which gets tiring after a while and makes it impossible to take serious moments...well, seriously. Would recommend if you don't mind outrageous plots of espionage filled with action that borders on the silly and humor riddled with expletives. Likely accurate to the source material, I'd imagine.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's basically a reinvention of the James Bond franchise for younger generations, especially teenagers and young adults. The mixture of relentless action, British humor, a tiny shot of eroticism, exotic locations, twisted scenarios and spectacular special effects still works very well. What makes the Kingsman franchise special are the young and geeky main character, the connection to contemporary phenomenons such as social media activities and robotics as well as a more extreme mixture between situation comedy to lighten things up and visually explicit images to impress younger generations.There are only a few minor elements that are wrong with this sequel which is on the same level as the predecessor. First of all, the movie includes a few continuity mistakes such as car doors getting torn off just to look perfectly intact one shot later. This shows that the filmmaking process was slightly rushed and sloppy. Secondly, the movie overuses the use of stereotypes about the differences between American and British cultures. Especially the song Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver is overused in this film, especially since the movie takes mostly place in Kentucky and not in West Virginia. Thirdly and most importantly, the plot is also somewhat incoherent. It never becomes obvious why Harry suspects Whiskey to be a traitor. The idea that the villain placed antidotes in secret locations all around the world without even one of them being discovered is quite ridiculous as well. The way the Kingsmen finally discover Poppy's hideout in Cambodia doesn't make much sense either.In the end, Kingsma: The Golden Circle is an energizing, entertaining and fast-paced spy flick for teenagers and young adults. If you are open to pardon some obvious filmmaking and plot mistakes and just want to switch your brain off, you will certainly enjoy this slightly shallow film for what it is. I really liked the vivid ride but I wouldn't consider this film or the franchise a contemporary classic as many other people seem to do. It's fun but lacking substance to be more than just that.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only difference is the story is more drawn out and the action sequences are more outlandish. The characters are written like cartoon characters with a lot of them doing stupidly bizarre things throughout like the US president deciding to kill millions of people to beat the war on drugs and the villain turning people into literal ham burgers.Barely anything makes sense and it's really silly - There is no regard for the laws of physics, there are robot dogs, Elton John does a flying kick and the gadgets are insanely over the top. But it's all of this camp silliness what makes the film so much fun. The plot feels like a jumbled mess because of the multiple subplots, twists and it's numerous character arcs. Julianne Moore was an interesting casting choice for the villain and she has some great scenes too but unfortunately she's underused here.Golden Circle has many flaws but it's saved by its crazy action set pieces and they are a visual delight even if they sometimes retread a little bit from the first film. It's certainly one of those films you will enjoy if you appreciate dumb action films. It's ridiculous, illogical, silly fun and the action has been considerably amped up from the first film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Parts of it were good but I wasn't really a fan of the overabundance of stylistic action scenes and characters that I didn't care for. Wasn't looking forward to the second one but decided to see if Matthew Vaughn was going to be able to turn this film series around for me. I'm not overly fond of Vaughn's work though I did dig X-Men: First Class. With The Golden Circle, I think this film is definitely better than the first but still not that sold on Kingsman.In this film the world is under attack from a new threat. A rather great Julianne Moore plays Poppy Adams, who laces the drugs of the world with a toxin causing mass chaos among millions of people. Eggsy of the Kingsman reunites with Harry and the Kingsman work with a secret service from the South named the Statesman. This film makes use of a few A- listers. We've got Hally Berry, Channing Tatum, and Jeff Bridges added to the cast.The film ups the over the top ridiculous gadgets and improbable action scenes. It may be fun for some but I think it just feels really unrealistic and gimmicky. I get that the characters are sharply dressed, drink and present themselves like impeccably dressed agents. Its overbearing though. We kind of get it. The film is overlong, I don't think I felt the length however I think it becomes clear that the film runs out of steam 3/4 of the way through. Some of the action scenes are headache inducing and really desperately trying to be cutting edge.I still think the film is overall better than the first. Julianne Moore is actually great as a nice talking, homely, yet violent villain. I didn't mind Pedro Pascal and some of the other familiar faces added. I hated the inclusion and predominant use of Elton John. It wasn't funny and was just randomly weird. I know this film will please fans of the first film but its still not a great selling point as to why this franchise should be considered great. It has a few cool moments (Mark Strong and the rendition of Take Me Home, Country Roads is fantastic), but overall I found it to be as a better but still forgettable entry into the series.6.5/10","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Being a huge fan of the first film with how smart, funny, and entertaining it was, I had high hopes for this sequel, while knowing very well that it probably wasn't going to top it. That being said, this is a worthy successor in my opinion, and I feel as though it can be enjoyed in the same ways that the first was. Sure, the originality of it is thrown out the window, due to the fact that it shares very similar plot points, but if you care about the characters and are able to have fun, it really can't be all that bad. Even though it has many issues, here is why I believe Kingsman: The Golden Circle isn't getting enough credit. Pursued by an evil organization in The Golden Circle, the Kingsman are under attack and all of their bases have been destroyed. With nothing left to do but seek help, the remaining remnants of the once booming organization set out on their own. Eggsy and Merlin being the last two members, come across a group called the Statesman, who wants nothing more than to recruit them as one of their own and bring down this new and looming threat. While many of the elements of the original film are being rehashed here, it's all about being fun and having likable characters, and I feel as though this sequel continues that in spades. Although there are many enjoyably fun aspects to this film, it's far from perfect, and that's where villain in Poppy comes into play. Her character, along with this new organization seemed very annoying to me. Their presence definitely moves the film forward in terms of story, but the idea of them and their overall execution felt very over-the-top and forced, even for a film like this. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a film that suffers from having too many likable protagonists and not anyone remotely intriguing as a villain. This made for a fun experience when the main characters were on screen, but there didn't seem to be any stakes. Going back to my original statement in saying that this film is very similar to the predecessor in terms of entertainment, that's easily the biggest takeaway I received from this instalment. Without giving too much away for those who have been completely oblivious to the promotional material for this movie, I have to say that the way certain characters are brought back into the forefront and how others ave their swam song was very satisfying in my opinion. Aaron Egerton remains a stellar performer in every role he's in, and this film is no exception. Although inconsistent at times, this sequel is still a blast to watch. In the end, the over-the-top style isn't for everyone, and if you didn't enjoy the first film, then I would have to recommend staying far away from this film, due to the fact that it's more of the same, just cranked up to eleven. Kingsman: The Golden Circle suffers from a poor villain story line, but the addition of new characters showcasing some pretty terrific action sequences definitely make up for that aspect. This sequel won't be remembered as the superior film, nor will it be remembered as one of the best sequels out there, but when it comes to satisfying fans of a surprisingly fun first film, I feel as though this one does it's job nicely. It takes it to a few extremes that I didn't really appreciate, but overall, this is a solid time at the movies.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story is funny and light, but how it is carried out is nothing like 'light'. Vaughn considers every factor of a film to make the movie more powerful and absorbing, for example, sound, music, camera angle, camera movement, costumes, and set design. I can tell he has paid attention to these details, and all of them contribute to upgrade the quality of the movie.In the second Kingsman movie, audience can expect more flavorful, colorful, and diverse action. Of course the gentleman's action with far-advanced technology weaponry is included, mixed with a flavor of Western cowboy lasso. Dilemma of sophomore slump. The scale gets bigger; the casting includes more stars (in this case, Elton John who steals the show); however, the story seems redundant. Moreover, there is limit to ignoring protagonists' 'immortality', but bringing back to life of someone who's shot in the head goes overboard. There are some parts explaining rather than showing. However, overall, delightful, satisfying action spy movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film was once again directed by Matthew Vaughn, and written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman (the duo have co-written six screenplays together now). Original cast members Taron Egerton, Colin Firth (who's character presumably died in the original film), Mark Strong, Edward Holcroft and Sophie Cookson all reprise their roles in this sequel; while newcomers Julianne Moore, Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry, Hanna Alstrom, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Bruce Greewood, Emily Watson, and Elton John all join the cast. The story, this time, revolves around the Kingsmen having to team up with a similar team of American spies, in order to take on a new enemy in London. The movie has received mixed (to negative) reviews from critics (unlike the highly praised original), but it is expected to be another hit at the Box Office still though. Being a fan of the original, as well as Vaughn's other films, I was severely disappointed with this movie. The film takes place one year after the events of the original movie, when Eggsy Unwin (Egerton) is now the Kingsman's top operative, and he's also living with Princess Tilde (Alstrom) of Sweden. When all of the other Kingsmen are taken out in a missile attack, from a new enemy in London (called The Golden Circle), Unwin and Merlin (Strong) travel to Kentucky to meet their American counterparts (called The Statesman). They learn that The Golden Circle, lead by Poppy Adams (Moore), has laced every recreational drug with a deadly toxin. Adams demands that the President of the United States (Greenwood) ends his war on drugs, in order for her to release the antidote that can cure everyone. The British and American agents must team together in order to save millions. The movie is bigger than the original, in almost every way, including a much bigger cast of celebrities and even more over-the- top action scenes. Still, despite all of this, the movie feels so much smaller in comparison, for what it's able to accomplish. Some of it is fun, but it's mostly just a big mess, and I was bored for most of it's extremely excessive 2 hours and 21 minutes running length. Seeing as how Vaughn and Goldman have produced much better films together, in the past, this movie was a big disappointment for me. The action scenes are boring, a lot of the humor is humorless, and the celebrities are often more of a distraction than an actual addition of talent. I sure hope the next 'KINGSMAN' movie is a lot better.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/234520321","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Do not worry if you haven't seen the first one because the movie explains a bit of what happened before the main character became Kingsman and it is easy to follow. The story is summarized in two elite secret organizations which must band together to defeat a common enemy that wants to take over the world. In a nutshell, I found it to be quite a plain movie with predictable twists and basic plot. I got already bored past the first hour of the movie and even though it as decent I just kept wishing the end was near.There were many things that didn't work out for me including the lack of catchy lines, wit references and clever cultural jokes which leads to forceful laughs. However, what really saddens me is the lack of character development as they had great actors on their hands and could've taken much more advantage of them but for some reason they decided not to. I didn't even felt moved when strong emotionally charged scenes took place. The only thing that may have saved this movie from being a total let down is the fact that has some cool action scenes mixed with a great cast whose performances are unfortunately limited because of their obvious script. In addition to this, I enjoyed the British scenery and the way they linked and compared it with the American culture. It is visually satisfying. Also, in the running of the movie you get used to the vulgar humour that you actually find yourself falling for the childish wordplay. To sum up, I do not regret the choice I made to watch this movie and even though it is clearly flawed it is still decent and I would recommend it to watch it a Sunday afternoon if you want to slightly entertain yourself and basically kill the time.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Even more over-the-top than its predecessor, this overlong and overstuffed 'Kingsman' sequel still offers plenty of fun but is also a lot more cartoonish and a lot less lively","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3811229/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","21 September 2017","As is typical for a sequel of this nature, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' succumbs to the tendency to do everything its predecessor did bigger, louder and wilder.That pretty much sums up the rollicking car chase scene which kicks off the movie, as our teenage protagonist Eggsy (Taron Edgerton) finds himself attacked by a former turncoat Kingsman agent Charlie (Edward Holcroft) whom he thought had perished. Besides their close- quarter skirmish in the back of a retrofitted London cab careening down the streets of London at night, Eggsy also finds himself shot at by heavily armed gunmen on three other vehicles, which he eventually takes out with a trio of miniature missiles in the middle of a park.Soon after, the entire Kingsman is nearly wiped out, save for Eggsy and his handy tech guru Merlin (Mark Strong), triggering the so- called 'doomsday' protocol that has both of them travelling to Kentucky to seek the help of their US counterpart called the Statesmen. There is now not one but two espionage organisations, and consequently a surfeit of secret agents joining the fold, including Statesmen head Champagne (Jeff Bridges), trigger-happy Tequila (Channing Tatum), tech nerd Ginger Ale (Halle Berry) and Burt Reynolds-style Western hero Whiskey (Pedro Pascal). Oh yes, the other audience favourite Harry Hart (Colin Firth) whom was shot point-blank in the head in the first movie is back too, courtesy of a McGuffin that inadvertently sucks any sense of real-life peril from the proceedings.But then again, the same can be said of the cartoonish villain this time round – a nefarious drug kingpin named Poppy (Julianne Moore) who lives in her '50s 'Happy Days' vision of Middle America, complete with movie house, hair salon and diner, right in the heart of a remote Cambodian jungle village she calls 'Poppy Land'. Using her global domination of the drug business, she threatens to kill millions of people infected by her poisoned 'weed' unless the US President (Bruce Greenwood) legalises drugs. The caricature doesn't stop there; she has two killer robot dogs to protect her as well as a kidnapped Elton John (no kidding!) for her own entertainment/ amusement. It's silly all right and even more kiddish than before, notwithstanding Poppy's penchant for turning her disloyal subjects into cheeseburger filling using a heavy-duty industrial meat-grinder.There is indeed a lot going on at the same time – on top of taking down Poppy and her henchman Charles, Eggsy has to contend with a somewhat off-form Harry who doesn't quite have the same aim, reflexes and worse, occasionally experiences fluttery butterfly hallucinations (before he chose military service, Harry had ambition to be a lepidopterist); a third-act turn also has Harry suspecting that Agent Whiskey has been working against them all along; and last but not least, a US President who has schemed to let millions of infected people, including his own Chief of Staff (Emily Watson), perish in order to fulfil his personal agenda of ending the war on drugs in one fell swoop. Yet even at close to two-and-a-half-hours, director Matthew Vaughn and his long-time screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman struggle to tie all the strands together compellingly, resulting therefore in a narrative that has a lot of ideas spinning around but not quite cohering fully with one another.That many characters and story lines also means less time for Eggsy or for that matter, Eggsy and Merlin as well as Eggsy and Harry, the sum of which arguably gave the first movie genuine poignancy alongside its madcap action. Without a similarly robust emotional anchor, Vaughn predictably ratchets up the scale and tempo of the big action set-pieces, although none quite matches the same breath-taking audacity as the piece de resistance from the previous movie (remember the church massacre?). There is a bar fight which sees Agent Whiskey teach some sneering local troublemakers a lesson with his electric lasso (which is intentionally reminiscent of an iconic sequence in the last movie when Harry was in much better shape), followed by a wild shootout at a deserted lodge high up in the snowy Italian mountainside (which is also intentionally reminiscent of the classic James Bond flick 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'), and finally the climactic showdown at Poppy Land that sees Eggsy and Harry (with Elton as an unlikely ally, no less) confront their arch nemesis and her array of gadgets. To be sure, Vaughn hasn't lost his imagination, verve or irreverence in the able blend of high-octane action and tongue-in-cheek humour, and these aggressively stylised sequences are undoubtedly the highlight of the film and worth the price of admission alone; but the generous use of blood and gore doesn't disguise the fact that the loss of danger diminishes the thrill and edge in the original.If therefore your intent is to enjoy more of the same stylistic pizazz which Vaughn brought to the breathless fight scenes, then 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' will surely satisfy – not only in its audacious defiance of the law of physics but also in its signature trick of making them sequences look like one single, long, unbroken shot. As with its predecessor, this sequel is firmly rooted in Vaughn's vision of the Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic-book series as an over-the-top James Bond pastiche that cranks up the graphic violence while retaining the classic spy franchise's classy air of sophistication. To be sure, we never expected the sequel to feel as fresh and original as its predecessor, but by trying to do so, it inadvertently turns what made it unique into sheer overkill, further exacerbated by a bloated plot that feels busy yet laboured at the same time. It is still plenty of fun all right, but it is nowhere as exciting, lively or distinctive as its claim to fame.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Matthew Vaughn has taken the spy genre and turned it up by 9000. I'm talking a taxi that transforms from a normal car, to a speedy car to a submarine. A suitcase that acts as a gun, body shield and missile launcher all-in-one. Even a whip that becomes a lasso that cuts through people. This pretty much explains director Vaughn's problem, he went too far. Like a mad man not knowing when to stop. Unfortunately he did not put his resources and ingenuity into the plot. A deluded business woman called Poppy Adams has devised a recreational drug that will kill everyone who consumes it through a gruelling four stage process (that does include dancing). It's up to the disbanded Kingsman to join their American brothers, Statesman, to stop her and save the world. Eggsy also has a girlfriend. Harry is still alive (completely shoe-horned in). The President of America sees this problem as a solution, as it terminates all the drug users in the world. So yes, it's rather over stuffed but fortunately it's 140 minutes long so it never feels too rushed. Just messy. However I cannot deny that I was thoroughly entertained and thought the pacing was consistently good. All performances were enjoyable, particularly Mark Strong and Taron Egerton (who finally has his name on the poster this time around). Julianne Moore was wasted, I absolutely despise an action film where the antagonist is just there to further the plot! Valentine was so good in its predecessor that he is constantly referenced with multiple expositional scenes. Adams was just a wasted character and her demise was borderline lazy. To counteract this, we have Elton John. Yes, Sir Elton John. Incredibly hilarious. Ridiculously stupid. I loved it. If a film can have him enter a scene grinning whilst ""Rocket Man"" plays...well it's just a winner. The action was well executed with Vaughn's visual flair garnished on top. A decent sequel, just no where near as brilliant as the first.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No big spoilers or anything, but there's a certain scene with an electric lasso and one scene with a different kind of sexual encounter that opened my eyes wide open. Anyway, this is a fun movie, and the connection to the American equivalent to the Kingsman is clever.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It does keep some of the key elements that made the movie refreshing and fun: over the top and unashamedly comicbookey action, a sense of reality that is purposefully ridiculously stretched to the limit and some ludicrous characters.Your mileage *will* vary: Kingsman can be an acquired taste and is not for everyone. But this new episode does build on the lore by adding the American Agency to the mix, more exotic and varied locations ... to a certain extent becomes more Hollywood than its predecessor. It is still very entertaining, very funny and very good visually.It has lost the element of surprise, has less 'british phlegm' than the predecessor so is probably slightly less good... but still, very very fun!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This ends up making the movie much more boring than the previous film.Overall, you could probably give this movie a watch if you've got nothing better to watch, but it's certainly not one of those movies that you can watch 4 or 5 times before getting bored like you could do with the previous Kingsman film... 6/10, let's just hope that the 3rd installment will be better","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie sounds false, the cinematography is completely saturated, which at the beginning of the film, all the action sequences look like false and consequently all the excitement and adrenaline goes down the drain. I say sewers. Sorry. After all, the main character at the beginning of the movie will stop at the sewers to go to see his girlfriend. Yes, that's where this movie belongs.In other words, an annoying and boring action movie, we have here. Because of that, the film changes from set piece to set piece, yet the scenes are poorly structured, the scenes are saturated, with the pace to be slow as a turtle, which makes the scenes that should be fun to see, in empty action scenes without any impact, example each punch that a character gives to another character does not have any impact, so does not have emotion or excitement.Not only that, as the characters have such exaggerated action scenes, these action scenes make the action sequences of the superheroes films tiny in comparison. Remember, they are not beings with superpowers, but simple humans. The feeling of danger or death ends up completely disappearing. And in the end, we end up not caring about the fate of the characters which are in the movie itself. Or better, the characters who had nothing interesting to connect with the audience since the beginning of the film. The characters are generics and poorly executed and written.If an action movie, can not produce good sequences of action, for what purpose this movie exists, anyway? This movie also does not convince anyone as a spy movie because the film is not serious enough and as a comedy movie, the elements of comedy are too bad to laugh, that is, the film still fails because the movie itself has no definite tone, so, is this a action movie? a comedy or a traditional spy movie? Apparently nobody knows, not even the filmmakers themselves.Not to mention, the acting sucks too. Halle berry, should have stopped acting since the last 10 years. Julianne Moore, why are you here? You also do not convince anyone in an action movie. Stay in your dramas. I do not remember, the acting of the other actors. This movie so passable and generic. A film to avoid totally, to speak the truth.","45 out of 99 found this helpful.

Such an elegant phrase that got millions all fired up years ago in preparation for the spy action flick of the season. Kingsman was a smashing success back in the day for me, and when I saw a sequel coming, I may have squealed in glee a tiny bit. Yet, I feared that a sequel could smudge the adventure I enjoyed so much, especially with the expanded cast. So tonight, I put on my suit (or t-shirt) and hit the theater to scope out the next mission. Was the mission a success? Read on to find out friends. LIKES:Funny: Remember that edgy humor the first Kingsman had? Well the magic continues my friends, as Kingsman2 is certainly Golden in much of its comedic bite. It starts like always with the banter between agents, well-timed and well-delivered by our cast to maximize the punch at hand. Then comes the reactions of our agents as their thrown ridiculous curve balls, or baseballs at points, meant to hinder their way. Yet the cameo by a certain celebrity might have been a major source of gut busting guffaws. I won't reveal who it is (I leave that to the Internet), but get ready to laugh so hard you might cry with his ""rock n roll' themed lines. Emotional: Surprisingly, Kingsman 2 may be more heart wrenching than the first movie. Eggsy's next stage of life has more than enough sad moments that will slow the adrenaline ride down, like those stubborn speedbumps in a parking lot, or a Game of Thrones episode. Character development is certainly stronger than ever in this movie, pushing our lead protagonist to levels we never really thought he would have to face. All these challenges keep you invested in Eggsy, Merlin, and others for the second round, making for a more immersive experience. Fast Paced: Kingsman 2 may run for 2.5 hours, but it certainly doesn't feel like it at all to me. With all the laughs, emotional investment, and action, you'll experience a time warp to the end of the film. I certainly did not feel bored in this movie at all, and was quite pleased by the entertainment it brought. To have that pace and the decent balance brought with it, is not something you see in most films. Action: Of course my favorite aspect has to be the action packed into the film on many levels. Kingsman 2 keeps up the high energy infused sequences that are about guns, melee, gadgets, and over the top stunts. Eggsy and the gang bring their skills back in high definition, special effects crazy goodness, with a fantastic play list to further amp things up. This dynamic was maintained through most of the movie, keeping things interesting with new gadgets to tear baddies a new one with. Despite a few missed moments, the action is certainly the selling point of this movie, especially with its integration into the plot and the pertinence to the mission. Throw in stable camera work and editing, and you just maximize the excitement of this film. DISLIKES: Ridiculousness: Don't get me wrong, the absurdity of this film is one of those charming qualities that got me into the movie. However, in this sequel, that level sometimes went a little too far outside reality to take away from the atmosphere they were creating. If the stunts aren't too far-fetched for you, then the invulnerability, or medical technology feats will have you rolling their eyes as they reach preposterous proportions. It fits in the comedic spoof theme, but feels out of place at times and took a little away from the suspense. This is only a small dislike. Viscous nature: I like a good action movie, and darkness can certainly open the gates to maximize the violence we love to see our actors perform. They unfortunately overstep their boundaries at times, crossing into the darker world I like to avoid if possible. Some rather gruesome deaths and blood bashings are the first scratches that chinked my armor. While a few are obviously computer generated, the special effects craft some rather scarring images that won't leave my memory anytime soon. Even worse though, is the cruelty to animals in this film. You know I hate unnecessary hurting of our furrier friends, but Kingsman was not hesitant to go the distance of getting emotional responses by this means. Not cool for me, but if you lack that empathy, you'll shrug it off like the agent's credo. Wasted Characters: Kingsman has a lot of great actors, with much of our cast reprising their roles in style and to great heights. Even newcomers like Julianne Moore as an eccentric villain, or Halle Berry as a tech geek, get applause from me. Hollywood though fails to live up to utilizing all their characters to the same degreeagain. Agents who survived the wraith of the last film are reduced to the background with little remorse, making small contributions at the best. New agent wise don't count on eye candy Channing Tatum to do much better, resorting to one action scene, and more modeling in an Abercrombie and Fitch manner. Why he doesn't get a serious chance? I can't answer, but I was disappointed with his involvement in the film. VERDICT:Overall, I was very pleased with this sequel and enjoyed the thrill of returning to the frontlines of the spy war. A compelling story with much emotion, amidst comedy and high speed action are the selling points to this film. Yet, the ridiculousness of the stunts, amidst the brutal kills shots and wasted characters takes away from the movie. Still, it's worth a trip to the theater and I encourage you to hit the theaters to experience the stunts in full glory and enjoy another fun action adventure. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

This one took itself a little bit too seriously at times. Also the story itself was not as fun as in the first one, all in all they overdid everything. Taron Egerton was fun as in the first one and gave the finest performance in the film. Colin Firth was all right but can do better, he was very much reduced. Julianne Moore was not great. I was really looking forward to see her playing a villain but the result was disappointing. Overacting and really not great at all. Thats not her material. I mean she was not awful or anything but based on her usual standards really not brilliant. Its sad to see that an Oscar winning actress like Halle Berry needs to reduce herself to second hand roles that easily could have been a breakout role for a newcomer or something. I still don't get why Channing Tatum was there as he was totally useless. Jeff Bridges was wasted in a very one dimensional role. But he obviously had fun playing it. Nice to see small fine turns by Bruce Greenwood and Emily Watson. Don't get me started on Elton John. Nice gimmick but they really, really stretched it. Good to see Mark Strong again who was decent. The action scenes were great though, especially the opening one, maybe a bit over styled and of course unrealistic but they were intend to be that. Good soundtrack as well. But one of the biggest problems was that it was absolutely overlong and they could have cut half of it and it still would be the same (maybe better) product.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"4","/10","By no means the disaster many have cited, but The Golden Circle is both silly and plain boring","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4015383/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","27 December 2017","Having directed no fewer than three comic-book adaptations with Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and Kingsman: The Secret Service, it's a wonder director Matthew Vaughn has taken so long to deliver a sequel. Kingsman took over 400 million at the box-office and was one of the surprise successes of 2014, and with critical and audience responses both overwhelmingly positive for the My Fair Lady-meets-James Bond spy comedy, a sequel was always going to be on the cards. With The Golden Circle, Vaughn and returning screenwriter Jane Goldman have taken the route of most sequels and made everything bigger, but not necessarily better. The Golden Circle may please some fans of the original with its lashings of ultra-violence and colourful language, but I suspect many will become sickly with the film's desire to throw everything at the screen to see what sticks.A year on from preventing Samuel L. Jackson's plan to wipe out the majority of the world's population using mania-inducing SIM cards, and Eggsy (Taron Egerton) has settled well within the ranks of the Kingsman and has shacked up with Princess Tilde of Sweden (Hanna Alstrom). One night he is attacked by a former foe he had long thought dead: Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), the failed Kingsman applicant believed to have perished in the head-exploding finale of the previous film. Charlie is alive and well, and has been fitted with a hi-tech bionic arm capable of brute strength. Eggsy manages to overcome Charlie, but the severed arm hacks its way into the Kingsman's computer system. Soon enough, the majority of Britain's finest secret service has been taken out by long-range missiles. Along with Merlin (Mark Strong), Eggsy travels to the U.S. to investigate a clue left in the agency's Doomsday protocol, and discover a sister agency named the Statesman led by the gruff Champagne (Jeff Daniels).The Statesman are like the Kingsman, only instead of bespoke suits and good table manners, they dress like cowboys and have nicknames based on alcoholic beverages. Channing Tatum's Tequila is first to greet them, and is understandably suspicious of this shadowy agency operating without their knowledge. There's also Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), and Merlin-equivalent tech genius Ginger Ale (Halle Berry). The bad guy this time around is Poppy (Julianne Moore), a Martha Stewart-like drug baron hiding out in Cambodia. Her master plan is to infect all users of her various drugs with a toxin that will soon cause their deaths unless the U.S. President puts an end to the War on Drugs. Poppy's outlandish plan, which would seem to damage Poppy's trade if successful or offer the President a chance to rid the world of drug abusers and Poppy's customers, is one of many problems with The Golden Circle. Armed with robot dogs and a kidnapped Elton John in an appearance that goes way beyond mere cameo, Vaughn and Goldman seem happy to suck out all sense of reality for this sequel, and with it have considerably lowered the stakes.The movie's most glaring problem, however, is the return of Colin Firth's Harry Hart. Most of us were shocked and saddened when he received a bullet to the face from Samuel L. Jackson following the original's most spectacular scene, but to bring him back feels cheap, removing any sense of peril in the process. The action scenes, which involve everything from an electric whip to a man-chomping meat-grinder, rely heavily on CGI. The Secret Service did this too, but it also used practical effects to retain a sense of physicality when Harry was hacking, shooting and burning his way through a Church full of bigoted psychopaths. The newcomers all do well despite being left in the background for the majority of the running-time, with Tatum especially barely registering before he is placed into a coma. Highlights include Egerton's beautiful jaw-line and Strong's deadpan Merlin, but there is little resembling the freshness of the first film, which also managed to keep its outrageous ambitions in check by structuring the plot around Eggsy's Kingsman training. The Golden Circle is by no means the disaster many critics have cited, but by striding to take things to the next level, Vaughn has made Kingsman both cringe-inducingly silly and plain boring.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

That is not to say we're dealing with high art here. In fact, some of the scenes were borderline cringeworthy, a combination of bad acting, bad script and bad direction. You know those movies that put an actor without giving him any lines and he has to listen to the main character and put a weird smile or node because he isn't allowed to speak? This movie is full of those. There were some clichés and the CGI was also average.Still, it was fun. Nonstop over-the-top action that doesn't take itself too seriously and is very enjoyable. The movie doesn't waste any time and starts the action right from the first minute. There is a subplot involving a main character that in my opinion was completely unnecessary and could have been discarded.Recommended","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Too much focus is spent on special effects while attention to good substance is lost in this installment. In short, it's as if Michael Bay oversaw this tragic mess. The acting (If most of the dialogue is excluded) stunk to high hell and clearly the costume designer had the weekend off. OK, let's get right to it. This is not good story telling. I need more lines so, the actors, director, and whatnot can only work with what they are given. And, in this case, they weren't given very much. The writing is still what I have a problem with and that is the meat of any film. The issues I have with this film would have turned a much better book worthy of the silver screen into a silly soap opera with guns. As it stands the movie even as a y.a. revival needed improvement but the second film could've done well what the first did poorly, enhancing it to be even more exciting. I'm sure that those true fans were greatly let down.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now the sequel is here, and while it isn't quite as good as the original, it's still a worthy follow up that wisely sticks to what made the last one work.Most of you will already be familiar with the Kingsmen, the oh so British spy agency cleverly disguised as a tailor's shop, and with our hero Eggsy. This film wastes no time in utterly destroying the organization, forcing Eggsy and his sole remaining Kingsman to seek help from their American cousins, the Statesmen, who are every bit as Southern as the Kingsmen are English. And the need all the help they can get to defeat the secretive, globe spanning drug cartel known as The Golden Circle and their rather eccentric leader, Poppy.Julian Moore is delightfully quirky and quite fascinating as Poppy. She's a billionaire drug kingpin with a powerful sense of nostalgia for 1950's America and a personality that's equal parts cheery suburban housewife and ruthless psychopath. One minute she's cheerfully inviting you to sit down for dinner in her spotless diner. The next she's feeding you to her robot dogs. In her own peculiar way, she makes an even better villain than Samuel L Jackson's corporate ecoterrorist.As before, Kingsmen really delivers the action. From the very beginning there are fistfights, shootouts and explosions aplenty, all beautifully shot. The freewheeling taxi chase is every bit as awesome as it looks in the trailers. Eggsy's showdown with his bionic armed rival is suitably intense and stylized, and Agent Whiskey has some very impressive moves with lasso and bull whip. But the best part is the uniquely manic choreography of the final fight scene, in which multiple fights take place simultaneously, seemingly in fast forward, as frantic music plays.Kingsmen also delivers more than a few laughs. Be warned, the humor here is not for the easily offended. It's also somewhat broader than last time, especially in relation to the Statesmen's American stereotypes. There's also less of the biting satire that pervaded the original (although sharp eyed viewers will note several references to Connery and Moore era Bond films.) That said, between slapstick, better than average sex gags, and moments of sheer absurdity, there's plenty of good comedic material.But none of it comes close to Elton John. Celebrity guest appearances are generally something of a dicey proposition. There's always the risk that it will seem gimmicky, or that the filmmakers will rest at having the celeb appear on screen and assume that audiences will find it amusing. But here Sir Elton is in full form as the whiny, demanding prima donna/hostage, leaving no doubt that the bitch is indeed back. And you have not truly lived until you've seen Elton John going all kung-fu while wearing a garishly colored bird costume.I should probably address the controversial tracker implantation scene. It is fairly tasteless and offensive, but also absolutely hilarious and fitting with the movie's overall tone. What I found far more objectionable was the cannibalism scene near the beginning. It does serve to drive home the villain's sheer evilness, but it's extremely cringe inducing and unfunny.Now for the bad. Golden Circle admittedly doesn't offer much in the way of clever new twists on its predecessor. It's also a little too gory in a few places, a little longer than it needs to be, and perhaps a just a bit too over the top for its own good. So I can understand why many critics haven't been as kind this time around. But for viewers who enjoyed the first Kingsmen, this should hit the spot.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Throw in Elton John playing himself and you'd think that would a rich enough cast-list. But we also have Poppy Delevingne, older sister of the model Cara Delevingne, Emily Watson (Elsa Einstein in ""Genius""), and Pedro Pascal (Oberyn Martell in ""Game Of Thrones"").From the opening fight sequence in a racing London cab, the action is furious and massively enhanced by CGI so that it all looks utterly fantastical. There's a magical lasso, following in the path of a similar device in ""Wonder Woman"", and some scary mechanical apparatus such as robot killer dogs and a giant meat grinder. Four-letter expletives are commonplace, but the most offensive element is a scene at Glastonbury music festival involving a miniature tracking device which surely goes beyond the bounds of decency even for the ""Kingsman"" franchise. But, perhaps not, because director of both movies Matthew Vaughn and his co-writer of both scripts Jane Goldman are obviously determined to see how far they can subvert the James Bond formula for a new, usually younger, audience.

Kingsman The Secret Service was a pleasant surprise in early 2015, proving that there's still room for originality in adapting comic book properties. However, The Golden Circle pretty much doubles down on every insane aspect of the first film, all while throwing out the heart and soul that was impressively touched upon in the first.Now I'm not going as far as saying I don't like the film, I actually enjoyed the theater experience, but it just feels like a disappointing renewal of the property. What felt fresh in Secret Service, feels like a complete re-hash. Julianne Moore plays Poppy, an infamous drug lord who spends her days on an island no one knows how to reach. She decides to use her power to infect a good portion of the world's population in an attempt to convince the President to stop the war on drugs. On one hand, it's the type of crazy plot that served the first Kingsman well, but on the other hand, it's PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME PLOT AS THE FIRST FILM. And it plays out in almost exactly the same way.If you're going to bring back Colin Firth as an emotional connection to Eggsy, then why not somehow tie the villain into Firth somehow? Poppy does her fair share of evil things to Eggsy, but I feel like even those losses aren't anything that made me feel bad for Eggsy. Instead, I just got ticked off at the events that took place. I just can't get behind some of the character choices that the writers made. That's not even mentioning the problem I have with bringing Firth back in the first place. It's exactly the same problem I have with Marvel bringing Coulson back. The whole point is that these characters are motivated to defeat their enemies because of the losses they go through. You just can't wipe away a major event because the character is beloved by fans.Enough ranting, though. The Kingsman are joined by The Statesman here as their pursuit of Poppy leads them to team up with their counterparts to defeat a common enemy. With that conjunction, comes new characters to like played by Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry, and Jeff Bridges. All good actors, but besides Pascal, none of them get a whole lot to do. Pascal is the clear standout, with a whip as a weapon (which is basically an Indiana Jones lasso on steroids), with Tatum having a cool action sequence and Bridges having a few typically chill Bridges lines.The film is also 12 minutes longer than the original, and you definitely feel it. When you can feel the length of an action film that doesn't have a lot of down time, then you know there's something wrong. I honestly can't pin point the reason why all of these aspects don't work in The Golden Circle but worked well in The Secret Service, other than the lack of originality and freshness. I hate when I spend an entire review (or more like a reaction) describing things I was disappointed with, when in reality, it's not a bad film at all. But sometimes it's easier to point out flaws than it is things you like because those are far more expected. Perhaps I'll appreciate the insanity more on repeated viewing.6.3/10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

You know what quite possibly as he finally decided to make a sequel and I think many of his concerns are in play here.Now don't get me wrong when I did laugh I laughed heavily, what's more concerning is that a big portion of these laughs came from Elton John's involvement, the idea of The Statesman in principle is a great further idea in the Kingsman world but were they an absolute necessity to the plot in this film? Think of the two biggest players on that side in Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges and think 'did I get my money's worth?' the answer for me is emphatically no and I just won't have the argument they are building to their larger involvement in another sequel, sorry that just doesn't satisfy me for the reason they were an active ingredient in this film.Here's the thing...the best explanation/comparison I can give is to compare both Guardians of the Galaxy and Kingsman: The Secret Service, the impact of both films were pretty similar, both were surprise box office and critical hits with much of the praise going to the performance of the actors and generally the characters interactions therefore funny scriptwork, whereas yes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doesn't particularly move a lot along storywise it did continue to entertain throughout and this is where Kingsman: The Golden Circle falls flat as although yes this is a very serviceable sequel as is generally competently made it doesn't feel like it particularly moves anything along but the main problem is it can't quite keep up the hit rate of entertaining interactions in the process, there's a quite stunning final fight scene with some good satirical political humour in play so there are great positives to shout about but maybe it's just me but I've come out more frustrated with wasted potential for this entry and I really wanted to love it as well but there we go","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

In the process, the movies can devolve into a cookie cutter action movie. So it goes with Kingsman 2, but are we having fun along the way? In a goofy early 1980s James Bond kind of way. This sequel accomplishes what the first film did, by adding many comic (mostly comic book but also humour elements) bits to keep it from falling into cliché' storytelling. Sure the villain's lair is dumb, but Julianne Moore can do it with a straight face. There are flashy action scenes that kept my interest (the cable car sequence especially). There were a few too many subplots that drag the film into extra innings. The cartoonish evil plot to destroy mankind sometimes didn't mix with the R rated content. I enjoyed the expansion of the Kingsmen universe with the U.S. based Statesmen. It displayed how we can take this 'essence' of a country and represent it with deeply symbolic items. One great example is the character of Whiskey. A young Burt Reynolds look-alike, he is a caricature of a super cowboy with a magic lasso. The big budget film throws in gadgets and some extreme locations. For instance, part of the villain's operation is on a mountaintop, making for big action sequences, and of course blowing things up. I also liked the supporting characters bouncing off our protagonist Eggsy. It gives him some depth while at the same time a dash of debonair. The return of Colin Firth, who was a major asset in the first film, is oversold. His return is slow and one of the subplots that drag the film down. In general, I think the script could have been honed a bit, thinning out some of the extraneous stuff. For instance, there was a subplot about some dude who lived in China that I can't remember going anywhere. The problem with a summer blockbuster film is the big setup for the 3rd act. At that point, the movie is juggling too many balls in the air, and needs to resolve each story thread before we can all go home. One trap in that situation is that too much exposition is required to setup the predicament and explain what needs to be done to resolve it. I suppose the biggest complaint is the discord in tone between the cheeky spoof of spy movies with the intent to feel genuine concern about the fate of our main characters. It is hard though to extend your concern to too many characters. For the most part I had fun, the pacing allowed me to forgive some of the obligatory exposition, and didn't get too worn out at the end.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Okay the first one was better but that's almost all the time the case with movies like that. It's still better than any James Bond movie to me though. The cast in Kingsman: The Golden Circle is top notch. Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Julianne Moore, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges and Pedro Pascal are all a delight to watch in their respective characters. Halle Berry is the exception to me. I don't think she's a great actress and I never will think it. The story is again candy for the eye with a lot of fast action scenes, good special effects and new interesting spy gadgets. I hope there will be more Kingsman movies. If they are all this kind of quality than they can make more Kingsman than James Bond movies.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Saving the world is good and all that however, saving the world while looking sharp and acting like a gentleman is exactly what made the world fall in love with them when they first burst on to our screens in 2014's Kingsman: The Secret Service. Would they be able to recapture the same magic in this sequel though?Eggsy (Taran Egerton) and the rest of the Kingsman must stop the maniacal Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) from holding the world hostage. To do so, they must team with an allied spy organisation from the U.S. known as Statesman.Opening with a pulsating action sequence that finds Eggsy try and escape enemies in a black cab through the streets of London, Kingsman: The Golden Circle soon becomes a bit of a bloated affair, its near two-and-a-half hour runtime way too long for a film of this ilk. It's the array of subplots and over-indulgence in Elton John scenes that drag the film down a level. There's still plenty of fun to be had mind, Matthew Vaughn certainly not forgetting the comic book roots with both incredibly over-the-top action and corny dialogue aplenty. It's foul-mouthed and crude, the Glastonbury tent antics being high on the list of scenes that will most likely receive complaints however, the energy that the first possessed is sapped by the overbearing narrative.If you're expecting to see something to rival the church scene from the first film then you'll only leave disappointed but I'm glad they didn't just try and copy what was so successful before. Free Bird suited the craziness of that scene incredibly well and Vaughn finds another musical number to perfectly accompany such a pivotal sequence in John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Roads. To say which scene would be a pretty big spoiler so I'll let you discover it for yourselves.Coming to the performances, this is a well performed sequel that sees a number of favourites return alongside the new cast who fit the series seamlessly. Taron Egerton proves again why he's one of the most sought after younger actors working today, maintaining chemistry with whoever Eggsy crosses paths with. Julianne Moore is clearly having a ball as the villain of the piece while Pedro Pascal delights as Agent Whiskey, the Statesman agent ordered to help Eggsy put a stop to Adams' plan. Mark Strong, Channing Tatum, Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges ensure the film remains high in entertainment value while Elton John's cameo will have you laughing out loud, even if he does show up a few too many times.Kingsman: The Golden Circle retains the fun factor a film like this requires but it's the drawn out narrative that makes it suffer a little. Interactions between the Kingsman and Statesman leaves me excited for the potential of a third film where my best advice to everybody involved would be to keep it simple.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

Together, the Kingsman & the Statesman have to join forces, to stop an imminent threat to the world. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is an awesome film. Director Matthew Vaughn has made sure to keep all the elements, that made Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014) a massive success. The action set pieces are mind-blowing. All the action scenes have been taken several notches higher, compared to the original. My favorites are the cable car scene & the climax. The visual effects are superb. However, this movie is not as hilarious as the first. Don't get me wrong. There are a number of scenes that make you cackle. It's just that, the humor was more fresh in the previous film. If I had to choose, I'd say Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014) is a bit superior to Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Taron Egerton is spectacular as Eggsy. Colin Firth is brilliant as Harry Hart. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin. Julianne Moore is outstanding as Poppy. Pedro Pascal is fantastic as Whiskey. Halle Berry is great as Ginger. Edward Holcroft is impressive as Charlie. Hanna Alstrom is good as Princess Tilde. Elton John is hysterical as Elton John. Poppy Delevingne is effective as Clara. Michael Gambon, Sophie Cookson, Bruce Greenwood & Emily Watson are perfect as Arthur, Roxy, President of the United States & Chief of Staff Fox, respectively. Channing Tatum & Jeff Bridges are underutilized in their roles as Tequila & Champ, respectively. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a must watch for fans of Kingsman: The Secret Service(2014).

And so, here we are looking at his second film, a logical continuation of the story of the first.We see an attempt to smooth out some rough edges that were criticized in the first film: unlike what happened before, and except for some more bizarre deaths, it is a more serious bet on the family segment, with no problems regarding graphic violence and gore. Matthew Vaughn did a satisfactory job of balancing action and humor, and reinforcing the dose of choreographed and flashy fights and spy gadgets, where the technical and effects department had enough ground to shine. The soundtrack isn't bad, maintaining the essentials of the first film, and the cinematography and costumes work. The editing is very well done, and despite being a very long film for the genre, this is not a really important problem.The script is fun and entertains the audience well, trying to maintain the quality of the previous work. However, he is forced to make concessions: the character of Colin Firth, who was applauded for his work in the first film, is resurrected, and the film's setting is, almost entirely, the USA. In fact, the inclusion of an American spy organization hidden in a bourbon whiskey distillery in the middle of Kentucky, although well framed by the script, is still just a maneuver to win over the country's box office. With an aggravating factor: the North American characters are clichés and behave like simple cowboys, with more agility and physical strength than brains and tactical thinking. Everything a spy would need the less, in life or fiction. Finally, a note about the villain: despite the actress's efforts, the character is bad, was poorly thought out and poorly developed, in a kind of kitsch revivalist delirium without any sense or taste.Once again, Colin Firth does an impeccable and praiseworthy job. Taron Egerton appears more mature and resilient, more capable of ensuring the protagonism required of him. Mark Strong is also excellent, largely because he had better material in this film, where his character has a lot more centrality. Jeff Bridges is also good enough for the job. Unfortunately, there are several actors who were not given decent characters or material, and who struggle against this without great results. That's the case of Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum and Halle Berry. They are good, they do what they can with what they are given, but it is a vain effort.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film editing keeps the action sequences kinetic, though it tends to go overboard, sacrificing clarity for extravagance. Its strength lies in the continued irreverence towards the spy genre conventions, providing us with quirky gadgets and explosive set pieces. However, the weakness comes in the form of an overstuffed plot that lacks the streamlined elegance of the first film.

In this sequel to 2014's Kingsman: The Secret Service, a new mysterious drug cartel known only as ""The Golden Circle"" are causing trouble for the Kingsman, resulting in a team up with their American counterparts: The Statesmen.Kingsman: The Secret Service was one of my favourite films of 2014. From its incredible use of Lynard Skynard's ""Free Bird"" in the mesmerisingly energetic church sequence to the characters seemingly ripped straight from the page of a comic book, it was a reinvigoration of a genre long in need of some fresh charisma. Therefore, hopes were high for the sequel. The marketing painted the film as Kingsman, but bigger, louder and crazier than before, and in that regard they did not disappoint. Within the first five minutes we have been thrust into the first action set piece of many, there are more characters, more crazy gadgets and more explosions than even Bond could handle. However, despite the film undoubtedly being bigger than its predecessor, I would be lying to say it is better. It appears that unfortunately heart has been sacrificed for scale here. For example, in the first film, the church sequence blew my mind, as it did for many others. In this film the filmmakers clearly attempt to recapture this lightning in a bottle, however miss the mark completely. After leaving the theatre mere hours ago I can hardly seem to remember even one outstanding action sequence, hardly even a good one. The main issue with them I find is that in the first film the most famous sequence was filmed in a very shaky manner in order to convey that sense of impulsive violence and lack of control; As a result of this most of the action sequences here are filmed in a similar manner. However there seems to be very little thought put into it, resulting in most of the action (especially the opening sequence) leaving the audience stunned and disorientated, yet not in the positive way the original did.Furthermore, there is a certain musician in this film that initially is there as a gag and is funny for a while, however, he then inexplicably becomes a main character and I still just cannot comprehend why. It was irritating, distracting beyond belief and just left a bad taste in my mouth.My final negative is with the structure of the overall film. Where the first was a clear cut origin story of a adolescent boy turned mature super spy and the personal trials and tribulations required in order to pursue this transformation (a slick and stylistic coming of age film) it is incredibly difficult to pinpoint what this film wants to be. It is so unfocused, with random side plots endlessly inserted seemingly just for the fun of it until the film simply seems to lose its identity: what does it want to say? What's the message?It is not all bad however. Most of the jokes still land to great effect as they did in the original, we have a multitude of A list actors giving their A game to deliver truly interesting characters that as an audience we care about, the standouts being Taron Egerton's ever lovable Eggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin, and visually the film still has that vibrancy and life that made the original such a standout in a genre saturated with bleak characters and vistas. I truly wanted to love this film. Yet unfortunately, certain stories and characters just don't lend themselves well to sequels. Look at Kick-Ass for example, amazing first film, poor cash in sequel. I think as an industry we need to learn that it does not matter how successful certain films are at the box office or how well they are received critically, certain stories do not need to be milked for sequels as they just won't work. It was fun, but it won't be remembered anywhere near as fondly as the first.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was surprised that I couldn't find big posters of Kingsman in my theater in Manhattan downtown 34 St, that's kinda odd, and they even posted the upcoming Daddy's Home 2 ever since from August, and Daddy's Home is going to release in November.The movie itself was amazing, there were many great action fights arranged in different songs, fascinating weapon designs, great casts and unforgettable puppies! Dogs and kids should never be killed in Hollywood and to the rest of the world as well. 😉Old songs keep rolling back to the big screen, especially the 80s, so far there were at least 3 different Take Me Home, Country Roads this year 2017 in Kingsman, Logan Lucky and Alien: Covenant. Not to count The Guardians of Galaxy and Baby Driver, their character even owned tons of tapes.Warning, Human meat hamburgers.

I agree that certain choices about characters being present or absent were probably suboptimal and as far as character development goes, it almost seems like a bridge for future movies to come. Ultimately, as the old saying goes: ""you can't be everybody's darling,"" and while many of us would have probably gone in a different direction with the second movie, it is definitely satisfying if you leave your expectations outside the movie theatre and just enjoy it, the way it's meant to be enjoyed.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was brilliant and something different from the Bond and Bourne spy movies. Part II or the Golden Circle is a joy ride but a safe one. Mathew Vaughan and his team play it safe here. No risks taken.So the movie starts with the all the Kingsmans killed and their centres destroyed. The only one surviving is Egsy and Merlin. They go to US to meet the Statesman, their cousins across the Atlantic and discover a drug organization called the Golden Circle headed by Poppy.As I said earlier, Vaughan and his team are playing safe. So they get back Harry aka Colin Firth from the dead because they very well realized that without him the movie cannot work since he was the star of the 1st part.The plot is safe and it delivers to a certain extent. But I missed that fun element of the 1st part.The biggest disppointment is the villain. Part I had Jackson playing the eccentric the villain to the hilt. In this part, Moore is brilliant actress but cannot get that craziness on screen thanks to the poor writing. She has one beautiful scene where she explains how drugs consumption doesn't kills that many people that guns and other items do.The next disppointment is the villian's henchman. Sofia Boutella was superb as the henchwoman with sword legs. The guy in this squel is passable.The rest of the cast does a decent job including Bridges, Tatum and Pascal. And what is Halle Berry doing in this film? An Oscar winner a decade back, I cannot believe she is doing such small roles which do no good to her resume.The only entertaining bits I loved was Bruce Greenwood playing the President of US and seems to be outright copy of Trump as President. And Elton John playing himself captured by Poppy. He is a delight to watch him and is hilarious.Vaughan also maintains the same tone of the earlier film i.e. the blood and gore and some good action sequences with the crazy background score.Overall, it is a safe joyride and I hope that Kingsman 3 is on par with 1.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also movie feels too long for compared the story, movie is simply too long, when it does not have enough story to tell.Despite all of it's failures Kingsman: The Golden Circle is quite entertaining. Biggest problem with it is, that it tries to be Bond movie, but fails to be so entertaining. It tries to be every way bigger than the first movie. Because of all this movie fails as it's efforts.

I still like Taron Egerton's character and thought he was cool in action scenes, plus he still had a great partnership with Colin Firth's character.Julianne Moore as the villain at times was funny in how the character would act, but I would have liked her more if they put more personality or backstory to the character.The action scenes are fun to watch, especially the 3rd act climax. The action scenes were once again fast paced, and the actors were great during them using their cool gadgets.The movie will at times have slow moments, but it did not bother me that much. Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017) and Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) are both fun spy movies to watch back-to-back when given the time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In this movie, Eggsy as the new Gallahad teams up with the American version of Kingsman called the Statesmen, after the Kingsman's headquarters were destroyed by a psychopathic lady who happens to be the Genghis Khan of the drug trade.It's wicked and absurd, just like it's predecessor. Some people think that this time, they went too far. I personally think that they did it really well. Same as John Wick's sequel, they were both bigger and more bombastic the second time 'round. They expanded their universe and gave plenty of exciting opportunities to go forward with their universe. With the American's Statesman made, they could delve into other cultures as well and make super-spy agencies out of them.A criticism that I agreed with is the fact that the movie is quite messy. So many stuff is happening inside this movie that it struggles to balance everything out. I could feel that while some parts were really exciting and fun, some parts were justdull. I'd say the movie could really benefit with some subplots being cut.In the end, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie (perhaps, partly because of my recent inactivity with my beloved movies). I thought the movie was really exciting and funny. Though perhaps not as good as the original, the charm could still be felt. The universe expanding, I thought was also really good. It sets up great potential for a big franchise. Too bad the critics didn't like it, I certainly liked this movie.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Like the violence, much of the narrative is gratuitous, pointless. This leads to apathy in the viewer. When presented with cinematic conflict, it helps if the viewer cares which side wins. In this film, the two sides were nearly indistinguishable. Sometimes allegiances were too confusing.The original Kingsman film had a concise plot that offered some interesting surprises.

I saw it back in theaters on word of mouth and loved it and have only grown to like it more with more viewings. So naturally I was excited to hear a sequel was coming out and that Matthew Vaughn was returning, and I can safely say I found it worth the money. There are a small handful of choices made in the movie that I won't spoil, but that I found just a little odd and thought they could have been slightly altered to easily get the same point across and not felt as weird. However, that said, I had a total blast with this movie. Yes, it's over the top and totally unrealistic, but that's part of the charm of it and one of the biggest draws of the original I thought. The performances are great, the story(while completely bonkers) is fun, the cinematography as well as the stunt work and visuals are incredible. I can't deny there were more than a few times I looked over to my buddies and commented on how awesome a particular moment was. And one thing I would kick myself for forgetting to mention, the musical score. I found myself wanting to look up the score after leaving the theater. Overall, a very enjoyable movie that you can easily have fun watching, with a few odd moments. I put it about on par with one or slightly below. A very good followup and I look forward to collecting the bluray and putting it next to the original on my shelf. If you enjoyed the first, I'd say definitely check it out.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Frankly speaking, I haven't watched a film with such pleasure and some kind of childlike enthusiasm for a long time. Matthew Vaughn did not fail, made a first-class dynamic movie about modern knights, retrained as super spies. The result is a bright, acid colors picture-parody, without any faded undertones and shades, with deliberately crude, but not vulgar humor, organically interwoven into the original story.With unsurpassed manners of an elegant goon Vaughn ""skating"" over the whole classic genre of ""Bondiana"", turning all the previous adventures of Agent ""007"" in the banal safe walk of an aging police officer. The galloping, alternating, spectacular scenes make watching this not-so-short film not cumbersome and easy. That said, unlike ""Kick-Ass,"" Vaughn has not crossed that fine line between justified and excessive violence. The thrash that begins closer to the picture's equator is understandable and not repulsive. Well, special thanks to the filmmakers for the impressive final fireworks display. Every average person who turns on the Evening News or any popular talk show after a hard day's work dreams about it, I think, secretly...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's kind of like Austin Powers, with all the Bond-mocking spy tropes, only way more violent. Personally, it's a guilty pleasure. Here, after the Kingsman facilities in the U.K. are bombed, Eggsy and Merlin must seek the help of Statesman, their American equivalent. It delivers on all the high-tech and over-the-top action of the first movie, even if it doesn't rack up a body count like its predecessor. It's not a very serious movie, but it's great fun. It's still really violent though. It's got plenty of guns, whips, electric lassos, and all that stuff. Oh, and a guy gets shredded by a meat grinder. I can honestly say, that's the most brutal death I've seen on the big screen, possibly ever. There are a few scenes in this movie that make me uncomfortable, although that's not a problem with the movie. The world building, with all of the British and American stereotypes, is actually quite enjoyable and makes for some funny moments. It's an alright movie, but it has a few major flaws. First off, it seems like there were actors who had other priorities, because some of the new characters don't get nearly as much screen time as they should, and it seems like it sets them up for big scenes. Julianne Moore as Poppy, the villain, is still pretty good, but she's no Richmond Valentine. But then again, very few villains are better than Richmond Valentine. Most of the other new characters are forgettable, because they don't get much screen time. They totally wasted Channing Tatum with a character who barely got any screen time. Agent Whiskey was probably the best of the new characters, although the twist with him at the end was a real pisser. The issue with the characters is that it seems like there's a plot in motion, but the right characters aren't used in the right places. But that's alright because Kingsman doesn't appear to be a major franchise. If Marvel or DC put out a movie like this, it would be really bad. But Kingsman isn't much more than a fun time at the movies, and in that regard, it succeeds.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We are hit head on with a taxi full of action and charming humour from the opening scene; this continues throughout the movie alongside the highly enjoyable plot and new antagonist and the impressively choreographed action sequences that were carried on from The Secret Service's Bar scene and church scene. All in all the movie had its faults and one that dragged it down mostly was the comedy sometimes feeling out of place but that can be forgiven and is made up for by the humour itself. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a far fetched theatrical plot that varies from serious spy movies by adding a creative spin on the genre.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The film is very similar in editing and spirit to the first, which confirms that the recipe is already exhausted because the hook is in the visual experience and not in the plot.

It contained plenty of action, some plot twists that I did not expect and made the movie even more interesting and nice interpretations of the cast. The direction which was made by Matthew Vaughn was very good as i the first movie and he kept the same pattern on the second movie. The interpretation of Taron Egerton who played as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin was very good as it was in the first movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Mark Strong's who played as Merlin, Julianne Moore's who played as Poppy, Colin Firth's who played as Harry Hart and Channing Tatum's who played as Tequila.

Following the emergency protocol, Eggsy is about to encounter a couple of surprises which might be the key to saving the world once again.It's a movie which follows the path taken by its predecessor, in terms of style, characters and story. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to improve upon it. We get to see about the same thing but with a different antagonist and one or two twists. Except these it's about the same movie. I'm not saying that it is a bad thing, but I was left lusting for a bit more. It's characters are diverse and likeable, also well played by their actors, but the story is a bit inferior. It's much more predictable than it can be considered ignorable, thus the drama involved is even more lessened, compared to its predecessor, of course.But, fortunately for me, the action sequences are still as impressive and intense. Although even more exaggerated, they still play an important role in the viewer's entertainment. The gadgets used are also great, the CGI involved is top notch, thus providing a great time.Although a bit more serious than its predecessor, this sequel doesn't manage to stay on par with its predecessor. Its much more predictable story isn't able to provide as much drama or even thrill as it should, while not managing to do anything to improve and thus raise its bar to another level. It's still a pretty good movie, a good watch especially if you've seen The Secret Service, but one that could have been a lot better.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Kingsman is in trouble now that are just two agents but they will find a way to stop this criminal with the help from another organization in the United States.Everything seems to be bigger in this sequel... But is it? The movie starts with an amazing action sequence that establishes a little bit how fast pace this movie is in a couple of moments. The fact that a lot of the agents are so easily killed makes this movie a little bit weird. Because it makes you see like the villain of this movie is really cruel and promising but she really doesn't do much. Just like the first movie. She is just the mastermind and she has a sidekick with robotic parts who is in charge of defending her. Just like the first movie.The plan of the villain is against a part of the humanity. In the first movie were people who weren't from the richest society. Now are people who do drugs. Honestly is a great plan and this is delivering flawlessly. The problem comes with objectives of the villain that doesn't make any sense, you will understand why or just watch some videos on YouTube that explain this.The new organization is pretty interesting, but it's just so weird watching them try to gain their trust and some twists are so weird. Many of what happen in this movie is just weird. Sometimes the pacing is all over the place and the only thing you can say is ""Well, something happens, I don't know what but I know that it happens.""This sequel is decent but it's ungreat. A lot of the decision that were taken was awful, and it repeats the same formula of the first movie except for the funny training part. It could be worse but it could be so much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It really gives you something different, new style of action, with amazing camera angle and slow motion effect. It gives you a new experience with action movies and you will be fascinated with it, trust me ! And with the great success on the first movie, of course it will be made a sequel. Vaughn is given opportunity to be the director of these two movies and i think he is really the one. He makes kingsman the movie that has his own unique style and somehow make it really cool.On different aspect, the story is good just like other action secret agent movie, and with some plot twist added too. Some scene feels emotional, and other scene really hilarious. And with extra touch of same line or same scene in kingsman 1, it just feels nostalgic and sometimes makes me smile. At the end, i was thinking of what it is to be the bad aspect on this movie, but somehow i cant think any of it. Kingsman : Golden Circle is just perfect and really brilliant on every aspect.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

It wasn't necessarily a bad film, I definitely enjoyed a couple scenes and thought there were some good ideas at play, but somehow the film enraged me with it's idiocy. Everything it got wrong could be so easily avoided but so much of everything in it makes no sense. The cast is all fine, I like Taron Egerton and Mark Strong, I also like the return of Colin Firth, a reveal that may have been surprising if it wasn't for the fact his face was plastered on the poster. The villain is played by Julianne Moore in a performance that was just sort of annoying, not terrible but annoying, there's an Elton cameo that goes on for far too long and produces one of the worst lines I've ever heard in a film. The special effects weren't bad either but they looked off in certain scenes, just slightly wrong. The music was good, I enjoyed the incident that got the whole story rolling, even if I wasn't a fan of the way it evolved.

I want a sequel to revisit characters that I love and it was great to see Eggsy, Harry and Merlin back together again.It was funny, cool and hugely entertaining. The plot was far more interesting and considered than anything in the last few Bond films (a jealous long lost brother - Jesus!) and it nicely combined humour with action and nods back to the first film.Yes, it's over the top but so was the first one. It has cool tech and outrageous action but it isn't a GI Joe film, it has characters that are fleshed out and likable.As a Brit, I appreciate how the makers are unashamedly prepared to show us as being quite cool and am far happier for this to 'represent' us abroad rather than the tedious and shockingly bad recent Bond films (exc Casino Royale).It's a shame that the shadow of identity politics is affecting so many reviews nowadays. Some hysterical reviews seem hell bent on slating the film and down grading it because it didn't tick enough diversity boxes or triggered their narcissistic virtue signalling.This film gave me a great time at the cinema, developed some characters that I loved, expanded the universe they live in and kept me entertained. What more is a film supposed to do?","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Now that I finally got around to it, I feel like the critics were a little harsh. There's fun to be had with Kingsman: The Golden Circle, but I'll admit it does have flaws that stop it from being as good as the original... but I am also nearly a decade older than I was when that first movie was out, so maybe this kind of movie isn't likely to have quite the same appeal.It makes some bold storytelling decisions early on, both being willing to kill off characters and bring back once-dead ones with equal ridiculousness. He's on the poster and in the trailers, so it's not a spoiler, but reviving Colin Firth was ridiculous. I get he was great in the first, but nothing here character-wise really justifies bringing him back. He's still cool, but the loss of him in the first movie is undone. And if we're surviving headshots now, two other character fates - one in an explosion, and one in a meatgrinder - I mean... can they be reversed? Asking that almost genuinely; the stakes are weird for this series going forward.I'm similarly conflicted about the action. It's still flashy and fun, but not as fresh as those sorts of scenes were in the first. Pedro Pascal getting a whip was fun. Pascal actually stole the show, in general. He made The Golden Circle a better Indiana Jones film than The Dial of Destiny was. As for Elton John in here? His acting was terrible, but he was great. I thought it was fun that a cameo just got extended to a supporting role, and he had fun with it, too. He brought some life to things, even with the bad acting.I would like to see Pedro Pascal play Indiana Jones at some point, to be honest. He had the physicality, the energy, the look (mostly), and the whip. Just give it to him; everyone loves him.We also had lots of bowling, Julianne Moore, and Jeff Bridges, ticking some serious Big Lebowski boxes... however, Bridges and Moore don't share screen time, and even though there are lots of scenes where characters drink, no one has any White Russians. Honestly, how dare they miss these opportunities. I hope someone got fired.The series probably needs to mature just a little for a third movie one day, seeing as the characters (and target audience) are all getting older, too. This is only a slight misfire in some ways. I thought it was fun and engaging in parts, but there were certainly opportunities for improvement.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a sequel to the previous one Kingsman: The Secret Service, which is based on the comic book series Kingsman. Among this movie, there are three aspects I will comment, the casts, plot and the work of production.In this movie, there are many potential actors and actresses participating in the performance. Among those actors and actresses, there are some big stars too. For example, Colin Firth and Julianne Moore. Both big stars get many kinds of awards in their career.The plot is very simulating especially the fighting scene, which makes me feel like I was the person in the movie. If a person likes to see some stimulating scenes, this movie is a good choice.There are three work production companies in this film, Twentieth Century Fox, TSG Entertainment and Marv Films. After shooting this film, the director of the film announced that there will be another sequel of Kingsman and the third one maybe the last one of this series.An item has good and bad, so do this film. There are some disadvantages in this film that many fans cannot agree with it. So, do I. For instance, the first one is Eggsy did not check the robotic arm for a date, the second one is Rosie died easily and the agent's address is super easy to steal and Brought a minesweeper umbrella, but still stepped on a landmine etc.To sum up, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a little bit below the audience's expectations compare to Kingsman: The Secret Service but this one has its own advantages too. For a diehard fan of Kingsman, these comments will not change their minds about how they comment on this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is one of the silliest waste of time I've watched so far. The film is a certification 15 but honestly in my opinion it should be an 18.The language is appalling with F this and F that what seems every 10 seconds throughout the film, why? The sexual nature of one scene (even though you don't actually see anything) is quite disgusting. The film seems to be up its own bottom with mindless special effects and literally no humour what so ever, actually I'm wrong, there was one scene after the cable car which was funny but the rest was just wrong. Targeted at the wrong audience, too much bad language (from gentleman) and a story which only sought to do one thing and special effects for effects sake.

I just saw a mainstream big budget action movie; based on a comic and featuring superheroes (just call them secret agents); lasting 140 minutes – at least 30 more than any movie of its ilk should; and I enjoyed myself and left kind of wanting for more! I honestly couldn't see this happening. the last time I was really into mainstream big budget projects was somewhen circa the beginning of the century. This is the sequel to 2014's new kind of secret agent movie – let's call it James Bond introduced to the YA generation. This time they battle the evil mafiosos who like to urinate on other battle (hence the name ""golden ring"")... or maybe just some evil-doers or the other. Some of the original cast has returned, including Taron Egerton as the central young hero and Hanna Alström as his girlfriend the Swedish princess, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth, and there are many new famous faces, including Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, Emily Watson, Channing Tatum, and, er, Elton John as himself. Matthew Vaughn has always been a versatile and exemplary director who's noteworthy for bold visual inventiveness and stylishness in his movies, from heavily effect-based, choreographed and edited fights, to minimalist but glamorous look of the world, to outlandish gadgets used to fight evil. OK, I know it's all a team effort, but he's still the guys who pulls it all together, innit? After seeing The Golden Circle"" I believe even more that Vaughn really was unofficially directing Guy Ritchie's first and best two movies for him. This movie is visually wild and crazy like a Snatch."", if the latter was a mainstream comic book / superhero project. You can have fun just cherishing how everything looks and plays out on the screen. As usual, screenplay is by Vaughn himself and his long-time writing partner Jane Goldman. The Golden Circle"" already starts with a bang, ramps us the pace and holds it, and doesn't end before everybody involved has had their fair share. There are car chases, fights (I am kind of surprises that there's still so many original fights in movies!) and bombastic setpieces involving an unusual lasso, robots, meat mincing machine and more. But you could already expect some crazy things based on the first movie, yeah? It's not a perfect movie. The characters and the plot are not really that interesting in a meaningful way (I know, I know, it's still a mainstream big budget action, it's not supposed to be that interesting). What is worse: all the famous faces joining the cast don't really have anything cool to do, and their roles are rather small, which is surprising, especially considering Berry. One could say it's kind of a lost chance but it's also true that there's so much happening that there's no need for famous faces to add anything, really. Maybe their roles are small-ish for budget reasons. But, then, why add so many of them anyway? Leaving minor niggles like this aside, the Kingsman"" sequel is a kick-ass joyride of a movie which not only looks good and feels good but left me wanting for more. More action, more surprisingly but deliciously weird jokes, more style, more of this secret world which plays something like MIB"" meets 007 meets superhero movies, more enjoyable details such as drug kingpin creating American 1950's nostalgia land in the jungle for home, more outlandish turns of events such as the U.S. president going renegade etc. For a blockbuster, The Golden Circle"" sure does have a lot of personality, both plot- and visual style wise. And for that, I applaud it! I really wish most pure entertainment movies were shorter. But ""Kingsman 2"" is 140 minutes, I wasn't bored once and left asking for more! Many critics seem disappointed by The Golden Circle"", for example, Rotten's Tomatoes' consensus says the part deux offers more of everything that made its predecessor so much fun, but lacks the original's wild creative spark. I think the real situ is exactly vice versa, and the first part, while good enough, is lacking compared to the sequel.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This time the squad got blown up? So they had to work with a neighbor group, the Statesman, to fight the enemy.This one was for sure a major step down in almost every aspect from the first movie. The most important one was the quirkiness and class that the first one had. Golden Circle just didn't feel cool or interesting. The story was unengaging for its unnecessarily long runtime. There were very few funny or classy dialogues. It's the same director, but the charm was mostly gone.Character-wise, only Egerton as Eggsy carried the movie. He was passionate and funny just like in the first one, although his new relationship with his girlfriend wasn't as hot as I expected from what the last scene in the first movie entailed. The new villain was nowhere as cool or threatening as Valentine from the first. Julianne Moore wasn't the problem, it's just that the writing for Miss Poppy was so bland. Halle Berry's character felt irrelevant even though she was meant to be a similar version of Mark Strong's Merlin.The first movie had a political satire about climate change, and this one was about war on drugs. I honestly didn't care much about this aspect, but the Golden Circle seemed to try to hard with this theme and it wasn't even that innovative or interesting.Overall, Golden Circle lost the gentleman gesture that made Secret Service so fun to enjoy. Hope King's Man will find that classiness again. 6.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It brings the fun, spontaneity and ludicrousness that made the original so enjoyable back. Like its predecessor, it has a ton of great moments that you will not be able to keep your eyes off of because of just how visually pleasing they are, as well as side splitting hilarious dialogue. It certainly has a lot flaws and I am saddened to say that, as enjoyable as it is, does not live up to its predecessor. First of all, it throws back to the first Kingsman far too much, such as characters reminiscing about the events of that movie, making references, and even going as far as to showing footage. This movie does not make sense without having seen the first, and in my opinion, a sequel should be able to stand on its own. As well as that, Channing Tatum has an underwhelming role, despite being highly advertised, he is here very briefly, I also felt Colin Firth's involvement should not have been made known. I would love to have been surprised by Harry's return, and it would have made the rest of the film a complete thrill since I would have been overwhelmed by just how much Firth is in it, but instead I was underwhelmed when his character was revealed cause he is all over the posters. The cast are in solid form, Taaron Egerton, Colin Firth and Mark Strong are still stellar in their roles, with each character having a solid arc. The new cast, while not appearing quite as much as they should have, still deliver, such as Julianne Moore, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry and a terrific performance by Elton John as himself. Pedro Pascal was the stand out for me, I have never seen this man in any previous work, but thought he did a phenomenal job as Whiskey, with a great screen presence, terrific characterisation and an intriguing, layered personality that was a nice match up against Eggsy and Harry. Terrific fun from beginning to end. While it certainly has its imperfections that I could not help but point out as a massive fan of its predecessor, there is still certainly more good about Kingsman: The Golden Circle than there is bad, I had great fun and would recommend to anybody looking for a good comedy, action or adventure. Eggsy and Merlin must team up with American spies after their branch is destroyed and take on a woman who is looking to take the world down with her powerful drug cartel. Best Performance: Colin Firth","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Their talent alone makes ""Kingsman"" an entertaining ride, not to mention the previous film's cast members such as Colin Firth. Most occupy new roles for them and do a good job. Probably most outstanding is Julianne Moore.The story is even original and has smart twists like the first film. At heart ""The Golden Circle"" is a worthwhile sequel. However, something in the excessive run time (over two hours) and the lack of finer details (the shoehorned backstory of Pascal's character) makes for a flimsy film. In several action scenes, the characters definitely survive because of story cheats.Many times unlike the first film the bad guys had an opening to turn the tide for their own survival and didn't take it. The heavy plot armor detracts from the first film's achievements of doing away with exactly that, and also reneges on another theme of the first film which is the finality of death.The film doesn't take itself seriously nor anguish about its own backpedaling, and that already makes the film easier to watch than most. However neither does the film has a strong sense of cohesion or really a strong purpose to get any significant message across. It's cool, it's clever, it's fun, but definitely also rests on the success of the previous film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It continues right where it left off with Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, as an agent for Kingsman. Here, something big happens and he teams up with Merlin, played by Mark Strong, to ""save the world.""The movie is a visual thrill ride, with the most absurd action sequences you will ever see. Guns popping out of umbrellas and briefcases, advanced watches that can do anything imaginable, and much more. The cinematography was absolutely wonderful.Unfortunately, this is where the praising of the movie ends. The movie is quite choppy with its transition through action sequences. The plot is as convoluted as Suicide Squad's, with all its unnecessary subplots. During the second act, it was really hard to tell what the heck was going on in the movie. When I was able to comprehend all the mumbo-jumbo that was being showcased, yet another curve ball was thrown to make things more confusing.One of the characters who seems like a significant player does not need to be in the movie. The way the movie justifies that characters presence towards the end is very predictable and unneeded. Without the character, the movie would have been around 10 minutes shorter and it would not have made a difference in the end goal.Now, you may be thinking that ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" must have been an unbearable movie, but in truth, it is not. The action sequences and visuals make up for the plot mishaps. It is a fun and crazy movie to watch. Rarely, are action movies this ridiculous, and still, provide quite the amusement. Not everyone will enjoy this sequel, with its ridiculous plot, but ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is what it is: A fun disappointment.Rating: 1.75/3","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Key word: Most. At least one Hollywood player, director Mathew Vaughn of Kingsman 2, has gotten the message.In an interview with EW, Vaughn explained that consideration for his audience led him to edit out several anti-Trump references in the blockbuster hit because he knew that people would not be pleased.Apparently the shady CEO, played by Julianne Moore in the film, had a few lines about wanting to host NBC's The Apprentice that were then deleted to keep the partisanship out.""We actually took out The Apprentice line,"" said Vaughn, ""because we felt it was too close to the bone. I think America's going through a pretty interesting and rough ride at the moment and I wanted this movie to be escapism. And that means not suddenly have half the audience going, 'That's not cool, that's not funny!' as the other half is cheering.""Another Trump dig was decorating a White House set in his signature gold and gaudy taste, which also did not make the final cut.""We were building a White House Oval Office in the style of Trump Tower. We were making it in all gold and blinging it up. This was in May of 2016 and then I had an inkling. I remember saying to my American production designer, 'Trump might win, you know? Would this be as funny if Trump won?' And he was like, 'Trump will never win.' And I said, 'You know what, I have a weird feeling he might. So let's build a normal Oval Office and scrap the Trump version.'""Looking back, Vaughn knows he made the right decision, because ""if you go too far — if movies get political when they're meant to be fun — then it weighs everything down a bit too much.""It only took a summer's worth of box office flops, poor ratings at the Oscars and Emmys, and the public's all-around disdain with Hollywood to realize the obvious: insulting customers just drives them away.Good for Vaughn for letting reason get in the way of partisanship for once.","21 out of 45 found this helpful.

The core is sadly just undesirable, which is the weakest part of this sequel's design. Matthew Vaughn and Jane GoldmanIt unfortunately have no success in creating an immaturely compelling concept, especially after their predecessor ended up being an entirely amusing blast.The return of the original heroes to face an even bigger situation doesn't live up to the original wave of diverting storytelling. This time, The Golden Circle takes an unnecessary and overlong 2 hours and 20 minutes to provide the story, but also can't attach to a familiarly enjoyable pace we encountered and got to experience in the first Kingsman. Julianne Moore's presentation of a villain is actually just as fun and Samuel L. Jackson's, but is flattened severely by poor writing. All the characters and absurdity are great throughout this movie.However, if the opening hour to the tale was just as exciting and fun as the end of the second hour and the entire climax, the Kingsman sequel could've and should've been a lot more diverting. The climatic tension and excitement is the best and most memorable thing in this movie. There's too much time wasted on the lead-up to it, but once it arrives, there's wildly entertaining action, fearless fatalities and solid motion that we should've received in the start. In the end, it's hilarious and worth the watch for fans.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This new adventure finds the Kingsman headquarters being attacked, forcing its members to re-locate to the American spy organization known as Statesmen. With a long history in common between the two covert services, they must team up to defeat a new, foreboding enemy that will cause great destruction to our world.Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman return as director and co-screenwriter, along with lead actors Taron Egerton as new leader Eggsy, Colin Firth as veteran Hart, and Mark Strong as tech wizard Merlin. Julianne Moore portrays Poppy, the drug cartel villainess of the piece, like that of a Stepford wife, complete with a faux plaza of '50s kitsch. However, her character comes across as generic and her plot to implement toxins on all recreational drugs is nothing short of far-fetched and ridiculous. Channing Tatum is unfortunately wasted in his performance as agent Tequila, while Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges at least make the most of their cameos. An appearance by Elton John, who is being held captive by Poppy, gives the film a slight edge, but soon ends up being repetitive.The action and stunt set pieces are what really drive this movie. Being based on a series of comics, the staging of the scenes has all of the tight-knit structure of still panels being set in motion. The most iconic showcases for this are an opening car chase/fight between Eggsy and the mechanical arm-wearing rejected candidate-turned-rogue agent Charlie, a gondola chase on the slopes of Italy, and the final battle. The non-action pacing, however, feels like it has a start-stop functionality, which makes much of the movie lag in large sections during its unnecessary 141-minute length. Much of the film also gives off a mean-spirited, including a scene where Eggsy has to hide a device in the private parts of his nemesis' girlfriend. At the same time, there is a lot of unnecessary plugging of Fox News, given this is a 20th Century Fox release, which greatly conflicts with the satire of the U. S. President being in cahoots with the drug cartel.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" isn't quite as fresh and exciting as its predecessor, but if you're looking for something that will spice up your movie night, there is enough action and excitement to keep you satisfied.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When rejected Kingsman recruit Charles ""Charlie"" Hesketh (Edward Holcroft) infiltrates Kingsman's database obtaining the names of every Kingsman agent, a coordinated misile strike ends up wiping out every Kingsman except for Eggsy and Kingsman's quartermaster Merlin (Mark Strong). With Kingsman destroyed, the two initiate Doomsday Protocol and contact Kingsman's sister organization in the United States, the Statesman, lead by Champagne ""Champ"" (Jeff Bridges) and consisting of agents Tequilla (Channing Tatum), Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), and tech expert Ginger Ale and are in possession of an amnesiac Harry Hart (Colin Firth). The group soon learns the orchestrator behind Charlie's attack is a organization known as The Golden Circle run by Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) which has effectively monopolized the drug trade. Tired of being in the shadows Poppy has unleashed drugs ranging from Cannabis to Cocaine that are tainted with a super virus to which she alone has the cure and will only release it when the United States ends its war on drugs and allows her drugs to be freely sold and marketed. However the ultraconservative President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood) is intent on letting everyone affected by the virus die because it will allow him to ""win"" the war on drugs. With the President of the United States content to sit back and let millions die the Statesman and remaining Kingsman team up to save the world.One of the biggest surprises of 2014 was definitely Kingsman: The Secret Service, which reteamed Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman with Mark Millar following their collaboration on Kick-Ass and giving us a nice mash-up of an R-Rated Roger Moore era spy-fi film with a nice central core of My Fair Lady with chav protagonist Eggsy succeeding at saving the world and integrating his chav background with the elegance and refinement of a proper gentlemen. Making $400 million against its $81 million budget, it was a foregone conclusion that a sequel would be produced. The world created in Kingsman: The Secret Service definitely left the door open for many possible directions for the series and with The Golden Circle it feels like many ideas were thrown on the board only for Goldman and Vaughn to say ""we love them all! Let's do all of them at once!"" making The Golden Circle a very busy and bloated film that does exhibit flashes of the original's charmingly violent absurdity.The movie has a number of issues that typically plague sequels such as getting rid of too much too fast, resetting elements to bring back the status quo, and upping the ante by adding too much. A major misstep happens with every facet of Kingsman eliminated in the first 20 minutes, including Sophie Cookson's Roxy which felt like a real waste of a character as Roxy had been such an integral part of the first adventure only for her to be cast aside. We also have Princess Tilde played by Hanna Alström returning from the first movie now in a relationship with Eggsy that feels like an apology for the ""Anal sex"" joke ending that some critics had a problem with and there's not all that much to the character or their relationship and it's just more baggage for the movie to lug around. The movie also brings back Edward Holcroft's Charlie character from Kingsman whose purpose as a spoiled rich counterpart to Eggsy's chav background was fulfilled with nowhere else for the character to really go and he's not interesting or intimidating enough to compensate for the inherent weaknesses with the character.The Statesman is an interesting concept with them being American counterparts to Kingsman who have a cowboy/alcohol theme that contrasts against the ""refined gentlemen"" theme of Kingsman but aside from Pedro Pascal most of the Statesman are borderline cameos with Channing Tatum spending much of the movie in a coma and Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry greatly underutilized. And then we have Harry Hart. The first Kingsman movie pretty definitively closed the door on Harry Hart but even before a sequel was announced Millar and Vaughn expressed every intention of bringing him back. There is a reason why Hart is back and even for a world like Kingsman that features metal legged assassins and microchips that make your head explode this will be a tough pill to swallow. It is understandable why they'd want Harry back because Colin Firth's performance as the character was a scene stealer and when the character died the last act while still good was a little lacking, but for a long time Harry isn't actually the Harry we know because the movie gives him amnesia so this popular character they've backflipped through hoops to bring back is sitting on the bench for a long time and even when Harry is ""back"" the movie handicaps the character by giving him issues with coordination and perception.The movie's villains are also pretty mixed. Julianne Moore is certainly having a blast playing eccentric drug lord Poppy Adams, but the character feels very odd with Poppy's fascination with 50s Americana decorating her lair complete with robot dogs and Elton John who she's kidnapped for her personal amusement. Poppy's plan also doesn't make a lot of sense and the movie tries to write that off as ""she's just crazy"" and scenes like her making hamburgers out of traitorous henchmen certainly sell that point but Poppy falls short in comparison to Valentine as a villain. There's also a ""twist"" reveal villain that feels really extraneous and only serves to add more bloat to movie. I will say that the unnamed President of the United States played by Bruce Greenwood is one of the best parts of the movie with the character sort of an amalgam of every prominent conservative President over the last sixty years with bits of Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and especially Trump as the President shows a willingness to let those affected by the virus die simply so he can ""win"" the War on Drugs and it's a really solid piece of commentary that works well with Mark Millar's style. As much as I criticize this movie I don't think it's a bad movie and there are moments that do reach the level of insane brilliance of the first film. Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth remain strong in their roles and the action sequences are still well done, but with an overstuffed narrative and some pretty underwhelming creative decisions I didn't feel it quite captured the same level of the first film.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is okay, but it's not an entry I'll be chomping at the bit to revisit. A story juggling too many elements and throwing away much that was established in the first movie serve as stumbling blocks that prevent the movie from reaching its predecessor's level, but if you can get past some of those hurdles there are moments that match the excitement and subversion of the first film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The amount of repeated unnecessary uses of the F-word was not only distasteful and offensive, but just downright annoying. The excessive, over-the-top, profanity was not at all entertaining. It was instead an un-ignorable distraction from any remaining entertainment value the film hoped to possess. Such intelligent, highly-trained, and refined 'gentlemanly' characters, unable to utter two consecutive sentences without the F-Bomb...poor judgment by the script writers.Also this sequel could easily have shaved off about 20 minutes of silliness and vulgar crude attempts at humor that were more of a turn-off than an opportunity to laugh. There were also random rogue scenes that left gaping plot holes with no follow-up after that particular scene was over. I read in the trivia that the original cut of this film was 3hrs and 40 minutes. Really? Who does that? It was finally edited down to 2 hr ans 21 minutes, which was still too long. If you removed all of the gross, vulgar, profane, silly, goofy, random, or preposterous filler content, you would easily have a prime cut of premium Grade-A Kingsman Spy Entertainment movie in under 2 hours.

Matthew Vaughn returns to direct this second adventure with more action and fun, co-writing the script with Jane Goldman (Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children), screenwriter of the first. Colin Firth also reprises his roles, as well as Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and a super evil, Julianne Moore, joins the franchise as drug dealer Poppy Adams, head of a mysterious criminal organization. Along with them, the Statesman: Whiskey (Pedro Pascal), Tequila (Channing Tatum), Champagne (Dennis Quaid) and a hilarious Elton John playing himself. A devastating attack leaves Kingsman with only two surviving agents, Gary ""Eggsy"", the former promising street kid, now an expert agent, and the ever-faithful Merlin. Eggsy, who has become the new Galahad of the top-secret British private intelligence service known as Kingsman, is attacked by Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), a former aspiring agent who was rejected. Unwin (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong) are lonely because Hart (Colin Firth), codenamed ""Galahad,"" died in the previous entry. They must travel to the United States to find the Statesman, a forgotten ally operating out of Kentucky with his own distinctly American way of doing things. They join a spy organization as an evil mastermind plans to unleash a threat that would send the world into chaos. Manners make the man! New allies and old friends come together to face the global threat of Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) and the Golden Circle!. Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!Good sequel full of action with doses of hooligan comedy, in this second installment the Kingsman is about to disappear after a brutal attack in London, here the survivors receive help from a parallel American organization called Statesman. Kingsman is based on the graphic novel ""The Secret Service"" written by screenwriter Mark Millar - author of the Comics series ""Wanted"" or ""Kick Ass"" - and one of Marvel's last star writers, for whom he created the series "" Ultimate X-Men¨ and ¨The Ultimates¨ about The Avengers and drawn by artist Dave Gibbons who is also the illustrator of ¨Watchmen¨ comics for D. C. Comics. A sweeping action comedy, the film has a humor similar to Kick-Ass and an even more spectacular action. A parody of spy movies and James Bond series, which deals with the investigations of Harry Hart, who tries to hunt down a peculiar and dangerous criminal mastermind who is endangering world security. The plot is a bit ridiculous, but we are in a parody action comedy and it is told in fast movements and unstoppable action. In addition, surprises abound, being very funny and disconcerting. In the film there is suspense, comedy, emotion, irony and chases galore with impressive action scenes. The script is well developed, as are the characters and the frenetic action combined with excellent special effects that are also varied. From start to finish fun and entertainment are guaranteed.It stars Colin Firth as the ruthless but calm agent Harry Hart and the then newcomer and now world star Taron Egerton playing the tough and sympathetic agent Gary 'Eggy' Price who is deeply in love with his Scandinavian Princess Tilde played by Hanna Alström. Adding other good supporting roles, such as: Pedro Pascal, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Halle Berry, Poppy Delevingne, Edward Holcroft, Julianne Moore as an extremely evil maniac teacher, and the now aging singer Elton John, whose life was interpreted in a recent biopic by Taron Egerton himself.The film was brilliantly directed by Matthew Vaughn. He is a good writer, producer (Guy Ritchie films) and director, producing or filming blockbuster movies, such as: ¨Layer Cake¨ ¨X: First Class¨, ¨Stardust¨, ¨Kick ass¨, ¨Rocket man¨, ¨Silent night¨, ¨Tetris¨, Blood night¨, among others. Rating: 6.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This, though, struggles with all of these things and more. Julianne Moore is completely wasted as the main villain stuck in her art deco diner driving things remotely. The whole robot thing is too over the top and the Elton gag is over indulged and ran on too long.The Statesman idea is OK (albeit a marketing rather than a creative decision), but telegraphed the ending as soon as we meet them. The most egregious decision, however, is the resurrection of Colin Firth having the effect of losing dramatic tension by removing any sense of jeopardy.It is clear to see why the decision was made to go for a different format for the third movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I hope it will be very useful for many!If we make a comparison with the first story, the second part is not much inferior in terms of special effects and spy stuff. The main thing is that throughout the story there is first-class humor, exciting stunts, city chases and courage for the good of the motherland. In addition, the battle between good and evil, the film is far from one-sided. One gets the impression that the dark side is stronger than the good, but as it turned out, the good guys are much luckier.In general, it's not boring, but still there is a small nuance - throughout the entire viewing, some sluggish visual enthusiasm is felt. It feels like something is missing from such a great story. Maybe it's all about my movie addiction and my brain wants more, or the directors really started to hack and therefore a little little attention was given to some moments.In general, I am satisfied with the viewing, I confess - it was funny. Rating 8 out of 10. I recommend.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here, Vaughn elevates the creativity of the original's brand of well shot, high octane action, through new characters with neat new tricks up their sleeves. He as well retains the no holds barred, uncompromising violence that is straight up exciting & appealing. On the comedic front, the quips and jokes were absolutely on point, delivering laughs on the constant, but it is the film's use of its cameos that merits a novel kind of amusement. These are then held together by an amazing soundtrack that keeps everything upbeat and brimming with energy.Where the film falters and fails to live up to its predecessor, is when the gimmicks careens off its rails, & the silliness becomes over bearing. For instance, heroes being treated back to life throws off the needed sense of danger that grounds its heroes. Also, its propensity to push for mini adventures that bears awkward innuendos, carries an unpleasant taste & ups the unnecessary screen time. As for its antagonists, it was unfortunate that the stellar Julianne Moore was given lackluster set pieces that dampens her mischief & wastes away her interesting motivation.Nevertheless, The Golden Circle's entertaining feats remain undeniable. The laugh out loud moments and visual amazement from the its insanity first, substance later theme, is quite a challenge to undermine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A cab journey one night, though, reintroduces him to his fellow trainee ""Charlie"" (Edward Holcroft) who now has an interesting new arm - and still clearly bears a grudge. Why? Well it appears that the mysterious Golden Circle might be behind it, so it falls to ""Eggsy"" to investigate. Tragedy ensues - big style - and he and ""Merlin"" (Mark Strong) head to the USA where they encounter a sister organisation ""Statesman"" where ""Tequila"" (Channing Tatum) and ""Whiskey"" (Pedro Pascal) work for ""Champ"" (Jeff Bridges) - and they discover another fairly surprising person too! Meantime, ""Miss Polly"" (Julianne Moore) announces that she has been lacing all the recreational drugs in the world with a deadly pathogen that will kill everyone, excruciatingly, unless all drugs are legalised. They have got to track her down and thwart her cunning plan before the bodies start piling up. This is a fast moving and quite entertaining boys-own adventure. Egerton is quite engaging, and there are quite fun contributions from Sir Elton John and a trio of lethal mechanical mutts. It's not as good as the first one - some of the fight scenes just go on for a bit too long, but the cast seem to be enjoying themselves - and who doesn't like a bit of John Denver?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The second one is extremely silly. More silly than a very silly thing. The action is so OTT that it just made me laugh. Julianne Moore as the villain was about as terrifying as a labradoodle puppy. Pedro Pascal (who I loved in GoT) is just completely unbelievable. As is Channing Tatum. There are good performances - as always, Jeff Bridges is entertaining, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton, Halle Berry, Hanna Elstrom and Emily Watson (fantastic cast isn't it!) are all terrific. And with such a great cast I expected that I would love this film. My darling and I both exited feeling soooo disappointed.

Here's the best way to explain why I like it so much. It's a very long movie, and yet I was never aware of it being long. In fact, as the end scenes obviously approached, I thought it couldn't be the end already, could it? People said was such a long movie. Any movie that can hold my attention so well that I'm unaware of the passing of time is a good movie.The action is practically non-stop, and extremely well directed. There were no fight scenes in the dark, or with wildly switching camera angles so you can't see what's going on, flaws typical of a lot of contemporary action films. My only regrets is that one of my favorite characters doesn't make it. I won't spoil it and say who, but it was a well written and well played death scene with some great humor. I give it a 10 out of 10.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

It was literally my favorite movie of that year so I was defiantly looking forward to the next one. And I got to see I really loved this movie quite a bit. It was defiantly amazing. Right off the back I love Taron Egerton as Eggsy. He is such a fun and cool character and that first half without Colin Firth being there was defiantly great. I really loved seeing a much more matured Eggsy fighting doing his own thing. It was a really enjoyable piece of the first half. I also found that when Colin Firth did come back they found a way to bring him back in what I felt was reasonable. I also found his role in the movie quite really good too. It felt natural and it made sense for his character. The movie is also really funny. I laughed so much throughout this movie and it made the experience all the sweeter. The jokes really hit hard and they each put a smile on your face. The movie also has a lot of pretty good emotional beats to it as well that really worked for me. Now this movie is not without its cons though. For instance as much as I loved the first half of this movie I also will admit the pacing in it is really poor. Things move at a fast paced and you have no time to get reacquainted with your old characters before the movie makes the decision to sideline them for all these new characters and sadly...these new characters just don't work as well. Aside from maybe Poppy, Ginger and Champ the rest of the cast fells very weak in there roles. Elton Johns felt really forced like they were juts doing it cause we did it in the last movie and Channing Tatum felt pretty meh too. And there choice to sideline there older characters like Roxy I felt was this movie's biggest mistake. There are also a number of scenes that feel to much like the original and they also feel forced. This movie needed to move these characters forward in a interesting way , but instead this film just feels to much like a rehash of the first. Overall though I would highly recommend this film despite my negatives. It is a really fun time at the movies and really adored what they did here. I thought it was fun and silly and made the experience of this film all the better and I think more people should check it out.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

As some reviewers here have already mentioned not all the characters are evenly written and some of the Statesmen agents are nothing more than time fillers, which is both a shame and a waste of talent. I don't think it has to do with the nationality of the characters as both the American president and Poppy are wonderful cartoons brilliantly performed by Bruce Greenwood and Julianne Moore, I think they simply had too many cartoons to present on screen, and some simply didn't get enough screen time to develop. But for me, this the only real fault of a real fun movie, spoofing cinematic genre as well as social attitudes with a very self assured hand. If they do want to keep it going they will have to further develop these underdeveloped roles, and I'm sure they can do it if they apply themselves.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sure, they could be serious and dramatic but there was still this sense of fun that was inescapable: villains with insane plans who control henchmen with superpowers. The hero gets the bad guys (and girls) in style then ultimately saves the day. In many ways, it was a success. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was reminiscent of such Bond films like ""Goldfinger"". Both are very good movies with real emotion and stakes, and plenty of cringe- worthy moments.Therefore, if The Secret Service can roughly be equated with the strongest Sean Connery James Bond movie, then The Golden Circle parallels a stronger Roger Moore Bond film. Sure, it's plenty of fun and not nearly as cringe-worthy, but it also feels more hollow. Consequently, events have less emotional impact on the heroes and, additionally, occur not to progress the story but to establish a cool scene.""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" picks up from the previous film as we are reintroduced to Eggsy (the brash youth who became a Kingsman as played by Taron Egerton). He is quickly attacked and we are brought into one of the film's faux one shot fight scenes. It's filled with computer animation leaving me unsure if I should be impressed at all by the technicals of the shots or just looking at cleverly integrated CGI and real life. Either way it's impressive, though the speed comes dangerously close to headache inducing.His attacker works for Poppy (Julianne Moore) who is the biggest drug dealer on the planet. Her sinister plan? To legalize all drugs in the United States. I guess the idea is to replicate the villain from the first movie, but it doesn't quite work. Valentine's plan was to fix global warming by killing almost everyone. He's trying to fix a problem by creating a much bigger problem. Here, Poppy poisoned her drugs and will only cure the afflicted if drugs are legalized. Valentine's endgame is unacceptable. Poppy is doing plenty of bad things, but her endgame potentially acceptable or, at least ambiguous.This is just another example of how this movie copies from the original but loses quite a bit in translation. Matthew Vaughn has directed many other comic book adaptations, but seemed to always end up out on the sequel. He consistently does a great job so it is an inexplicable shame to lose him for the follow through. So, now he has a sequel to one of his own films under his belt and he manages to do well, while he simultaneously disappoints. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is easily Vaughn's worst movie. Fortunately for him, even his worst movie is still plenty fun.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can see the standpoint of this sequel to ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" setting the bar as high as it did three years ago to the point where what followed it would not be able to measure up. However, the flaw to that logic is that the first film was one of those out-of-nowhere hits that just took the world by storm and this one brings the audience back to the characters that are established with some new ones as well.With Matthew Vaughn back in the directing and co-writing chair (Jane Goldman returns here as well), our story takes place one year after the first film ends, with Eggsy (Taron Egerton) well-established as a Kingsman code named ""Galahad,"" living in the former residence of his mentor, Harry Hart (Collin Firth) and trying to balance both constantly saving the world from evil and keeping up with his girlfriend, Princess Tilde (Hanna Alstrom). When a global drug dealer named Poppy (Julianne Moore) makes a move towards global domination, Galahad and Merlin (Mark Strong) must find and enlist the help of their American counterparts, known as the Statesman. Hidden in a bourbon distillery in Kentucky, they meet up with agents Ginger Ale (Halle Berry), Tequila (Channing Tatum), Champagne (Jeff Bridges), and Whiskey (""Narcos"" star Pedro Pascal) in order to once again save the world and maybe even meet up with an old friend who may or may not know who and what they are.For people that find the classic James Bond films to be a little dated and the Austin Powers films to be way to hokey, Vaughn does his best to bring those fans back into the over-the-top spy genre fans back into the fold. One of the things that I love most about both ""The Secret Service"" and ""The Golden Circle"" is that they require such a suspension of disbelief that they both seem to work on every level, giving me that sense of awe and wonder with the right balance of humor to keep the story moving. I did find the second installment to not be as well- paced as its predecessor, having me feel all of its two hour and twenty minute run time, but that did not keep me from enjoying my time in the theater. The difference with ""The Golden Circle"" is in a story that is more complex than ""The Secret Service"". There are a lot of things going on here, especially with a few twists and turns, and that can (and does) weigh down a film like this quite a bit. Again though, it didn't make me enjoy it any less and it still does not justify the level of reviews that I am seeing online about it. And even the over-the-top violence effects from the first are toned down here, and that didn't bother me either. At a certain point, we as critics have to stop expecting everything to be a cinematic masterpiece that can only be truly enjoyed by the elite whose nostrils haven't pointed towards the ground since the Renaissance and just go ""is this an escape from the chaos that exists outside of this auditorium?"" in order to truly review a film. In the case of ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"" the answer to that question is ""yes, yes, yes"". It shows a maturity of the journey we follow Eggsy on, and honestly, I am looking forward to its next installment.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

This was something of a gamble, as the comic series was not that well known and the previews seems to show the movie as another spy knock off. This only lowered expectations as it became a surprise hit, thanks to it's throwback-style of 1960's spy movies and it's over-the-top nature gave the genre a fresh breath of air. Given how dark and grisly spy movies had become with The Bourne series and 007 going in that direction, it was nice to see Kingsmen: The Secret Service as something more light hearted. As soon as I left the theater, I felt that the series would continue with more crazy stories to tell about the finely dressed spies and how they go after villains. Kingsmen went from something few were interested in into something people were excited to see. I became even more ecstatic when I found out that the story was going show what the ""American Kingsmen"" were going to be like. So lets see if Kingsmen: The Golden Circle is just as entertaining as the first. In the time that has passed, Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton) has embraced his part of the Kingsmen, taking the title of ""Galahad"" in honor of his late mentor. He's also in a relationship with the princess of Sweden Tilde (played by Hanna Aiström). The film opens with Eggsy fighting a former Kingsmen candidate Charlie, now turned villain. Though Eggsy manages to escape, Charlie's bionic arm hacks into the Kingsmen computers, revealing all the data to an unknown source. While Eggsy is having dinner with the royal Swedish family, a collection of missiles destroys the Kingsmen headquarters, the remaining agents, and even Eggsy's home.With only tech guru Merlin (played by Mark Strong) the only survivor, he and Eggsy follow protocol and are lead to a whiskey facility in Tennessee, which is home to Statesmen, an American spy organization. Upon meeting their leader Champagne (played by Jeff Bridges), he's saddled along with agent Whiskey (played by Pedro Pascal) to investigate a worldwide drug poisoning that may be connected with the attacks on Kingsmen. This drug organization, run by Poppy Adams (played by Julianne Moore), is the Golden Circle and is responsible for a large amount of drugs that are dealt with. As Eggsy is investigating, he also comes to discover that his mentor Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) is not dead.It seems that Matthew Vaughn did his best to keep the same tone from the previous movie, only to step it up. The Kingsmen: The Golden Circle is definitely over-the-top, violent, and comical. Does that it make it better then the first one? No, as some of it can get a little too ridiculous (there's a cannibal sequence that made half of my theater laugh and the other half squeamish in horror) and though the last movie was a respectable two hours, this was simply overlong.I can say that as an action movie, this did satisfy me as there were some fantastically staged moments, especially the finale that takes place at the villains layer (which is modeled out of a 1950's Americana town). Other sequences including car chases in London and a mountain scene in Italy shows that Matthew Vaughn still has some unique ideas. What he needed was a more polished script as if in order to extend the story, there are moments that only seem tacked on in to make the plot ten minutes longer.Though guys like Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges had their fun moments, the winners here are Taren Egerton, Julianne Moore, and another celebrity guest that I won't spoil here. Julianne Moore is clearly having a lot of fun being the stereotypical spy villain, with a more motherly nature that does give her an unnerving edge, even if it's not as memorable as Samuel L. Jackson's performance from the first movie. Seeing Taren Egerton having gone from street punk to gentlemen-like has been a fascinating trip, only exemplifying what a good actor their young man is.I'll give this eight laser lassos out of ten. Though some might see it as overkill, I found Kingsmen: The Golden Circle to be just as entertaining as the original. It might have matched it had the movies' runtime been cut by fifteen minutes. Just understand that if you feel like that the sequel is over-the-top, go and watch the first movie to remind yourself that it's always been that way.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I did, however, experience the exact opposite and cringed several times as the story unfolded and very obvious situations and very cliché actions were shown. And when you add in the gratuitous use of a certain famous musician, and all the obvious cowboy/American stereotypes, then you may come to realize that you're being led down a very shallow path. Additionally you're coping with watching lots of wildly unbelievable tech, and it adds to how the film ends up quite a bit cheesy. If there is a third film, I hope the producers really give us a better story and less CGI. This second installment was too much eye candy and not enough story and emotional engagement.

Therefore, his choice to do this made me VERY excited/hopeful for this movie. And after watching it, I was fulfilled. It's different enough from the first so I can differentiate the two, but it doesn't do anything revolutionary, like the first. If it ain't broke, then don't fix it.What're the positives for this movie? Vaughn's style certainly springs to mind. Vaughn is, without question, one of my favourite directors working today. I've liked every film he has released and his style is such a vibrant & fun one. That's no different here. I love the way he shoots and edits this movie to keep adrenaline pumping in the action sequences and humour bubbling in the middle moments. Does the style differ from the original? No. But the original looked fantastic, as does this. Action sequences are jaw dropping and a blast to watch, and the middle moments are well shot also. It's a visual delight!Another praise I can give this movie is the range of performances from its cast. Taron Egerton, once again, does a fantastic job as Eggsy, and really sells the 'Not James Bond' archetype. He's everything James Bond is and isn't, and Egerton sells this flawlessly. Colin Firth is, once again, excellent as Harry, and I admire the man for his action capabilities. Dramatic experience from 'The King's Speech' and whatnot also aids him in the quiet/dramatic moments. Mark Strong{Sherlock Holmes; Kick-Ass} reprises his role as Merlin. The accent remains, as does the straight faced attitude. What more do you want out of a character? I was very pleased he reprised the role. The only statesmen that is worthy of mention(not because of performance but because of contribution) is Pedro Pascal{The Great Wall; Game of Thrones}'s Whiskey. Yes, his name is that of an alcoholic beverage but it's hilarious so who cares. Anyway, Pascal is excellent in the action sequences but I think he lacks some credibility in the more dramatic moments. Only a minor flaw but it's still something that irked me. Edward Holcroft{Kingsman: The Secret Service; The Sense of An Ending} was also great in his role of Charlie, that posh brat from the first movie. Same actor; same character; same desire to end the git's life. So well done to Holcrof; he made me want to assault him.As for minor praise I can award the film, I love the music and costume/set design. The use of Frank Sinatra in the original movie was already hilarious but they return to that style of music in this, and it is as funny it was originally. I also love the costume design for both the Kingsman and Statesmen. The stereotypes for each country perfectly shine through and are humorously executed. Then there is the set design. The main place I admired the set design was in the villain's base. I won't spoil anything but I thought it was a very funny and eccentric environment to use.Vaughn's signature style of humour also shines through. I absolutely love his style of comedy. There is a character in this movie that I didn't expect to be as funny as they were but they delivered. Each character has a couple good jokes and funny moments, and succeeded in making the movie very entertaining.That humour point is also an issue I have with this movie. Some of the dramatic moments are undercut directly with jokes, which makes them lose all impact. I really dislike this. In the first one, the dramatic scenes were still dramatic while the funny scenes were still funny. Here, the funny scenes are still funny but the dramatic scenes are blended with funny moments, so I wish they just left them moments alone. There was one in particular I had a distaste for, which I won't get into for the sake of spoilers.Now for another unfortunate issue: the villain. Not that Julianne Moore does a bad job; she was good, but the character she was portraying was not. She remained in one location for the entire film and contributed nothing to the plot until the last moments. Valentine was, debates about the lisp(it was great) aside, at least an active villain. He contributed to the plot and murdered Galahad. That made him pretty intimidating and genuinely threatening. Moore's villain just sits there and acts creepy to make her more threatening. Nothing wrong with that as a performance but she doesn't 'do' anything.Another issue I had was the unfortunate sidelining of the Statesmen. I wish they gave them more screen time. It was annoying to see them CONSTANTLY pushed to the side, especially considering the marketing campaign depicted them having a reasonably large role. I don't think its a spoiler when I say that Halle Berry, JEFF BRIDGES & Channing Tatum are all just pushed to the side without a second thought. That was immensely disappointing because I wanted to get to know these characters. Alas, I cannot.Overall, I liked this movie. It's not dissimilar to the first one but I like that. Everyone loved the first one so what's the point in drastically changing it around? It's an engaging and entertaining way to spend two hours so I can 100% recommend it. I'm not saying the critics were WRONG, but I certainly think they've been overly harsh on it. I'll rate this movie 8 'PUT_IT_DOWNS' out of 10!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Just as the Kingsmen are parodies on the stiff upper lip British gentleman the Statesmen are parodies of the southern US gentleman (if you can actually call them that) only even more so. Maybe it is my European heritage but I personally feel the Kingsmen are fairly cool where the drawling Statesmen are more on the silly side.Once again Eggsy is the main character although I have to say that I personally like Harry, the original Galahad, much more. He has much more charisma, elegans and smarts. Since he is portrayed on the movie posters I guess it is not much of a spoiler when I say that, to my delight, the rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately Eggsy is sometimes quite cool and plays his British gentleman role quite well and sometimes he is just dumb as a doornail.Poppy Adams is okay but she is bordering on the ludicrous too much for my taste. The we have a certain English artist, a Sir no less. I do not know how much they had to pay to get him to take part in this movie but I am fairly sure I would consider it too much. He was just silly as far as I am concerned.The movie is of course loaded with gadgets, most of them of the variety that makes noises of varying levels of loudness usually resulting in one or more bad guys biting the dust. It is almost gadget overload but I really liked. Sometimes this amount of totally unbelievable gadgets is dragging down the movie more than anything but in this one it was mostly a success. To me Harry and the gadgetry is what makes this movie.Given that I am originally from Sweden I have mixed feelings about Eggsy's girlfriend and the Swedish royalties. I guess those parts were okay but I could have been without them as well. At least I feel that however wrote the scene with the ""royal"" dinner could have read up on Swedish etiquette. Knocking on a glass with your spoon, knife or fork means you are about to give a speech, NOT that you want the plates to be changed. A professional servant, and the Swedish royalty DO have professional servants, do not need to be told when to change plates.The actual story is, well it is original at least but I would not rate it any higher than okay. It served as a vehicle for stringing together all the stunts and jokes so it served its purpose. The worst part of the story was that I was actually finding myself agreeing with the president. This might perhaps shock some people but I am sorry, if you are dumb enough to ingest that crap, which is also highly illegal, then I have no sympathy for you.If you get upset about stupid plot details and plot holes then be prepared to be upset. There are plenty of them in this movie. To me it did not matter too much since this is not really a thriller or drama. It is a spy parody / comedy. Having said that it did piss me off a bit that this advanced organisation did not have brains enough to deal with the piece of equipment left in the London cab at the beginning of the movie. I mean, it was just soo obvious what would happen.Anyway, on the whole this movie was great fun to watch. I hope we get another sequel. Perhaps one with a Japanese version of the Kingsmen? There ought to be plenty of cultural stereotypes to play on there.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Long story short, I left the theater a bit underwhelmed and I knew I'd set the bar too high. That aside, the movie does satisfy all aspects of what an action movie is expected to be.The story itself seems to be creatively done, but not executed as well as the first movie. Of course, there is a well-thought out and original psychopathic villain, but the movie is less riveting, and (unfortunately) less humorous. I, however, say that with the best intentions because I still have hope in this franchise.Though it may seem that this movie was a complete let down as I describe it, it really isn't as bad as people may think. The fight scenes had been done very well, the gadgets almost as showy as those of the first movie. Additionally, there is something so satisfying about getting every little piece in the story that references the last movie. That being said, I'd suggest watching Kingsman: The Secret Service first, or you might be spending much of your time after the movie on the Internet, laboring over every detail you didn't understand in The Golden Circle. It was almost like the Kingsman I so dearly knew and loved, but not quite. It is not at all a waste of your time (even if you do decide to disregard my recommendations on watching the first movie). You'll still walk into a film that has a touch of feel-good and a whole lot of energy.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

There is a few famous names in this movie, if you have not heard - don't look up who it is, and those characters are absolutely great in it. This is one of those movies I could watch again and again and never get bored with. Similar to how most people felt about the original Hangover movie.

Elton John as himself in feathered Captain Fantastic wardrobe goes Bruce Lee flying kick on the bad guy. Taron Egerton's Agent Eggsy places high tech sensor in the cavity of groupie Clara, played by hippie spacey Poppy Delevingne, not the one in her mouth. ""Kingsman 2"" culminates in the exquisite over-the-top martial arts and gun display with Eggsy and his mentor Harry, played by Colin Firth, at drug cartel headquarters Poppyland in the jungles of Cambodia to the tune of Elton's ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"". ""The Golden Circle"" ironically and touchingly lands in Colin Firth's soothing gravitas as Harry. Eggsy tells Harry that he fears if they can't retrieve the villain's antivirus, his fiancée Princess Tilde, lovely Hanna Alstrom, will die. Eggsy regrets that he fell in love with her; thus, violating Kingsman oath. Harry says, ""Having something to lose makes life worth living."" Firth can truly land a line. In ""The King's Speech"" when he says, ""I have a voice."" he broke my heart. ""The King's Speech"" is one of best movies ever made. Clearly, ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is not in that company. Contrary to critical mass opinion, ""Kingsman 2"" is just plain fun. I believe that counts for something. Writer and Director Matthew Vaughn returns in his sequel of the very entertaining ""Kingsman"" with scattered cluster of narratives, mostly outrageous and hilarious. Julliane Moore does her whacked out best as global drug lord Poppy, who single handedly annihilates the Kingsman. All that apparently remains is Eggsy and his beloved tech adviser Merlin, played by stalwart Mark Strong. Poppy as part of her master plan created a virus that will kill anyone, who uses any of Poppyland's recreational illicit drugs or associated derivatives. This targets millions of people. This is all part of Poppy's scheme to extort the United States. Comical Bruce Greenwood in this satirical incarnation of the President of the United States sees this as the leverage point to ""End the War on Drugs"". Without either suppliers or addicts, there is no war. This stark simplicity is part of the warped sense of humor in Vaughn and Jane Goldman's screenplay. Forced to regroup Eggsy and Merlin follow their intelligence trail to the American version of Kingsman in Kentucky—Statesman. Channing Tatum is very cool as Agent Tequila, who provides their introduction, and mercilessly kicks both their asses with his martial arts skills. Too bad Tatum is not leveraged more here. Perhaps, in ""Kingsman 3""? Statesman Leader Champ, played by laid back Jeff Bridges, and adviser Ginger, subtly brilliant Halle Berry, reveal to Eggsy and Merlin that Harry is alive, thought shot to death in ""Kingsman"". However, death in movies is as we all know: relative. Harry is alive without memory of his Kingsman past. There are great action sequences like where Agent Whiskey, charismatic Pedro Pascal, kills the army of winter soldiers with six shooters and a laser lasso. When the noise quiets, ""Kingsman 2"" meditates its center in the unexpected homage of Eggsy's mentors: Harry and Merlin. In the most touching scene Harry tells Merlin, ""It has been an honor"" Both Harry and Merlin are the Fathers that Eggsy never had, and they defined the man he becomes. ""Kingsman 2"" is bittersweet and nice in this acknowledgment. Besides as my friend Ron pointed out, the f bomb spewing Elton John in the movie actually might not be caricature. Yeah, there is a lot of weird going on in ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"". Most of it works, because of talented actors, a sense of humor, and some heart.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"3","/10","The 'Die Another Day' of Kingsmen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4006715/?ref_=tt_urv","domgwyther","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66115660/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2017","This year has seen a number of the more original genre films in recent memory receive the sequel treatment. Back in 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy was a breath of fresh air for the superhero film, John Wick showed us how action films should be and Kingsman: The Secret Service injected a much-needed sense of fun back into the spy movie.Now, director Matthew Vaughn, along with an all-star cast return for The Golden Circle and waste absolutely no time in establishing that this is going to be 100% nuts.Before the film even starts the disembodied voice of Mark Strong bellows out, in character as Merlin, reminding the audience to switch off their phones or he'll 'repeat the church scene on us'.We're then treated to an insane opening car chase through London complete with android arms, mini-guns and a submarine, all set to Prince's Let's Go Crazy.By jumping the shark in the first five minutes, Vaughn quickly dispels all sense of realism, to quote Eggsy 'This ain't that kind of movie bruv'.As the plot about the sinister drug organisation of the title unfolds, things just get more and more ridiculous. There are robot dogs, there are laser lassos, there are even devices that can repair your brain following a head-shot.That last one is indicative of the main problem with Kingsman 2. There are no stakes. The first film was insane, but it still felt like there were consequences, thanks in no small part to the sheer level of violence on display. Here the tone and the plot lead you to believe that at any point someone will turn up with a gadget that will solve all the problems, save the day and no one will get hurt.The comedic tone has also become a bit of a problem. While the first film flirted with some fairly controversial punchlines, this time things go a step too far. Specifically, there is a sequence set at Glastonbury festival which is just gratuitous in every sense of the word. This scene, which has already started to grab headlines, is one of a couple of instances where the film slips into full Austin Powers territory.Although it sometimes oversteps the mark, The Golden Circle is here to have fun and on that front, it delivers in spades. The cast, both old and new, are clearly having the time of their lives and it's hard for that not to translate off-screen. Julianne Moore is wonderfully nuts as the murderous Poppy in a sickly sweet performance that calls back a certain Dolores Umbridge from the Harry Potter series (who is, in my opinion, one of the greatest screen villains in recent decades).The Statesman also make a predictably ostentatious debut. The American version of the Kingmen are represented by Jeff Bridges, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal and Halle Berry, all on fine form. While the introduction of the Statesman provides a new dimension to the world, it's a shame that a lot of what people loved about the first film i.e. the sheer British-ness, has been lost in the confusion.Sequelitis is on display in Kingsman 2 more so that any other follow-up this year. The filmmakers have fully embraced the 'bigger is better' approach and as a result, the film often feels bloated and overlong. There are at least two subplots that could have been cut out in their entirety, and the kinetic, frantic camerawork that made the 'church scene' from part one so memorable is definitely over-used this time around.That's not to say the film doesn't deliver some great fight sequences towards the end, it's just that we've spent an extra hour getting there that we didn't need. Likewise, some of the best humor is saved for the final act, and surprisingly enough it's often delivered by the one member of the cast who is not necessarily known for being an 'actor'.Kingsman: The Golden Circle is definitely fun, and on that level, it's a success. Much like Guardians 2 and John Wick 2 though, it can't recapture the fresh, genre-shaking impact of the first movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was so happy to see that Matthew Vaughn was returning for this movie, it was not something I expected and that made it all the more gratifying when he was confirmed to return. He created such a great tone and style in the first film and I didn't want to see someone else try and replicate that. He directed the action in this film very well, suitably over the top and very fast but the way he does them still makes it feel somewhat real and they're all extremely entertaining to watch. Most of the characters in this film are great, Taron Egerton was once again great in this movie I liked what they did with his character in the film, it managed to keep him more relatable like he was in the first. Merlin was actually my favourite character in this movie, Mark Strong stole this film, he was really funny when he needed to be but I loved his relationship with Eggsy and it created for some of the films more memorable moments. I liked the inclusion of the Statesmen into this world, they didn't just feel like a re-skinned Kingsman but there own organisation. I liked Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Pedro Pascal in this film they don't always get a lot to do but always have a good screen quality to them.I liked that Vaughn didn't just try and recreate the first film again, this is defiantly a different film from The Secret Service, the American setting worked very well, the characters aren't as well equipped or prepared making them seem more vulnerable. The returning characters as a whole are more human in this film, it lessens The homages compared to the original and true to function as it's own franchise and universe and I thought that really worked well for not only this film but likely any other instalment's still to come. I can see where some of the negative reviews are coming from, this is defiantly not a perfect movie. Colin Firth was one of the biggest highlights of the first film but he should not have been resurrected, his character arc was very cliché and dragged the pacing down as it had to be resolved, he just didn't have the magic that he had before and seeing Eggsy and Merlin interact and their chemistry made me realise that he didn't need to be in this film. As I said Tatum and Pascal are both good in this film but they don't get a lot to do and left me wanting more. Poppy was also a very weak villain, it didn't help that she was coming after Samuel L Jackson's villain, Richmond Valentine, who was such a great antagonist for the original but there was just nothing to the character. She had no motivation for her actions, she was far to over-the-top and she didn't really do anything leaving all her henchmen to do the work while we get a few brief scenes of her sitting in her hideout. Kingsman The Golden Circle is not as good as it could have been. It leaves a lot of characters without anything to do and suffers from a weak antagonist but that was outweighed by the great directing, brilliant returning characters and the changing up off the formula. I think the critics are being far to harsh on this film and I am still very excited for what comes next for this franchise. 8/10: A- (Fantastic)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Expectations were moderate, poise was relaxed, and bare feet were atop the coffee table. When the movie concluded, I felt my prognosis was shattered. The movie plays to the slow- motion, flip/flop/f*ck-em-up crowd that has kept many franchises afloat, but this brownie seems fully baked to decadence. The ""Dukes of Hazzard meets Get Smart meets The Avengers (the Steed and Peel program)"" vibe is affable now that James Bond has outlived his usefulness. I regret I wield the remorseless temerity to articulate that antipathy for 007, but the incontrovertible reality stands that ""Kingsman"" receives the crown and doesn't spoil the lineage for the British Espionage/Action genre. Bond has nestled into ennui. ""Kingsman"" succeeds with Julianne Moore as the villainess, perhaps conjured from a lost episode of the 1960s Batman TV program (minus the tilted frame). She's a goof, and she, too, is shameless. Channing Tatum's participation is peripheral; however, he proves integral to the future of the franchise. The movie is not quite ""Big and Dumb"" like those ""Mission: Impossible"" movies because it does not have an ego like Tom Cruise tainting the production. Colin Firth plays his role equitably, Mark Strong is meritorious, and even Jeff Bridges has a chuckle. They've earned their downtime as grander schemes await. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is simply a very good movie because it delivers on its promises of keeping you distracted with sugary breakfast cereal and John Denver songs so you don't notice that every other aspect of true life is not worth the waking moments. Watch the movie, then sleep. We'll wake you for ""Geostorm""; I trust you wouldn't be able to sleep through that, anyway.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Right.Damnit, fellas, learn to edit. This movie severely needed to be cut down. I'd say at least two-three subplots and 40 minutes oughta do it.I really didn't want to rate this movie so low, because a few scenes were actually really good. Unfortunately, those scenes were so few and so far in-between - plus, they happened so late in this overlong project. I actually started this review with the same amount of stars I gave the first of the Kingsman ""franchise:"" 3/5 stars. But, after collecting my thoughts, there were sadly more negatives than positives to equate an average rating.First, as stated, the length. Second, the poor excuse to bring 'em back for the sequel since people loved the character cliché. Third and in conjunction with two, that damn amnesia subplot. I hate that trope and they wasted so much screen time to get said favorite character back to normal. (SEE: Men in Black II.) Fourth, the overuse of Fox News. Bah!It's been a couple of years since I've seen the first, so maybe the sequel's opening was a little too radical for me. It involves an unintentionally hilarious and bad action scene that I kept expecting was some sort of cheap cartoon since it was so fake. I nearly wanted to turn this off several times on how bored I was with how absurd it looked. I stuck with it, despite two strikes against it in less than 10 minutes: I knew how long this movie was going to be and I couldn't get invested with the comically bad CGI in the action.That said, I'm glad I did finish the movie off because there were a couple of well-worth scenes ahead. But, only if you can climb aboard the ridiculous nature of this alternative universe. The simple synopsis is: a secluded drug kingpin (played deliciously by Julianne Moore) is drugging her own drugs with a deadly virus in order to come out of the closet as a heroine (get it?) after giving everyone the antidote and become a star! Only one thing, she's got the Kingsmen to deal with! Or what's left of them and their plot-device cousins.That's like 10% of the movie as there's far too much more going on. But, at least, it's the gist of what the core is. The movie's wildly unrealistic, but as the movie progresses, you kinda drift into the weird nature and accept it. Sadly, though, one outrageously bad figure is the President. (No spoilers, he literally advises his intents immediately.) Any time of my entire life prior to 2016 would I think this President is lampoonish and would never happen. The scariest thing of this movie was how spot-on they were with our current President and how badly he would act just like this psycho moron.Of all the craziness here and the complete suspension from reality...they nailed our current evil and brainless leader. Probably, most satirical, was that they used many scenes from Fox News and in real life, they worship the grounds he walks on. Here they go down with that sinking ship. Woo-hoo. Seriously, that should add another star right there. But, no. This movie was far too long and some of the many subplots made me cringe on how needlessly they stretched this out. Even when the climax concluded, I checked out as we had about 20 minutes still to go.I kept reciting the famous words of Seinfeld's Elaine Benes in my head: ""I can't do this anymore! It's too long! End this movie already!""***Final Thoughts: Ironically, my dear friend and movie critic just recently, in his latest podcast, spoke about separating politics and his reviews/show. I added a lot here because, frankly, they did spoof our childlike President with his absolutely horrible policies and impulses. It's worth noting, the best shot in the film, above all else, was the last shot of Fox News and the fate of the President. Priceless and worth watching the movie alone.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Was handled well and with plenty of good humour, avoiding all the cheap shots (mostly). This is a movie to go and enjoy for the imagination and innovation that's been put into it.

This hyperkinetic action thriller sequel again delivers a dizzying amount of souped up and slowed down physical action. At the same time, the screenplay has included more emotionally gut-wrenching moments that can almost bring the audience to tears. Immediately, however, the audience is jolted into attention with an almost unreal action sequence that seems to defy even screen reality in its depiction of extended mayhem.Overall the plot and set design almost seem to take James Bond movies as its inspiration except with a lot of joviality and at the same time a raw, gritty, nasty, and even sadistic delivery of willful murder with glee. The movie thus is even repulsive at times, loaded with swear words that seem to besmirch the genteel nature of the British-side of Kingsmen. The political undertones in the movie can be startling considering the contemporary nature of the reign of President Trump and surprising in the contrast to the upcoming Tom Cruise movie American Made (2017) suggesting America's connection with the international drug cartels.The movie it seems borders on somewhat of a fine balance of schizophrenic tendencies with its primary plot and its twists and wry sadistic behavior along with the British sense of humor. The audience is tossed about almost as the characters are in a spinning cable car. It is novel in its action shots and offers up an action ride of entertainment with brief scenes of sensitive emotional reflection on death, sacrifice, and even romantic betrayal and faithfulness.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

So , "" the golden circle "" is directed by Mathew Vaughn , the genius behind kick ass and the first kingsman movie . This movie is the very definition of what a sequel should be , even though it had moments of nostalgia from the first movie , it didn't rely on it completely and also focused on its own story . The best thing is that they got Harry back in this movie , and that sort of gives you the ""men in black"" vibe. Taron Egerton was great and so were the supporting cast , but it would've been better if Channing Tatum had more screen presence . But its possible they're saving him for the 3rd movie. They also killed off a lot of important characters in this movie , so after a point you just don't care anymore. The villain's plan wasn't as brilliant as valentine's from the first movie. But the action and the adrenaline pumping music mask that. In the end , kingsman 2 is a perfect sequel with great moments of nostalgia , great action , great characters and one big bottle of statesman whisky .","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It seems like it's the cool thing to do nowadays to take what is supposed to be a fun action movie and expect it to be the next Citizen Kane. Some movies are just supposed to be fun and keep you entertained. That's how I felt about this movie. It had a decent cast and brought back several people from the first movie, even if briefly. I thought that some of the over-the-top weapons and gadgets, especially from the ""Statesman"" side really made this a joy to watch. There were points in the movie when I audibly said ""Are you kidding me? This is awesome!"" And that, in a nutshell is what the ""Kingsman"" movies are all about. Cheeky, sometimes dirty humor with all the nifty gadgets you can imagine. Kind of like James Bond before they turned him into an AK-47 wielding action movie star rather than a debonair spy. If you want two hours of entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously but can still manage to tug on your heartstrings a little, give this movie a shot. I took my sweet time getting to watch this movie because I saw how low the reviews were in relation to the first one. All I can say is I am kicking myself now for not watching this movie immediately.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Enjoyable but a huge mess","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8860123/?ref_=tt_urv","mickeythechamp","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52112075/?ref_=tt_urv","8 February 2023","So, I watched this because we needed a nice dumb action movie, and I remembered not being the biggest fan of this movie first time around but enjoyed it overall. This time around I see it as this huge cluster of ideas that are all executed halfway and overall, this is a huge mess and a missed opportunity. I like the style and universe of Kingsman and when the movie is fun and dumb It works, but this time it tried too many ""I want to make you feel"" scenes and sequences witch just don´t land. I still like it and have fun with it, but I really have to recognize all the flaws with this movie.After the Kingsman are compromised, Eggsy and Merlin most seek out the organization Statesman to help them track down a new villain.The biggest problem with this this movie is it feels like they had a lot of separate plots they wanted to do, but just trew them together without picking and choosing. There is a villain plot, an amnesia plot, a girlfriend plot, the Statesman. There is just too much ground to cover and it feels like a movie of side quests more than a coherent movie. I read that the original runtime was far longer so maybe the long cut might fix this, but I think this would just make the movie more confusing.A big mistake for me was the erasure of stakes. Yes, this is a spy parody and we know secret agents barely get hurt, but a decision brings back something from the past and to me it felt like the biggest copout ever. I hate when stakes are erased, what I felt once will now be eased by this movie's decisions and to me it´s just a cheap way to try to make me happy. Stop doing this.The twist in this movie is kind of just there. It feels like a last-minute thought but the outcome of it is kind of cool.The characters seem dumbed down even more in this movie. They make so many small mistakes and one in particular lead to a really unearned death scene that once again, was just here to make me feel. I really think this movie rushes itself and has so many problems finding out what it wants to be.I love the way action is done and filmed here. The cinematography in this movie is so fun and experimental. The camera follows the action in an exiting in your face way and feels weightless and without boundary. It made me both excited during action and a particular scene in a tent is so much funnier with the help of the camera. The effects used are mostly not the greatest when they stand alone, but together with the action creates this hyper stylized comic book feeling movie. The impacts land so well, and the traveling of camera and characters flow well together. The music and songs used during action scenes also enhance the experience and make them even more memorable.The highlight of this movie is the fight scene at the villain's lair and the dinner scene at the end. This really highlights how fun and creative the action direction of this movie is and you are sitting there wuuing over the cool moves.The villain needed more time to really hit home. She´s cool and her aesthetic and lair is so fun, but it never get´s the screentime it deserves.I´ve heard complaints this movie is too political and I´m like maybe? It´s talking about drug legalization and comparing to other legal substances but I see this more as the villains drive more than a statement. Spy villains are always a bit political anyway, aren't they? And I feel like no definitive answer on the matter is given, it tells both sides, it even makes jokes about it. I don't think the movie wanted to say something but just have a reason for the plot to happen.I really liked the expansion of the universe with the Stateman. It´s a fun idea and it makes you wonder what other forces are out there.The humor is fine here but is mixed with these overly serious scenes. It leaves the movie tonally confused. In general, this spy comedy really wants you to feel at times. It´s very see-through and didn't work for me. It tired too hard and really didn't have to.The score is good at times but also too cliche at others it´s a mixed bag. The instrumentals are all good though.Golden circle is a movie I till have a lot of fun with but it´s a very frustrating watch on so many levels. The aspects I like are outweighed by the pure mess and bad decisions and overall I would rather return to the first movie 10 times more than this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The comic book ""Kingsman"" provided the basis for 2015's ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" a blockbuster sized action picture with, ostensibly, a cheeky attitude not unlike that of ""Kick-Ass"" (also directed by Matthew Vaughn). For many, that movie filled the sendup/pastiche/update bill quite nicely. Instead of an official intelligence industry, the secret agent outfit Kingsman, operating out of a high-end tailor's shop, is a privatized law-enforcement security service with a lot of high-tech weaponry and convoluted cutting-edge tech protocol. The movie itself, a sort of bildungsroman in which raw recruit Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is given a class-conscious catapult to lethal gentlemanhood by older agent Harry (Colin Firth), was sufficiently slick and energetic that you might not notice at first what a callous, nihilistic, smirky, sexist, retrograde pile of expensive garbage it was. It even managed to make its last-call anal sex joke seem mildly charming ... The true tell in the first film was the character of Gazelle, a henchperson of the main villain, a woman whose prosthetic legs are sharp knife edges. With these she can amputate limbs, and even cut a man entirely in half. These mutilations were depicted in a sterile, near analgesic fashion; the audience is meant to titter at the loss of life and limb delivered so efficiently, with no pain, no mess. Similar dismemberments and body halvings are delivered in the sequel, ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle."" It's violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that's silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim. Speaking of actors, this is a movie that makes you wonder about them as a class. Can Colin Firth, Channing Tatum, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges, Poppy Delevingne, Julianne Moore, Michael Gambon, and so many others in the cast be themselves as soul-dead and life-hating as this movie? If not (and it's probably, or at least hopefully, not) who do we blame? Their agents? The whole bloody system that's out of order?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Why Channing Tatum wasn't given more screen time? He'd have rocked it. I can't stand him for his d-bag roles, but he kind of found an exalted status in here.Loved the integration of back story. All in all decent flick except a little too long for the punch and shot and pretty milked out and drawn out and predictable and cliche at times.

Alone the fighting scene in the church in The Secret Service is more worth than all of The Golden Circle.I won't say that this movie is a total disaster, but after half an hour or so I was bored watching and relieved after the movie was done and I left the cinema and could get a good shot of fresh air. Anyway, imo The Golden Circle got too much CGI and not enough story, and the fun/humor felt forced or uninspired, and the action scenes are all just fx.

The film opens with a delightfully entertaining car chase/fight scene, that does go a bit absurd on the CGI, but is fun nonetheless.Overall Eggsy's adventure stateside is an adrenaline filled rollercoaster, with only a few missteps in the plot. The largest misstep for me in this movie is the villain, the villain in the Golden Circle is sadly not as charismatic or as interesting as Samuel L. Jackson's Valentine. Julianne Moore's Poppy does have her moments of cruelty that definitely shine (i.e. hamburgers) but other than those few moments she seemed slightly flat for my taste.Pedro Pascal brings a lot of fun to the film in his portrayal of Whiskey and was indifferent about Channing Tatum's very minuscule part, but he did have a few moments.The movie was fun and I would definitely watch it again, the action scenes alone make it worthwhile.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was always more taken with the slightly cheeky Roger Moore era of the Bond franchise, before it all turned uber-serious courtesy of Daniel Craig. Therefore, I was delighted to see great stunts, ridiculous gardens and over-the-top villains hiding in hollowed-out volcanos (or the like). Now, I'm even more delighted to say that the sequel is actually pretty good, too. Yes, you can always argue that the sequel will never topple the original (Empire Strikes Back, Godfather II, Aliens and T2 excluded), but, as far as sequels go, this one stays pretty much true to the spirit of the first and is definitely worth a watch if you like spy movies in general, or – like me – are stuck in the past in the Connery/Moore Bond era.In case you're not up on the first movie, you don't really have to be as this one stands alone quite nicely as well. It's about a super secret English spy agency that masquerades as a tailor's in the middle of London. However, one sunny day someone goes and drops bombs on all but one of the Kingsmen agents, leaving the last man standing to flee across the pond and join his counterparts in America, aka The Statesmen (and find out who was behind it all, obviously). It's good to see all of the cast have returned for this one (even ones you may not think should be in there, but that goes into 'spoiler' territory) which is always nice to see. And it's equally nice to see that the film isn't afraid to kill off characters who you may not expect to see go out in the way that they do. Not only do the Kingsmen and Statesmen have to find out who blitzed the London agents, but also stop Julianne Moore from distributing drugs that will poison the world while they're at it. Now, despite my overall praise and enjoyment of the film, I felt that Julianne Moore was possibly the weakest element. Not because she was an especially bad villain – she's a great actress and did everything she could to appear as menacing to the world's population as possible, but she had one hell of a tough act to follow – Mr Samuel L Jackson. He was so crazy (and brilliant!) in the original that anyone was going to struggle when following in his footsteps.However, that's just a minor gripe. You could say that if you've seen one spy movie then you've seen them all – i.e. a super villain wants to do X and the hero must stop him, then insert a few high-octane car chases and fist fights along the way. Well, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' doesn't offer anything particularly new by going against that formula. It's simply the way it's done that sets it apart from the rest. It's silly, light-hearted fun, but at the same time is able to dip effortlessly into the action genre and also provide some genuine heart-felt moments. I hope we definitely at least get a trilogy out of this franchise. Dark, gritty Bond is okay if you're in the mood to be mega serious, but for those of us who still like our spy thrillers a little more light-hearted, then Kingsman is definitely the way forward.About the only major thing that jarred with me was some really noticeable CGI backdrops, but the action scenes were so well-shot that these more than made up for the Glastonbury festival that was blatantly created on a PC.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

A fairly well tailored action movie with just the right amount of over the top moments to keep some surprises around the corner. So of course I went in with high hopes with Kingsman: The Golden Circle given we got Matthew Vaughn directing and he never returns for sequels.The film takes place shortly after the first film as Eggsy has grown into his own as a Kingsman facing old rivals from the program and Poppy (Julianne Moore) beginning to spread a virus through recreational drugs that could kill millions. When the Kingsman's profiles are compromised, they find solace with the American Statesman to help take down this threat.Taron Edgarton really wears his confidence well as Eggsy as he's able to still balance his responsibilities while still feeling like the character I liked in the first film. I had my reservations seeing Colin Firth was returning given the scenario of the first film, but they add enough to explain his return, even if it is a head scratcher watching them explain.Alas, the film suffers from most follow up movies suffer from.......""sequelitis"". The camera work doubles down on the dizzying and jittery spinning from the first movie. This makes the action almost illegible to know what exactly is happening (thankfully this movie isn't in 3D, or be ready with a barf bag). What makes matters worse with the background in most scenes look severally fake and not blended well with the subjects. Even the film suffers from making Poppy virtually no different from Samuel L. Jackson's character in the first film as a strange talking villain who terrorizes the worlds most often used recreational items to exploit their dependency's on it to their death. And it takes adds one too many subplots as it's 141 minute runtime wears a bit heavy afterwhile.Kingsman: The Golden Circle has its fun and crazy moments, but it doesn't do too much to propel the story forward as it does stick to what your used to. I think audiences will have a good time if you saw the original, but I still feel the film has too much of a loose fit on its shoulders.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The loss of numerous colleagues, but the acquisition of a princess. One night stand turned committed relationship, he now juggles his affairs with a poise that appears safe from exploitation. He is a boy nesting into adulthood without any mentors. But then there is Merlin.Merlin has lost even more trusted friends, but his stubborn cheeks dam his tears. Once a meager staff member, now still a staff member but with more duties. Yet his job description is about to run off the page. An unsung hero, Merlin stays behind a keyboard, but his heart rests on the battlefield. The pair are thrust into an intercontinental scavenger hunt. The stakes have high body counts, and even higher ideological battles. The war has been raging for decades, but primarily on their cousin's soil. Now they must reveal dark executive secrets and swallow a red- painted truth that will sit idle as genocide combs the world.Two villains rear their ugly heads, but one wins the vile best in show prize. Sociopolitical conservatism, or a ruthless CEO of an illegal operation. The later's business is only illegal due to the former's blinding ignorance and rash policy penning. Of course, the business produces some questionable product lines, and fiddles with morality in the management sector, but its enemy also attempts to suppress their customers.The white-washed dome sells freedom, or a loose fragment of independence. The underground mega-company sells dependence. Their buyers overlap, and their ideologies pollute one another. This is the political strife that the lone Kingsmen must mediate. Negotiations have moved past lawyers and long tables. Compromise will be reached with surveillance and intelligence breaches. Agreements signed with bullets and deceased henchmen.The dimensions of the global dilemma are irresponsibly presented. The Kingsmen appear to uncover nuance is the conflict, but these moments of levity only hit as poor attempts to water down a gross oversimplification of the world's social climate. Making every side a villain only exterminates heroes. The failure begins when evil becomes your favorite label.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

After a slight break, I am back in the movie going audience and my first film is a long awaited sequel. As always there is slight trepidation as the film begins, is the sequel going to live up to the promise suggested by the first instalment. In this case there are absolutely no worries whatsoever. Any film that has such a mad frenetically outrageously special effect laden car chase beginning in first 20 seconds is OK by me. We return to the world of Kingsman approximately one year after the death of Galahad (Colin Firth) and find the Kingsman organisation has been infiltrated and destroyed by a mad criminal named Poppy Adams. As the only Kingsman agent that survives Eggsy thinks he is alone until he discovers there is a similar secret organisation in America, with their help he once again saves the day. Along the way we meet robotic killer dogs, a whole 50s style encampment deep in the jungle, and some very clever storytelling which involves flashbacks to the first film which very cleverly tie the two story lines together. A whole host of stars appear along the way with special mention to Channing Tatum who was just so funny dancing in not much more than his underpants, cowboy boots and hat. This is a film which does not take itself too seriously as there are many humorous moments and the stunts and spy paraphernalia is so outrageous I was almost willing them to be real. A wholly decent sequel to the first film. I enjoyed it immensely and could probably watch it again right now!!!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

So does the second Kingsman film match up to the first one? Unfortunately it does not, despite the star power behind it.Honestly, I would describe the plot at this point, but it's so convoluted that I don't feel like going into detail. Basically, there is a drug empire called The Golden Circle and the Kingsman need to stop it. There are so many subplots that at times it is hard to see where the actual plot is going.At a runtime of two hours and twenty-one minutes, it feels like the writers stuffed this film with plot elements, but not all of them are necessary. There is a subplot that involves Eggsy's girlfriend, and every time the movie spent time on it the pacing slowed to a halt. Especially since the actress who plays the girlfriend (the princess from the end of the first movie) is very dry and never entertaining or interesting.If Kingsman: The Golden Circle had spent less time on pointless subplots then it would be a whole lot better of a film. Nearly all of the action scenes are incredible, and in many cases they are right on par with the first film. The majority of the acting also really works, especially Taron Egerton, who should be getting a lot of good non-Kingsman roles in the near future.However, most of these good performances are wasted because they either give good characters no screen time, or major characters no development. Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry are all in this movie for a total of ten minutes, which is a complete waste given how accomplished these actors are. After a while, I started to wonder why they were not credited as cameos, because that's honestly what they were. Julianne Moore was excellent as the drug lord named Poppy, but she isn't really given a character to work with besides just being ""the bad guy."" Special shoutout to Elton John for being awesome in this movie.One character and performance that I really liked was Pedro Pascal as Agent Whiskey. He has always been underrated to me, and here he shows more of his acting chops. They go to a really interesting direction with his character, but then they ruin it about ten minutes after they go in this direction. I won't give anything away, but this is yet again a waste of a good character.Colin Firth is fine here, but the writers came up with a really lazy excuse for his presence in the film. Overall, this was a disappointing film despite having some great action scenes. It should have been about thirty minutes shorter, and they should have completely cut Eggsy's girlfriend from the film. I won't object if a third Kingsman film is announced, but I seriously hope they learn from their mistakes the next time around.I give Kingsman:The Golden Circle a C.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's just not a good movie. The original Kingsman was fun. It was a breath of fresh air. It had all those spy tropes that you love and handled them in an entertaining and fun way. So after it made a lot of money and got great press they decided to green light a sequel. Problem is, they didn't have a script. The original was based on a graphic novel called ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"". This one was completely new and therein lies the problem. They had no guide, they had no source and instead of crafting something original to follow up the first movie they just remade the first one but this time in the United States.Here we meet the American counterpart to Kingsman in the form of Statesman. Whereas Kingsman was undeniably British, Statesman is completely American. And when I mean American I mean cowboys and everything. Kingsman used a high tech umbrella. Statesmen use an energy lariat because they're cowboys. Get it?The rest of the movie follows the standard plot. Bad guy holds the world for ransom, good guys go in and save the day. But it's how you get from A to B that makes the difference. The first movie was fun but this felt... soulless. Sure there are great stunts, FX, direction, acting etc but it just felt empty and you're left feeling not necessarily ripped off but it just isn't satisfying. Can't give it more than 5/10. If you really want to see it, go for it but if you're on the fence I'd suggest waiting until it's on Netflix.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I've seen others say this had nothing to do with the first film and i don't understand that complaint, at all. There were lots of callbacks and references made to the first film and this also included almost all of the surviving cast. It had a similar storyline of the Kingsman saving the world from a deadly virus of sorts, rushing to release the antidote in time and that was fine.The plot was good, the acting was solid, and the action sequences were a lot of fun. I'm not sure why people disliked this so much. This isn't any different than sequels to Bond or Mission Impossible in that its not trying to be somethings it's not, which is a fun spy film with lots of gadgets, over the top fights, and lots of action. The dialogue is a bit quippy and some of it is cheesy but no more than the first film. This was not trying to be more than the first was and I appreciated that. The first film was one of the most fun spy films to come along in a long time with how it didn't take itself too seriously and this did the same. I really have no complaints with this. I guess I would have liked some characters to last longer than they did but I understand why they didn't, not just within the plot itself when they were taken out but it would have been too bloated towards the end if they weren't taken off the board. They did bring back a character who died in the first and that showed some of the deceased characters may return if there are more stories to tell in the world they've built. If you want to be entertained like the first film and watch some quality action, give this a shot. If you don't like it then I have a hard time believing you really enjoyed the first very much. It doesn't reinvent the wheel but it didn't need to. I'd give it 7.5 out of 10 if that were an option but I rounded up to 8 instead because I felt this has taken a beating for no reason.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Kingsmen: The Golden Circle, is several brilliant action scenes held together by a dull and tedious ""story"" and moments of striking stupidity.The first great action scene that starts the movie is followed by the first moment of true stupidity, in which super-agent Eggsy doesn't even think to check the high-tech thing he knows is in his car. After that, there is disaster, a contingency plan that makes no sense, and most stupid of all an utterly absurd scene involving planting a nonsensical tracking device apparently designed by a serial rapist.While there are a few good scenes with Elton John and Julianne Moore is a rather fun villain, overall this is a pretty bad movie. If you were to remove the action scenes it would be unwatchable, while if everything but the action scenes were removed it would be incomprehensible but more enjoyable.While the first movie was notable for it's extreme right-wing, paranoid anti-environmentalist story, the politics in the sequel are harder to pin down. The filmmakers do seem slightly contrite about the all-white-male heroes approach of the first film, tossing in Halle Berry as an American tech agent, and while the movie is still suspicious of government, this time their suspicious of anti-drug warriors while also portraying drug dealers as awful. Drug users are actually portrayed sympathetically (something that's been increasing during the caucasian-based opioid epidemic) and a review pointed out that in the movie it seems only white people use illicit drugs.So while the first movie was a paranoid Tea Party diatribe, this movie is just weirdly paranoid. I guess that's a step up.My advice, watch the action scenes, fast forward through everything else.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Vaughn made a much better movie than the latest series of ""bond"" at the moment. On the other hand, the director does not use all the stars with equal brilliance, the middle of the picture sags due to a lack of action and not always successful jokes, and the death of several key characters impresses much less than the death of Hart in The Secret Service.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A lot of reviews on here with low stars all have something in common, that all say it's too violent. In my opinion yes it's violent but that shouldn't mean it should get a low rating, think of how many things are violent out there that people love, Call of Duty, Deadpool, Kick - Ass, etc. 
If you take out the violence there are so many good points, great acting, awesome effects and to me a unique storyline. There is no doubt this film has cringy moments but there is no film without them.
Something that also stands out to me (more in secret service than golden circle) is the good portrayal of working class England. As someone who comes from a similar area to Eggsy (except up North) I love the idea of someone becoming a 'hero' of sorts.Really the main point I wanted to make was when watching be open minded and think about how many other much loved films/games are rude and violent before judging this one for it. As a drama student I make it crucial to look at more than just the surface of a film.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Lets get to brass tax: this film and its predecessor does not hold a candle to the iconic Bond film series which has been deemed by many to be the greatest film series of all time. Bond has class, charm and in most cases a decent story to weave all together. Kingsman is a bad joke and an insult to 007 by people putting it in the same sentence. In many Bond films Daniel Craig, Sean Connery and Roger Moore did many of their stunts, they were real fights and action sequences. Kingsman is an absolute joke when it comes to stunts or even fight scenes, it is like watching a CGI cartoon as we know its utter BS. At least Austin Powers was funny and never hid from the fact that it was a parody and not to be taken seriously. Kingsman is so ridiculous that its not even funny but just a sad mess to watch. This film will be sure to impress amateur film goers or teenagers who don't know much about anything. But for anyone with half a brain and some taste will be able to see through the ridiculous drivel that is Kingsman.","20 out of 100 found this helpful.

If you have ever seen a James Bond movie or even the first Kingsman movie, you have pretty much seen this movie. Kingsman 2 has it's good points, but one overwhelming bad point sunk this movie for me. There are a couple of good points, namely Halle Berry and Julianne Moore. Berry somehow, someway looks 25 years younger. I don't know how she and the makeup team did it, but she looks fantastic. Her scenes are fresh to boot. Moore, on the other hand, really plays up the craziness. She's deliciously vamp and I loved every minute she was on screen. Now, the bad: The Accents. Namely, Scally and Deep South. Two of the most annoying English language accents on the planet if you ask me. Thankfully, Egerton only employs the former for 20 minutes or so in the first half hour of the movie (complete with tracksuits, drugs, and his similarly dressed lads). The latter however goes on and on and on for the last hour. Thank God the most annoying employer of the accent, Channing Tatum, only uses it for 20 minutes or so. Still, the accents grated on this reviewer's nerves enough to ruin the movie (had there been no accents, it was only an average movie at best). See it for Moore and Berry's parts, but FFWD through the rest. You won't miss anything.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The original movie had much more scope as we saw Eggsy being trained up to be a spy. The first movie was an unexpected gem, but it had little expectation beforehand. The success of that movie means expectations were high for the second movie. Whilst it is never quite as engaging as the first movie there's still plenty of entertainment in the second movie. This sees a collaboration between the British Kingsman team up with the US Statesman. Rather than borrowing some of the plot lines from Bond it almost seems some of the plot has come from the real life spy organisations. The movie skips along at a great pace and it's certainly well worth a watch. The one gripe I did have was that there was too much Elton John. A quick cameo would have been great, but repeated scenes was a bit grating.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Which may be true but as a film, the Golden Circle is still a fun ride and worth a watch.The tone is slightly different and this film is longer and feels as such, but there are more characters so it makes sense.The action is still slick and stylish but the plot does somewhat drag a little and isn't that interesting.Though overall not completely disappointed by this film, was not expecting it to be as good as the original any way.As a rewatch 03/12/22' and having watched this sequel right after rewatching the first film, opinions have slightly changed.

It suffocates itself by being stupider, lazier, more ridiculous and can only help but pale in comparison to the original. Kingsman: The Secret Service was a breath of fresh air for the action genre. Its zaniness, humor, creativity and wildness made for one enjoyable time. Kingsman: The Golden Circle is too long, boring, predictable, CGI-infested, and ridiculous to even care for.The first Kingsman had a very infectiously perverse vibe that made the film more unpredictable and fresh. This one lost me as soon as they brought back Colin Firth in the most cartoonish and ludicrous way possible, making Kingsman go from unexpected fun to campy sci-fi stupidity. Nearly all the action scenes are too over-the-top, and cartoonish to enjoy. The film relies too heavily on CGI; everything seems so artificial and uninspired. The film goes for vulgarity instead of well timed clever jokes. The newcomers (Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, and Halle Berry) are wasted as they either drop exposition dumps on an already thinly written plot or fail to add any humor, charm, or character.If there is any good things to say it's that we got to see more of the good characters from the original, it had one or two funny lines, acceptable close-range fight choreography, and interesting commentary on drug use. All this, however, does not redeem the film for being a boring bloated mess.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This ""movie"" is anything but gold!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6382086/?ref_=tt_urv","TheHonestCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66610649/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2020","""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" (2017), for those who may not know, I loved the first movie. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2014) is, by my standards, a perfect film. So, you can imagine, I was very excited to see this sequel. But, much to my surprise, it sucked, and it sucked big time! This ""film"" has a convoluted and cliched storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a predictable generic soundtrack. At first glance, the basic plot line has great potential. The world gets held hostage by a drug cartel called The Golden Circle. This cartel unleashes a drug which causes a deadly infection. Now, that sounds like an exciting plot! Then, when I saw that the ""movie"" was written by the same screenwriters, I figured: ""yeah, the script is in good hands. This is going to be an awesome movie! Right?"" No, what was brought to the screen just felt like a dysfunctional storyline written by entirely different screenwriters. How is that possible? They had a decent concept and a great cast. How did they screw it up? Such wasted potential! I looked at the clock multiple times while viewing this ""movie"". That's a problem, because if you look at a clock, or your watch during a film, then something is wrong. I'm not kidding, I checked the clock at least ten times. The ""film"" is over ten minutes longer than the first one, but it feels such an eternity longer. This, honestly, is one of the dumbest films I've seen, in the worst possible way. There are ways to make good, over the top movies and this epitomizes how to do it the wrong way. As for the acting, it takes a nose dive into trash. Granted, there are a few actors that appeared to be trying. Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Taron Egerton and Pedro Pascal. They seemed to be the only ones who at least tried to put effort into their performances. It's just a shame that the poorly written screenplay and execution marred them from giving it their absolute best. The rest of the actors and actresses were just abysmal, especially Elton John! Yes, they somehow put Elton John in this diarrhea dump. To be fair, I do enjoy some of his music, but not all of it. He is criminally overrated in that category! Elton John does deserve credit as a musician and singer, but as an actor, absolutely not. His performance is so bad, that whenever he was on the screen, he just distracted from the plot, what little there was! Elton John, here's some advice from yours truly, stick to being a musician and singer. That's the lesser of your two evils! Finally, the soundtrack is just about as generic as you can get. It did have some good parts to it. But overall, it was just dull and unforgettable. The ironic thing is, this ""movie"" score was written by the same composers. How did they ruin it? The soundtrack was actually sounding amateur at some points! Now, let's get to the positives in this ""movie"". Yes, there are positives to be salvaged. The only two positives are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are perfect. Being a movie made in 2017, that's definitely no surprise! Great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for poor screenwriting and acting. ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" is a horrible movie, and it almost made my list of top 10 worst sequels. But, it didn't anger me quite enough to qualify. It had serious potential, but sadly, it just ended up being a total waste of film. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" and watch the first one instead. You'll be better off, trust me!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is here to rescue your tired brain with the assurance that while your mind slowly numbs itself to sleep watching it, it will watch over you and keep your brain safe from interesting plots, or characters, or novel action or anything that might tax your brain.Its ironic that the protagonist in the movie chides another character for being driven solely by desire to make more money than any soulful reason, since that is exactly what has driven the makers of this sequel.The opening action sequence of the movie is the only part of the movie that was good, and what one would expect in style and quality to connect this sequel to the original. The movie just went downhill from there and rapidly. There is a thin line between being roguishly charming and being rude. The first movie seemed to handle this reasonably well, this sequel does not.The movie does have a budget of 100M, so there is some value to the production and the hackneyed fight scenes, which is pretty much the only redeeming quality of the movie.In the first movie, the Kingsman were professional operatives. The Robin Hood legend of rewarding the poor yeomen and sticking it to the arrogant aristocrats made sense in the context of England. In the sequel, the Kingsman are like British football hooligans, they are patently arrogant, supercilious and insulting and beat up foreigners in foreign countries and seem to be drinking frequently for no apparently justifiable reason. If you are a Brit and this form of entertainment floats your boat, then have at it. For the rest, have your intelligence insulted by superior Englishman in awesome suits!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Together with Statesman, the two agents work together to save the world from a mysterious blue plague.Continuing on from the first film, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a little much better. It is not much different from the first one. Still with the same formula, namely the fighting style combined with slow motion movement with minimal take shots. Of course, the difference here lies in the quality of the action provided. The fight scene at the end of the movie is awesome. It may be a bit overwhelming when Whiskey has to fall in a meat grinder. This movie also has almost the same conflict as the previous movie. There is not much change in the whole. It was only on the need to cooperate with other agents that this film became a development.This film introduces another secret Kingsman organization universe, Statesman. The existence of Statesman in its American style is a refresher of this film. We can see the different ways the agents act. For the main enemy, Poppy here is not too much. This is also all the result of a conflict of problems that are not too big. Again, this second film is still carried lightly. It's not too much if this movie is indeed worth watching. The impression of comedy is also not lost as it has been from the first film. Elton John's whereabouts? Enough as a cameo.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film stars Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Halle Berry, Elton John, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal and Jeff Bridges.The headquarters of Kingsman is destroyed and world is rattled by a ruthless drug cartel, now the remaining kingsman has to take help from another elite secret service agency Statesman.This film can be called as one of the greatest squeal to watch if not perfect, this film beautifully picks up from where it was left in previously and will again take you to on a roller-coaster ride. The stunts are superb, the action choreography is mind blowing and VFX deserves a special applause. It also been observed that addition of new cast sometime makes the film pale and doesn't gives the new character the desired space but this is not the case with this film, the new additional cast makes this film much fore fun and entertaining to watch.Kingsman which can also be called as brutal version of James Bond now have to join hands with American elite agency Statesman to stop Poppy Adams a ruthless drug cartel played brilliantly by Julianne Moore. The best part of the film is that despite of huge star cast every star cast had got equal opportunity to showcase their talent and none of them disappoints and for me Halle Berry, Elton John, Pedro Pascal, Jeff Bridges and above all Julianne Moore was a great addition to the film and works as icing on the cake. The actors from previous films be it Taron Egerton, Mark Strong and the multi talented Colin Firth everyone was superb and played their part with utmost honesty.Screenplay of the film is fast paced and will never looses its grip from the viewers, action scenes and VFX as mention are terrifically mind-blowing and climax gives a superb closure to the film.A must watch action film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything about this action thriller wants to be cool, laid-back, and suave. But this hipster's remake of the 2015 highly profitable forerunner isn't. Bereft of humor and wit, the film is a non-stop assault on your senses and your patience.The stunts are still eye-popping, and Matthew Vaughn knows his way around directing an action flick. But the story makes little sense and never follows any logic...how else do you explain previously dead characters reanimated and sporting a license to kill and a great wardrobe. Just as before, the graphic violence upends the fun. Back with us is Eggsy (Taron Egerton), now renamed Gallahad, and an active member of the Kingsmen, a secret society of agents. He and his league of gentlemen must stop a drug lord curiously named Poppy (Julianne Moore) from destroying the inner sanctum and systemically infecting the world population with a virus. Soon Eggsy and his cohort Merlin (Mark Strong) are off to America to rally some Allied forces from Dixie. Halle Berry, Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges, and Pedro Pascal play these roles. Even Sir Elton John makes an appearance.All the relentless action cannot hide that old boys' club entitlement mentality and the misogynistic attitude that seemed to hearken back to the 60's era that are at work in the screenplay by Jane Goldman and the director which never rises above a leer. Granted the action sequences are well staged, very Guy Ritchie stylized movement, with its use of slo-mo and quick edited cuts to emphasize the kinetic effect, but the lull of a plot between the adrenaline rush of the fight scenes grows tedious and unintentionally laughable. The tone of the film jumps wildly from serious espionage thriller to spy spoof, as if the director cannot decide which genre he wants to do.The prestigious cast is less than serviceable. Academy Award winners like Ms. Berry and Mr. Bridges are totally wasted. Ms. Moore gives a truly awful performance (the first of which I never thought possible from this gifted performer). Mr. Tatum's role is basically a walk-on. Mr. Pascal does carry that Burt Reynolds 70's swagger well and Mr. Strong and Colin Firth reprise their roles with a touch of class and have a nice rapport with Mr. Egerton. And Elton John is an embarrassment, looking foolish and losing any shred of dignity. Why he would choose to participate in this goofy venture boggles the mind!But its the lazy storytelling, as the plot becomes more and more absurd, that dooms the movie. It resembles a poor man's version of a bad James Bond movie...the Roger Moore smirking variety, or more like those 60's trashy and sexist Matt Helm series starring Dean Martin, at their worse. The film constantly trades in class for crass. Kingsman: The Golden Circle keeps running in circles. It's fool's gold and nothing more.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The follow-up shows us a few new tricks but it's nearly impossible to top that infamous church scene. Previous newbie Kingsman Eggsy (played by Taron Ederton) is now an expert agent. He's still in grief over the loss of his boss and friend Harry (Colin Firth), who was killed in the original ""KIngsman"". Those of you who seen the trailers for ""The Golden Circle"" know that Firth is brought back. The method in which it's done is one of the many unexpected and cool parts of the film. As for the villain, Samuel L. Jackson did a great job playing a wise cracking can't look at blood, tech mogul, who threatens nearly everyone on the planet. His agenda was climate change. For this one Julianne Moore (Poppy) a miss-cast drug dealer wants to legalize drug use. She wipes-out each of the Kingsman facilities in and around London, killing all the agents in the process,except for Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong) all thanks to a mole. So they join forces with their American counterparts, the Statesman, who are based in Kentucky. Halle Berry, Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges play three of the members. ""Kingsman 2"" doubles down on the major characters and the action. While some of it works the main villain does not. Moore's Poppy is not a strong villain. Unlike Jackson's cool sidekick with the leg blades, she has weird mechanical dogs and apparently has a really gross appetite. She's hiding away in the middle of nowhere and even worse she doesn't even meet with the other cast till the end of the film. Tatum and Bridges only have a few scenes especially compared to Sir Elton John. The music superstar plays a ridiculously cartoonish version of himself in at least a half-dozen scenes. It's really hard to watch kind of pointless and really ruins the flow of the movie. Firth's return does help. Plus his bro-mance with Egerton and Strong gives some much needed emotional and calming feeling, they are really cool scenes. There are a few decent references to the original that help usher the series around granted the door is left ajar for a third outing. Returning director Matthew Vaughn brings back what made the first ""Kingsman"" such a hit, and why it quickly built a large and loyal following: graphic, comedic violence and over-stylized, comic book action. But like any good Bond film you need a really good villain and this one just didn't work.R for sequences of strong violence, drug content, language throughout and some sexual material This is a very hard R film the violence is more over the top here than the 1st theirs a couple scenes were 2 people are thrown into a meat grinder and one is turned into a sandwich and the language is just as bad not just with cursing but in regards to sexual references. The 1st trailer that was released featured a woman undressing showing lingerie; while there is no nudity during this scene it felt like I was watching a clip from an adult version of ""The Magic School Bus"" as the camera cascades down her belly and follows a tracker inside her. I highly recommend watching this through ClearPlay (LOGANAT THE MOVIES) REVIEW C","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything felt forced and the ifiotic stabs alluding to Trump and impeaching the president was in poor taste which completely took away from the movie. Let's not forget the character Poppy and the forced script poking at the failed war on drugs along with the movie ""president"" not caring about his people. The action scenes were not bad but the movie was all over the place like random butterflies.

The sequel to the surprise hit that showed off a distinct style and flavour which revitalised the spy genre in 2014 with its over the top fun. This time around the Kingsman have to team up with their American counterparts (The Statesman) to take down an underground drug ring, run by the seemingly innocent 1950s obsessed Poppy (Julianne Moore), who holds the world hostage.Kingsman: The Golden Circle seems to be a studio's head dream sequel it does everything the first does but just bigger... Sadly though this is another case where bigger doesn't translates to better. While doubling the violence, language and sex; The Golden Circle lacks in the sheer creativity of the original, and running in at 2 hours and 20 minutes this sometimes feels like a bloated version of the first Kingsman. With the additional action sequences, you begin to dislike the Kingsman's distinct style especially in the opening which isn't the greatest way to start off your movie- it becomes jarring and kinda giggly. Also there's sequences that drag on for way to long, The Golden Circle could have easily been edited down by 30 minutes by removing some of these scenes.The retuning cast members all do a good job with the material they've been given- especially Mark Strong- but nothing overly special. And, even though this is probably more of a coincidence than anything else, Julianne Moore's Poppy is oddly very similar to the 'villain' in this years ""The Emoji Movie"" (both evil intentions hidden behind a bright happy go lucky personality) - odd comparison but true. And none of The Statesman really stand out, if you liked what you saw of Channing Tatum in the trailer... Well that's all you're getting because he literally does nothing for the movie. Also there's Elton John, he's actually in the movie... More so than Channing Tatum. A lot of Elton John. Die hard Kingsman fans will probably still enjoy The Golden Circle, but those expecting more from this franchise will be disappointed. That being said everything that was in the first is in the sequel which is still good just minus that spark of originality and creativity which ignited back in 2014. I give Kingsman: The Golden Circle a C. Also afterwards John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" will be stuck in your head for days, which can either be a good or bad thing really.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Once again, before entering the conflict, the US had been selling arms (to multiple sides this time) - hey... 'It's all about the money.. money..' (i think that's how the song goes).But.. we should, by now, have gotten used Americas re-writing of History - I mean, didn't they manage to capture the 'Enigma Machine' - responsible for the saving of countless lives?

KINGSMAN 2 is a very long, every active visually, CGI spectacle that simply forgot to add a reasonable storyline to the huge cat of excellent actors searching for characters to portray. True, KINGSMAN is based on a comic book (Mark Millar, Dave Gibbons) and the initial film worked fairly well. This second installment written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn (who also directs) is slight on story, big on special effects, and seems to care more about explosions and robotic figures than a spy spoof.
The 'plot': A devastating attack leaves Kingsman with just two surviving agents, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). They must travel to the United States to find Statesman, a forgotten ally operating out of Kentucky with its own distinctly American way of doing things. New allies and old friends band together to face the global threat of Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) and the Golden Circle.In the midst of all this stars that attempt to make a difference in the experience include Edward Holcroft, Colin Firth, Michael Gambon, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Elton John (yes, really!), Jeff Bridges, Pedro Pascal, Bruce Greenwood, Emily Watson, Tom Benedict Knight - and more.For those diehard comic book fans this is a long evening of entertainment.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have quite that same punch the second time around. Unlike the first movie, which centers on Eggsy's growth from street punk to gentleman spy, there is no growth in The Golden Circle. We don't get to learn more about who the characters are, the spy world doesn't get expanded on, and there's no ramifications from the previous movie that gets resolved.But none of that matters as long as we have a lot of fun, am I right? Unfortunately, this movie can't do that either. While there are plenty of nifty gadgets and weapons, there's really nothing that we haven't seen in the last movie already, and the action scenes aren't nearly as technically impressive or memorable as the bar fight or church scene from the last movie.So is it a bad movie? Not at all. It's just boring and everything feels rehashed, and ultimately isn't really worth your time if you've already seen the first movie.Read my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/09/kingsman-golden-circle- 2017-same-thing.html","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not only are those well done action scenes disappointing rather than impressive if already expected. It is also sad to realize how very little is going on besides those. There's topics some may claim to deliver a message here, vague and cowardly ambiguous as it is. Thing is: Known topics like drug usage & legalization need to at least hint at depth to convince. The lukewarm appeal this boils down to remains utterly superficial though. The first Kingsman was a really good film. Now it wasn't outright brilliant but it had a stroke of genius here and there, scenes that may inspire and possibly change the uptake on the whole secret agent genre for some of us. It made us laugh, too! This one is nowhere near that. It's boastful meaninglessness goes nowhere, amplified emptiness does not fulfill. Perhaps it is supposed to be a funny uptake on American culture. Perhaps a humorous uptake on English class we saw in the first film is supposed to be replaced by a display of ""western-style ignorance and megalomania"". From where I stand it's neither funny nor insightful. They may have tried to recreate a working recipe and that's not a bad idea. Sadly they went about it woefully uninspired. The best one can say is that they may have attempted for something, but that in itself is not enough. Cooking up some of the old jokes won't do. The characters are as flat and rusty as are those jokes, the action is already known and the ""message"" unconvincing. The whole thing is sadly bland and pointless. There's barely enough to make a good trailer - as a film it's a decent attempt at best.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first Kingsman movie is one of my favorite action movies of all time and this was such a disappointment. There was pretty much nothing about this movie that I liked. The action was bad, the effects were some of the worst I've ever seen in a big budget movie like this, the acting was subpar, the movie looked like a Michael Bay Transformers movie, and aside from Elton John, the movie wasn't funny. Aside from Samuel L Jackson, the first Kingsman didn't really have any outstanding performances, but it made up for it by being funny, having great action, and not looking like Transformers 2. I need to mention the effects in this movie again. There are some scenes that I am genuinely surprised were approved. In one scene, a character is seen standing on top of a mountain ledge waving at other characters, but there is a blurry outline around him and you can clearly tell he was pasted in. In another example, there is a shot of a fleet of drones flying toward the Statue of Liberty, and some of the drones clip through the statue. If you liked the first Kingsman then stay away from this movie. If you've never seen a Kingsman movie before, then watch the first one, it's awesome. At the time of writing this I haven't seen The King's Man, so I don't know if it's worth watching or not.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

One thing that people miss about this movie is that boundaries are supposed to be pushed and things are thrown into this movie that are not meant to be taken completely seriously. With that being said, there are still some negatives to this sequel.First, the positives. One is the style and energy of a movie like this which isn't lost in this. The second, in my opinion, is the acting of the majority of the actors in this. Third, I quite enjoy the insane lengths that these movies seem to go to shock the audience or perhaps squeeze out a laugh. The negatives of this movie are quite noticeable in this movie too. The biggest problem in my opinion is Julianne Moore's character. This problem shouldn't be too difficult to fix. In The Secret Service, Samuel L. Jackson played perhaps one of the most outrageous villains I have seen in a while with his lisp and phobia towards violence, which added so much humour to his character. When it comes to Julianne Moore's character (Julianna Moore wasn't too bad), there was no outrageous thing that added that humour and each time she was on the screen it almost got to a stage of boredom, which is not good for this movie. Another downside I found was the amazing action style that Matthew Vaughn has brought to these movies. While it is entertaining to watch, the opening action scene there was too many shots and there was too much to take in so the audience tends to fall behind and fall out of the movie. Also there was some actions scenes that came across a bit stereotypical and lacked that inventiveness like the bar scene did in the first movie.This is by no means a bad movie, it is just frustrating to see that the problems with this movie were completely preventable and just needed that extra creativity added to certain characters and scenes.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Interestingly, it's also in the same order that I'd rank them quality-wise.In many ways, ""Kingsman: The Gold Circle"" is like taking the first film and combining it with either an Austin Powers or Matt Helm film. In other words, the film seems like a parody of the other two Kingsman movies....filled with action and characters that are WAY over the top...too much for my taste. Ridiculous fight scenes (even for the franchise), silly American agents which are inexplicably like cowboys (cowboys in Kentucky???) and a lair ('Poppy's Place') that is pure nostalgic kitsch...in the middle of some jungle! It really makes no sense but if you turn your brain off and just accept it for what it is, it's not a bad film. But if you are expecting anything like the first and third films (like I was), then it's a big disappointment...because it's so silly.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie could have been so much better if they had left out the politics and America bashing. The first movie was okay and if they had built on that it would have been good. This one, they make an American Presidency look worse than Stalin or Hitler and no American President before or now has even scratched that surface. Additionally, it made other Americans look bad.As such, writing was very bad despite the decent acting and a decent cast. I will never own this film and very glad I didn't go see this on in the theater (I would have walked out and asked for my money back) and I didn't even spend a dollar to rent this flop.Stay away!

The problem is it expands on the overblown action of the first Kingsman but doesn't feature the same charm and entertaining snark of the first film. It is only, after all, a sequel: i.e. not as good as the first with repeated themes and plot lines. The action scenes, however, are still spectacular. This time out, the plot has so many lasso holes that it's a distraction. Even in fantasy and spy films you need to have some internal logic. The logic here doesn't work. They make up too many fantastic explanations for the action that it doesn't make sense and I started to wonder why they bothered with the plot at all. Again, and I repeat myself, the rush to make a sequel led to a script that was ill-conceived and shoddy. The parts that return aren't as good. Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is now jaded and arrogant. He lost the charm and naiveté that made the first Kingsman so endearing. The subplots are ridiculous and cringe worthy. I am not a prude, but the way they handle the planting of a bug was stupid and adolescent. If I wanted stupid and adolescent, I would watch The Hangover. And by the way, there is mucous in the mouth. Jeff Bridges' part was terrible and underwritten. Tatum Channing is...Tatum Channing, a hot piece of flesh but not a credible spy. Halle Barry plays a spy who can't get a promotion and is under-utilized, kind of like an underutilized Oscar winning actress. Colin Firth's Harry is written so the actor can sleep walk like an amnesiac through the film. Mark Strong retains his dignity as Merlin, and his small part might be why. The real winner is Pedro Pascal, who plays the Statesmen's agent Whiskey. His screen presence is reminiscent of a younger Burt Reynolds. You know, when Reynolds was charming and on top. The Elton John cameo is worth a view. It will play on Youtube within the year, I suspect. Look for it there.And the romance? If I wanted an insipid romance, I would watch ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason."" Okay, it wasn't that bad, but it was unnecessary filler and cringe worthy. What they could have done is give us more backstory with Poppy and the amusing Julianne Moore. Moreover, Poppy's set piece is hilarious and amazing. Too bad they didn't use some of that money for a script rewrite. Rating: Rental The film has a few amusing parts and the fight scenes are worth watching on Netflix, if you have time. Peace, Tex Shelters","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

What fans of the original Kingsman film, will find most distasteful is how the film has lost most of the small scale, quick witted fun that the first had, through it's numerous amount of exotic location changes and big budget CGI scenes. Unfortunately it has an underlying problem between the link of the first and second film, which is the change to a large budget franchise. It feels like a film that is gearing up for sequel after sequel, laying the foundations for more and more films, which inevitably lost my interest. It's also not helped by some poor acting performances, tiresome celebrity cameos and some low-level dialogue, which I believe to be down to the budget once again. However, the film does have its positives. First and foremost, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and even though that sounds like a negative it actually isn't. There is a sense of fun and excitement that stems through the well filmed action scenes. This point is very much lost in many modern day action films and shows a sense of originality. Cliché as it is, the film franchise offers a fun alternative to the Bond Films, rather than having to sit through a terrible Jason Statham action film.Is the film very good? No. The film is very average from start to finish containing some shoddy acting and CGI filled mayhem, but does however have elements of the first films quick witted fun. A film to switch the brain off to, but nothing more.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I watch Fox News yes but I also watch BBC, MSNBC, come on, if you are making a movie, try not to just show the world you are that secluded and try to give people a bigger picture. The world is bigger than anyone of us can imagine and just tuning in Fox News is not getting you anywhere. I like a lot of casts in this franchise but the movie simply is a repeat of what it was in the first and the moral behind the story far weaker than the previous one. If you are looking for a better way to kill your 2 hours, I highly suggest other things----pick up a book e.g. ""The 7 habits of highly effective people"" will be better than watching this.

proper order. This certainly is not a stand alone film by any means.Our hero protagonist of the first film Taron Edgerton is on a date with a princess
no less than Kingsman headquarters is hit and almost completely wiped out. The
perpetrator of this evil deed is Julianne Moore who is the main reason to see this
film. She is having the greatest time in her life playing the psychotic villain who
has control of the world wide narcotics trade. Right now she's blackmailing the world having developed a chemical concoction that makes drug users get
sick and die in stages. She's even blackmailing the president of the USA who
is a Trump like lizard of a human being.No worry Edgerton has gone to America where there is a sister organization and he and Colin Firth who has lost his memory, but who regains it after some
shock treatment. Jeff Bridges runs the show and Channing Tatum is one of his
top guys. He swings a lariat like Will Rogers and a bullwhip like Lash LaRue.Watching The Golden Circle is a real blast. Nice special effects, a plot not to take seriously and Julianne Moore who among other things has kidnapped 
Elton John for her own amusement. Is there no end to her evil?","0 out of 12 found this helpful.

But there was also a well maintained mystique, a style if you will.This second movie keeps the bare minimum of the style and decisively ups the exagerations and the weaker, less palatable elements. There is a very confused, often self-sabotaging moral perspective at work here - not something that a movie about a self-righteous elite group can afford to have.And the vulgarity. Oh, the vulgarity. It has pretty much taken over.This is a movie with no soul, attempting to build one over the ghost of the previous one, which is mentioned far too often for this to even attempt to be its own thing, despite dramatic yet somehow also half-hearted attempts to upset and redefine the status quo.While technically there are many new elements and revelations, they are all utterly derivative and can't compensate for the loss of self-respect.

It tried to be a fun, mindless action romp but it had problems pulling that off with any sort of esteem. The direction lacks any sort of vision or character, and the writing is hardly believable or inviting. The characters we fell in love with from the first one because of their wit, intelligence or combat prowess are underused in this iteration of the story and replaced with boisterous, unlikable ""Statesmen"" and while their specific individual sets of skills and practice might be one of the only redeeming qualities this film has to offer, we see very little of these fascinating characteristics explored and rather than give us would we as an audience would like to see much of the film's action takes place in silly, tongue in cheek sequences that don't take itself seriously in places that would have served the plot nicely with some depth or nuance.While as of early 2018 when this is review is being written not much as been said about the possibility of a third Kingsman film being made, but hopefully if they decide in favor of a complete trilogy the next one will learn from the missteps in this installment and return to what made the first one so electric, gripping and fun.

Not sure if the script writers were trying to make a sequel closer to Austin Powers than James Bond, but they failed painfully in both genres. The action scenes were so over the top and ridiculous. 
Joining the original cast are even more star power costars, Channng Tatum, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges. Tatum is more of a cameo appearance and Julianne Moore's character is a lame female version of Dr. Evil. It's painful to see her act in this role that's so beneath her acting talent. However it's still not as painfully lame than all of Sir Elton John's scenes in this turd fest, especially his musical fight finale.
 If it wasn't for the two original Kingsmen, Colin Firth and Taron Egerton, I wouldn't have given this poppy-cock sequel even the 5 out of 10 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As a CGI-driven spy-spoof comedy, the film is a misfire. Novelty and some interesting characters made the first Kingsmen film fairly entertaining, but I quickly tired of this iteration's foul-mouthed silliness. The new story focuses on Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) (who I didn't find to be particularly interesting in the first film) and Merlin (Mark Strong, who is OK) and their nemesis, Poppy Adams (a ludicrously over-the-top character hammed up by Julianne Moore). The story is pretty silly and the stunts, gunplay, fights, and chases defy even the most forgiving cartoon physics. As action comedies go, I didn't find the script particularly funny and the broader 'shock-humour' profanity and sight-gags began to wear thin early on in the 140 minute movie (although I did like Elton John's extended cameo).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Re-hashing plot points and the best parts of the first movie2. Taking the ""bigger and better"" approach with the addition an over-abundance of special effects3. Adding in new characters you don't care about and in worse cases omitting major characters to the detriment to the sequelThe first smash-hit was a good movie because it was essentially an R-rated coked-up riff of those Roger Moore-era James Bond flicks that still boasted a solid story. It was an R-rated ultra-violent Spy Kids!!So going into this follow-up, I thought there was a good chance this sequel would at least match the quality of the first movie given this is the first sequel that Matthew Vaughn has directed (Kick-Ass 2 was directed by Jeff Wadlow and X-men: Days of Future Past was Bryan Singer).Obviously the action never reaches the heights of the Free Bird-soundtracked church sequence from the first (oh boy do they try), but there are a few highlights. The movie opens with a great car chase with Eggsy (Egerton) fighting a Winter Solider-ized Charlie Hesketh (the explanation for how he survived the first movie admittedly makes no sense) soundtracked to Let's Go Crazy by Prince that really starts the movie off with bang!There are also plenty of damn funny moments too, including one involving a GPS tracker that literally had everybody in the audience rolling on the floor.Even though this sequel is far from devoid of entertainment value, it still disappointingly suffers from all three of the ""sequelitis"" issues that I've highlighted above and it is all rooted in the script, which essentially boils down to a re-tread of the first movie with much more fat.Oh boy does this movie have WAY too much fat with it's excessive number of characters and severe pacing issues. For some reason the filmmakers thought it was a good idea to place even more focus on Eggsy, which perplexes the heck out of me because Eggsy has always been the most boring character in this series.Too much of this movie is taken up by his ""relationship-drama"" with his Swedish princess girlfriend (aka. Eggsy butt victory present at the end of the first one) that is played perplexingly straight and only serves to grind the whole affair to a halt. I also love how Eggsy is supposed to have matured since the first movie yet is still somehow dumb enough to leave the door to the secret spy room in his apartment place COMPLETELY UNLOCKED!!!!The dialogue scenes between Galahad and Merlin (Strong) are one of the few times where the movie sincerely succeeds in injecting an emotional core. Probably the most effecting moment in the whole film comes at the end with Mark Strong (if you have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about). It's ironic that for a movie with so much special effects and action, the best scene is a simple one that climaxes with one tiny explosion.The movie in general spends way too much time with superfluous uninteresting elements (Ex. Eggsy girlfriend, a gratuitous running gag with Elton John that over-stays it's welcome) and not enough on the actual interesting elements (Ex. the touching dynamic between Eggsy and Galahad, the satire on drug use that should have been more of the main focus).Even the Statesman, which were a centerpiece in the film's marketing, end up being completely superfluous to the plot. Channing Tatum fans will be severely disappointed because he only has a total of 10 minutes of total screen time before being unceremoniously removed from the plot. Even Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges are barely in the movie and thus do not make much of an impression.The only Statesman to receive any significant screen-time is Pedro Pascal, who plays Jack Daniels (aka. the one with the whip). Now I really like Pascal, especially on Narcos, and he does a good job with the role and has a good chemistry with main trio of Kingsman. But as with the case with most things with this movie, Jack Daniels doesn't really add much to the narrative and mostly exists to squeeze in more action sequences (his last fight scene is a classic case of padding out). He does have an intriguing character reveal but it's frustratingly tacked unto the eleventh hour of the story!!This is a movie in which the filmmakers seemed to have been very much thinking in set- pieces, which isn't always a bad thing (Ex. John Wick, Mad Max: Fury Road) but if that is the route you are gonna take with your action movie.then PLEASE keep the pacing brisk and invention constant!! It is never a good sign when action sequences start coming off as a boring nuisances than thrilling and the nearly two and a-half hour runtime does not help matters.Probably the biggest weakness of this movie is surprisingly it's main villain. Despite a solid introduction (you will not look at a hamburger the same way again), the 50's obsessed drug lord Poppy Adams (Moore) comes off as more of an annoyance to our heroes than an actual threat. She lacks that seamless balance of odd humor and sincere menace that Samuel L. Jackson brought in the first one.Moore's overly ernest dialogue delivery and just the fact that most of the jokes written for her are lame contribute to her character getting annoying and old VERY fast. Moore is a very good actress but her performance was simply terrible!!So at the end of the day, K:TGC ended up just being another average sequel. If you loved that first movie then I can only recommend it as a rental but otherwise, stick with the original.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And these days, it seems every successful blockbuster movie must have an entire money-making series to back it up.The Golden Circle, I'm afraid, just wasn't a strong start.The movie played up almost every standard sequel cliche: Overselling the comedic aspect of the series, pointless and poorly written-in celebrity cameos, week villains with week motives, and even using poor excuses to bring back characters that were killed off in the first film.Instead of being the next installment of an exciting new franchise, the film is really just a forgettable sequel that no one outside of the Taron Egerton fan club will watch more than once.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Taron Egerton is back as Eggsy, the once upon a time street hood turned English gentleman by his mentor Harry (Colin Firth). The secret spy organization, that uses a tailor shop called Kingsman as it's cover, suffers a catastrophic loss when they are hacked by a drug cartel and all of their agents are killed, except for Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong). The two agents search for clues to rebuild their organization when they discover they have an allied organization in the states called Statesman. The fraternal group of spies are in Kentucky and they operate as a whiskey distillery. Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry join the movie at that point for the most entertaining scenes of the film. The Statesman team up with the Kingsman to find out who's behind the evil plot that killed all of their fellow agents in England. It leads them to a drug lord who is the head of The Golden Circle. The Golden Circle is a drug cartel led by a cruel and evil crime boss named Poppy, played by Julianne Moore. She brands all of her agents with a circle of hot molten gold. She's forced to hide out in the jungle, but she's created her own little fantasy town that looks like a movie set from the 1950's; complete with a dinner, a bowling alley and a movie house. In the funniest parts of the movie she kidnaps Elton John to perform for her on demand. Elton is hilarious as a ""diva"" who's held captive and forced to perform against his will. Although her product is illegal drugs, Poppy wants to be recognized as one of the top companies in the world. So she devises a plan to taint all of her drug supply with a virus that causes severe symptoms and eventually death. She wants drugs legalized and immunity from all of her previous illegal acts in exchange for an antidote which can save everyone infected. Publicly the president of the United States agrees, but he has plans to stall the distribution of her antidote until all of the drug users die from the tainted drugs. A hardliner on drugs, he sees that as a way of winning the war on drugs and any future demand for drugs. The problem is it's not just ""junkies"" who are effected by the tainted drugs. Casual drug users, like one of the president's assistants and Eggsy girlfriend, who just happens to be a Swedish princess, are also infected. As a side note, the movie is from Fox Films which uses it's Fox News Channel to report on the crisis. Ironically, no one at The Fox News Network gets infected with the tainted drugs because, of course, none of the Fox Anchors would use drugs.The action in the movie is better than the humor, which is a one note song that replays over and over again. The ""spy gadgets"" are cool and there is also some key product placement of a few items that will be available for purchase online.The move it rated ""R"" for violence and some harsh language and it runs 2 hours and 21 minutes long. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" The Golden Circle rates a LARGE.Hollywood Hernandez","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure it could have had been better but so could the first one and almost every movie I've ever seen. I will have to watch the first one again but for now I would rate this one better than the first and hope they make another. Everyone's always complaining about remakes and how no new movie ideas are coming out but seem to look for reasons to hate a movie rather than like it. Most the reviewers seemed to like the first movie but hate this one which is basically the same exact formula but of course as in any movie series once you know that formula it's very hard to make it as refreshing the second time. I think they did the first movie justice and was a great tie in to further the plot of the first movie. Perhaps we can expect something involving Scotland next time if they make another movie and don't pay attention to all the whiners who never seem to be satisfied and are always looking at the grass on the other side of the fence.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story could be better, the action scenes are saved by Elton John as shield of Harry and the presence of Julianne Moore is a delight but her role is a real straitjacket. Yes, it is a nice film. But the lesson about drugs is so ambiguous than it becomes less than a pretext. And if the first part has the virtue to be surprising and fresh, the second one is especially made for a specific target of genre. Almost naive, it has, maybe , as basic good point to use Elton John as ingredient of a naive salad.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
