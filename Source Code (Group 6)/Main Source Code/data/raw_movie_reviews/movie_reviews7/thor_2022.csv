"6","/10","Enjoyable but empty","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310329/?ref_=tt_urv","masonsaul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94560739/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2022","Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.","1,846 out of 2,261 found this helpful.

Sadly in MCU Thor was only once really Thor and it was in Avengers: Infinity War, where we finally feel that he is the protector of Midgard and the God of thunder as in mythology. I'm not saying that Taika Waititi is a bad director, but the fact is he wrote and directed this empty movie with some jokes. He could maybe make a great Deadpool movie but Thor should have been more than this. Even Christian Bale's outstanding performance as Gorr couldn't save it. The real Thor fans aren't going to enjoy this movie.","162 out of 223 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Marvel is Losing its Mojo -But Still Has Moments of Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8317856/?ref_=tt_urv","frommeltstephanie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123874777/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2022","While not the worst Marvel film, it is certainly not worthy of high praise. Ragnarok was a masterpiece but Taika falls incredibly short of expectations for a bar that was set high in the beginning phases of the MCU. I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it, and that is a trend with some of their recent offerings. I'm on the fence about a rating of 7, but my favorite MCU movies are in the 8-10 range.Characters:
Thor has been reduced to a joke and doesn't have the appeal he once had. Why does he look like a carnie ala Joe Dirt? Why is he so weak, dumb and needy?Valkayrie's character has been reduced to a lesser version of her former self and her rule of New Asgard was pitiful and lacked inspiration. Tessa's talent was totally wasted.Christian Bale's performance, while exceptional was a bit too Voldemort-esque.The appearance of the Guardians was lame -who would look up to Starlord? Chris Pratt came across as a white trash version of the character first introduced and has completely lost his likability. Rocket is the best character in the Guardians and he barely had any lines.The first battle was against hawklike chicken muppets riding Star Wars knockoff vehicles and they just weren't formidable in the least.The cameos were fun (Hella) and the goats were annoying when they didn't have to be.Music:
The use of music was ill-timed and not matched to the action -no offense to GNR, but why so much of their music? November Rain was the only song that seemed to be paired well with the action. There are so many 80's rock and metal songs that would have made a better fit .Plot:
Boring and drawn-out. Pay no attention to the commenters whining about ""wokeness"" and this has nothing to do with anything other than their own prejudice and intolerance. The humor was dumb, childish and just not that funny or witty, unless maybe you are a 8 year old boy raised by immature parents.I'm a huge Marvel fan but I have been so disappointed in recent offerings that are a result of Disney greed, poor writing and lazy directing.","30 out of 38 found this helpful.

I would assume the vast majority of fans would rank this film better than Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness but worse than Spider-Man No Way home. It does not live up to the standard of the last Thor movie but sides as one of the better MCU films. Waititi 's iconic humor does not disappoint in this film and is filled with top notch action scenes; Bale's depiction of Gorr the god butcher is impeccable; However the film fails to move the MCU's broader narrative forward and leaves fan asking did this film have any impact on anything and anyone.","60 out of 90 found this helpful.

However it falls apart a bit towards the end as the ending was quite rushed, making the film feel like 10 minutes too short. Also No Way Home's multiverse exploration has skyrocketed everyone's expectations and we kinda want to see something about the multiverse in every Marvel movie now and when that doesn't happen its a bit disappointing. Apart from that this movie is good fun!","59 out of 91 found this helpful.

Marvel fan I'm shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be ""politically correct"" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.","466 out of 803 found this helpful.

Without going into specifics, the ending also nullified his emotional motivation that ""All gods must die.""However, the film makes up for some of these weaker points with imaginative use of powers, props and locations. But you aren't allowed a moment to digest the more serous moments, and end up leaving the cinema feeling a bit confused and uncertain as to whether you enjoyed what you just watched. Hence the division of opinion of those who watched the film, but didn't take more time to digest what they saw.So when you do see it, give yourself a few hours to let it soak in, then decide if you feel it was worthy of your time & money.","73 out of 116 found this helpful.

There is a lot that needs to be set up and unfortunately Thor: Love and Thunder has to do it's part in setting up that greater story.All in all, it's an entertaining, well executed, movie that I walked out of in a good mood.

But then he does make pretty good MCU movies, so maybe it would be a shame to miss out on those. 'Thor: Love and Thunder' wasn't quite as good as 'Thor: Ragnarok' for me, but it was still a decent watch.The film is once again very light-hearted. It is certainly going for laughs more than anything else. Consequently the tone is very safe and no one ever feels like they are in much genuine danger. Which is a shame because Christian Bale plays a particularly menacing (at least visually) villain.There are some fun cameos along the way as usual. The film is pretty well paced too. It doesn't really have a period which I would say dragged. If you enjoyed 'Ragnarok' then you are almost certainly going to have a good time with this one. 7/10.","451 out of 840 found this helpful.

This just became a movie about a superhero who finally snapped and decided to act as a complete idiot from now on... What a great way to destroy years of character development.The writing is just lazy and the director made an excellent work of transforming it into a parody movie of itself. Actually, that was my father's first questions after watching the first 10 minutes of this movie, ""Is that a Thor parody?""Cristian Bale is great, as always, and I am saddened that he had to stain his filmography with this movie.I could go on and on about all the things wrong with this movie but I have already wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and don't want to waste any more time on it.

When every single line is played over-the-top, they all lose their impact. Subtlety would have gone a long way with him.The other thing about the comedic beats -- most of which completely fall flat -- is not due to the actors' delivery but the directorial choices of how the scenes are shot.Even the Guardians of the Galaxy, who can usually be counted on for solid humor, came across poorly in this.A better edit might have made this more enjoyable, but not by much.

But it's like they couldn't decide which direction to go with the story, so they went everywhere with it. Literally EVERYWHERE.On one hand we have a sad but also beautiful new happening/story surrounding Jane, which really got to me, and I wished they'd kept that realness and sense of honest reality throughout the movie. They didn't..The action scenes are cool and some intense, and the overall cinematic scenery is stunning, like we're use to receive from Marvel. And some scenes are really funny. But here's the problem, cause on the other hand they're trying too got damn hard to be exactly that: funny.It's like they've said: ""what can we joke about next?"" instead of focusing on the story. Instead of taking the heartfelt story they have, and made that the roots of this movie, they joke everything away. Jokes are meant to just spice things up a bit, put a little zing on it, not take over the whole show. This makes the story weak, and most of the story they're trying to deliver in this movie is lost. So why a score of 7?Cause the story between the jokes and orgie-humor, is that good.","50 out of 82 found this helpful.

The stellar background music and stunning visuals add to that aesthetic and promote the overall 80s cosmic adventure vibes that Taika seems to be going for.It's safe to assume that if you enjoyed Thor Ragnarok and how Taika reimagined the Thor character, you'll mostly enjoy this film too.The essence of Thor and his emotional struggles over the many adventures was captured well and developed throughout the film.But Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor is the soul of the movie and her action sequences with Mjolnir were amazing. Her transition from Dr Jane Foster into the Mighty Thor, grappling with her powers and debating what punch lines to use, brings freshness and adds more color to the Thor character.Finally, coming to Bale's Gorr...I was a bit disappointed at the sparing use of Gorr but I think it added to the mystery and overall aesthetic of his character. But Christian Bale does steal every scene that he's in and portrays a hard-hitting and emotionally wrought Gorr.In terms of weaknesses, I think the movie does feel a bit rushed with its comedy and doesn't always allow it's deeper emotional scenes to settle in. The runtime could have been a bit longer as there is some interesting world building sequences that don't last for long. The storyline doesn't throw many curveballs as the viewer and that isn't necessarily a con but the over eager-MCU fan expecting multiple cameos or lots of fan service may not be thoroughly satiated.","21 out of 31 found this helpful.

As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)","645 out of 910 found this helpful.

The story is more than interesting. Once again, Waititi points us in a certain direction, and just when you think you know what's going to happen, he turns our heads. If you liked ""Ragnarok"" you'll like this one too, if not...well probably this movie will not be your cup of tea.At this point, everyone knows that Hemsworth was born for the role of Thor, but in this movie, he elevates his character to a completely different level...you'll see.Natalie Portman returns as Jane, but unlike previous films in which she was not a particularly interesting character, Taika has applied her magic and, in addition to embodying her in Mighty Thor, makes her a well-built character. Her return to the franchise is important for Thor's graduation, but it also tells us a story you can't watch indifferently. She's also funny, something we can't say about her previous incarnations in the role.All other supporting characters such as Valkyrie, Korg and Guardians also add a pinch or more of themselves to the final product. The chemistry between Thor and the Guardians is ridiculous, something we already saw in ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"". The chemistry between Valkyrie and Mighty Thor is something I can watch all day. Korg has a bigger role than and every scene is pure pleasure - that's what happens when you make enough pamphlets for a revolution!Christian Bale...frankly it's still surreal that he's part of the MCU, but his role as Gorr The Godbutcher is quite the reason for an actor of his caliber to perform it. Gorr is brutal, some of his scenes will remain etched in my mind for a long time, but not his radical actions are the only thing that makes his character memorable. You know that once the villain of the movie makes you sympathize with him and understand him, he is more than ""another villain"".One of the best action scenes in the entire Marvel universe is in ""Love And Thunder""! I can't wait to watch the movie again! The film feels like a collection of several comic book editions of Thor, adapted in the form of a film, flooded with a solid dose of style and music from the 80's.""Thor: Love And Thunder"" is all that was expected and more. Taika doesn't do more of the same, but pushes the boundaries even more, giving you a solid dose of laughter, action and emotions that you may not be ready for! The film has many pleasant surprises for fans and the love for the details is visible. The film surpasses all expectations balancing absolutely bombastic insanity with moving character driven stories. Christian Bale is top tier and Natalie Portman is truly outstanding. Waititi may have just delivered the MCU's best movie of Phase 4 and certainly one of the top 10 in the entire Marvel universe.You know this, but still stay for the credit scenes, which are extremely important for future events at MCU!","145 out of 274 found this helpful.

My rating comes from a place of love towards Thor movies.But I have to address the elephant in the room which is it's jokes. Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of very good jokes I genuinely laughed out loud, but the movie was so focused on delivering jokes non-stop that it became a parody of itself.This movie is the definition of sometimes less is more.Almost every moment that had some sort of heart to it is completely buried under a pile of jokes that made these moment completely irrelevant.Taika found a great balance of story and humor with Ragnarok. I mean, almost everyone praised how the humor he injected into the Thor, brought it to a whole new level. Easily on of the best movies of the Infinity Saga movies.So I'm a bit confused as to why they decided to go so overboard with the jokes, that it killed almost every character moment.Christian Bale's Gorr was highly anticipated, as we all know the acting chops he can bring to any project. And he did bring everything one would expect from any character he plays.Thing is ... he's the only one who tried to bring any amount of seriousness to the movie, and was severely underutilized. He was creepy and intimidating. His character had the right motivation for what he was doing. He had everything a good villain needs. I'm not exaggerating when I say that in the almost 2 hour runtime of the movie he was present about 25-30 minutes in total, most of which was in the climax of the movie.So if the main villain of the movie takes a back seat what was this all about? Well, in short it was romantic comedy between Thor and Jane. Emphasis on the comedy part, since the romance was severely overshadowed by constant need to inject comedy into every single scene.There was even a genuine moment for 2 gay characters, that was very well written, and would have worked so well as character development moments, if it wasn't squeezed in-between a major story beat and a returning joke, that overstayed it's welcome, since it was done for around the 6th time at this point.So my biggest gripe with the movie as whole is that it can't be taken serious at any level, as the movie handles itself as parody within the confines and logic of its own universe.","56 out of 99 found this helpful.

It's essentially the MCU's first romantic comedy, and plays with those tropes in delightful ways. But while Thor and Jane's relationship is handled well, Love and Thunder is less deft -- and a lot safer than you'd expect -- in pushing the greater MCU story forward. Christian Bale's Gorr feels underutilized and Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie takes a frustrating back seat, especially as the movie goes on. Taika Waititi's signature humor and visual style persist from Ragnarok, and are essential to buoying the movie through its cookie-cutter plot. With Hemsworth as enthusiastic an Asgardian as ever, Thor's future with both love and thunder are bright.","38 out of 67 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A few comedic Waititisms didn't stop me from enjoying this more than its predecessors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8309298/?ref_=tt_urv","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6860945/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2022","Let me preface this by saying that I don't really love any of the other Thor movies. Ragnarok was actually a massive misstep for me. The slapstick comedy made me eyeroll almost every time out, not at all fitting any progressive tone from the previous Thor or Avengers movies before it. After loving Jojo Rabbit, I thought that every Taika Waititi product that I didn't enjoy was some exception to his excellence, but I shortly discovered that that was the only film I did care to love from him. I started to give up hope, especially after hearing Love and Thunder only adds to the silliness that Ragnarok had.I'm here to say that the comedy this time around wasn't as maddening for me. Some of it was legitimately funny or at least served a courteous chuckle; it never interfered with the action, the villain, or serious moments; and I think the majority of jokes that fell flat passed by so quickly that I wouldn't even realize it was an attempt at humor unless somebody said it was supposed to be funny (which is never good, but it's better if it goes without a hitch). The Zeus scene was admittedly worst than the Ragnarok levels of 'bad' and really brought the movie down during the time, but thankfully that was the only time that I really felt the brunt end of failed comedy. There were two other running gags during the film -- one involving certain animals which I laughed at the more they appeared, and the other involving weapons which really didn't work except the first time it happened. They even repeat a bit from Ragnarok that I thought worked more this time around simply because it took place on Earth instead of Asgard. Upon re-reading my own paragraph I feel like I may be giving this movie more credit in its humor than I feel it's owed, but I feel this is all relative when I say: ""At least it's not as bad as expected or as previously established."" I can't see how somebody who loved Ragnarok is only now going to be upset at the knockabout that this movie at times can be.Love and Thunder introduces Jane as Mighty Thor, and although it was great to see Natalie Portman return, the dichotomy between her two selves with no in-between was very jarring. I guess in a two-hour runtime you have to accept these little nuances to be skipped time to time and she isn't the only character to undergo an immediate change like this, but if you're coming off the Phase One MCU character of Jane who you remember you would never believe she would evolve this persona. I guess that's what happens when your character lives on as you take a hiatus from the universe as an actress, though. Regardless, this story is very Jane-centric and I think it is something that Ragnarok was dearly missing. She helps complete Thor, or at least for a life that Thor pines for. There is a backstory montage showing a relationship between Thor and Jane (almost in an ""never before seen footage"" kind of way) that displayed more chemistry between them than either Thor or The Dark World bothered to give off. Like I said, very heartfelt.This actually is a good transition to Gorr, because his origins are also derived from the love of another as well. This movie does that thing that the show House M. D. did (where a patient with a certain quirk delivered thematically for the doctors in the episode), so what was happening with Thor was also happening with Gorr regarding their attachment to the loved ones in their lives. It doesn't play like this for the whole movie, but it is still a present theme. Christian Bale is really good, but I'm not sure if he has enough moments to show this. He both frontends and bookends the film very strongly and shows up here and there with shadowy minions, and he is absolutely a dominant presence every time he is on screen, but I definitely could have had more of him. He is never served as cannon fodder for Waititi's comedy, so his scenes are always serious and impactful. His monologues are very captivating and will get a lot of clicks on YouTube, and the action set pieces with him are very diverse and engaging.I'll restate that Thor never really was my favorite, and unfortunately it could be because he isn't Earthbound. Any time this character is off of our planet, losing that grounded aspect really takes away from it all for me. Never before had I imagined after seeing the first Iron Man film that we would get to a point where we'd have rainbow bridges and rock-bodied aliens, and that can be detracting for me. That said, the Earth scenes here once again grabbed me most (as well as the scenes with the colorless portrayal, you'll know when you get to it) and the off-world stuff did not (especially once again the Zeus scene). When Asgard was destroyed in Ragnarok I thought that was the best thing that could happen to this franchise if it meant more Earth scenes. There are some scenes away from Earth with nice grounded conversation, and these are the moments that almost reminded me of what Jojo Rabbit did so well. Valkyrie was also normalized a lot in this movie and I dug her every time she was on screen because of it.Despite some of the cringe that was afoot, I had a good time with this sequel. Given that I do not relatively enjoy the Thor films as much as many of the other MCU films, I can easily put this above the other three myself. It was a visual delight, the music was well done, the actors all gave good performances, and characters had solid arcs to play out. Furthermore, I like that it was two hours and they didn't needlessly add in other characters which didn't fit this story, even if they were a part of previous Thor films. I won't say this movie completely fuses the humor to my liking for this character, but the movie itself is the best/most entertaining of Thor that I have seen so I suppose I am accepting of it.","74 out of 146 found this helpful.

Christian Bale's performance as Gorr is excellent, is he the best MCU villain I would say no, but adds something very different and interesting.Chris Hemsworth clearly is having fun playing Thor now, you can see in the performance, the gritty Thor is long gone and film is a family friendly enjoyable feast.Just to add, this outside the Guardians of the Galaxy is easily the best MCU soundtrack, what a joy to behold it was throughout the film.Lastly my only real issue with the film is that as great as it was to see the Guardians of Galaxy again , the dialogue felt inconsistent with their previous on screen instalments , not sure if it was a performance or script issue but just didn't sit well in some moments.Other than that , this film has a lot of heart and emotion but that doesn't get in the way of it being a a good fun film and a nice change of pace for recent MCU films.","13 out of 18 found this helpful.

My personal favourite performance was Christian Bale as Gorr, who is undoubtably one of the best mcu villains so far. Not only did he seem perfectly reasonable at all times, but he was also scary and intimidating.The cinematography is beautiful and sometimes even unlike anything I had ever seen before.Taika Waititi once again made Thor magical and proved us just how beautiful his way of storytelling is.All in all, this movie is so much fun and emotional and the closest to perfection a thor movie has ever been.

Like the third Thor film, this film is directed and this time also partly written by Taika Waititi.In the film, after all his adventures, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is somewhat lost in his life and decides to go back to New Asgard. Before returning here, he learns that a dark creature called Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) is on a mission to kill all the gods.When he arrives in New Asgard he wants to ask Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) for help, but here he sees that his old hammer Mjolnir has been restored, but has found another owner. This owner is his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has magically taken over his hammer and powers. Along with Valkyrie and Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), both try to stop Thors Gorr before he manages to kill more gods.With this film, Tor is the first superhero from the Marvel film series to have four films of his own. Taika Waititi managed to get the Thor series moving again with the third Thor movie and is trying to do the same again with this fourth movie. Together with other script and story writers from other Marvel projects, he managed to turn the third Thor film into a more appropriate comedy action Sci-Fi film. In this fourth Thor film, the writing comes only from Taika Waititi herself and the more aspiring writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. The fact that the writing now comes from fewer people is reflected in the film. This fourth Thor film contains too many comedy elements, which often unnecessarily overshadow the drama moments and other elements. The comedy also comes at the cost of some of the different storylines, making some of these seem a bit rushed and if not clear which can sometimes lead to a more long-winded feel.Fortunately, Taika Waititi knows how to provide beautiful and believable visual effects in the film and thus brings out different worlds of the gods in creative ways. For example, he brings out the divine sides of the Marvel film universe more clearly and more playfully than they tried to do in the Marvel film Eternals, for example. In this film he also manages to use rock music from the 80s as a soundtrack in a fun and appropriate way.The returning cast members once again reprise their roles in this film. Despite the lesser sides of the script, Taika Waititi managed to persuade Natalie Portman to return to the Thor film series. Portman gets more drama sides with this film, but also super power sides to work with. In addition to Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi also managed to get Christian Bale back to act in a superhero movie with the script and request of his children. After his time as Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, he no longer wanted to act in superhero movies. Bale brings a darker serious side to this film, adding more darkness and some light tension.","24 out of 44 found this helpful.

Christian Bale is as angst ridden as ever and delivers it well, but what a wasted performance on a nonsensical script.The story is bad, the directing is pretty bad, everything including the music is over the top and absurd.I understand how the screaming goats felt in this film and wanted to scream with them!","148 out of 222 found this helpful.

Taika gets a little too much free reign as there are many unnecessary jokes. I really hope you like screaming goats. In addition, it's often hard to take the dramatic moments seriously when you think there's about to be a joke inserted to undercut it.Natalie is a nice addition as she brings some gravitas, however her character is saddled with some occasional poor dialogue. Hemsworth is game as always with his stellar comedic chops. His interactions with his various weapons are some of the best scenes in the film. The colors and vibrancy Waititi brings continues to be a highlight and one particular scene on a moon is stunning to watch. I have to say I also loved the GNR needle drops.It's not too often that I wish a film was longer, but this is one of those cases. I feel like we miss a lot of Thor-Jane moments we need to really feel the payoff here. Gorr is also shockingly underutilized and we barely see him butcher any gods. Bale goes all out with a phenomenal performance as one of the MCU's best villains, but I just wanted more.Love and Thunder is pretty standard Marvel fare that we're all accustomed to, which is fine, however I wouldn't mind a more consequential story in Thor's next cosmic outing.","25 out of 48 found this helpful.

But this isnt a standalone movie. This is the forth installement in the thor franchise and features well known and established characters, of whom we all want to know how their story plays out after the defeat of Thanos.And in this context, everything, literally everything is this movie is bad. No not bad, horrible. This is a mess, a movie that feels like a badly written fan fiction.There is only one thing that grants this movie at least 1 out of 10 points: Christian Bale. He always delivers, and it is a shame he was wasted in movie like this.Really there is nothing good to tell about this movie. Even die-hard mcu and thor fans should not watch this abomination of a movie.

Not that this is a bad thing, but it leaves little time to breathe and develop its themes. The majority of the movie is seen as a comedic adventure while the deeper aspects of love and loss are put on the wayside. Christian Bale does a fantastic job as the villain and it would've been great if the rest of the film could match his efforts. It is legitimately a good time, full of fun, and when it comes to comedy it's great, while the rest is just okay. This causes it to feel rather shallow in the long run, but if you're looking for a fun two hours without much thought involved, Thor Love and Thunder does the trick.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Too much jokes, I would say that having a lot of people talking and trying to be funny doesn't work. Maybe 2 out of every 5 jokes are funny. Guardians are barely in this movie so don't expect a Thor and Guardian team up.The tone is kinda inconsistent, with serious moments getting interrupted by that tradition ""Marvel comedy."" There is no real threat, Christian Bale is great but all he does is say stereotypical evil villain monologues. His fights scenes are good though, I will admit. He has a good backstory but his transition from grieving guy to main villain was lame and quick. It happens within the first 5 minutes. One second he is a normal guy, the very next he suddenly changes his looks an is now a super villain.Natalie Portman and Tessa Thombson are good in this movie, and they get almost as much screen time as Thor. I would say the ending involving a battle with kids and shadow monsters was kinda lame, it suddenly turns into a little kids movie.

Keep it up Marvel!","76 out of 134 found this helpful.

Thor was Thor as usual, and his overall character change by the end of the movie was not to extensive, but good.The side characters of the film, who still served good purpose for the plot were great, Valkyrie and Korg shined in there performances and were probably the funniest characters of the film. The Guardians of the Galaxy were great aswell, but didn't shine as much as they did in there previous film appearances, hopefully that's to change in the Holiday Special, and Guardians Vol. 3.To avoid spoilers I'll leave it at this, it's worth a watch, but it's not for everyone, I personally rate it between 6 - 7 out of 10, but one thing I'm left with is the fear that these films are soon to become cash grabs, and not genuine works of art, I see phase 4 as phase 1 (2.0), the stories created in these movies are gonna lead into a more extensive and greater plot, which I am excited, but worried about.I'm underwhelmed to say the least, but I'm happy that the film leaves the story open, and continued certain characters stories! It is worth the watch, but is probably not gonna go down as a marvel classic.","111 out of 176 found this helpful.

Ragnarok balanced the humour with the seriousness. A juxtaposition is needed with these things. The jokes were just better too. Love and Thunder devalued it's dark side by never actually giving the severity of their situation land. Every opportunity they had for a serious moment to get the audience (us) to take it seriously, they made another mediocre joke or just had a screaming goat. They had a romance with no real romance, again we didn't believe it because it was all too ""funny"" it needs some seriousness to balance out the comedyGuardians for example was funny... But Quill lost his mother and father and they all genuinely bonded and Yondu acted as a true father figure and had a good few serious scenes which ngl had me well up 😢. We saw Gamora tortured and manipulated by her father. Rocket have a angry sad speech about the genetic experiments they did on him. These were all really dark and sad and really made us feel for the characters. Which in turn made the comedy feel genuine and a relief from the seriousness.That's the formula.Balance the comedy with something real and serious. And no creepy uncle fester and kids just chilling in a space cage isn't enough. Christian Bale cast as one of Marvel's most badass villains and made to look like Uncle Fester because Taika thought ""Voldemort"" was a bad look was such a ridiculous decision. Voldemort was one of the best villains in our modern lore, and MCU already have Maw who we could have said was of the same alien race as Gorr for the films so Taika... Please step down or start taking the Marvel canon seriously.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

But when you revisit his projects later, you're gonna start noticing it's age.Thor: Love and Thunder is what I felt like an experimental project that wants to explore different ethnic races & certain LGBTQ communities in a very subtle way. You might not notice it when it's fun, but you will when it's not. The first part is Taika's some of the best comedies you'll ever see. The mid part is where it starts to get cheezy, except the visual grading. The final battle and the climax might or might not convince everyone.Then there comes the director's vision of 'comedy first' & 'plot secondary' aspect that some like & others might not. Overall, his movies are enjoyable with whole family. You could give credit at least to that part.Apart from it's downsides, Love & Thunder is it's another own standalone Thor movie that progresses MCU ""just a little bit"", meanwhile also ending some past characters & arks of the celebrities involved in the past MCU projects.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Christian bale's gorr is one of the most sympathetic and yet chilling villains in the MCU but I was disappointed by the screen time he had in the movie. If there was one thing I would improve about the movie is that they would take more time with the script. Overall the movie feels more like a redux from ragnarok but the performance of the cast make the movie worth while as well as enjoyable considering phase four has with led with many controversies.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The Comedy at the very beginning is really good and slowly as we enter the end of first act, it becomes goofy and there follows the silliness. That being said I laughed at 60% of the jokes and they were really good and at the other 40% the whole theatre was silent and gasping and it felt really Awkward. All the weird sounds made by Thor in the trailers have been cut as they might have realised it was too silly. Also at times I really didn't like the editing of the movie.The Mighty Thor, Dr. Jane Foster had most of the silly jokes which was weird and made the arc of the character by the end little unsatisfied and underwhelming for me because if the writing had been right, it would have impacted audience emotionally and would have been beloved by the whole fans.Gorr was really under-utilised in the movie. I really can't judge the character and performance as there was so little onscreen time, 10-15 minutes more would have made a lot of difference and made him beloved Villian like Thanos. Maybe the Gorr stuff was too graphic & dark for the tone of this movie, so they had to cut him out ,I don't know.With all that been said ,this was still a really good movie. Chris Hemsworth really owns the Thor role. The Action was really good and fun. The Cinematography was really good , the monochromatic scenes were greatly executed and when hit correctly, the comedy Scenes were really funny. If not for the silliness pushed too far it would have been a 9/10 movie because it really had that potential , great story and story arcs , redeemable minor characters , great action & soundtrack and cinematography as mentioned before.I really hope Taika Watiti to pull down some of the over the top comedy for Thor 5 it happens and keep the balance and he is really capable of that as he showed it in Jo Jo Rabbit .My Score : 7.3/10.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

I did want more from it, though.Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this - like the 2011 original (also 7/10) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (both 9/10) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.I simply cannot (cannot, I tell you!) believe they didn't just call this 'Thor Four' btw... 💔","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

The scenes with Gorr were rightly not played for laughs and Bale was brilliant. Ok there was maybe a few too lame jokes that didn't hit the mark and Zeus and the meeting of the gods was a horrible cringeworthy moment. But these were the exceptions in a movie that I enjoyed.It is not a great addition to the MCU but equally it is not Dark World.

Now too why I rated it a 6 out of 10 and not higher. I liked how each thor movie and each appearance had a new version of thor and was kind of disappointed that this Thor was sorted of the same as his previous movies in endgame and thor Ragnarök. I would have preferred like an older version of him maybe they will do that in another thor movie or a cameo. I just thought also some of the jokes and action's scenes were all from the trailers and promos and nothing really big or funny came out during the movie that I did see from the trailers. Some good stuff though I did like that they brought back Natalie Portmans character Jane Foster and Valkyrie and Korg which I loved but overall that's why I gave it a 6/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am actually appalled at the amount of good reviews online. I know the movie is supposed to be light hearted and a comedy, but it still fails in an astonishing fashion. IT IS SIMPLY NOT FUNNY. I was not the only one to think so either. It was really painful to hear the silence in the cinema after most of the supposed ""jokes"". The pacing was terrible as well, with most of the movie not driven by plot points but by what jokes Taika Waititi found funny; some were rehashed old jokes as well. There are good actors in this movie but their characters are stupid and too goofy for us to appreciate them. Thankfully, Anthony Hopkins' character is dead, otherwise we would have heard him tell fart jokes. The dialogue is the worst part by far, with most lines sounding like they were written by 4th graders. Bale is an amazing actor and his character was one of only good things about the movie; however, his ark was also understandably limited and a little superficial. The random cliche cgi monsters did not help the movie either.I would have been satisfied with a simple parody-like superhero movie, however this one failed completely in almost every aspect.PS: I think the movie should be rated somewhere around the 5/10 range but I gave it a 1/10 because of how much I disagree with the current rating.","20 out of 28 found this helpful.

That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man.

I will say that i enjoyed the music they put in the movie (despite my hatred towards guns & roses). Christian Bale delivered a solid performance as you would expect and honestly the acting overall was good. I'm disappointed by Taika on this one because it seems like they maybe gave him too much control. It was basically a throw away movie to make money. And that's not always a bad thing but it really didn't do much in my opinion to move Thors character ahead any. The colors and shots were nice. Plot was maybe too rushed while also kinda throwing in scenes that were completely unnecessary. Seems like
most movies are shooting for 2 hours worth these days when it really isn't always necessary. Natalie portman is a bad actor i believe after watching this, but also could have to do with the fact that she doesnt really do cringey comedy much. As far as people complaining about how cringey the movie is, that's what it was made to be. It's supposed to be a mildly cringey 80s style Rom-com but it even kinda failed at the Rom-Com side. If the whole cast would've been killed by Gorr the God Butcher i don't think i would've felt anything. And that's the general feel of the movie, not a lot of feeling or heart put into it. Is it still worth the watch ? Well yeah of course but it's not gonna be a classic or anything and hopefully after the bad press for the movie, disney will get their act together. 6/10 if you consider Ragnarok 10/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thor's character is evolving in each and every movie. The climax and the post credits scene set a great premise for the sequel. All the lead actors have done their part and as usual, Chris Hemsworth saves this movie in many many moments.However, here are some negatives according to me.1. Too many jokes. More than half of the scenes have jokes in the every dialogue. If not for Chris Hemsworth comedic timing, most of them would have fallen flat. Ragnarock was a perfect blend of comedy and seriousness which this movie lacked. We get it. Marvel wants jokes in their movies. But I felt this was an overkill.2. Gorr's character. It is severely limited. If you are expecting a Thor-Hela kind of duel, forget it.In this movie, Gorr is too weak for Thor. One of the fact we enjoyed Ragnarock is Hela and Gorr's limited and undercooked character might make this movie just passable for some. Whilst Bale's acting was great, there is no heavy impact of his character in this movie and this is due to writing and his limited screen time. If he is shown as THE GOD BUTCHER and comes just for 5mins in the first half and 10mins in the second half of the movie, you don't feel THE GOD BUTCHER's intensity and impact.Overall solid movie for me.PS, please reduce the jokes in the next movie Taika.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I feel like Ragnarok did a better job at the comedy. I find comedy in Love and Thunder just didn't land properly. As well, I feel like Gorr the God Butcher was underutilized in the film. I feel like he wasn't used enough in the film and it doesn't make him feel like enough of a threat. He's the GOD BUTCHER and he doesn't seem to fit the role. I do find Christain Bale does a good job as always but it doesn't help the flawed script.I find the CGI in Love and Thunder is a little more spotty than Quantumania. I'm more likely to pick out a worst CGI moment from this movie than Quantumania.Out of the Thor films, my favorite ones are the first and Ragnarok. I find Love and Thunder is a little more watchable than the Dark World. It's definitely more memorable. I do find the post credits scenes in Love and Thunder is good enough setup for the future and would like to see the continuation. I hope that a possible Thor 5 does better than this one and possibly be on bar with Ragnarok. Taika Waititi seems to kinda overstayed his welcome as director, so probably best to get a new director in for Thor 5. I'm alright with him staying as Korg but not as director or writer.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is very hot or cold with some very cheesy undertones. The plot of this movie can be appreciated because it is not predictable. However, it seemed like some of the humor was overdone and some scenes were cringy.The action scenes were overall pretty awesome. The cast and acting was top shelf. The cinematography was also top notch but there were some tacky wardrobe choices for side characters. The soundtrack selection was fitting but lazy for the most part.Overall this movie tries too hard to be a crowd pleaser. Some early Marvel fans might think Disney's influence over the direction of the Thor saga is blatant and is cheapening the experience. In addition to Multiverse of Madness, Love and Thunder is a good indicator that future MCU films are out with the old and in with the woke new.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson deliver charismatic performances, injecting humor and heart into their characters. The film editing keeps the pace lively, balancing action with quirky moments. Its strength lies in its exploration of themes like identity and legacy, and the film certainly doesn't shy away from the over-the-top comic book fun. However, it falters with a somewhat convoluted plot and a sense of déjà vu from previous Thor installments. The music adds a bombastic flair, and the cinematography captures the fantastical landscapes with vividness. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" may not be the most thunderous entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it delivers a decent dose of cosmic superhero antics for those seeking a fun, if somewhat familiar, adventure.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's completely shallow and as badly written as a comic book movie can get. Thor is nothing but a mindless buffoon and for a character of his consequence that is inexcusable. Jane Foster is handled well enough but is also shallow as her story arc is undercut by joke after joke after joke. You can say the same thing about the entire movie itself. It's like the director was required to put a joke a minute into the movie no matter the situation. What results is a shallow mockery that is a notch above Batman and Robin but certainly a low point in the Marvel cinematic universe.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Thor life history was narrated very comical and anyone who did not watch the previous 3 movies will understand. In fact any audience without knowing any back story can catch the concept. Mighty Thor or Lady Thor character was nicely used and good weightage for her as well. Zeus part was cool and most funniest. Valkyrie was also filling and the stone character also.Pros I felt:
Thor attitude always
Mjolnir & Strombreaker
The love part and core content speaking love
Comedy screenplay
Zeus character
BGM & musicCons would be:
Running time - below 2 hours and I'm frustrated as I wish even a 3 hour movie
Weakly designed Gorr character
Lesser time for Gorr
Villain less powerful
Lot of dark scenes - it is minimally visible in theatres
The shadow army is not worthyWhy I cried a lot on cons is because I expected Gorr like a terrific villain and he was just mummified with less preference. Even Thanos who was killing humans had such a built-up and character width - Gorr who kills Gods have just 5 mins of story.However ending was made emotional as always and good leads on the post credit scenes..","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The great thing about the MCU was the way in which they mixed some humour into the life or death business of super-heroing. Think of examples like the back and forth over Captain America admonishing team mates for ""language"" in Age of Ultron. The opening scenes of Iron Man with Stark's interaction with the soldiers in his Humvee. Even the two-handed scenes between Thor and Hulk in Ragnarok, a movie in which limits were tested. Those limits are over-stepped in Love and Thunder, especially, but not only, in the scenes where Zeus is presented as having the personality of a spoiled kid.

A lot of this is explained in nice quirky montages, courtesy of Korg. There's plenty of great cameos - from a lot of Aussies too, since it was filmed here - but the biggest (not a spoiler) is Russell Crowe as Zeus, who has a semi-important role, and is great.Love & Thunder is very fast-paced, using the soundtrack excellently - especially four Guns N Roses songs - and it's amazing the difference of ""the vibe"" during/after 'Thor: The Dark World' and 9 years later compared to this film. The black and white scene is excellent, there's plenty of battles and whenever it starts to get too serious, there's some well-placed jokes. The ending seems fitting and leaves you happy to see where Thor's journey takes him.","290 out of 583 found this helpful.

Tone it down. Less is more. The soundtrack was underwhelming. Also, Jane deserved better and Natalie Portman is better at drama than comedy. I think the only thing that was good in this movie was Christian Bale. But, because this is a Marvel movie and he's playing a ""disposable"" villain you already know how this ends without me needing to tell you. For shame. Why does Marvel have the tendency to kill of the three-dimensional villains that are actually interesting? They should keep pumping out complex and flawed villains, same as heroes. Otherwise, what's the point? For us to be bored to death? Mission accomplished. Marvel: Please do better.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

He carried the movie. For a moment I thought he was playing the Joker. He would've made an amazing Joker. He's such an amazing actor.2 This movie was visually stunning. The VFXs were well made. The fighting sequences were pretty good. VFXs did the heavy lifting. My personal favorite is the fight on the colorless planet that they showed in the trailer.3 They added a lot of story before the classic MCU opening credits. I even thought it was one of the ads the cinema was showing. I would've missed the opening of the movie if I didn't know that Christian Bale was in the movie.4 The movie ended on a high note. It made you excited to see what's coming next. Both easter eggs were meaningful, unlike the second easter egg from Doctor Strange MOM. I'm not gonna talk about the first easter egg since it's gonna be spoilers. The audience were cheering when the second easter egg was out. It was worth the wait.5 It's not until the end of the movie that you'll realize which child they were talking about when they used the ""Sweet child of mine"" song. Also the meaning of ""Love and Thunder"". I thought it was a nice touch.6 Personally I think there are too many jokes in the Marvel movies. Sometimes I didn't get the joke and got frustrated, sometimes I enjoyed the jokes, sometimes I didn't.7 The movie took inspiration from two of the best Thor comic books. Jane Foster the Mighty Thor's story and Gorr the God Butcher's story. The main issue is that Gorr didn't get enough screen time. In addition, the character development of Valkyrie and Jane could've done a better job. What's more, the plot was kinda predictable, since I've seen plenty of the Superhero stuff, I could see where they're going with the story, mostly.Final Verdict 8/10. Inspired by two of the best Thor's comics, with stunning VFXs, with an amazing performance by Christian Bale as always, I would strongly recommend this movie. Even though the script could've been better, it doesn't matter. The audience won't care once they've seen the exciting ending and two easter eggs, they would walk out of the theater with a smile on their faces.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It felt like every scene had to have a dose of zany shoved into it because..well it had to be more zany. I think that just because you can doesn't mean you should. And Love And Thunder shouldn't have. The heavy storyline that starts the movie is underwhelmed by the humor that is smashed into the story for what sometimes felts was funny for funny sake. Christian Bale is a massive bright spot in this one and the music is outstanding if you are a Guns and Roses fan.

First time I've ever cried at the start of a movie. And was then switching between sobs of joy and sorrow until the end. Thank you, sincerely, to anyone that had anything to do with it.A true Marvel offering and a credit to filmmaking. I have created so many accounts just to leave positive reviews. This is what a Marvel film should be like and what a Marvel film can be when it isn't interfered with. Multiverse of Madness suffered because they had to cut so much out of it, this is a beacon of what can be achieved through creatively honouring source material.It has love, it has heart and it certainly has thunder. I cannot recommend it enough. Don't be a dickwad when you go see it, enjoy the experience, open your cold, dead heart to this wonderful film and it will reward you with a deep, emotional, hilarious experience.I truly hope that there are more movies like this. I would generally say that I would love an extended cut, that's certainly the case for MOM, but honestly Love and Thunder was perfect and I don't want them to change a single thing.

There were many great jokes, and i loved Valkyrie.In this movie there was a great threat, an amazing antagonist, the thing with the children, a good Jane foster story arc, and the beautiful Valkyrie. I expected a lot from the movie. But the movei was tarnished with bad jokes, that wasn't even funny, and a whining Thor, who just wanted to ""spend a night"" alone with his hammer Mjolnir. All the threat, all that happened with Jane in the film, all those amazing characters were just secondary over this whole Mjolnir thing. All the thing became meaningless, like all the good stuff was thrown away to a trash can, and Thor became the God of bad jokes and Whining.Thor was serious for 2 minutes throughout the entire film. Like he didn't even care about all the stuff that's happening. This ruined the serious mood of the film and the threat that was lurking in the universe, as well as Jane's condition too.

Overall this was a good lighthearted watch that could have had better writing and better pacing.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was a fun movie and a breath of fresh air to finally move away from the dark and brooding MCU for a bit. No multiverse, and the stakes weren't as universally high as they usually are (although still a really good villain), but it felt great to have an MCU movie like that again. Admittedly, it felt a bit rushed, and there were a few moments here and there that teetered on the brink of parody instead of comedy, but still a solid standalone movie. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments, though, and definitely one worth rewatching multiple times.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It managed to blend serious story points and dramatic moments with Waititi's sense of humor. It worked because the movie was serious and the consequences were real.However, with Love and Thunder he overdid it so badly that none of the serious moments were given any room to work and everything was a stupid slapstick joke. Since people loved the occasional one-liner from Korg in Ragnarok he is now in every scene and narrates the whole movie. Now, suddenly, he has large amounts of dialogue and it doesn't work. This can be said about most of the movie - the dialogue is lackluster.Natalie Portman's return was a nice welcome but even her part was turned into a joke and something tells me that it was money rather than the quality of the script that brought her back to the franchise.Tessa Thompson played Tessa Thompson in yet another movie and in this one she played the part of the background matte painting of every scene she was in. Zero character progression with zero charisma.Christian Bale was the highlight of this movie but his character felt so disconnected from the whole thing with tone and dialogue that it felt like I was watching two different movies at once.In conclusion, it felt like I was watching a one-off parody of a MCU movie with no ties to the existing story.","12 out of 16 found this helpful.

At this point, I'm very tempted to believe a good percentage of the ratings are not genuine; the comments reflect a much grimmer situation.I'm not even going to comment on the movie itself, but on the approach and wokeness is written everywhere.The world does not need protection from fictional, unreal things. So worry less about how not to offend people and be more inclusive, instead worry about how to encourage and motivate them to overcome their weakness and reach their true potential by reflecting a world that is true and in that world people need protection from wars, viruses, incompetent governments, inflation, raising costs of living and so on.","18 out of 26 found this helpful.

I really don't know where in the way Disney got lost with marvel superhero movies and turn them into comedies, if This is the path for the legacy I highly advise Disney to hire Jim Carrey for their next superhero movie.Thor is a mythology god ! The son of lightning! A mighty warrior who saves the universe, and in this movie he is just a clown. The line of the story is not bad at all ! But the focus is just wrong ! Even Russel crow was soooooo bad ! His character is so lame , the mighty Zeus is turned in to a low budget standup comedian by the powerful Maximus decimos meridius, such a disappointment.Highlight : the music is cool ! For me , a xgen, mixing guns and roses to the movie was nice , but in the other hand , I grew up reading comics were Thor was one of the biggest heroes of all time. I guess I will be mad for a while. Hope the next marvel movies don't turn this way! It would be a shame for the franchise.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was different. Such a catastrophe for the marvel franchise. There's no plot, writing, directing or special effects ! They cast some of the greatest actors of this and the last decade but they gave them awful scripts and roles , making them terrible. No need to specify about the plot , I do not think that there is one actually. Writing isnt even a thing here ,they probably just improvising some silly sentences. Special effects? More like a copy of an old version of unreal engine . Not even cinematic CGI , with the actors in all fighting scenes to be graphics . I'm really disappointed, not only with the current situation but with myself too . I just spended 2 hours and 10 bucks of my time and money to watch one of the worst movies of the decade . Actors of a high level and huge budget were wasted .If you haven't seen this movie , DO NOT . This was the greatest mistake of mine because I didn't read any of the comments before watching by myself.Also I feel sorry about all this people in the cinema, who where tricked by this money - earning movie system.

This film is very entertaining, it's full of jokes and excitement, but the pace is little too rush, they could've described some more on the characters development, or little more details to explain some plot point. But instead it was just little rush to fly by some quick explanation while there are many new things introducing in this film.The plot was losing little direction at the second act and the solution of defeating the villain is little too simple and weak...it makes me feeling like playing games of beating the final boss by getting a high level weapon, period.HOWEVER, I'm very impressed to actors/actresses performance where they bring out outstanding performances in here. Christian Bale performance is so amazing even we all have seen many movies of him, but he could still bring out such expressions that you can't find any of his past films. I'm very VERY impressed. Natalie Portman can still bring her great act in here, she's never disappointed. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are doing alright, not bad acting, but doesn't bring out anything interesting. Chris has better performance on his last Thor film than this.In the end, this is still a good entertaining film, but it's little waste not to develop something more complicated plots instead just too simple. I probably rate this film 7/10, but because of the impressive performance from Christian Bale, I would rate it 7.5/10.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I wish we saw more with Gorr the god butcher. Christian Bales performance was absolutely outstanding. Altogether, I think this movie was okay. It's a movie for the mass, to please everybody. Nothing about it is groundbreaking in the world of film and cinema. At least kids will now have a cool Thor skin to play with in Fortnite.

I loved Taika Waititi's take on Thor in Ragnarok, feeling it was the perfect blend of comedy and serious and was looking forward to L&T as a follow up.I was disappointed at how goofy Thor was made to be, and it seemed to rely too heavily on that goofiness, and toward the humour rather than a careful balance.On rewatch though I realized that most of the goofiness came from Korg's version of the story. When we hear Korg as an active narrator, Thor is this two dimension version of himself whose heroics are described as Korg understand heroics.Arguably, the entire movie is from Korg's point of view, however I think we slipped back and forth from being viewers of Korg telling a story, to viewers of events as they happen. Thor is a bit of a lunkhead at times, and as we expect him to be at other times, and those are the key moments of change between listening to the story vs watching the story unfold.Outside of those moments, the movie has the same balance as Ragnarok does which was easy to enjoy once that distinction had been set. Why I missed it on first viewing I can't possibly say.Yes there are a couple of scenes that had a little too much silliness injected (i.e. Zeus prancing down the stairs seemed to be an odd humorous choice in the scene), but these were few enough to ignore.I also remember being disappointed with Gorr, and yet even though most of what he was up to was off screen, when he was on he was much more frightening than I'd given credit for first time around.I don't think I gave it more forgiveness the second viewing, just saw it with eyes with more understanding on where the silliness came from. Is it Marvel's best film? No where near, but it definitely lacked the disappointment I felt on first viewing.TLDR: watch this movie with the understanding that when you hear Korg narrating, it's going to be a sillier scene than when he isn't.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The comedy was much more amplified (most of the comedy didn't even stick for me) and felt incredibly awkward.There are good things about the movie, like Gorr, who I enjoyed throughly with what screen time he did have. And I found Jane Foster's story to be pretty interesting and more enticing than what we were being presented.Chris Hemsworth was great as Thor, but the writing given to his character is a huge disservice to what was supposed to be his ""passing of the torch"", and it's a huge let down. They almost stupefied his character to the point that it's a parody of who Thor is.The rest of the movie was ok at best, serviceable and somewhat fun but I wouldn't really go as far as to say it's the saving grace of phase four. I think at this point, us Marvel fans, are going to be hurting for some quality films from the studio until they can get things situated and planned out better. Because as of right now, there's not much hope for the future of the MCU.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

So yeah, with a heavy dose of a totally useless ""Valkyrie"" and the always ""should live in Wakanda"" Heimdall, you have to try really hard to get past it.If you can, this isn't a bad movie. The Jane as Thor was better explained than I thought it would, great to see Darcy, if only for a minute, and Helmsworth was great as usual. Christian Bale was awesome and interesting to see them weave in Greek mythology too, but I'm guessing if they go very far with that, I'm sure half the Greek gods will end up sassy black people as well.Some people correctly criticise that there's too much humour in this movie, but it calms down after a bit. At first I thought the movie is was going to play out like a satire of Thor, but like I said, they reign it in after a while.All in all it's worth watching - you have to take it for what it is, a dumb fantasy movie, no more no less.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

With a steady stream of Marvel movies and TV serials, maintaining coherent and connected storylines has become challenging. In fact, it's probably best if fans take these at face value, rather struggling to connect the dots, only to end up frustrated. Perhaps no one understands this better than Taika Waititi, the director behind what many (including me) consider the best MCU film, THOR: RAGNAROK (2017). Waititi and co-writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson once again embrace the blend of quick quip comedy and expected action sequences, supplemented this time a love story.The pre-opening credits sequence provides the backstory for the film's villain, Gorr the God Butcher, played by Oscar winner Christian Bale. Gorr has spent a lifetime worshipping the Sun God, only to realize his worshipping has occurred in an actual God-forsaken world that costs him dearly. Gorr ends up learning the lesson of 'never meet your heroes', and this confrontation gives him the power and curse of the Necrosword, and sets him on a revenge mission to kill all Gods. We have to respect a villain who has a legitimate claim to his mission - it's not just a thirst for world domination. Gorr wants the Gods to pay for their ambivalence.We then pick up Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) as he has been fighting with the Guardians of the Galaxy since the end of AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019). With no shortage of characters who excel in comedy, this sequence shifts us into laughter and light-hearted mode after the bleak Gorr opening. It's this pacing that holds for most of the movie ... Waititi never lets things stay too serious for very long. Soon, Thor splits off from the Guardians, as he returns to New Asgard, being run by King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). Now based on Earth, New Asgard is a theme park and tourist attraction. One of the features is the theater acting group we've seen previously, and this time Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, and Sam Neill are joined by Melissa McCarthy as Hela. While this is going on, we learn Thor's old flame, astrophysicist Jane Foster (Oscar winner Natalie Portman) is now an author being treated for Stage 4 cancer. A trip to New Asgard provides her strength as the shattered Mjolnir hammer magically re-forms in her presence. Jane's story boils down to whether she wants to try to extend her life through science or live every remaining day to it's fullest.Gorr kidnaps the Asgardian kids, forcing Thor, Valkyrie, Korg (voiced again by Waititi), and Mighty Thor/Jane Foster to track him to the Realm of Shadows. Their plan is to stop by Omnipotence City to request assistance from the almighty Zeus (Russell Crowe). They are shocked to discover that Zeus is little more than a colorful televangelist with a Borat accent performing a whiz-bang show so that he can get on to the next orgy. Zeus refuses to assist with an army, but he does manage to chain Thor and strip him nekkid centerstage. The good guys nab Zeus' golden lightning bolt and head off to rescue the kids and confront Gorr.In a reverse Wizard of Oz twist, the films turns to Black & White when they reach the Realm of Shadows. It's an eerie environment befitting Gorr. Bale is certainly at his best when he is terrifying and menacing, although the writing is a bit inconsistent for the character, and sometimes it drifts into Pennywise mode, a definite drop in suspense. The action sequences are fine, but really nothing we haven't seen before. And that's probably the biggest issue with all superhero/comic book stories these days. Anything new must come from the story or the characters, and we know the characters far too well at this point.Waititi's version delivers many laughs throughout. Among the best is the odd relationship between Thor and his hammer Mjolnir and his axe Stormbreaker. Thor's jealousy of his ex-hammer hooking up with his ex-girlfriend is almost as funny as Stormbreaker's jealousy of Thor trying to steal back the hammer. Also cool is Thor's homage to Jean-Claude Van Damme, and the look of the Altar of Eternity, where one last wish is granted. Maybe not as effective is the apparent Guns 'n Roses fetish or Jane's struggle to come up with a catchphrase. Sure to be a divisive element is the recurring gag of bleating goats ... I found them hilarious, but many won't. Another piece that simply didn't work for me is Ms. Portman's performance, especially in the scenes with Hemsworth. Her comic timing can't match his, and it's a match that just never clicks.Obviously, the characters originated from the minds of Stan Lee and Jason Aaron in Marvel Comics, and it's Taika Waititi who brings his unique touch to the project. Since he directed THOR: RAGNAROK, he won a screenplay Oscar for JOJO RABBIT (2019), and I've been a fan of his style dating back to EAGLE VS SHARK (2007), and on to the brilliant HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (2016), and TV series ""What We Do in the Shadows"". Waititi is scheduled to direct a Star Wars movie in the near future - one surely to be divisive among that fan base. As for this latest Thor movie, it may be tonally jagged and have a few too many zippy quips for some, but it manages to be silly and tender and emotional, while having the look and feel of a comic book come to life. Stay for the two end-credit scenes.Opening in theaters on July 8, 2022 (Thorsday)","17 out of 41 found this helpful.

I'm sorry that people don't understand something well done and don't realize the direction of all the Thor movies so far.What makes me mad is that people give to this movie number 1 rating or 2 becouse it was a comedy or it was funny or i dont know what got into them, when to MOM they give rating 10 just because it was made by Sam Raimi.

So it is no wonder that he grabs the Necrosword and vows to kill all deities. Christian Bale gives his best performance since American Psycho, and at the risk of being blasphemous, I believe it's actually even better than that one. No, really. For more than two decades, I didn't think that would ever happen. While he has too little screen time, he's probably the best thing about the entire film.For one thing, while all of the action looks cool, it's only when he's involved that we feel any sense of danger. And another, he manages to tear the movie out of the rut it's otherwise stuck in, of humor that is marred by an insistence on being a constant throughout the running time, and the feeling that the talented cast, like in Thor 3, are trying desperately to outdo one another, all of the time. I realise that not everybody thinks the romantic comedy aspect works. Personally I thought it was great. You can tell that these are people who can act, who enjoy working together, who share immense chemistry, and who have shared a lot of screen time by now.This features a lot of risque references, a little strong language and brief nudity. I recommend this to big fans of Ragnarok. 7/10.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Love and Thunder"" could have been great, but weaknesses prevent that","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8317071/?ref_=tt_urv","raven-11881","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur72965424/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2022","Yesterday evening I watched ""Thor - Love and Thunder"" in the cinema. Here is my personal impression of the movie (minimal spoilers to the initial situation of the story).Briefly to the initial situation of the story (minimal spoilers to the first 15 minutes)The opening scene shows Christian Bale as Gorr in a dry desert on an alien planet together with his little daughter. Both lack water and Gorr prays to his god to give water to his little daughter, which of course is not heard. More I do not betray at this point.The plot around Thor begins at the point where Endgame ends: the Guardians of the Galaxy go on an adventure journey into space together with Thor and Korg. Unfortunately, this is only touched on at the beginning for the first ten minutes, until Thor and Korg say goodbye to Guardians to pursue their own goals, namely to follow a distress signal from Lady Sif, who speaks of a ""Godslayer."" At that moment, a rather adventurous (but also often silly) journey through space begins.Plot / Storytelling / PacingThe plot is very exciting and interesting from the starting point. I was hooked from the first second, which was due to the brilliant opening scene that grabbed me emotionally right away. Unfortunately, however, director Taika Waititi gives the plot too little time and scope to fully unfold. The same goes for the characters. There are a tremendous number of exciting and interesting character moments and developments, but unfortunately a lot of things are dealt with too quickly or even off-screen, e.g. The ""emergence"" of Mighty Thor, which is a shame. The same problem has already ""Thor - Ragnarok"". Waititi is simply not the right director or he wants too much and then makes it only half but nothing whole.Another problem, at least for me, is the exuberant humor and the extreme gag density, of which unfortunately only half really ignite for me. Many gags and moments are genuinely funny and made the whole cinema laugh, but again many other gags hardly struck a chord with anyone in the auditorium. Also, too many gags often destroy great and emotional moments of action. Why is that, Mr. Waititi?Overall, a much lower gag density would have done the film a lot of good, as well as a 30-minute longer running time to give the characters, their developments and especially the plot more time to unfold.Actors / CharactersThor is of course great as always and I just like him as a hero a lot. Chris Hemsworth simply IS Thor. This role is tailor-made for him. Unfortunately, Waititi makes him a joke in some scenes. Of course, Thor has always had humor, but this was in Thor 1 & 2 and also in Avengers 1 & 2 never exaggerated or inappropriate, but was used skillfully. Here, on the other hand, he constantly cracks jokes or he lacks for his age (1,500 years) far too often the words or he is ""babbling"". You just don't know this from him in such an extreme way from the first films. It's as if he sometimes lost his ego, only to find it again in the next moment, only to lose it again afterwards. Why is that? It disrupts the flow of the plot and his development tremendously.Korg, as always, is rather THE jokester par excellence, which I don't really like. I would have gladly done without the character. Korg adds nothing to the plot and he is not important at all. He's seemingly just there to give Waititi an appearance in the film.Seeing Jane Foster again is really great. And Natalie Portman's performance is better than ever. She plays convincingly and has really worked out really hard. Suits her and in the role of ""Mighty Thor"" I like to see her. The name though is just ridiculous. Her name is JANE! And Thor is called Thor! Mjölnir has nothing to do with that at all. Why can't she just be called ""Mighty Jane""?It's also great to finally see Lady Sif again. It's just a pity that it's only a very small appearance again. I would have liked to see Thor and her talk it out, since they haven't seen each other for years.Zeus is again completely different than I had imagined him. And unfortunately his appearance is much too short.Gorr, however, is the absolute highlight of the film. Christian Bale plays the role absolutely great and steals the show from everyone else. And what I find particularly good is the rather horror-like way in which his scenes and he himself come across. It gives you goosebumps, or at least it gave me goosebumps. I really like the fact that Gorr is also a very ambivalent and charismatic character.Here we really have one of the best antagonists of the entire MCU. Unfortunately, we see far too little of him. If you already have such a strength to show, why not show more of him and give him even more space and screentime to develop? Once again, I can only say that Waititi has simply not shown a good hand for the plot and the duration of the film. It can simply be done better.Overall, all the characters are great again, but unfortunately Waititi doesn't know how to make and get more out of them. He has the right ideas, but implements them far too clumsily and hectically.CGI Animations / Action ScenesThe action scenes have been varied and well staged. There aren't any action scenes that made my jaw drop, but they're certainly respectable and varied, especially when Thor and Jane fight together.The quality of the visual effects (CGI) are at the highest level, as they were in Eternals, Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain Marvel. Top-notch. I've noticed that the visual effects from ""Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)"" are always a lot better than those from other effects studios. Every time CGI quality didn't convince me that much, ""ILM"" was also missing in the credits. In any case, really great and very successful.Camera / Coloring / Scenery / EditingI liked the camera work. You always had a good overview of the action during fights and they were skillfully staged. But also apart from that the shots and scenery are sometimes really beautiful. It was also worked a lot with total shots, which I always find great. I also find the color scheme of the film fantastic, which covers everything from brightly colored to dirty and gloomy to black and white. I also love the contrasts, which are often a real eye-catcher. I'm curious to see how it looks on my OLED TV with Dolby Vision. That will certainly be a mega sight. There's a lot of variety for the eye here.MusicThe soundtrack is okay and sometimes pretty cool. Unfortunately, not every piece can convince me and thus the music leaves a split footprint in my ears.ConclusionAs with ""Ragnarok"", ""Love and Thunder"" has the same weaknesses: The too hectic plot, too little character development and the far too high and often unfunny gag density. The film doesn't take itself seriously enough, especially Thor as a character is a bit too intentional for me here, but not skillfully funny. Thor is no longer the Thor from Thor 1 & 2 and Avengers 1 & 2, who took himself more seriously and who also talked less nonsense. Gorr as the ambivalent antagonist, however, is just perfectly cast with Christian Bale and, when he does show up, easily takes every scene for himself. I would have liked to see more of him. ""Love and Thunder"" could have easily used 30 to 40 minutes more running time, which could have been used to not let many actions happen ""off-screen"" and to give the characters and the plot more opportunities to develop and evolve.Overall, however, I came away from the cinema extremely satisfied despite the weaknesses. I'm already looking forward to the second viewing and would rate the rewatch value as high. However, I can't completely ignore the weaknesses, because they make the film enjoyable again and again. Without the weaknesses, I would have easily given it the highest score. I look forward to the already announced sequel and hope that then again another director may turn it, who does not make such a silly comedy.8/10 points - High rewatch value.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8309258/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2022","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is the 29th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the fourth solo film to focus around the Marvel superhero Thor. Directed and co-written by Taika Waititi (""Thor: Ragnarok"", ""Jojo Rabbit"") and again starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, it continues the God of Thunder's journey throughout the universe in a solid adventure that both satisfies and saddens.After the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been in outer space with the Guardians of the Galaxy, visiting distant planets to help out their inhabitants with any problems they are facing. Some time later, Thor is forced to part way with the Guardians after he receives an emergency signal from New Asgard back on Earth. Upon arriving home, Thor is informed that a being known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) has come into possession of the god-murdering Necrosword and intends to wipe out all gods from existence, with the citizens of New Asgard next on his hit list. With this new danger looming, Thor hurriedly recruits his associates Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and his old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the latter of whom has taken up the mantle of ""Mighty Thor"", to stop Gorr from his deicidal killing spree.Since he was first introduced into the MCU back in 2011, Thor's solo films have been, to put it mildly, a mixed bag. The first two struggled to find a harmonious tone, with an inconsistent blend of out-of-place comedy and unnecessarily dark moments preventing them from becoming memorable additions to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, if it weren't for the amusing antics of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), I assume most people would skip these two films without a second thought. All of this was rectified in 2017 with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" finally striking the right balance between humorous and serious themes, all of which can be traced back to the involvement of Taika Waititi. All of that remains here in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", as it thankfully continues everything that made its predecessor such a great inclusion to the MCU.Though it doesn't deviate too much from the previous film in terms of tone, this one still retains the same amount of fun and energy that all the MCU fans crave. Here, we get to see Thor as a more upbeat character, who has worked through many of his personal insecurities that were holding him back following his fight with Thanos years ago. He is more optimistic and sure of himself, and despite causing the occasional collateral damage like most superheroes, he always finds ways to make up for it (or at the very least TRIES to).I like how over the course of three prior solo outings and four ""Avengers"" films, Thor has since developed some of the most relatable humanistic traits in the whole MCU, which is interesting considering the character is supposed to be a perfect god. We've seen him go through a wide range of personality changes, from self-important deity, humbled defender of Earth, depressed wreck haunted by his mistakes, and now a man contemplating what his future might bring. But it is in the latter example we see Thor delve deep into what is arguably the most important emotion of all: Love.Considering the film has the word ""Love"" in its title, it stands to reason that it will be the overarching theme its main character will grapple with. Long time MCU fans will remember Thor's original love interest Jane Foster, the astrophysicist from the first two movies whose belief in a scientific explanation for everything is shattered when she meets the God of Thunder for the first time. Though the two seemed to hit it off at first, certain factors prevented the pair from going any further, leading to their break-up and, in turn, her not appearing in the third film.Foster returns here with a vengeance as she makes up for her absence with her new identity as ""Mighty Thor"". Watching as Thor tries to comprehend the sight of his ex-girlfriend donning not only similar attire to him but also using a repaired version of his old hammer Mjolnir provided some amusing comic relief upon their reunion and the way he handles this situation shows how far he has come as a character. He now truly feels a love for someone unlike anything he has felt previously, allowing the story to take their relationship to levels not seen before.In addition to implementing all of these new romantic elements, director Taika Waititi also uses his eye for visual detail to the film's advantage. He shows us brightly coloured locations such as the Omnipotent City, a sprawling metropolis populated by various other gods, including Zeus himself (played by Russell Crowe). Waititi uses this place in particular to show how these gods all have different attitudes to what their titles may suggest. For instance, some of these gods actually care about the well-being of the less fortunate while others just find their positions nothing more than a burden. These moments allow for some quirky universe-building that only a film set in the MCU could properly pull off.But it's not all vibrant environments we get to see. There's also the Shadow Realm, a sinister place lit only by the colours of black and white. When our heroes arrive at this menacing location, the film starts to resemble those classic colourless feature films, tapping into that old school feeling of people exploring somewhere frightening. The movie's antagonist Gorr appropriately considers this place home and his dark intentions suit it to a tee. The way in which Waititi is able to balance these two polar opposite locations alongside one another is testament to his talent as a filmmaker and goes to show that his presence among the MCU staff is a welcome one.Returning to the role after a three-year absence, Chris Hemsworth demonstrates how much he has evolved alongside Thor as a character, going from a stoic overpowered god to a fun-loving hero not afraid to show his sensitive side. Hemsworth uses his signature Aussie larrikin likeability to bring out the amusement factor that makes what I call the ""Waititi-era"" Thor a more endearing hero than when he was first introduced. His scenes with Natalie Portman as Jane Foster had a believable warmth to them, which is surprising since I always thought they lacked chemistry with one another in the first two films. I guess it was simply poor writing in those movies because with the way the pair interact here you'd swear their relationship always had this much of a spark to it. With that in mind, Portman is clearly enjoying herself more this time, considering she has a more physical role in the story than before. It's nice to see her occasionally one-up her co-star during the film's action scenes as she manages to hold her own when the going gets tough.I also think Christian Bale did a good job as the film's main villain Gorr, a man hell-bent on causing the extinction of all gods. Knowing how talented an actor Bale is, it was nice to see him provide the character with more dimension than your typical MCU antagonist. Without venturing into spoiler territory, Gorr's backstory is shown to be quite tragic, immediately clueing the audience into why he is on this genocidal crusade in the first place. The best types of villains are the ones who think they are doing everything for the greater good (like a certain purple Titan wielding a gauntlet), and I did feel sorry for Gorr once I understood his motivations, although this of course doesn't justify him wanting to murder the innocent.Now four solo movies in, it's great to see how a hero like Thor has finally found the appropriate balance between a powerful god and a regular person. Though I think there is little else that can be done in future films to develop the character beyond what we have right now, we can still appreciate him for what he is already - a genuine person with relatable flaws. And that is what I believe to be one of the reasons why the MCU has been successful for so long - it shows that heroes, even literal gods, are capable of going through legitimate growth and changes to become better people. That and the casual humour of course. Either way, it has proven to be a winning combination.I rate it 8/10.","143 out of 299 found this helpful.

His quirky humor, great soundtracks, and attention to deft pacing and comedic timing made that film, while far from perfect, a unique standout that helped create a fresher vision of Thor as a character that not only would ultimately set him up for ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame,"" but provide a blueprint for how directors could still put at least a somewhat unique stamp of their own on the Marvel formula. I'm not necessarily a hardcore fan of Waititi (""Jojo Rabbit"" was not for me,) but still appreciate his idiosyncrasies and interests in using humor and irony to pepper stories in unexpected and distinct ways. With that said, given that I enjoyed ""Ragnarok"" and also love Christian Bale (who plays Gorr, the film's villain,) I was hoping this sequel would deliver. While it's not terrible by any means and a fine way to kill two hours on a hot summer day, it's much more forgettable than its predecessor and adds vanishingly little to the MCU as a whole.The film deals with Thor's post-""Endgame"" whereabouts, including his partnership with Jane Foster (the ""Mighty Thor.) Its primary plot line, however, centers around him and Jane having to rescue a group of kidnapped local children from the wrath of Gorr, a vengeful father who wants to kill all the gods. As anyone who saw ""Ragnarok"" and remembers its light, breezy, irreverent tone can imagine, the tone is emblematic of that film. Yet while the film can sometimes be entertaining, it just doesn't work anywhere near as well as ""Ragnarok."" The humor doesn't feel fresh and instead feels rather forced, the character development is surprisingly rather weak, and the stakes never feel convincing. There are plenty of ways to do comparatively lower-stakes MCU movies in a more interesting way (like ""Shang-Chi,"") but instead this feels more like a Disney+ miniseries concept than a theatrical movie in terms of plot depth and relative impact to the greater MCU. Even its themes of romance and the impact of interpersonal relations on the psyche feel blandly explored, and the emotional core there is in the story feels rather weak compared to ""Ragnarok."" To Waititi's credit, the film is deftly paced at a notch under 2 hours managing to never feel too long nor too short, he does serve up a good soundtrack (highlights include classic Guns and Roses songs,) and a few scenes have CGI visuals that are a cut above your average Marvel movie. Yet these stronger elements unfortunately don't match up against the film's relative sense of purpose or even a strong, original plot. Christian Bale is very good, unrecognizable, and menacing as Gorr, but he's almost criminally underused in the story, to the detriment of the broader narrative as a whole. Recommended for theatrical viewing only to devoted Marvel fans; everyone else can wait to stream it or skip it entirely. 6/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Movies and characters need heart behind them and it feels like a lot of them lack this heart in favor of fan service and ways to make the most money possible. Most of them are overly dramatic and the jokes that do make it in don't usually land for me. But I remember watching Ragnarok with my family and... laughing? Didn't even know who Taika Waititi was until earlier this year and was surprised to see he wrote the one Marvel movie I enjoyed. As expected, his 2nd Marvel movie didn't disappoint either! Honestly, Gorr wasn't the most compelling villain but he served his purpose. Christian Bale needed more screentime!People often forget that storytelling doesn't have to be constant doom and gloom to have an impact on people. Taika does a great job balancing comedy and drama in his work and this movie is no different. Comedy makes tragedy hit that much harder and it's great to see this in a Marvel film !!","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

From the beginning, to the end, I was entertained. I wasn't sure exactly how it was going to end either, which means the plot was, while not exactly deep, not completely obvious.Great movie? No
bad movie? No
Good and entertaining movie? Sure
Do I feel like I wasted my time? Not at all.Memorable? I finished watching it and can still remember the plot.Will I watch it again? Possibly, in a year or two.Was it better than other recent offerings from the MCU? Better than most, yes.Did I fall asleep watching it? No.Did the plot keep moving? Yes
Was the plot deep and full of intrigue? Medium
Was it as good as Thor Ragnarok? About evenI liked the emotional bits and the love story between Jane Fonda, Jodi Foster, Jane Foster, and Thor.I liked the focus on what matters most in life.Most of all, I like that I was surprised by the ending.Love wins, every time. It may not be glamorous, and it may be a journey of pain to get there, but Love, selfless self sacrificing Love, always wins.I think we are at a point in our societal evolution where a large portion of society is focused on finding enemies under every rock. Many have cited the ""female Thor"" plotline as problematic. To be fair, it was in the comic books, and to be fair, the hammer chooses who is worthy not by gender or other characteristics, but by the content of their character. We have lost sight of the idea that the content of someone's character is important. We have become wrapped up in identifying with one ideology or another, or identifying with one group or another based on subjective criteria. One thing this film does, either on purpose or as a byproduct, is illustrate that a person's value is in what they give to the world around them, what positive impact they have.A wise man once wrote ""If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.""","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I love the humour Thor has but it used to be occasional, this film tries it every step of the way, endless jokes, the weird goats that literally lost it's comedic value by the second scream. Jorg was funny but also when you realise he made the movie he has a surprisingly big part.The story was just ok, chemistry was a bit off, you just didn't particularly care about the extras. The mayor of his homeland was meh, fights were just deja vu and the rest was just a bit aimless and pointless.Did I laugh? Yeah! Did I enjoy it? I'm unsure, I was mainly disappointed/confused. The end credits with the guy from Ted lasso and Valhalla were probably the least interesting I've seen.Truthfully that should be it for Thor stand alone films, as good as he is, his worlds just dull especially without Loki, I assume maybe there will be some cross over with Valhalla? Either way I can't say I'm bothered and most people I heard seemed deflated. He should just be part of the big films and leave the solo ones.Sense Stan sadly passed I've found marvel films to have dropped off hard, this was a full on comedy and nothing like the original 3 where comedy was there it bits. Stan wouldn't have liked this, but from passable like Spider-Man to middle of the road like ten rings to the awful eternals and venom and whatever dr dull was. Marvel had a run of unbelievable films which no longer seems a guarantee. DC have black Adam which looks fun, be nice to have some competition as the Batman and morbius films were dull as hell.Is this the begging of the end for them being guarenteeed hits? After 5/6 mediocre at best films, I'd say yeah.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was a more comedic but very sharp Thor film. Director Taika Waititi brought his very peculiar sense of humor to the MCU and it was refreshing. With Love and Thunder Waititi goes even further into comedy. So much so that the film feels like a self parody. I am all for silliness in superhero films but if you want an audience to be emotionally invested in a story you have to take it at least a little seriously. The film starts off as a full on comedy and the 3rd act gets serious but again, the shift in tone is jarring. Chris Hemsworth I'd good again as Thor and Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster Thor's love interest. They have a good chemistry but again it's all so silly that when the film gets serious we should care more. Christian Bale plays Gorr, the God Butcher. He is the villain and is the best part of the film. A really good performance that is taken seriously but the rest of the characters are so busy being funny that it seems he belongs in a different film. Bale's great villain is sort of wasted. Is it entertaining? Yes. There are some really cool visually touches and yes some of the comedy works but I wish that the film would have been more of an adventure and less self parody....Grade: B-","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Despite having polarized reviews I personally liked Thor Ragnarok and it was the best movie in the Thor quadrology in my opinion. Atleast the slapslick comedy worked out so well and the chemistry between Thor Hulk and Valkyrie were so likeable.In Thor 4, A similar premise was there. There's a goofy team up, A well made villain character and some quirky events with goofy characters ( Grandmaster , Zeus ) but Taika failed to recreate the same magic as the team up was so muddled , Gorr had less time but Bale made good use of the character and Thor meeting with Zeus was so ridiculous.B&W scenes between Gorr and Thor were surprisingly good and sequences involving Stormbreaker vs Necrosword were good. The crew tried to save the movie but except Hemsworth and Bale , others were not contributing much to the movie. Some comedies were a hit but most of them fell flat. Movie was mid till Thor escapes from Zeus but it was okayish after that. As a Marvel fan , I'm worried about the future of Phase 4 after this.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There were also some dramatic moments that changed the plot and the concept of the movie, something that I did not expect and it was a nice surprise. The direction which was made by Taika Waititi was very good for one more time and he did an excellent job on the way that he presented the evolution of the story after the events of Endgame. The interpretations of Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Christian Bale who played as Gorr, Natalie Portman who played as Jane Foster and Tessa Thompson who played as King Valkyrie. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Russell Crowe's who played as Zeus.

Maybe this is all due to Waititi and Hemsworth being unrestrained this time and unfettered from the Marvel restraints which helped to make Ragnarok a more perfect balance of comedy and drama and greater success. This was less than the sum of its parts and tried to do too much with too little, never allowing its audience to go with the flow. There are great performances and some brilliant cameos, for those who have loved Hemsworth's Thor history, but it lacks the cleverness of Ragnarok and ends up being clunky and a pale immitator of the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. In trying to please everyone at all cost, this leaves a confused mess and bring the Thor greatness of Ragnarok back down to earth with a thud - where The Immigration Song was inspired in Ragnarok, too much Guns and Roses just led to a land of confusion, and a Universe that may have been blown by all the colour and lights. Even a nude rendering of Hemsworth can't distract from its obvious flaws, though it was a nice try. Time to go back to the drawing board to hammer out a better Thor, for those who love the God of Thunder. This movie does him a disservice.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was nothing in this film worth saving. If it were not for the fear of missing something in the overall story arc, I would have stopped watching this several times. Honestly, this was beyond disappointing - it was painful.I think it's time to abandon Hemsworth and move in a new direction. The incessant desire to be funny.never worked. The entire film was a train wreck. I feel bad for the Guardians cast. They seemed to participate awkwardly - as if they knew this was a complete klinker.

The jokes flow second to second each more surreal and unmarvel like from the last but much like ragnorok it's the stunning visuals that really standout in the movie, it's just beautiful. Waititi's eye for this world is unlike anything else happening within the Marvel cinematic universe.

Visually distinct and with a unique soundtrack, the formulaic screenplay benefits immensely when focusing on the complex arcs of each character.Still, the continuous comedy bits - far from the hilarious creativity of the past - deny further exploration, removing emotional value from the third act. The action featuring generic CGI shadow monsters holds predictable issues, and an irrelevant plot deviation only serves as a teaser for future content.Overall, Taika Waititi succeeds yet again, but this time, he fails to reach the full potential of the premise.""Rating: B+","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

There is also some great use of Guns n Roses songs.Of the cast Hemsworth is great, I love this version of Thor, as opposed to one from the first two movies. Bale was superb, he was very creepy when he was onscreen!! Natalie Portman works in a way I didn't expect. I LOVE Natalie Portman, but I never cared about the Thor and Jane relatiinship. I was surprised at how much I got into it and their relationship in this one. Russell Crowe is clearly having fun, but he won't be for everyone. Tessa Thompson is no fun, but that's how her character is written, so it's not her fault. Where was the bad ass from Ragnarok?It's tone is a bit all over, the comedy is so front and centre it kind of takes away from the seriousness of what is happening and it is serious at times.The Jane/Mighty Thor storyline seemed a bit rushed and I'd have liked more Bale, but overall, I really liked it a lot and will be seeing it again.","21 out of 39 found this helpful.

Thor's latest planet-skipping adventures are built around the party-rock atmosphere of several Guns N' Roses tracks, notably ""Sweet Child o' Mine,"" but, alas, the song's refrain ""Where do we go? Where do we go now? Where do we go?"" is all too apt for the movie's directionless, make-it up as we go along style. Here are a lot of things I love about Waititi's approach to Thor, but my favorite is that they are now comedies. While ""Ragnarok"" was packed with jokes, I think ""Love and Thunder"" embraces the comedy aspect even more. The trailers let us know there would be plenty of laughs, but it also felt like it may try to be a bit more serious. Well, thankfully, that was the trailer, not the movie. ""Love and Thunder"" is listed as an action, adventure and comedy. What it actually is, is a comedy with some action and adventure. I laughed out loud so many times and just when you start feeling like things are getting serious, you get a perfectly timed gag and the tension is released. Often times when a movie is trying to be funny or full of action, the filmmakers tend to sacrifice story and emotion for spectacle. This is not the case with ""Love and Thunder."" Waititi understands in order to make the jokes land and the action hit, you have to care about what is happening. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll be vague here, but there is a rich story filled with love, wanting, loneliness, heartache and sorrow. These heavier elements create a story we're invested in as an audience, but it's balanced expertly with humor, adventure and plenty of spectacle. I cared about Thor, Jane and even Christian Bale's Gorr. Waititi and his team created relatable characters, strong storylines and plenty of drama. We've had a few opportunities to see this, but Hemsworth is a brilliant comedic actor. His timing and delivery are pitch-perfect and make for an egocentric Thor with a heart of gold, and you can't help but love him. Hemsworth was the perfect choice for this role and it's ever more evidenced in ""Love and Thunder."" We all know Natalie Portman is a fine actress, but her chemistry with Hemsworth is palpable and she brings a certain sense of humanity to the film that is essential to its success.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

There were lot scenes which ended too fast I actually wanted to see more from those but anyway let's hope we'll get an extended version of the movie.Overall the Movie has a good storyline which filled with romance, emotions and mostly lot of fun. I love how they showed the love story between Thor and Jane it was totally romantic. When it comes to CGI and VFX they have nailed it. Some scenes were totally unexpected like credit scenes they were really exciting. It's probably worth watching two times in theatre. Don't care about those who downgrading the film just get the experience of your own!","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

Ragnorak was surprisingly fresh and grew on you with repeat viewings. Love and Thunder I think will do the same. Watching it a second time was a more pleasing because I could pay attention to the shots and the editing, not having to focus on where the story was going. The nuts and bolts of the film are on solid ground. It is well put together.The plotting is not as tight as Ragnorok, that's for sure and some of the joints are held together merely with cheesy jokes that aren't always funny, but it still has its moments.To surmise, even if it doesn't quite meet expectations on the storytelling front. Visually it is one of the best to come from Marvel. Turn off the sound and give it another look.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"","","Taika Waititi's Worst Film To Date","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8555741/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","19 September 2022","Taking all that was good & refreshing about Ragnarok and overcooking it to the point where all of the good stuff is rendered useless, the 29th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has its priorities all over the place and has no idea whatsoever about what made the previous entry such a vibrant cosmic delight. The story does have a heart but it is buried beneath all the vapid goofiness that's overdone to the point of annoyance.Co-written & directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople & Jojo Rabbit), Thor: Love and Thunder isn't devoid of the flavours that made its predecessor work but the balance is certainly missing this time around. The film looks & feels like its own parody, for Waititi here overdoses on his own style and fails to properly handle the drama, romance & comedy elements. The premise is promising but when it comes to execution, it is lacking in restraint & consistency.For a $250 million production, the imagery & visual effects look as underdeveloped as they are uninspiring. Editing focuses on all the wrong stuff here as the film could've done more with less Korg, less eccentricity, less quips and certainly more emphasis on developing the dramatic bits. Every now n then, it does strike a heartfelt chord but with the narrative being a tonal nightmare, the effectiveness of those moments is either vastly diminished or wholly nullified by the silliness on display.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder isn't entirely the disaster that many are calling it to be but it is definitely a step down in quality & coherence that the last chapter exuded in spades. The story isn't without its merits but they are few n far between. Enormously underwhelming & downright forgettable, the film showcases Taika Waititi's worst tendencies as a storyteller, certainly ranks amongst his weakest directorial efforts, and suffers from problems of its own makings. In short, Marvel Studios' latest is as empty as it is cringe.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Gorr The God Butcherer (Christian Bale) was magnificent, truly a standout performance. Chris Hemsworth is great at playing Thor, he invests alot into the role as we've seen over the years and hopefully more to come.I'll admit I was skeptical at first in the decision of bringing Jane Foster/Lady Thor back into the mix as her character has had no relevant screen time to the story for many years but I was wrong, she was brilliant. I couldn't help but ponder where Loki was, I was expecting a reunion/ a confirmation of Lokis possible survival for Thor but nothing. I know its all a plan and I have faith it will be incredible! I can't wait to see Thor return on the big screen, I'd highly recommend this one, not the best ever but still very entertaining!","19 out of 36 found this helpful.

But this time something didn't happen at all. ""Love and Thunder"" has way too high contrast between drama and jokes. Like Taika shot two movies at once--a drama about Thor and his lost love and a parody on Thor movies; and randomly mixed them together. And the jokes? Jesus Christ, reasoning the jealous axe with tickling it for relaxing the tense were awful. If it was a complete parody in Mel Brooks style, that would work, but this is a part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe, Taika! What have you been thinking about?! And why the hell did the studio allow you to make THIS?!As a result we got an awkward and chaotic story, a set of scenes poorly stiched together with awkward and inappropriate jokes. Some moments were really good, like Russel Crowe as Zeus or Christian Bale as Gorr. But in general it's really the worst part of MCU so far.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Just when I thought the industry ran out of superhero writing ideas, this little gem comes along, and we were all in tears laughing so hard. Even the story-telling narration was a brilliant touch and elevated the plot and the laughs. The entire screenplay had everything and something for everyone. The humor, the romance, family dynamics, and so on, everything imo was perfection. All casting and performances were outstanding. The almost 2 hour runtime flew by with the excellent pacing. The set designs, S/VFX and cinematography were amazing. The score and soundtrack were spot-on. I can't wait to see this one again, as it's now one of my favorite superhero films of all time.

It gave the character Thor much more personality and made him more fun then the other marvel characters. Sadly though this movie over does every single good thing Ragnarok did. The plot jumps around and sometimes just doesn't make sense and Thor is a total idiot in this movie. The running gag was annoying and some of the characters that reappeared in this movie display why they should have only been in ONE movie. The main problem I have with this movie though is the villain. Gorr the God Butcher is a terrifying but a enjoyable villain to watch on screen. Yet we only get a few major scenes to enjoy Christian Bales performance! One of the first MCU villains I wanted more of! Overall the movie is just okay. If you want a few laughs and a few cool fight scenes definitely watch this movie. If you are looking for anything deeper than that steer away.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Strong performances from the whole cast try to bring the viewer into the movie, but fail mostly due to too many jokes, and to much screentime for Korg, who's only purpose is to add a joke to every scene.The second half however definitely speeds up and brings the perfect balances of action, character-development and emotional dichotomies which carries the movie to finally start. The plot only really starts in the second half, and brings the joy and balance of Thor: Ragnarok, and a satisfying conclusion to the movie.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is brought down by the silly first half, but restabilises to bring about a very watchable and enjoyable movie.(Better than most of the last Marvel movies like Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Eternals, and Morbius)
Still, a very enjoyable and fun movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sometimes the jokes were awful, but basically, it was not that bad. Average story, not bad characters, funny acts. They gave some hidden meaning as well, to think about it. But basically, it is about joy, and for that, it is good.You can laugh, you can have a coke with some popcron and just relax. Smile, laugh. I pretty much enjoyed it.

Some it lands, but a lot of it doesn't. The worst part is that every character seems to basically behave differently from how we know they should be acting, because every line is delivered as though it's part of the same joke. The effect is rather bizarre and it's often difficult to tell if we're watching what's actually happening in the film's present tense or if we're seeing some re-imagined and embellished past tense, like the Korg narration that periodically crops up in the film.Bale's performance is really the stand-out element here. His motivations are something we can sympathize with and he brings a level of quirky intensity that's often lacking in these MCU villains. Ethan Hawke recently said that he thinks the Marvel films are actor-friendly but not director-friendly, and this is a good example of how putting quality actors in front of the camera and letting them do their thing can pay off. It's a shame that the rest of the film seems to hell-bent on undermining all of the serious drama with a strange often misplaced sense of humor. It's hard to say if this is the weakest Thor so far, as it's still probably better than Dark World, but it's not as good as the first one and definitely not as good as Ragnarok.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Plus, in a movie on character like Thor, we need a full to action all the time. Half of the time was just like a slow romcom.I think Kevin Feige should just check what their editors are doing.

This film fails to do that.Most of this film feels like a parody of itself. There are way too many jokes, most of which fall flat. Thor himself has become a joke, feeling more like Homer Simpson than the God of Thunder. Christian Bale does a good job as the God Butcher, but his role is almost side-lined by the other characters. And Russell Crowe feels like he is doing a Saturday Night Live sketch.There is a scene in one of the comics whether Captain America has been nominated as leader of all superheroes against a galaxy threatening enemy. Another character objects, on the basis that Cap is one of the least powerful beings present. Thor steps up and says something along the lines of ""Captain America is a man whose every action is the embodiment of honour; I would follow him into the jaws of Death."" *THAT* is the Thor that I want to see - one who values honour and courage above all else (even physical might), who considers petty mortal concerns beneath him, even though he sometimes finds himself succumbing to them.Sadly, the MCU character is moving further and further away from that character.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But they're not bold enough to do it so they rather spend their time with childish humour trying to appeal to kids when they could very easily be dominating the industry even more.

Taika Waititi's style of comedy and directing just fits with me. This film definitely is not perfect, but it is exactly what I wanted.One of my absolute favourite elements was 'Gorr the God Butcher', as the villain. Christian Bale gave such an amazing performance, which shone despite the character's small amount of screen time. There is a particular film sequence that involves his character which is extremely well executed visually. I really liked the direction they took the Jane Foster character in! It genuinely surprised me at points and built upon previous films.The film does seem to move at a rather quick pace. It never really stays in a singular scene for too long. This does somewhat prevent further character development and leaves you wanting a bit more of certain characters. It definitely adds the film's humour, as it does not dwell on jokes that didn't land as well as others. Overall, I would recommend checking it out!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thor has spent years trying to ignore his trauma from his conflict with Thanos, and Gor sacrifices his life to avenge his daughter's death against the gods.However, the end of the movie is not about Gore or Thor winning, but about them realizing that there is something more important than revenge and their battles. Thor decides to spend his last moments in Jane's arms rather than fight Gore, and Gore decides to bring the girl he loves back to life rather than commit mass murder. Ultimately, the film explores the fact that love and acceptance are greater forces than revenge and war, and this is a step forward in Thor's storyline as he gradually moves away from the crazy conqueror and outlaw he was in his first film.Thor's fondness for Mjolnir and his jealousy of Jane who uses this weapon is one of the common jokes of the film. So it makes sense that Thor takes Mjolnir back at the end of the movie and gives the Stormbreaker to Law. However, there is a deeper meaning behind Thor's use of Mjolnir. Throughout the film, Mjolnir shows Thor's feelings for Jane and his longing for her. By using Mjolnir at the end of the movie, Thor shows some kind of respect for Jane and thanks her for helping him grow and develop his character.Reuse forever
Eternity wasn't mentioned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe until Thor: Love and Thunder, but it was in the comics. However, the Marvel Comics version of Eternity is somewhat different and is the next priority in the Marvel Universe after the Living Tribunal. Apparently, the doors of eternity were locked before this, and it is not clear what their role was before. The Marvel Cinematic Universe devised a law so that the first living being to reach eternity could have one of his wishes fulfilled.The film's dialogue suggests that this is a one-time deal and that Eternity cannot be used again after Thor: Love and Thunder. However, now that the gates of eternity have been opened, this entity may seek to use the power of the remaining beings for its own purposes. Eternity and Infinity are often associated with Galactus and have significant similarities in some images, and Galactus may also appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Who gives hits?

I'll get the bad things out of the way at first.It has WAY too much humor, to the point where it's almost unbearable at times. It is very obviously rushed, with some characters like Jane not getting nearly enough development. It has some very shoddy CGI at times, but nothing outright horrendous. Finally, it suffers from a weak first half littered with too much childish humor and not enough focus. The plot is a little too simplistic, but it does the job.As for the good. The acting is fantastic, specifically Christian Bale as Gorr. He absolutely steals the show. Tessa Thompson, Natalie Portman, and Chris Hemsworth all deliver great performances too. The soundtrack is also amazing and it had me jamming out all throughout the movie. The visuals for the movie are very unique and diverse. Gorr is one of the best villains in the MCU, his sheer presence is terrifying. Sad we didn't get more of him though.Overall, you have a very fun time for all ages.

The writers tried far too hard to recreate the fun of Ragnarok, of Guardians, etc. Previous MCU movies had serious action, great visual effects, an interesting storyline, and the occasional humorous moment. Love & Thunder seemed to shoot for being a parody of the MCU lineup. Pointless action scenes that did little for the franchise, a boring storyline, with stabs at humor early and far too often. Many of our favorite characters whittled down to nothing.The soundtrack had potential. Lots (and I mean LOTS!) of Guns & Roses, with even a character named Axl. But like the humor, too much means too much. By comparison look back at Avengers: Endgame. Appropriate music selections throughout, to include that final scene of Cap slow dancing with Peggy Carter to jazz. Something for everyone.The end of the credits tells us ""Thor will return."" He's one of my favorites, but if the next effort is the same as Love & Thunder, just let the franchise enter Valhalla and spare the fans the agony.","9 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's polarised audiences, thanks in no small part to the surreal vision of director Taika Waititi, that re-imagines Thor more as a goofy layabout than as an omnipotent deity.After teaming with the Guardians of the Galaxy in Avengers: Endgame, Thor has become restless, so he strikes out on his own to find his purpose. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the God of Thunder and is clearly having a ball milking the role for laughs. He's threatened by Gorr, the God-Butcher (played fantastically by Christian Bale) a ghastly, reaper-like bogeyman who suffers a personal tragedy, causing him to seek retribution against all gods. Tessa Thompson returns as the female warrior Valkyrie, now the King of Asgard, and Waititi reprises the role of the softly-spoken rock warrior, Korg. Thor's old flame, Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), reappears as the super-powered Mighty Thor, thus complicating matters. This triggers flashbacks of their domestic life together and the basis for settling unresolved feelings.Waititi has carte blanche to make a romantic comedy with superhero elements, rather than the other way around. Credit to him for having the deftness to balance the levity with the pathos in a style that doesn't diminish either. The sentimentality isn't fully convincing, but his heart is in the right place. Waititi's modus operandi has been to stay true to his idiosyncratic brand of absurdist humour. The arbitrary and whimsical jokes come from beyond deep left field. Every scene is a set up for a gag, whether it be a pair of screaming goats, or the infinity ice cream cones (infinity stones, geddit?), so when a very familiar figure shows up as Zeus speaking with a thick Greek accent, well why not?The film's costumes and technical expertise is top rate, which is to be expected given the budget for this blockbuster. A brilliant, vibrant colour palette livens the proceedings, with mythical and fantasy elements fused into a vivid and gorgeous spectacle full of scintillating battle scenes and special effects. When a song from the 80s rock band Guns N' Roses starts playing, it's just another incongruous element that shouldn't work, but it does. All of these disparate pieces make this an amusing and entertaining romp, giving the Marvel Cinematic Universe another colossal shot in the arm.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

And that works. The second half of it is more serious, with extra stakes, action sequences added and a few emotional moments. And that works too.What doesn't work is that the filmmakers haven't figured out a way to match these dark and funny bits together in a way that fits. There are numerous false sacrifices that don't raise the stakes. Weirdly enough they did this in the Amazon series The Boys as well - and that's a problem.The actors do look like they are still enjoying playing the characters. There were a few, such as the Guardians of The Galaxy, that should have stayed longer. And a few others, such as Korg and the Asguardian kids, that overstayed their welcome. (Waititi plays Korg, so for some reason in this film he gets most of the dialogue)
Valkerie was sadly underused and Jane's feelings towards her illness should have had more screen time.Thor is back and he's here to stay, which is a good thing since I do love his character. But overall this follow up to Ragnarok could have been much better since it had all the ingredients to be. They just weren't used right.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a movie where the hero's journey is is purposeful and resolute, not only for Thor Odinson but Jane Foster as well. To get on that road, though, takes a lot of patience.As fun as LOVE AND THUNDER is, the movie is also childish, idiotic, superficial, and features way too many Guns-n-Roses anthems. The first twenty or so minutes, where Thor goofs off with the equally-juvenile Guardians of the Galaxy, would tax even the strongest of Asgardian gods. Once the threat of Gorr, the god butcher, arrives on New Asgard's steps, the heroes' quest begins - and that is a most satisfactory story.Taika Waititi makes use of Chris Hemsworth's generous smile and biceps in a familiar and comfortable manner. Thor takes on the mantle of leader and proves he is quite sufficient in the role. Smashing and thrashing and joking (maybe a touch too much of the levity this time around, though) leads to a successful, and actually unsuspecting, ending where you are craving more.First and foremost, Thor is a hero. Hopefully future appearances of the Thunder God will focus more on this aspect and keep the over-the-top humor in reserve. Maybe for a rainy day.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because it looks like they have shifted their strategy from quality to quantity. It's been not even two years into Phase 4, and I have lost count of how many shows and movies they have released. And looking at the upcoming slate, there seems to be no slowdown.Anyway, coming back to this movie. Taika Waititi is an excellent director. But this movie seems like a rehash of Ragnarok, but ten times worse. This movie is full of jokes in every scene. And most of them don't land. And given that they are in almost every scene, you really can't connect with any of the characters or feel for them.I feel bad for Christian Bale because did an excellent job here with what he was given. And the remaining characters had nothing to do except appear alongside Thor and be a part of annoying jokes. The major focus of this movie seems to be setting up future projects. I wish Taika had focussed on improving this one first. And lastly, this movie probably also suffers because of the short runtime because it tried to jam two best Thor's comic storylines in a movie that's barely 2 hours long.","17 out of 26 found this helpful.

Natalie Portman's character (Jane Foster) had a brilliant execution of being brought back into Marvel after years from her last appearance.Love and Thunder was perfectly expressed due to the end of the movie with major sacrafise and sympathy for one and other. Gorr was portrayed astoundingly, making him one of the creepiest mcu villans to date.Runtime could of been extended as I had a huge interest in Gorr himself, wish to know more of his backstory. Felt rush in certain segments.CGI did wonders with the golden palace, action sequences, shadow creatures etc.Wish to of seen more of Valkarie and Jane's bond of sisterly friendship!Recommend !!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Seeing how they dumbed down Thor and made him into a slapstick joke I did not even want to see this movie. So when I say this was better than I thought I mean I thought this would be a -10/10 movie and be so horrible I would not be able to finish it without falling into a radioactive vodka-chamber. So the good news is that this is not THAT bad... The bad news is that this is still absolutely terrible.The good with this movie is that it expand the Marvel Universe somewhat, we get to see some new things, some new worlds, some new characters. The cinematography is pretty great and the CGi hold pretty good. I also think the Jane story was a lot better than anticipated and I almost did not hate her.The bad is everything else. The dialogue is atrocious, the attempt at humour is for children who has never seen a movie before, and the story is beyond contempt. This movie is also very short and it feels very rushed, very cut off like they wanted to make 40min more but did not have the budget or the studio hated it so they sliced of 5min here and there. And the acting... sorry but this is probably the worst acting I have seen in any Marvel movie. Every scene feels forced, and every actor look like they do to not want to be in this movie.Almost all the negatives I mention above I would blame on the director which leads me to my main complaint; the directing is absolutely horrible. This is badly put together, badly edited, too short, badly told and if actors that we know can put in a good performance do not that has to be blamed on the director.Everything else I mainly blame on the script. OMG this is so badly written, absolutely horrible. This movie is written by a 12yo blind and deaf fan of bad humour and then it has been added to by Darth Kennedy who was brought in to polish the script. Then directed by a childish man-baby lacking anything resembling an intellect.I give this 2/10. I do not think Superhero movies can get worse than this. This is on par with the worst of the genre and I cannot phantom who can honestly like this.","261 out of 519 found this helpful.

I knew I was in for some goofiness and I can swallow that from this director, but he flushed all his bathroom humor he could while still garnishing a PG-13 rating. Marvel films have been family friendly for the most part with battles earning the -13, but this is every bit for the sexual innuendos as it is for the violence.While that's a disappointment that's not the reason for the 3 stars I'm giving it.My level of disappointment was in the movie as a whole. This film serves no purpose other than to make Disney money and get Thor thin again. There was absolutely no character growth in this film. It was full of laughs and there's some very cool elements ""whosoever be worthy..."" is probably the pinnacle of enjoyment for me, but it falls flat against the movie as a whole. It's just empty and things in it that should wow us, like big name actors playing big name characters, leave you instead with greater disappointment.I took my 11 year old to see this and we talked about the adult themes that were unnecessarily thrown down our throats and why they were inappropriate and why his siblings will not be allowed to see it. These things serve no purpose but to bring raunchy humor into a useless comedy, that said, he loved it and had fun.It is fun and full of action, if stupid action flicks are your thing, then this is for you. If you're a Marvel fan and love the character and plot developments this is inline with Ironman 3 and (Indiana Jones 4) in that regard, the Marvel universe can exist without it, but even that movie has more heart and worth than this waste of time comedy.Save your money, tell Disney to get back to their story telling roots and make better films. This is a must miss. (I can't believe I'm saying this about a Marvel film, man I'm disappointed!)","18 out of 28 found this helpful.

With Bale being one of the best actors Marvel has ever had, he should of had a lot more scenes. Another great actor Russel Crow was a complete joke! Overall, the film felt rushed and there wasn't any character development. Can I also ask what is up with the CGI in marvel movies/shows lately. It's becoming soooo bad!

This isn't working! Write a script worthy of the actors who clearly did their job in preparation for this mess. All the blame for the much anticipated and highly hyped Thor: Love and Thunder lays at the feet of its director/writer Taika Waititi and I can't believe I had to write that. Often brilliant, all I could think of was why he didn't pass if he didn't want to make another Thor movie! I'm actually worried that someone will get the wrong impression that there isn't a story to tell about Thor when I'd pay to see this one again with a good script and with proper use of the available talent. These movies are made for young teens and enjoyed by adults and this turned me back into an early teen stomping my feet and yelling in my head at the screen for the lame jokes, the pitiful use of Russell Crowe, the tragedy of the lack of use of Christian Bale, (he finally has been given the right role to bother with a Marvel movie and you butcher his story?), the very indifferent story given to Natalie Portman to address the situation she is living in, and on and on. Why were The Guardians even there? Another complete waste! How do you manage to waste Chris Pratt and Brad Cooper too? Not to mention the star!! Hemsworth worked unbelievably hard to prepare for this movie and even he was wasted in this nothing burger, poorly conceived and genuinely indifferent direction with no story, certainly not one worth telling, of what could shoulda woulda been THE blockbuster of the summer! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN!! I'm very worried that the wrong people will get the idea that there isn't a Thor story left to tell when this actor, who has basically dedicated his career to playing him and cares every bit as much as Benedict Cumberbatch does about portraying Dr. Strange, won't get credit where it's due because so much trust was placed in the wrong director because he had a hit with Ragnerok. He keeps saying he didn't want to make it again when that's exactly what he did! This story called for a script that took the material seriously, including humour that hit the target instead of lame 6 year old jokes! And mostly it needed the time, that extra 40 minutes given to Dr. Strange, to fully give Gorr the time he needed to show us his rage and anguish becoming the God Butcher, there's never been an actor better qualified to play a character with the depth of this one (think Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, where was Christian Bale's chance to bring his incredible performance out of the shadow because he was robbed of story time?). And also time to truly let us feel that Natalie's Jane Foster was the love of Thor's life who this all powerful god could do nothing to save? Where was their moment? Honestly Mr. Waititi, I don't think you wanted to make another Thor movie period and you should have been big enough to pass on it or get help when you knew your script wasn't nearly enough to properly serve the characters in a movie that clearly WASN'T Ragnerok but an epic tale which you admittedly said you filled with every single suggestion received by 6 year olds. How could you? How do you sleep? You're the king of comedy in New Zealand but you're more than that, you can be overly silly but you're extremely intelligent and must have known this was headed off the rails early enough to save it from a near complete disaster! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???","26 out of 43 found this helpful.

But this movie fell flat. I liked about 40% of this film and mostly due to the cast. Everyone was superb it was the script and dialogue that killed it. Felt this movie was more suitable for Disney Plus release to be honest. Other reviewers said it best when they mentioned the movie was pure fluff, no substance. Jokes that weren't funny, storylines that were rushed...underused villain. I felt they did a disservice to Christian Bale who is always amazing in everything. He was a good villain but Loki remains my favorite. Natalie Portman was great, this was her best role in the Thor franchise yet. Dare I say, I think I liked Thor 2 better than this one.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Granted, it is a superhero movie but when you cast Christian Bale as the Vilain the movie can't be all fun. It was good but not as good as it's predecessor. Keep the silly but add a serious undertone and it would have been great. Add some more depth to Thor and it would have been great. A little more of the God Butcher's build up/journey would have been great.

While it is an entertaining movie, it may not be the best Thor movie or the best Marvel movie overall.The film has a more lighthearted and comedic tone compared to previous Thor movies. Some viewers may find it a bit childish and not as action-packed as they would like. Additionally, there are some cringe-worthy moments in the film that may be off-putting for some viewers.However, the movie does have its strengths. The performances from Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Natalie Portman are all excellent. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and the humor hits the mark more often than not.Ultimately, while Thor: Love and Thunder may not be the best Marvel movie, it is still an enjoyable and entertaining film. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe should definitely check it out at least once to see how it all unfolds.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The great costumes & effects stood out to me above all.While it was fun to watch, it felt like a very long ""what if"" episode or if the director was given a sandbox with toys and told ""go"", come up with something.Script and pacing were all over the place. So many of the moments and comedy were so forced, that they killed many of the scenes. While I don't mind the Thor films going with a more ""comedic"" tone or being self aware that it's not taking itself too serious - there was just too much. The characters, plot and story become a joke. I didn't feel for any of the characters at all because all the ""emotional"" moments were barraged with jokes every other second.Acting was great as usual and it was nice to see Thor's story arch come full circle to where the actor can potentially retire and the young avengers take over. The story itself was very underwhelming. It's the same message and story we've seen told hundreds of times before.A fun ride overall with some decent moments but far from the best.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor: Love and Thunder pushes that just a little too far. The movie is essentially Thor's story filtered through the perspective of beloved supporting character Korg, but this is the movie's flaw. No sincere moment is allowed to stand without being undercut by a quip, a sight gag, a silly interruption. There's no emotional solid ground, so you can never become fully invested in the story. The cast is great, the characters are interesting, the setting is compelling, the concepts are intriguing, but the story's unwillingness to allow a moment of seriousness makes even the funny parts less enjoyable. It's not a bad movie, I had fun while I was watching, but you can tell that it could have been much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Waititi goes all out to make an absurdist comedy here and inserts himself into the film way too much, not only co-starring but narrating the darn thing too. And a little of his trademark humour goes a long way, as it turns out. The storyline's okay, Hemsworth is very funny too, but Portman's return is mishandled and her character arc so serious to be completely at odds with the overwhelming goofiness elsewhere.

The guardians are somewhat wasted here, Jane's story is not good enough, and Christian Bale's character is boring and uninteresting as a villain. I really think this is one of the weakest MCU offerings. Probably on the same level as Thor The Dark World, which is unthinkable given how much bigger MCU has become since that movie came out, and that it has the same director as the excellent Thor Ragnarok. Eternals failed because it doesnt have interesting characters. This movie has familiar characters, but I think they are not utilised properly.

So did it live up to Ragnarok let's see.The cast is all around great and the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman is on full display. They really brought their relationship to life in this one and I feel they handled it much better then the first two Thor films. But I do feel that certain plot points involving their characters were rushed and didn't deliver the emotional punch the writers were looking for. Christian Bale is the standout for me (which is exactly what I expected), his performance as the gritty intimidating Gorr is amazing and why I wish we got more of it. The vast majority of Marvel films have the issue of not focusing on the villain enough and this film is no exception. Every scene involving Gorr is incredibly well done and if they were to have given me more of that it may have been the best MCU film but the constant shift in tone taints the overall quality.Every scene that didn't involve Gorr was very comedic and I felt that the comedy was not handled well for a number of reasons. First when you set up a movie with a villain as dark as Gorr, you need to keep the tone consistent and this film did no such thing. There were a lot of well written jokes but they didn't at all mix with the overall story. Gorr has one goal and that is to kill all the gods and he does some pretty messed up stuff to achieve this goal so to take that premise and intertwine it with a romantic comedy you get what is a very weird feeling movie.The visuals are across the board great and one fight sequence in particular may be one of my favourite from the MCU. The music is very on point throughout the entire film as they pair the awesome action sequences with amazing classic rock hits.Overall Thor: Love and Thunder is a good film. Thor and Jane finally receive their deserved development and Christian Bales Gorr is nothing short of menacing. But the lack of a consistent tone makes for a weird and at times frustrating watch that taints the overall quality of the film.7/10

Every scene with him is instantly better for his presence.2) Guns 'N Roses: The soundtrack is filled with GNR songs like Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and the perfectly timed use of November Rain's outro, that successfully gives me chills despite that the scene is literally a bunch of kids fighting monsters. Made the moment a thousand times cooler.3) Thor and Jane: I love the rekindling of Jane and Thor's relationship and the themes of love they carry, as well as loss.And the screaming goa-... No, the screaming goats definitely overstayed their welcome, haha.Overall, while this movie certainly does have problems, it is a really fun film and definitely isn't as bad as the reviews would have you think.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I had the complete review written and then it ... well it went away. So from the start - and probably a bit different than the other review I wrote. A bit like the Thor you get here. Taika reinvented him for Ragnarok - and he even went further with this installment.You have to dig what he does - and his humor too of course. I understand that some do not like the humor. You can't fault the movie technically speaking though. Ask (your) kids - maybe you got a bit weary, but they surely haven't. And the darkness that Christian Bale brings to his role (great as always of course), will not faze them either.Bale who gets introduced first in the movie. Might be a (new) trend for Marvel. Giving us the bad guy, before we see the good guy(s). Moon Knight did the same (Ms. Marvel did not of course), but let's keep an eye out for that.Bales character is not alone when he gets introduced. There is someone with him. And while you may want to forget about it. Bale will not let you. He will keep talking about that character - so much so, that you may get a bit annoyed. But there is a reason (or two, no pun intended) for that.Everyone except Bale can show off their silly side. Adding a bit of gravitas from time to time. But the darker tone and mood is kept for Bale and his character. He may not have much screentime, but the movie called Thor (whoever that might be - you probably have seen the trailer so you have an idea I reckon).But apart from reintroducing characters to us, the movie is also reintroducing the Thor (movie) mythology to us. So if you or the little one you are with or whoever have not seen the previous movies, you get a ""what happened"" at the beginning. Not everything will be rehashed. There is another flashback kept for later in the movie.This is the fourth Thor movie and aside of Hugf Jackman as Wolverine, no one has played a comic book character as long as Chris Hemsworth has. And the latter has gone through quite the transformations. I understand if you are not into the humor.I myself had an issue with another character (that you may already know is in the movie). The portrayal and the accent seemed weird to say the least. But even though I had my own preconceptions about that ... I'll call it character, I understand that Taika only wanted to do his thing. I did not know he was part of the Marvel comic book cannon to be honest, but I am not as involved in the comics as others are.So while there is not much story here (getting from point a to b and all that), there are a lot of cool set pieces. And a lot of weird (Taika) humor. Like him expanding the God universe if you want to call it that. Which is sort of the scene I was talking about above.It all makes sense in the end though and for me the balance between silly and drama did work. You have to suspend your disbelief, maybe drink a little bit of that kool aid and just go with the flow.I for my part am happy Thor is back. At the end of Avengers Endgame, no one seemed to know (apart from Kevin Feige probably), if any of the surviving (and available, no pun intended to the ""old"" man, who passed on ... well you know what) characters would return. So seeing Thor get into the Guardians of the Galaxy ship really made me hope he'd return. I thought it would be in a Guardians movie, but it's them who were in this ... at least for a little bit. A funny little bit that is.And then you have the end credits scenes. People should be aware of them, but still some get up and leave. As with most MCU movies (minus Endgame), you get some bonus and look into the future. One scene during the credits and one after ... both are promising and really great to say the least.So sit back, relax and let the (mostly) lightness wash over you ... it would be a shame if you couldn't. I just had to laugh, because there is a moment where Thor is naked. You don't see a front shot of that, but you do get to see his behind ... uncensored, if that means anything to you. It's another joke and it does work quite well too (no pun intended).Edit: almost completely forgot a few important things. One thing I am surprised by. Well the non reaction from people who are into religion (no matter what kind) that is. Because the movie essentially is critisizing almost everything about religion. It does make fun of Gods ... no pun intended. This is more than the silly depiction of Thor. This is kind of an atheist ... well heaven (another pun I know). It is underlying, but it is not subtle to be honest.And of course the music - Guns N Roses for the win as some might say. Music apparently played a big role during the making of the movie. And if you don't mind classic rock as I reckon people would call it now ... well you could do a lot worse.","25 out of 57 found this helpful.

Sometimes the humor is so dry it's painful, which of course means I couldn't stop laughing. Everyone talks about how wonderful Bale, Portman, and Thompson are and they are absolutely right, but Thor is still my favorite. Hemsworth nails the dramatic and the comedic in rapid fire. It's actually astounding that the movie can be so damn lighthearted and dry in its humor, often to the point of satire and even spoof, one minute and then switch gears and make your tear ducts activate the next. It shouldn't work, but for me it did. Again, this hits so many of the same beats as Ragnarok and Our Flag Means Death and Jojo Rabbit and Hunt for the Wilder People. If you loved those movies as much as I did, you won't be disappointed. Frankly though, if those movies weren't your cup of tea, then neither will this.","26 out of 60 found this helpful.

I no longer feel that exhilarating energy I felt before.Taika Waititi showed in ""Jojo Rabbit"" that he knows how to use humor as a tool for resilience when dealing with difficult and very sensitive topics. In this case, I believe that Marvel's heavy hand has destabilized the dosage.""It's not that he misses, it's that he doesn't get it right"" PERFECT DEFINITION 🌷Thor: Love and Thunder is better than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but not by much.""Just don't make mistakes who don't."" Very well said. I think the worst thing about people is always expecting the closest to perfection from others, when we ourselves don't even get 10% of what we really want.Marvel no longer cares about the quality of the movie itself. The content machine cannot stop. Connections to other movies, cross-references, Disney+ series hooks, and post-credits scenes. Everything seemed fine until Phase 3 of the MCU. In phase 4, which started with the Black Widow movie, everything went wrong. All movies are more concerned with taking the fan to the next movie. The biggest proof of this was Doctor Strange who managed to make a solo movie that doesn't develop character and that Wanda is practically the star of the movie.After Endgame the MCU became a Netflix! Quantity ALWAYS, quality ALMOST NEVER! If I hadn't liked Ragnarok, which the critics loved, imagine this one being massacred! It is a pity!Grade: 6.4/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

And this movie really assumes you must love Korg a whole lot because he has not one but three patronising narrations that open and close the movie and bring you up to date with what happened between here and Endgame, and I didn't like those scenes very much as they just didn't do it for me and felt like a lazy attempt to condense the story and get it moving faster, one would have worked at the beginning of the movie but it's overdone, and so is Korg grossly, I thought he worked much better in Ragnarok because he and the schtick approach was new and was done much better and just enough for it to not be to obnoxious in that movie, but here I felt sick of him within moments and he way overstayed his welcome and was just annoying as fk!! Urg it's like the movie was made for severely attention deficit people who can't sit still and take in a movie for like two minutes, it was terrified of slowing down even just a little and just letting the story breathe for a while, the rapid fire jokes were for me having a bad effect on the more serious aspects and the pathos, I thought it clashed horribly when it would go from her as the lady Thor to sick and dying in the hospital, you simply cannot plonk something as deadly serious as freaking cancer in a movie like this and expect it to work, it's like having Billy get a brain tumour in Gremlins 2! It felt like there was a really good movie in there somewhere, just between Thor Jane and Gorr but it didn't focus on that enough, I really didn't think Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth has any chemistry at all in the original movie but here I thought the opposite, they're a little older and things have changed a lot since that picture and she seemed more relaxed than before and I liked her as a warrior woman I thought it was cool, I was surprised by how she ended up at the end I thought it was surprisingly sad, don't worry about her coming back in any sequels folks! Christian Bale was surprisingly awesome and very creepy as the villain, I thought he came off as genuinely insane and lethal, I wanted more of him, he was probably the most threatening villain in a marvel movie yet. I also loved how his story ended as well, never expected to see one of the biggest cosmic entities of the Marvel universe in one of the movies, kudos to Taika for not having Eternity crack some goofy joke, although I'm sure it was severely tempting! There was definitely some awesome things in it, I loved the visuals and some of the huge locations, and the hall of the gods and the silly Zeus was where I thought the comedy did work really well and I liked that scene a lot with Thor declaring the gods cowardly and ticking off the most lazy Zeus ever, look forward to see where that leads in the future. I was overall slightly disappointed with this, it took what worked for Ragnarok and cranks it up to eleven and for some that might work but for me the comedy was mostly just annoying and obnoxious, frequently stopped the movie dead and prevented it from really ever taking off in a big way, this overstuffed cosmic mess of a film proves that Mr Waititi is capable of overestimating his strengths as a director and also that he could really do with learning a little restraint!

They are joined by King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Korg (Taika Waititi). Russell Crowe makes a memorable appearance as Zeus.This is trying very hard to be funny. Sometimes it is funny. Sometimes it's a little awkward. It's a little worst when compared to Ragnarok. I never bought into the Thor and Jane Foster romance. Basically, Jane turns into a girlie puddle in the presence of Chris Hemsworth's muscles. It's fine but it's no Romeo and Juliet. At least in this one, Natalie Portman has many dimensions to play. Her character has so much more. With more daring, this would be a two person journey. Thor could really dig into his relationship with Jane.

All that changed when Taika Waititi took over the director's chair for ""Thor: Ragnarok"". Full of bright colors, poignant humor, and a complete reinvention of the character, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is one of the most beloved stories in the MCU. Similarly, this film is bright, cheerful and flashy. It falls more in the comedy genre than action, which is both positive and distracting at times.The villain in this movie, Gorr the God Butcher, is one of the most fascinating antagonists in the MCU. His story is compelling and just looking at him will run chills down your spine. Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") nails his portrayal of the character and is one of the highlights of this movie.The film does a great job of recapping Thor's experience over the last decade and sets the stage without having to hop on Disney+ to watch the predecessors. The supporting characters are likable (especially Korg), the humor is exactly what you would expect from a Taika project and the runtime is well balanced.This is the first installment in the Thor franchise without his brother, Loki, and the absence is felt. Apart from Gorr, some of the new characters introduced were overly comedic and took away from the heart of the film. The second act was weak and focused more on setting up future installments than staying in the present.If you have seen the trailer, you know that the Guardians of the Galaxy are in this movie. Unfortunately, we will have to wait until ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" in 2023 to see them in action, because their screen time is extremely limited.There are moments with real character development and complex emotions, but those scenes are undermined by an onslaught of jokes. Personally, I love Taika Waititi's style and humor, but it might be too much for some viewers.""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a popcorn flick. It is upbeat, visually impressive and transports you to another universe. The humor might be a bit excessive, but it's a break from the traditional MCU mold. In my personal rankings, I have this movie just below ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" and above ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"". It's a solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a lighthearted theater experience.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I think the only way to watch it is to establish this is a parody (even if it isn't, just assume for your own sake it is) and just watch it, expecting nothing more than 2 hours of spoofs, silly jokes and other movie references. I am not going to rate it, because I would have to give it two rates: a proper Thor/Marvel movie - 2/10, a spoof/parody - 5.5/10 (had few laughs).To summarise - all the usual aspects of a film: acting, script, plot etc. Are on par with Marks brothers' movies. Humour is somwhere around Benny Hill and Mister Bean - you will get few laughs, but that is definitely a no-brainer.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This Thor movie felt more like an old Disney movie i saw when i were 9 years old (23 years ago). At this time i was tagged and liked the cool budget effects without noticing how poorly made they were. That's how it was in this Thor movie now 23 years later. There was no context and no serious mission either, I think this was one of the cheapest movies Marvel made and it's made for kids?. The movie felt like a parody of a real Thor movie but the bad thing is that Chris Hemsworth is parodying himself?

Thor's character has grown, and he's become a caricature of himself now, but what a character! He's lost his purpose and is finding his way! The unpredictability makes it all the more fun! The ensemble of supporting characters add to the fun as well.If you want a serious film, then don't sign up for this. It's supposed to be fun. I wanted fun. It was fun.

I can't say there was a part of Thor: Love & Thunder I didn't enjoy, but I also left the theater feeling unsatisfied. There were great parts! The space goats and Thor's jealous battle ax were highlights. There was a big fight scene with some of the best special effects in a Marvel movie to date. But the ending felt sudden and disappointed me, while the movie overall lacked something that made me connect and care about the plot.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Honestly, giving it a 6 even feels generous. This movie fails on so many accounts; pacing, story building, character development, and so on. Even with so many great tools at their disposal (high caliber actors, effects, director) they still managed to destroy whatever this movie could have been by speeding the plot along to try and meet a 2 hour run time. Christian as Gorr was completely wasted.. his presence in this story felt completely arbitrary, and disposable. The only exciting thing from a fan's perspective was the introduction to the cosmic abstracts, which i'm hoping will be further expanded in future movies.So my advice would be to come into this movie with low expectations, and hope it exceeds them. But in reality this movie ranks very very low within the MCU's body of work. It's definitely within the top 5 worst marvel movies, without a doubt. It seems i'm not alone in saying so either.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

By virtue of his design, Christian Bale's deliciously hammy performance, and the delicious shadows swirling around him, I couldn't keep my eyes off Gorr the God Butcher. I could listen to this villain talk for ages. He and his plot take our heroes to some of the most visually creative locations and set pieces we've seen in the MCU thus far. When set to the great Michael Giacchino's score and a perfectly-fitting hair metal soundtrack (lots of Guns 'n Roses with a dash of Dio), you're fully whisked into a world that could only happen in comic books. It's just a notch below Ragnarok due to the occasional leap in logic (one in particular towards the end comes out of the blue). However, this is for sure on par with Thor Odinson's best adventures. Taika Waititi was born to direct this lovable himbo space-Viking. I can't wait for the next classic-rock science-fantasy trip. If those end-credits teasers are any indication, there's plenty more to explore with the God of Thunder.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well Thor has sort of gone into semi-requirement and has a beer belly. But when he learns that a rogue god is on a mission to kill all the other gods, and gain immortality for himself, he gets re-energized and rounds up the band of superheros to fight to make things right.As you watch more and more of these they begin to seem all alike, until this one, which has much more fun with the topic. And the town of New Asgard with all the kids, incidentally played by many of the children of the main actors and the director.Not a memorable movie but my wife and I enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Whereas Ragnorak had a little bit of something for everyone, this movie clearly targeted a much younger audience. The film doesn't take itself seriously at all and the pacing is probably the fastest we've ever gotten out of the MCU. Whether or not this works for you or not is completely subjective. I would've preferred a more mature approach to Gorr and Jane but that just isn't what this movie was going for.

Unreined Waititi and
Jennifer Kaytin Robinson's high-stakes plot and drama is overshadowed by comedy and far removed from the feel of the Marvel Comics.There's a handfuls of humorous cameos including Matt Damon, Sam Neil, Melissa McCarthy, Luke Hemsworth and Russell Crowe along with the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy to name a few. Despite a great effects, soundtrack and score even with Christian Bale's solid performance trying to ground it and death themes throughout, Waititi's offering desperately falls short. Love and Thunder becomes almost a parody played for laughs, hints sarcasm, trading in adventure for book of shoehorned jokes.Overall, if you're completely checked out it could be a cheap blast, but it's a sobering reminder that character is everything and even with a solid director and big budget it's possible to still miss the mark.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was funny at random moments with a few unexpected celebrity cameo appearances, but the constantly comic approach was maintained at the expense of the convoluted Asgardian adventure storyline. It also meant sacrificing the heart that would have us empathize with the fate of the principal characters. Chris Hemsworth still plays the title role in the manner born - though the rest of the cast felt somewhat less committed to their roles, even Christian Bale as the malevolent evildoer and Natalie Portman returning in superhero form as Thor's love interest. The souped-up climax was such a textbook MCU exercise in eye-rolling excess that the ending was robbed of its innate poignance.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is a lame or boring scene for nearly every genuinely great one. There are things to love here. Crowe and Bale are very good, though the latter is somewhat unutilized. Portman and Hemsworth are okay, or even decent.However the most utilized side characters are horrible. They have nothing to do in the script, they are just there. Korg is so forced and shallow that his character singlehandedly ruins many otherwise decent scenes. He is just an idiot, and a tiresome one. He's been in like 3 movies by now and we don't know anything about him, except that he is dumb and overstays his welcome. Valkyrie, while a bit more interesting has also next to nothing to do here. They take way too many screen time from others who are more deserving.I get it, you need some funny sidekicks for these kind of movies but none of them is funny. Taking a couple of the Guardians of the Galaxy on the road would have been so much better, because they are actually good characters. Rocket and Groot worked so well with Thor in Infinity War, there was chemistry there. There is none with Korg and not much with Valkyrie. It is a huge missed opportunity to play around more with the cast of GotG and this God Butcher fella. Korg is also some kind of a narrator and it's just not working. The stories he narrates should have been explored and shown instead. Feels like both him and Valkyrie were there just for fulfilling a political agenda.On the other hand, Thor and Jane worked for me and they had some genuinely good moments. Some of them unusually real and deep for a Thor movie and I'd like to see more of these. Same goes for Gorr. The bad guy had a believeable motivation and all the main characters evolved a bit.The jokes and the dialogs are passable, the plot is decent and the action is mostly good. I would like to see a cut with much less Korg and Valkyrie and more Thor and Jane. And more Gorr and Zeus as well, of course. This multiple Thor thing is a bit silly but executed well and there's also a strong hint why it happens(though it can be missed easily).It's a fun movie with some parts on the more serious side. It's still the second best Thor installment for me and it could be on par with Ragnarök if the side characters wouldn't be a waste of space or outright annoyance. Goldblum, Hulk, Heimdall, Karl Urban and even Valkyrie were so much better in that one. That's the only difference for me, though it affects the movie substantially.This would be a slightly above avarage movie if not for some genuinely heartfelt and good scenes. Those make this a weak 7/10 for me. With better side characters this could have been on par with Ragnarök.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The screaming goats we thought was hilarious because she loves Taylor Swift and I showed her the old screaming goat meme tied to her, so we loved it, but certainly understand it wouldn't be for everyone.As a movie, if I'm turning into a critic, it's all over the place and mostly mindless. Christian Bale seems out of place as he played his role seriously and amazingly. Was disappointed in Zeus. I think Russell Crowe is a great actor and played the silliness that is this movie well, but he's far gone from his Gladiator days for sure. Zeus is supposed to be powerful and look as such, but Crowe is just a silly old fat guy. Again it does go with the movie to be fair, but I'd prefer this have been different personally.They shoved the gay stuff in your face a little, as is apparently now a rule for all movies to fight....whatever they're fighting, but considering other ways it's been done this wasn't terrible. I mean the guy is a collection of rocks after all so go for it I guess. Valkyrie was expected, and think she's that way in real life anyway, so again check the box Hollywood, bravo.Overall the movie is basically an action comedy, so expect that and it's plenty enjoyable if you're up for it. If you're expecting anything serious, Bale is great but that's really about it.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is unapologetically tongue in cheek while still packing in some solid emotional heft.It boasts a plot that crams in a lot yet never feels congested. The foundations and structure of the plot do follow the typical Marvel formula, but Taika's script and direction make this film feel nice and refreshing.Speaking of Taika's script it is very sharp and funny. Mix this with Hemsworth's comedic timing and delivery and you get a match made in heaven, so this is definitely the most I've laughed at a Marvel movie.Hemsworth really looked like he was having the time of his life playing Thor in this film which was so fun to watch. Natalie Portman back in the MCU and with such a badass role was brilliant to see.Bale played a pretty good villain, nothing outstanding but there was some decent development there and he brought a sufficient level of unhinged menace to the role.I will say the action was never particularly inspiring and I would have liked to seen more of Bale and have that role fleshed out a bit, but these criticisms are relatively minor and don't detract too much from the quality of the film, which for the most part is top notch.If you throw yourself into this film with reckless abandon and are happy to surrender to Taika Waititi's quirky and goofy humour then you will have a blast.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was pleasantly surprised and loved the humor. The movie is indeed irreverent and I agree that it is strange to see the irreverent humor laid across the more serious aspects of it. That said, humor is one of the ways we cope with tragedy. That's kind of its main purpose in our psyche.To me, this film kind of sits in the series like Moonraker does in the James Bond series. It doesn't really have a point and is panned almost universally, but if you switch your brain off and watch it for it just for fun, it's enjoyable (at least if you have an open sense of humor I guess). I can see how most MCU diehards will hate it, because it does not really advance any overall plot or develop the characters in a way that is meaningful to the overall universe.One strength of the film is that it continues the overall trend of Thor being the most tragic yet most developed of the major MCU characters. He has had to deal with the most loss and the biggest psychological challenges of the series as a whole. I think what he does here, given the new challenges he faces in that way, is a very good depiction of how we should try to live our lives. Thor has been through a lot, but he just keeps pushing forward, and I think that is a testament to his character and the portrayal, despite all of the other parts of his story and this film. Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson's roles fit into this perfectly, and they all look like they are having fun.I think the biggest problem here is not the film itself. It is that the MCU set such a high expectation for an overall storyline with the stones/Thanos, and doesn't really know what to do next. It has become a series of episodes that do not clearly link in the storyline. I think a lot of MCU fans are struggling with that, which makes sense given how tightly most of the series fit together previously. So again, you do have to just switch off a bit to really enjoy this, but for most people I think it will be enjoyable to do so, as long as you don't mind the screaming goats (which I found hilarious).","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was nice seeing these characters again and of course the new characters. Christian Bale was a highlight in the cast giving the best performance in the movie.The main issues with this film is that it's simply not funny, a comedy is supposed to of course be funny. Hearing the cinema audience laugh at every joke whilst I sat there in silence for the majority of the movie honestly made me feel like a paid audience was watching the movie because I can recall about a couplke ocasions I actually felt like laughing.And don't even get me started on those screaming goats, they were funny for the first time but with every appearance the joke became cheaper and ultimately become a nuisance. There are also some huge tonal issues in this movie which at this point are reflective of the MCU as a whole nowadays. There are few minutes on screen without a joke, again that would be fine if the comedy was top notch but here it really isn't. These childish jokes ruin otherwise serious moments and give the impression that everything in this movie is a joke. Thor Ragnarok did a great job of shifting it's comedic tone when necessary and overall gave a highly enjoyable viewing experience, I don't know what happened since then but my gosh did they not learn from the sucesses of the previous movie, instead they cheapened serious moments and turned everyone we loved into a joke. The film itself even made a joke about Thor's lacking character development as of recently. A self aware movie can be great but it really isn't so funny when a character becomes completely incompetent.Overall, as entertainment if you turn off your mind I'm sure you'll have a good time but by most other metrics this fell flat.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Movie Review -Marvel Studios' Thor: Love And Thunder, starring Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Russell Crowe, and Natalie Portman, introduces you to some new Superheroes, Gods and Villains. Some of them are too good even as newcomers, while some are too predictable as the old ones. From the trailer, you get the overall idea of the script, be it characters, suspense, or adventure, and the final outcome doesn't go beyond that, except for one thing. However, it makes sure to fulfil all the criteria of Marvel's Superhero Entertainer, which leaves you satisfied by the end. Love, Thunder, and Laughs: Thor's cosmic adventure ticks all three boxes, despite a few boring aspects. I wish Thunder was in the lead, though.Thor 4 starts off with an introduction scene of the antagonist, Gorr, who becomes the God Butcher after his God fails him. We get back to New Asgard, which is quite like a corporate city and visually lavish, where Korg (Taika Waititi) keeps telling the legends of Thor, aka God of Thunder. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) attempts to find inner peace after losing the love of his life (three times, OMG!), but must return to action to prevent Gorr from murdering the Gods. Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Korg join his army, and then appears Thor's ex-girlfriend Jane Foster ( Natalie Portman), aka Mighty Thor, with Thor's ex-weapon, Mjolnir, to support him, of course.Thor: Love And Thunder might just bore you with typical romance and illogical reconciliation (you might even end up asking why it was there if it wasn't supposed to make any sense, and you won't even get answers), but it covers the loss with explosive action and thrilling adventures. It's a topic of discussion why every superhero film should have a romantic angle to spoil the structure. Of course, not every superhero film can be intellectual like ""The Dark Knight"", and Marvel never wished to match Nolan's intelligence with their money-spinner entertainers. Yet we have that boring romance, parting and reconciliation just to look down and check if our popcorn is finished or not. Thor: Love And Thunder has many moments like this. It's unfathomable how Thor and Jane's love story was left incomplete before the mighty assembly of Avengers, and how it suddenly pops up in the post Thanos era. 8 years or something, as Thor says, who was counting anyway, and what was she doing in the meantime? One of the most pressing questions is why the Guardians of the Galaxy suddenly disappeared. Let's not expect any answers from Marvel.Coming to performances, Thor: Love and Thunder is blessed with Christian Bale's supremacy. He is truly deadly and dark as Gorr and makes you forget many former villains with his impeccable presence. Thor, aka Chris Hemsworth, gets back into his old shoes again and the size still fits him. Not just the physical transformation, but his verbal transformation also clicks well. This time he is more funny and child-friendly, that's some good change after ""The Dark World"" and ""Ragnarok"". Tessa Thompson and Taika Waititi have limited space but do well, whereas Natalie Portman is charming as Mighty Thor and damn boring as Jane Forster. I was expecting Russell Crowe to spread a surprise, but the screen time and role both came out quite underwhelming. Nevertheless, he has a surprise for you in the end credits scene that might just erase previous low grade marks.Marvel's cosmic adventure is visually splendid, and you don't expect anything less in this department, at least. But still, Thor: Love and Thunder goes beyond expectations to leave you in awe with some enchanting and colourful visuals. This may surprise you, but Thor: Love And Thunder also has some dark visuals, and they are unexpectedly awe-spiring. The background score and cinematography seemed okay, while the editing remained crispy most of the time. The tedious romance could have been trimmed a little and easily been replaced by action scenes or comedy to make it more engaging, but what's done is done now.Taika Waititi will be remembered for bringing a bewitching change to Thor's universe with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017). This man pulled Thor out of a dark and intense world and made him more funny and amusing with his commercial vision. With Thor: Love and Thunder, he continues the flow and keeps you smiling all the time. Taika has increased humour and children-oriented theories that should widen Thor's reach to different age groups. However, he fails to make a theoretical sense. But who cares about that when you are watching an MCU product? Chuck the brain, let the chicks and eyes enjoy the show. As a whole, Thor's cosmic adventure is as entertaining as you'd expect, with some new surprises in store.RATING - 6/10*","8 out of 33 found this helpful.

No it's not a masterpiece, and yes there were instances were the comedy was forced and not very funny, but there were also some very funny parts.And some of the serious moments like the Jane/Thor romance and Jane's illness. I found them to be touching.Jane's chronic illness in the film was something I didnt expect of Marvel, and I thought it was a good subject to show. People can't always be strong and be a heroes, people get sick sometimes and it's good to talk about (like Jane and Thor did).Also the part were Thor says something allong the lines: nobody knows for sure what tomorrow happens, its about living now. It hit pretty close to home, also because of having someone close to me with a chronic illnes. Thus I really appreciated this theme/part of the film.Good action, beautiful colors and CGI.The part with the children army of thor, yeah sure it was kinda funny and weird. But also endearing and I felt it had heart.What happens in the end of the conlusion, no spoilers, but I thought that was kinda meh.Not talking about the epilogue though, with Chris/Thor playing opposite of his Daughter India. Which was really cute and heartwarming.And India was just very cool in her role, and great and natural acting (looking seriously talented).And great chemistry with her dad (duh).And people linking this to narcissism of parents, just stop. Its worrying that you can find these things in something authentic and natural like this.*So all and all, I understand this movie wont touch and impress everyone, (for me it did do it) but what I think is certain, there is more than enough good things you can say about this movie.So people, stop whining so much. (And saying spiderman no way home is better than this, is ridiculous)Thank you!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Taika Waititi's funny sense of humour is prominent- playing Korg and he stars in it whilst also directing the movie!

Dr Strange 2 was the same - the mishmash of ideas basically cheapened the more emotional moments.

Literally, every character and plot device in the film is a joke. You have Chris Hemsworth who CRUSHED it as Thor in all the previous films and the story does not seem to remember any of the story lines or arches in the previous films with Thor. He does not go on a journey or evolve, instead it feels like a parody of the character. You have Oscar winner Natalie Portman coming back to play Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor with the comic story arch which should be a SOLID HOME RUN and the character is written as a joke, why? Last, the film has Oscar winner Christain Bale as the villain Gorr The God Butcher as he is barely in the film and like the other characters is written as a joke. It is one joke after another after another. I don't understand what the director was thinking. He has the budget, the characters, the talent in front and behind the camera and this is what was given? Taika (director) you are better than this!!!! Kevin Feige (President of MCU) where were you? How did you let this happen?? The film has its moments, but my God all the unfunny childish jokes take away from those moments. Also, MCU, Hollywood.. please stop saying you have LGBTQ+ characters if they are represented in 1 second moments that can easily be removed in other countries. This is not representation, it is baiting. I hope Thor stays around and goes under another director.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Side note it was very cute to see Chris Hemsworth's entire family (expect Liam) in this movie.For a film that takes place mostly on a green screen, the CGI isn't terrible and the makeup and hair is done well (except for Natalie Portman 's wigs...)

Taika Waititi is a good director at making serious theme matter with comedic acts to it. Even if act plays it off funny, the context is rather sad or depressed, which is why I like Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit. However, this movie did not land on its subject matter and takes jokes as the main focus. There are some enjoyable moments of the movie, but it sometimes felt forced and not engaging. Ragnarok, Infinity War, and Endgame was a great switch around for Thor, but this movie dumb down this character and now just embrace him as a joke. I seriously believe this is the movie that's going to hurt the MCU. It's an enjoyable film but nothing to experience again.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is no jeopardy in the film whatsoever.Considering that the Gorr the God Butcher run and the Jane Foster run are considered seminal in comicdom, this film has done more damage to Thor on and off screen than if it hadn't been made at all.Actually, the best thing about the film is the soundtrack. And they didn't even get that right with a handful of Guns and Roses songs and not even a mention of Lady Lightning by Bang Camaro. Probably because its on the Peacemaker soundtrack.Actually, go watch that instead.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

The franchise is clearly just churning out one-off films that don't amount to an overarching story with purpose the way that they used to.With that said, Thor Love and Thunder was fine. There were some funny moments, some good action (though not really enough in my opinion), the cast did well, and the cinematography matched the caliber of Ragnarok.Small spoiler, but I did expect the Guardians to play a bigger role in this movie. They were hardly in it at all. I felt the movie would have been strong individually as well as to the MCU if they were a bigger part of the story. It seemed like that's what was coming between Thor and the Guardians after Infinity War/Endgame but it totally fizzled out.Bottom line, you can watch this or skip it. It really doesn't matter, unfortunately.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now, yeah, V has kinda grown on me over the years and it's definitely no longer the worst one. But still, Thor: Love and Thunder is helluva lot better.In a rare occurrence, the Thor quadrilogy joins both the Spider-Man Home Movies and the Mission: Impossible franchise as the few series that gets progressively better with each chapter. About half-way through this, I thought I liked Ragnarok more. That all changed in the highly enjoyable final act.Thor is BACK, baby. Well, from his Dad-Bod ways and as he's helping out the happy underdogs across the universe, he discovers both Love and Thunderous rage from a God-Butcher. Pray Thor makes it out of this one.The funny thing about this movie that reunites Chris Hemsworth with Natalie Portman: I wasn't 100% looking forward to that reunion prior to starting this adventure-comedy. Truthfully, she is NOT one of my favorite actresses and I'll get right to the point: She practically steals Thor's Thunder throughout this film. She was spectacular and my favorite part of this movie. And this may be my favorite role for her.Now, that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chris Hemsworth - he was having a ball and it shows he really enjoys entertaining the masses as the title character. The rest of the cast was equally awesome, except, well, The Bland-Batman.I mean, Christian Bale as the Baddie. He was fine, but really uneven. He almost acted like the Joker/Riddler at some moments and then menacingly quiet and composed the next. And back and forth he went. Unfortunately, he was never likable enough to gain ANY sympathy from me - even though his character had well-defined motivation and depth.While this had a KILLER soundtrack, was absolutely hilarious and is technically better than Ragnarok, it's not by much and it's a perfect companion to that third one. Needless to say, if you loved Ragnarok, this will have the same impact for you. And you might as well forget those first two Thors. Just stick with the two best: Ragnarok & Love & Thunder.***Final Thoughts: I HATE that Marvel makes us stay through the credits. Literally, it's my least favorite part of the MCU. BUT, every once in a while, an MCU chapter will change my mind, albeit temporarily. You simply MUST stay through to the very last few seconds. I liked the first one pretty well and LOVED the last one.","15 out of 33 found this helpful.

It didn't do the best job at raising the stakes of the possible threat & the pacing doesnt really allow you to fully absorb everything happening. I feel like the antagonist should've been explored more in depth. Wish we could've gotten to see the death of more Gods & speak on have the antagonist speak on their intentions more. The fighting scenes also weren't anything new from Thor. I did however like the other ways that different powers were shown throughout the movie tho. Jane fosters Mighty Thor is actually one of the most refreshing aspects of the movie. Overall I have to say I enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok more than Thor: Love and Thunder. But this movie is still worth the watch.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Thor is still without a clear path or plan, but must take action to thwart the machinations of a madman (Bale, who deserves a lot more screentime) out to butcher all Gods. Thor also gets a blast from the past when he reunites with old flame Jane Foster--now bonded with his old companion Mjolnir. Even after three previous entries there's still a lot to work with here, but so many of the key characters are mishandled, the bulk of the comedic bits fall flat, and the ex-lovers chatter gets tired oh so quickly. After a promising opening the movie stumbles into tonal uncertainty as it veers between silliness and seriousness but never convincingly establishes what's at stake or manages to feel consequential. It's redeemed somewhat by the fantastic visuals and a third act that's pretty good, but the unevenness of the finished product and the limited use of so many great characters makes it curious as to what was left on the cutting room floor. **½","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, he did not expect that his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster had become Mighty Thor with his Mjolnir. Together with Valkyrie and Korg, they go on a cosmic journey to confront Gorr.Thor: Love and Thunder is the 4th film of Thor's journey in the MCU and is a large solo film series in the MCU. This film still seems to use the same formula from Ragnarok, starting in terms of comedy, colorful visuals and flexible acting. The film is set after the events of Endgame. However, it is really unfortunate. Despite thepost-Endgame story, there are many changes from Thor's character development in this film which is much looser and has a great sense of humor. This is a bit of a weakness of this film even though this film is quite entertaining. Too much comedy is brought and the humorous impression of Thor has an impact on the limited character development in this film. Starting from Gorr the God Butcher who should get a large portion as the main villain. Gorr's appearance here is quite extraordinary, but the lack of performance in the film does not give a scary impression in the movie and even sympathy for his motivation is not felt. Then Jane Foster's transformation into Mighty Thor is also a pity. Supposedly, we can see Jane's problem here which can be explored more deeply. Likewise with the presence of Zeus who actually makesadi boast in this film.Overall, the film performs entertainingly . It has a story premise that is less convincing even though it has brought Thor's biggest enemy. The conflict of the story is less deep. There are many conflicts that should be able to be explored far away. Many plot holes occur with the impression that everyone has understood the world of Thor. Both stories and conflicts are less capable of being densely constructed and fused. Love and Thunder became a rock n roll film for me with a memorable rendition of GnR's skirt music. A little disturbing part of the film, visuals from Axl or Astrid and annoying goat sounds.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The audience felt no connection to Jane Foster as she's been absent from almost every marvel movie thus far.

He doesn't quite manage to capture lightning in a bottle twice but he does deliver a perfectly acceptable blockbuster.In many ways Love and Thunder is one of the Marveliest of Marvel movies, something in bad guys past (admittedly something pretty terrible in this case) makes him go all genocidal and to complete his evilness he must find the magic macguffin while the heroes try to stop him via some snappy banter and middling action sequences. The film stands tall in that it has funnier humour than most of its stablemates and a villain that leaves their mark. You'd need to look far and wide to find an actor put in more work with so little time than Christian Bale as god shanker Gorr, elevating a character that could easily have been another Malekith the Accursed into one of the franchises most memorable villains.While Love and Thunder has no problem balancing its jovial tone with a menacing villain it is less successful at adding a stage four cancer story to the mix. The physical transformation in Natalie Portman's Jane from wasting away patient to shredded Mjolnir wielder is impressive and Portman looks like she is actually enjoying being in one of these for the first time but the story doesn't half bring an Asgardian size elaphant into the room. It's pretty hard to believe that in all his travels through the cosmos Thor hasn't been to one place he thinks might have a shot at curing cancer.A rather subdued film by Taika Waititi standards and there is no doubt the Marvel formula has been worn so thin its transparent but there is still fun to be had and Thor gets a satisfying end to his story.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I love how deeply Chris Hemsworth played a hurt character and how well he found purpose on life. But in most movies everything is exaggerated, even hopelessness.

The screenplay is a mess of contrived dialogue, nonsensical character motivations, and lazy storytelling. The movie attempts to be a comedy, but the jokes are forced and unfunny, falling flat at every turn. Even the action scenes, which are supposed to be the movie's saving grace, are poorly choreographed and unexciting.The performances of the cast are wasted in this movie, with even veteran actors like Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman unable to save it. Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor, which was previously a highlight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is reduced to a caricature of itself, with the character reduced to a bumbling, unfunny joke. Portman's Jane Foster, who was previously absent from the MCU, is given nothing to work with, reduced to a love interest and a plot device.The new characters introduced in the movie are poorly developed and forgettable. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, who was previously a promising character, is reduced to a one-dimensional stereotype, and her role in the movie feels tacked on and unnecessary. The villain played by Christian Bale is a paper-thin caricature, lacking any depth or nuance, he is set up as the big bad however is quite underwhelming despise the efforts of Bale.The movie's visual effects are unimpressive and feel like a step back from previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.The CGI is often poorly rendered, and the movie's use of practical effects is uninspired. The film's overall look and feel are underwhelming, lacking the epic scale and scope that fans have come to expect from Marvel movies.In conclusion, Thor: Love and Thunder is a terrible movie that squanders the potential of its talented cast and adds nothing to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie's poor writing, unfunny jokes, forgettable characters, and underwhelming visuals make it a complete waste of time and money. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be better off skipping this movie altogether and waiting for something better to come along.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

To make it worse, this broad, silly humor does battle against serious issues like cancer and child death.Parts of the movie work, like a child-army action scene in the last section, but attempting to make a movie that is as exciting as Black Panther, as funny as Blazing Saddles, and as touching as A Star is Born was doomed to fail.Director Waititi managed to pull off impressive tonal shifts in Jojo Rabbit so perhaps he thought he was up to creating this Turducken. But there was serious intent behind that movie and this is just a popcorn flick with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach.Still, it's got some good action, Natalie Portman manages to pull off the combo of pathos and badassery Waititi so desperately wanted, Russell Crowe is genuinely funny (who knew), and if you like superhero movies you might as well go ahead and watch it. Just don't expect too much.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is anything but that.I also want to point out the CGI. This movie has some of the worst effects I've seen in a high budget movie in a while. We're talking PS2 level graphics here. They are laughably bad, especially for a company with as much technology and money as Disney.This movie was a good display of the direction that Marvel is going. Rushed, cheap, poorly made movies with a bad plot and unlikable characters, put out as quickly as possible to continue generating as much revenue as possible.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

All those CGI fights bore me very quickly and the movies often take themselves much too seriously, IMO. All respect to those who are into the franchise, but it's not for me. My taste runs more to LOTR, and much of the Star Wars series, even Harry Potter.I have followed the Thor movies within the Marvel franchise, after very much liking the first one. My expectations for this, the fourth Thor movie were low. What else is there to say on the subject?Basically, the movie blew me away. Everything worked for me. The movie brought back the feeling I had as a kid in reading Marvel comic books, many long years ago. Too fantastical, even nonsensical, to be real, but inviting at the same time. I really like that the director went camp with this one. Well, mostly camp. Because, there's also: cancer, basic existential questions and Gorr to balance off the levity.I'm still wondering why this worked, because the tone of the serious scenes was so different from most of the movie. But life is like that isn't it? Light moments, levity, and then cancer, death, and those existential questions about the life we're living. So maybe those shifts aren't unrealistic after all.The various elements of the movie were all at a very high standard. Loved the colour and the sets. The cast was sterling, especially Christian Bale. And Guns 'n Roses' music fit exceptionally well. This could well be one of the movies that becomes a favourite for me. The ones that I've seen 5 or more times; there aren't all that many. But first I'll see how viewing number 2 goes, and that will be soon.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

I have been finding the MCU pretty stale recently but this film really did it for me. Super funny with classic Waititi kiwi humour. I get that his comedy isn't for everyone so if you do find his jokes unfunny, you'll probably not have such a great time with this since its very reliant on its comedy. Me personally, that's what I came for and that's what I got.I also really like what they did with the characters of Gorr, Thor and Jane. I wasn't so much a fan of Jane before this film but her characterization made me love her this time around.Visuals, and performances were great as is usual with marvel. You're in for a treat with the fight sequences, which are shot and choreographed fantastically.The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because I think some romantic/emotional moments needed some time to breath and the beginning was really fast paced which is okay but it skimmed over some stuff. I would've like to see a touch more of the guardians, but that didn't really hinder my overall enjoyment of the film very much. A couple nit picks and plot holes too that I can't explain without keeping this review spoiler free.I don't suggest going into this film expecting a standard MCU film because that is not what you're going to get. Its fun, its fresh, its hilarious and it was the best cinema experience I've had in quite some time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

After the 3rd movie,Thor became ""Bambili"". Visually it was a great movie, the script and the dialogues trying to be funny were bad. Gorr was great, his motivation was great too. Christan Bale gave a great performance. The first half of the movie tries to be funny, it's ridiculous, it's bad, but I like the the second half. I only laughed at a few scenes. Overall I didn't like the movie. The goats were not funny at all, they were constantly shouting. Is this funny? Yes, it was at first scene but unnecessary to show it 145 times. It's like a parody movie. And this scene... Korg. Didn't he have a mother in the previous movie? Does he have 2 fathers now ? What and Why ? What are you trying to do ? Somebody force you for this ? Come on. . .Anyway, Christan Bale was perfect.The movie was kind of enjoyable but not good movie.By the way Natalie was ok.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

The characters, plot and action all made the fantasy seem real. No opportunity for this to happen in this latest Thor installment. The numerous interjections of attempted comedy only succeeds in snapping the audience out of the fantasy world that they planned to be a part of.Thor is one of the favorites of the MCU.

First of all I just want to say that Thor Love & Thunder is the first ever comic book film I watched where there felt like there was nearly zero at stake. The tone of the movie is just so all over the place, the dialogue was something that my 8 year old nephew could come up with, the story seemed good on paper but was not executed well and that could be because there might be a lot of things removed, the pacing just made me feel like I was watching this for almost three hours when in all reality it was among one of the shortest of the Marvel films. Wrap up all of these issues into one big bow and you got a product that feels like actually two separate films in one movie. I briefly scrolled through some of the other reviews on here and saw plenty of complaints this time around on Thor's personality, and how he's just in a full on idiotic form. In recent years, I have been feeling very strongly about this matter and it is in full effect within Love and Thunder to the point that it is blatantly obvious. As someone who did not care for Ragnarok I was not expecting a majority the humor to resonate well with me, I wont lie and say it was totally and purely awful, I think Waititi definitely nails the Guardians of the galaxy's humor well, not as much the Thor humor though. I didn't find most of the jokes in the movie funny and I think its safe to say that it appeared that my screening did not find most of the jokes funny either between the friend I attended with actually expressing to me he felt like he was almost ""forced to laugh"" at many of the jokes and the lack of the audience expressing a sign of laughter on most of the jokes. As it is, for whatever reason it may be, the runtime was restrictive enough as it was in a movie with a lot to accomplish, If only more time was focused on developing certain plot points, relationships, characters (especially Gorr the not-so-God butcher), and adding necessary details instead of focusing what joke they could nail next, I believe the impact that the audience was supposed to feel walking out at the end would have been greater, made more sense, and maybe even I would have liked it more.","105 out of 209 found this helpful.

It did have some decent battles showcasing the mighty Thor's hammer.It's too loose to be a staple film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Just as the movie Poster suggests, a lot is going on in this film., from the revival of Thor's love interest with Jane to The Guardians of the Galaxy making a non-encapsulating cameo, screaming goats, the gods, and the Gorr( the antagonist). Additionally, I'm still trying to figure out how Jane became ""a Thor"" I know she may be a chosen one or worth but turning into Thor is pretty wild.Ragnarok is still the best Thor movie in the series.Thor: Love and Thunder feels like a filler episode of your favorite anime. You will gain some pleasant moments from the movie, yet you won't be exclaiming to everyone that this is a must-watch! The first after-credit scene makes me hopeful for a fantastic sequel to this film.With that being said, Entertainmentsparadise rates Thor Love and Thunder a 6/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thor has more fun and unrealistic character in comparison with comics. I was complaining about the Thor movies until this. There were a lot of unnecessary jokes in movies. However, in Love and Thunder, jokes and other adventure emotions are balanced well.About acting, Christian Bale shows us his quality again. His story, aim and emotions displayed well. We can understand his mentality in movie. Same situation is also for Lady Thor.Action scenes are enough for me and Thor's emotions, his journey on finding himselves displayed well.On the other hand, scenario has some mistakes according to other movies. Additionally, I learned that movie was almost 4 hours in origanlly but it cut almost 2 hours from the movie and we can understand this in movie. In my opinion, these interferences affect movies in bad way.Finally, Love and Thunder is my best Thor movie. However, MCU should work on their cinetographies. They have money and experience for it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just been to see Marvel Studios Thor Love and Thunder at the ODEON Cinemas in Mansfield IMAX screening. Absolutely loved it one of the best Marvel Studio movies ever, well I say that every time but it is. A very eventful roller-coaster ride I loved every minute to ever second of it. Tons of laughter with Thor's goats ""AHHH"", Chris Hemsworth is so funny as Thor best guy to play the character and Taika Waititi as Korg brilliant an absolutely hilarious character so funny every thing he saids. The whole writing and production to the actors and actresses, and the director Taika Waititi so funny he knows how to get a lot of comedy in a action packed adventurous film buff especially a marvel film love him. Ever song fitted perfectly with ever fight scene best music ever they defo know how to pick the perfect songs the music department brilliant. Thor: love and Thunder is a serviceable entertainment that coasts off a game cast who could've done more. I don't agree what other critics and reviewers are saying that it's got a lot of resemblance to Thor: Ragnarok. The most humorous characters in the film were Thor Goats and where many jokes land and many do not amongst the triumphs it's a proper comedy detour to the home of the gods Omnipotent City. It's has the one of the best marvel villains and the most scariest Marvel Studios villains ever 'Gorr the God Butcher' (Christian Bale). All the CGI was spot on from the villains goons zombie like shadow creatures to the home of the gods to the really good part the shadow realm when it goes like (Monochrome) brilliant. Absolutely loved the ending tho not saying anymore but say to the end as always 2 credit scenes one post credits and after credit scene. My verdict Thor: Love and Thunder is more Waititi than Ragnarok. It's had a very good strong opening to the middle then to the end brilliant, and it's smooth and colourful to the very end and I loved how they kept true the the comics with one particular storyline for one of the characters of you don't know then go and watch the film now if from uk and in cinemas around the world July 8th.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Taika Waititi's background as a painter can be seen throughout the film, through the use of a vibrant color scheme and specific tint isolation. This is incredibly aesthetically pleasing and, quite frankly, nothing that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has shown us before. Matched with a rocking soundtrack -- Appetite for Destruction from Guns N' Roses, Thor: Love and Thunder is quite literally an ""appetite for destruction.""Thor: Love and Thunder picks up after the events of Avengers: Endgame. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still tagging along as one of the Guardians of the Galaxy. After all his paths have been severed from his battles with Thanos, he finds himself without a pathway. In all of his thousands of years of living, this has never been a concept that Thor has had to tackle. This puts him on a journey of self-exploration. Although, obviously in the Marvel Universe, that can only last so long when the new villain Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) comes to town. Gorr vows that ""all gods will die."" Thor recruits the help of his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who seemingly became a Thor herself. These two learn to work together to defeat Gorr and how to navigate the world while rekindling their old relationship.Thor: Love and Thunder emphasizes the idea of ""love"" in the title because that's how audiences will feel about the film's color variations and banging soundtrack. Christian Bale completely steals the entire show as Gorr the God Butcher. In every scene he is in, your eyes are glued to his worldly-like presence on the screen. Although he is terrifying, the audience will not be able to get enough of him. Christian Bale finds a way to make this a Christian Bale film and not a Chris Hemsworth film. As much as Gorr the God Butcher's storyline is golden, which is ironic given his black and white color scheme, other branches of the film feel unnecessary. During the film, certain plot points are used that feel somewhat like a cheap excuse to move the story forward. The characters spend a solid 30 minutes exploring something new, yet later we learn that it has no overall impact or relevance to the story. Part of the film is wasted on the focus of Zeus. It may be comedic and light-hearted in the moment, yet it almost feels like it is only introduced to help set up future Marvel projects, rather than focus on the film we are currently watching.If the title doesn't make it obvious, the film deals with the theme of love persevering and expresses the concept that relationships aren't forever, but the love behind them is eternal. Following previous Marvel content Thor: Love and Thunder continues the trend of pushing PG-13 boundaries and getting darker. When I say that Christian Bale is incredibly terrifying, that is really true. Marvel does not hold back on his character, especially when a large part of his role is about abducting children. Given that, plus the barrel of intense action throughout the film, this film is not to be taken lightly.I give Thor: Love and Thunder 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. You can find Thor: Love and Thunder raining its way into theatres on July 8, 2022. So make sure to check it out!By Jude A., KIDS FIRST!","18 out of 44 found this helpful.

Think the last 2 movies including Dr Strange MOM has the same issue. These are movies that are created by their director to be completely 100% stand alone. Phase 4 of the MCU doesnt feel like the start of something new like phase 1 did.Will say that Hemsworth and Bale are still and always be the standout actors for the film. Its still so surprising that he has such perfect comedic timing, downside is that the script went 1 step to far in making Thor an Idiot. His whole arc from Thor 1 to Endgame that he went from the arrogant god to caring about everything and everyone, not letting collateral damage come to the forefront but within minutes of movie starting this has just been reverted. Bale as Gorr was great but earning the title of the God Butcher was a step to far, seems as though this was a Mordo set up from Doctor Strange level threat than actually the epic level threat. Only seeing the first god actually killed on screen was a disappointment. Thinking that Russel Crowe being signed on for 1 movie i hoped he might have been the shock that earnt him the title. Side note Russel Crowe as the campest version of Zeus ever was a great edition to the movie.Thinking this is where the movie falls down, the comedy in Thor: Ragnarok was perfection and trying to capture lighting twice doesnt always work out. There were some standout laugh out loud moment... Korg but there was a lot of jokes that didnt land. Either cringe or taking away from the story. This could have been a 2 part story which would have been even better. So much of the story was rushed, Janes redemption but also demise was so quick for such a poignant story line from the comics. Then the Goats, it was funny for the first 3 times then they needed to shut up!Im not going to say that i didnt enjoy the movie but i think i've fallen into the trap of overthinking what could be shown in the movie and ultimately being slightly disappointed. I'd love for the team to return to do the next movie and just hit the heights that Ragnarok did.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Knowing this had the same director & having watched all the trailers, my expectations were low...though as a huge Christian Bale fan & a Marvel fan I felt the need to at least watch it once. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how the tone of this film seemed to be a happy medium between original 2 & Ragnarok. It worked! It's not an excellent superhero film, and certain elements were underutilized, but it was enjoyable! Seeing Jane weld the hammer was so great - I'm glad Natalie made a return! And for the record, the MCU doesn't deserve the brilliant actor that is Christian Bale. He absolutely nailed this role soooo well, but his performance almost seemed too good for this film. All in all worth watching & after some solid Marvel duds we've been given lately...this was a welcome relief.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The differences are jarring.The movie is also too long. Not long for a Marvel movie but could still stand to shave of 15-30 minutes. That's how much time is spent on wasteful things.I wasn't crazy about the last Doctor Strange and I'm not crazy about this film. It seems the MCU is going down but what can we expect?

Chris Hemsworth is as good as ever, Natalie Portman is really fun, Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie entertainingly, and Taika as Korg has quite a few laughs but ultimately was just too many for me. The standout of the film is easily Christian Bale. He stole every scene he was in and I wish he was in the movie more! He's really not though.

The movie was fine, but i saw so many lost opportunities. The history line was great and there were some amazing actors that could have made the movie so much greater. It was really a lost opportunity in so many directions. Christian Bale is a great actor and one thing that I liked, was that only his character brought ''realness"" to the movie. It was only where he was part of the scenes where u really could not take the eyes of the movie. His character really was made out of a good reason and it lives space to think. On the other hand Nataly Portman as Jean Foster was a great fit and she portrayed so well the character. But the downfall of the movie and what needs to be fixed in the next ones was the parody. There is nothing wrong when fun moments are added during the movie, in my opinion is better because it gets your attention but should not be overdone. From the beginning to the end it seemed more like a parody and not in a good way. Was totally disappointed in this direction. There were of course really funny moments but mostly is was over exaggerated. So many important and powerful scenes where wasted and were turned into jokes. It made the move feel very very commercial. Like a strategy only to attract the audience and taking it further away from being a good movie. It seemed in many moments like I was seeing Deadpool (but not in a good way). Deadpool was a successful movie of course but this doesn't mean that you have to turn every marvel movie into a parody. It looses its meaning. Thor is not a parody movie and please keep this in mind in the other ones. Was really excited to see it, but when I left the cinema I was totally disappointed. It really looks like the only intention was to win money and the content was not important turning it 100% into a commercial movie. Incredible cast but so purely guided.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Love and Thunder still looks good, it has the same kind of visual sensibility that helped Ragnarok stand out from the pack. The fight in the shadow realm has some nice cinematography and choreography with the action. Jane's return is also intriguing from moment one, I can't go far into spoiler territory but they do find a new angle on it to make Jane as Thor unstoppable yet vulnerable at the same time. The rest of the plot isn't as unique or fresh but the creative team handled her character's return with a lot of tact.Writer/Director Taika Waititi brought the Thor movies back into the limelight with Ragnarok and a lot of the legwork was done through putting the focus on the comedy. It kept things breezy and Hemsworth can pull it off so Ragnarok avoided getting bogged down in the drama like The Dark World did. That mindset is present here, but it's regrettable that most of the comedic bits in Love and Thunder just aren't funny. Do you remember the screaming goat video? Hope you found that funny and get ready for that joke 10-20 times. Think Thor getting jealous over Mjolnir being reformed and ignoring Stormbreaker isn't awkward? It's actually hilarious....right? Humour is subjective but I can't remember the last time I saw a comedy in theatres where there was such a low hit rate with the jokes. Love and Thunder feels like it's trying too hard to replicate the spontaneity and surprise that Ragnarok had up its sleeve to diminishing returns.The MCU has larger names but I'm of the mindset that Chris Hemsworth is one of the more underrated actors in their stable. He's got all the physicality, he's capable of running the emotional gauntlet and he's really funny when given the opportunity. Love and Thunder gives him the chance to reunite with Portman and he's absolutely game, he smashes the bad guys and tells the jokes as required. It was nice to see Natalie back too, her departure from the franchise was very unceremonious and she's given more to do in Love and Thunder. She's a good addition to Thor 4 and her character felt like the most original part of the movie. Tessa Thompson is still doing her thing as Valkyrie, she's still got great chemistry with Hemsworth and while she's given less to do than you realize, she holds up her end of the bargain. Ditto for Christian Bale who gets a chance to be more hammy here and there but other than the opening couple of scenes, he's left playing the same couple of notes on the piano for the rest of the movie. He's a great actor and I thought he deserved more to do just like Thompson did. The Guardians are in and out of this movie so quickly, they're respectively fine in their bit. Casting Russell Crowe as Zeus was a nice twist and while he's clearly having fun, I thought the bit went on too long.As much as Waititi re-energized the franchise with Ragnarok, the end result with Love and Thunder just isn't at the same level. I had heard going in that the critics were nitpicking and that Waititi was making such weird and refreshing choices with the material. When the credits rolled I was just confused. What was so daring or different in this movie? There are macro plot beats (Jane's return, the city of the gods maybe?) that go a different way but the movie recycles a similar aesthetic, presents us with a largely two dimensional villain and it's the same old search for the Macguffin. To my surprise and while I think Taika is capable of incredible work (Jojo Rabbit was a huge surprise for me), this is just a lacklustre script and the film presents itself as more quirky and edgy than it actually is.If you had told me at the start of the summer that I was going to like Madness of the Multiverse better than Love and Thunder, I don't know if I would have believed you. Maybe expectations were too high but I feel like Waititi and his team just couldn't capture the same magic twice and what we were left with here was a decent looking and passable effort that was underwhelming overall. Most of the comedy falls flat and the story failed to keep me interested. As much as I enjoy Hemsworth as this character, unless we're partying with the rest of the Avengers, I'm not sure if we need another Thor solo adventure. Maybe we've had our fill of Thor beating people up with G&R playing in the background?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Previous Thor movies where never too serious and already had plenty of humor. Making a parody of a character like this just feels fake and turned the whole movie into a somewhat childish joke. The relationship between Thor and jane is very different from previous movies and I should probably tell you the director has taken a lot of artistic liberties with their back story. Thor is turned into a goofy Homer Simpson-type of loveable Idiot and the entire first half of the movie feels very empty. Some parts do get a good laugh but for me the whole movie was far too silly and childish.Positives: Christian bale makes great villain and the visuals are great (even by marvel standards).Not for serious fans.

There is a slight but constant, drop in quality. Judging from the other new movies' reputation, it's safe to say that they failed hard to keep up with Phase 2 and 3.It's better than BLACK WIDOW and ETERNALS. If you lower your expectations, you will enjoy it. Yes, jokes are forced and THOR: RAGNAROK seems like comedy gold, a G. O. A. T in comparison. There is a lot of mediocrity here. Maybe this movie targets very young audiences, i mean, if i was 10 years old, i would probably love it. It's too naive and silly.However, there are some positives. As many people have mentioned, Bale is great. Portman is a very good actress too, and she doesn't disappoint. Russel Crow was funnier than i expected. I found these goats very funny too and Korg was a likeable character. Hemsworth is always a charismatic presence. Furthermore, i got used to this movie naiveness and i liked a lot the final ""battle"". Guns n roses were a perfect choice, as a 90's kid, their music always brings me joy. Finally, there were some lines that made me laugh. (Jarnbjorn vs mjolnir, etc).So, lower your expectations, forget previous phases' existence, and you will probably enjoy it. Still, this Phase failed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He was fantastic, adding much needed depth and acting quality to the show.Chris Hemsworth was his standard self and it was nice to have Portman back but she felt like the character misfit the movie.The action sequences and special effects are good enough but they are monotonous and too much of a crutch for the plot (as will ALL superhero films at the moment).Love etc rebuilds a little of the magic of Thor but has a long way too go to return it to its lofty origins :)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The visuals of this film are some of the best, you have these beautiful bursts of colour throughout, contrasted by this somehow bright black and white tone In the alternate realm. Thor continues to experience a roller coaster of emotion, and has surprising, yet satisfying arc. Natalie Portman was a surprise, she delivered a decent performance, showing two sides of the same coin. The overall storyline was satisfying, there are moments I wish had happened, but it's not a deal breaker. The highlight for me was Russell Crow as Zeus, it feels closer to what Zeus was probably like compared to other depictions. Highly recommend seeing this film, it's not about fan service, it delivers an enjoyable and comedic experience, whilst adding a sense of horror, not as extreme as Multiverse of Madness.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The action scenes are thrilling and inventive, especially when Thor and Jane team up to unleash their powers. The film also has plenty of humor, thanks to Waititi's quirky style and Hemsworth's comedic timing. The supporting cast is also great, with Bale delivering a menacing performance as Gorr and Portman proving her worth as a superhero.However, the film also suffers from some flaws that prevent it from reaching its full potential. The tone is inconsistent, shifting from silly jokes to serious drama without much balance. The plot is convoluted and overstuffed with subplots and cameos that distract from the main story. The character development is weak, especially for Jane, who becomes Thor's equal without much explanation or struggle. The film also relies too much on nostalgia and references to previous MCU films, which may alienate some viewers who are not familiar with them.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is a fun but flawed adventure that offers some laughs and spectacle but lacks depth and originality. It is not as fresh or satisfying as Ragnarok , but it has fun moments that will please fans of the franchise.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thor (3) Ragnarok was great, they hit the sweet spot with action and comedy and adventure, from me 8/10. Thor (4): Love and Thunder, in my opinion 6/10. That's because it got a bit too silly by having too many silly moments, a bit too long of silliness, a bit too far with silliness, but jokes were not bad.

This falls short of the mark. The humour isn't the same, although the goat's did bring a few chuckles. Valkyrie was more an under-used sidekick whose humour didn't land, but Christian Bale as Gorr was the standout performance, but with little screen time.It also felt like a tribute to Guns N Roses, as FOUR songs were used, three of them in a row.Not quite sure where this new phase in the MCU is heading, as nothing has been the same since Endgame.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Here is one of the instances where I'd just like to say something I saw on YouTube that I really agree with. Never mind the critics. This is a fun, enjoyable Phase 4 film that perfectly balances (a lot) of humour with some really dark undertones and upsetting scenes. I'm trying hard to keep this spoiler free, but some scenes are just so powerful (especially nearer the end) and Christian Bale was just.... incredible. Who cares about the character design? It's not even that bad! He was menacing, ruthless, but not evil enough to be irredeemable. Chris Hemsworth was amazing as usual, and Natalie Portman played her role SO WELL. So on this one I say don't scroll to any more reviews and watch the film without being a hardcore film critic and criticising everything, And enjoy the film for what it is. If I could I would rate this 8.5/10 but I will round down because 9 is VERY high, and reserved for films like Endgame. Stay for both post credit scenes! There are 2!This is a great movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A good enemy whose motivation one can understand.Thor has never really been anything to me, but I can easily see the qualities in the film.

It had a clear storyline, great special effects, a great cast all around with a fine pick for the lead role (Chris Hemsworth), a stirring musical score, and a director (Kenneth Branagh) who knew how to lean right in to the mythical grandeur of the Norse gods. Yes, those were the days. Now in this fourth Thor film where are we? Norse god? No, a 'space Viking'. Serious warrior? More of a lovable doofus with muscles and a magical axe. It's all very entertaining and easy to watch -- things never drag, and visually, Love and Thunder is as striking as almost any thing Marvel has come up with. The Shadow Worls, the Hall of the Omnipotents, and the mysterious Eternity are terrifically well done things to look at. Also, for a cast that includes Natalie Portman and Christian Bale (and an over-the-top Russell Crowe cameo) how can you go wrong?So I enjoyed it. Go see it, you'll have a good time. But I also came away thinking that underneath the hood, this movie is fighting with itself, and for that I look right at director Taika Waititi. This thing can't decide what it wants to be. There's a lot of straight-on situational and romantic light comedy, which is fine, but the deep problem with that is that when things suddenly NEED to get serious (as they almost always should in superhero films; after all, the word 'super' is there for a reason, and saving the world/universe goes with the territory), it's hard to be convincing about the necessary shift in tone.Look at the other 'best' superhero films of recent years: the first Iron Man (2008). X-Men 2 (2003) and Days of Future Past (2014). Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man No Way Home (2021). Wonder Woman (2017). The first Avengers (2012) and of course the big Infinity War/Endgame pair. What do these have in common? Yes, they have great characters and production values, but the ultimate key is that all of these films take themselves seriously, and that's how to make a fantasy world work. They lay out a storyline where the stakes are high, and then go at it straight on. If the movie can't even suspend its own disbelief while it's rolling then how can the audience do it? Waititi seems to want to have it both ways, or all ways, at once. Are we watching a sendup of superhero films or the real thing? I had the same issues with his Jojo Rabbit (2019), which was brilliant in certain ways but a chaotic mishmash of tone. It was less than the sum of its parts.Just to get the rest of my complaints out of the way, the first half-hour felt quite odd; the actors were delivering their lines in a quippy, offhand way as if they were in an episode of Seinfeld or Friends or whatever the recent equivalents are. And I was looking forward to seeing more of the lovable Korg and his off-center dialog that was such a fun part of Ragnarok, but it just fell flat this time. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was sadly underused and it looked almost as if she wished she was somewhere else.By this point, the Marvel film universe has almost completely disconnected from its original comics source material. (Case in point: it was very cool to see Eternity introduced as one of the Ultimate Powers of the universe -- he's rendered extremely well, just like the first appearance in the Doctor Strange comics. But he seems to be used as something like a wishing well, which is pretty trivial. Really, guys?) Right now it feels as if they are making up stuff as they go along, and interestingly, they are starting to run into the same storytelling complexity problems that the superhero comics have had for decades: continuity and retconning. If there's a Grand Plan for Phase 4 and 5 it's sure hard to see what it is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Taika Waititi's humor, although not consistently hitting the mark, brought a light and entertaining tone to the MCU. The characters, especially Thor, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Jane Foster, and Korg, showcased undeniable charisma, contributing to the film's appeal. Skillful editing kept the pace smooth, allowing me to lose track of time, and the narrative arc around Jane Foster added a compelling emotional dimension.On the flip side, the plot felt somewhat formulaic, lacking the innovation of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and unfolding predictably. There was a noticeable missed opportunity in exploring more depth in the main storyline and secondary characters like Almighty Thor. While Christian Bale's performance as Gorr was commendable, the character's writing fell short, preventing Gorr from becoming the formidable Marvel villain he could have been.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The element of drama was effective in the story, as the film revolves around the character of Thor completely this time, Thor is the most person who has loved people taken from him in MCU so far, starting with his mother, then Auden, then his homeland, Asgard, then Loki several times, and with this film it took more from him than before, all of this and still takes from him more at the end of the successive tragedies until the All Father character is formed and enters the MCU.With that being said, now come to the negative points of the movie. Some of the comedy scenes were inappropriate within the context of the scene and had no meaning. Taika Watiti tried to create a second Ragnarok inside the movie, but the importance of the story and its depth are not commensurate with this amount of irony, especially beside the presence of gods. The last fight had a few bugs and although it was fun, at one point I felt like Christian Bale's presence was just a way to attract viewers with his debut. After all, Love and Thunder isn't much better than Marvel's first-class work, but it's an enjoyable and worth watching movie experience, that's for sure.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marvel's Thor: Love and Thunder. My excitement following the success of 2017 Thor: Ragnarök and the return of Taika Waititi as not only director but also co-writer has been palatable as well as guarded. With only an hour fifty-nine-minute runtime, the return of so many established characters, along with the introduction of new storylines, combined with the ""late in the game"" onslaught trailers, clips, and other hype I was more than a bit fearful we would've pretty much seen the entire film before it actually hit the screen.Both valid takes as it turns out.Thor: Love and Thunder is indeed a fun, summer romp of a film that delights in many ways. The light-hearted to downright silly comedic beats, plenty of expected as well as unexpected call backs, fast paced action, and a storyline with heart at its core for my time and money put Thor: Love and Thunder in the same realm as Thor: Ragnarök.Sweet.Same realm but not quite the same level, however.The less is more runtime definitely keeps TLT from hitting the full Ragnarök level of enjoyment. Not all the comedy is a solid hit, but more importantly the drama and the emotional elements aren't given the time to sit/breathe making for a less impactful viewing experience that's emptier than it should be.Christian Bale delivers as the ""Big Bad"". I just wish there had been more Gorr to feast upon. The same can be said for Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster/Mighty Thor. The chance to really delve into and expand on their characters never quite comes to fruition and while seeing them is enjoyable it's also frustrating as a result. The character development remains only skin deep here. A truly squandered opportunity.Then there's Russell Crowe. I can't even begin to wrap my head around that one. Better than his outing as Henry Jekyll in 2017 The Mummy but still... If nothing else, what the hell was up with that accent? I'll leave it at that.Moving on.Good visuals. Strong direction. Then there's the soundtrack. Ahhh, the soundtrack. An around the world and back snap for certain. Guns N' Roses takes me back, ABBA makes me happy, Mary J. Blige is never wrong.Thor: Love and Thunder as a whole is a bit of a mixed bag, not unlike all the Thor films. Fortunately, there's more good about it than bad.Did I want more from it overall? Yes. Did I enjoy seeing it on the big screen? Yes, again. Can I recommend you head to the theater to check it out? Again, I'm going to say yes. Go for the fun, go for the joy of catching up with the familiar characters and for a glance of seeing where they may head in the future. Go with the right mind set for a summer movie experience but be sure to stay for the 2 end credit scenes.Thor: Love and Thunder is a 7.5 for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The storyline is woeful, the dialogue is trying for humour but misses by many country miles, the cast are trying hard I feel but even they can't breathe life into this utter mess of a movie. Watiti is I believe trying for humour with emotion but fails on both. The key emotional moments just left me cold, the overwhelming barrage of attempted humour completely strips away any emotional connection with the film and the poor plot/story undermines everything. By far the worst Marvel film to date, this was an utter car-crash of a movie. Please reconsider letting Taika Watiti direct a Star Wars film, on this evidence he will ruin it.If you enjoyed Ragnorok and are thinking of going to see this film...DON'T..!","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

There were funny moments here and there, Christian Bale's performance was very good and Russell Crowe...Russell Crowe is in his own world in this movie, in a good way.Sadly, Waititi's indulgence could really be felt sometimes, with him leaving the camera on for the actors to improvise in between scripted scenes. The humour, personally, felt really flat most of the time except for, again, funny shots and lines here and there. Chris Hemsworth is always good as an actor, but a good actor can't camouflage bad jokes. The predictable MCU moments are here, clichés tropes and plot points...it's not like the other movies didn't have that, but where Ragnarok felt fresh and different, this one really doesn't hit the same.Overall,6/10 recommendation for mindless fun but with all that money on the screen, this could've been much better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) was the same as Thor: Ragnarok (2017).Chris Hemsworth as Thor is still great, but Thor in the movie can act stupid and can be cringey at times even though he does have good moments and cool action scenes.Natalie Portman as Jane Foster/Mighty Thor was good. I liked how she became Mighty Thor because it was like how she becomes Mighty Thor in the comics. She was cool in action scenes, and she has good scenes so you can feel what she is going through.I did like Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher because you do get a backstory that helps you understand him, he can also be creepy and intimidating. The problem is I would have liked to see more of him because he is not in most of the movie.The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster/Mighty Thor was still good and they work well together. The problem with the movie is that it can get too cheesy with its jokes, and it can get cringey, but there are jokes and dialogue that are funny.The movie has an 80's feels to it, the Guardians of the Galaxy are only in some small scenes, and the action scenes are fun to watch. The 3rd act can get stupid, but it is entertaining.Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) is like Thor: Ragnarok (2017) in many ways, but I liked Thor Ragnarok (2017) more than this. Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) is fun and entertaining to watch, but you might not like this if you did not like Thor: Ragnarok (2017).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The relationship between Jane and Thor was beautiful, especially the hospital scene.All in all, would've been a great movie if they skipped the flat jokes and awkward lines, and also brushed up on the SFX a bit, because some parts looked SO bad, especially the first fight. The fight on the shadow realm was beautiful though, I loved the B&W and how mjolnir and the bolt made things a bit colourful while the rest was all gray.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth is great as always so is Natalie Portman and this was definitely my favorite thor movie with her. Christian Bale was fantastic as Gorr & I really liked a lot of the set pieces especially on the climax. I will say though a lot of the humor was pretty excessive and some was just downright dumb. I laughed many times but stuff like the goats constantly screaming got old fast and thor pouring beer on Stormbreaker almost made me facepalm. Despite that though I can't act like I didn't have a great time. Ragnarok was better tho.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Majority of the elements I would consider alright 6/10 overall, but there was stuff lacking that pulled it down.First off the start felt pointless and so did the attire changes. It set the tone for the remainder of the movie to follow suit in some bad habits with the movie constantly trying to be a comedy (with most jokes just falling flat. Not all were bad they just weren't funny either with only maybe 1-2 laughs out of the entire movie worth of puns/jokes/comedic elements.) it just took away any type of feeling or investment into the darker parts of the story that had real substance to be deeper and great. It just felt like the movie was chasing the formula of Ragnarok and it failed to capture it completely. This thor was less heroic and more like a parody of what he started off as.A huge drawback that would polarize some is the screaming goats in this movie. To me it was annoying and would be part of the reason I wouldn't be quick to rewatch this movie.Christian bale delivered and had he been included into a more serious thor movie would have been an amazing fit into the arch/storyline. He did his job but everyone else seemed like they just showed up put on their suits and read out some comedic lines to get paid. It felt cheaper and just flat.I think the movie had the right idea, wrong director, and missed the mark of excellent because of it.6/10 - Alright movie but below marvel movie expectations and not the most rewatchable one either. It's just in line with the majority of phase four which just hasn't hit the same level as the predecessor movies and phases.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A good point is Christian bale as the villain absolutely thrilling performance the kids in my theatre ran away. Chris hemsworth is good as Thor like expected. Some good emotions were blended with the story about the female Thor's illness. The director has not full filled expectations like the 3rd part of Thor being the best. The climax is ok doesn't feel huge. Action pieces also ok noting new to get excited. Overall a fun summer entertainer for me.

He reaches an oasis and sees Rapu that mistreats Gorr. The powerful Necrosword choses Gorr that beheads Rapu and he promises to kill all the gods. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy are fighting Sif and Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is under treatment of a stage IV cancer on Earth. When Gorr kidnaps all the children of New Asgard, Thor, Jane Foster with Mjolnir, King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Korg go to the Omnipotence City to ask Zeus (Russel Crowe) to join an army of gods to fight Gorr, but Zeus don't care to his request. Now the quartet needs to fight Gorr to rescue the children and avoid the God Butcher from reaching the Etenity's gate.""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is an adventure that aspires to be funny, but most of the scenes of comedy are unfunny. The adventure is not bad, and Gorr is a creepy villain. The corny conclusion is silly, with Thor raising the daughter of his enemy. The American Jane Foster reaching the Valhalla is hard to be understood. My vote is six.Title (Brazil); ""Thor: Amor e Trovão"" (""Thor: Love and Thunder"")","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I recently watched Ragnarok and was hopeful that the movie would follow suit in terms of its art and comedic direction.Love and Thunder does this too a certain extent but not fully. The vibrant colours of Ragnarok are still present which awesome however the comedy is very stale. Korg was amazing in Ragnarok and quickly became one of my favourite mcu characters, However, he overstays his welcome in Love and Thunder. I can only describe him as too quippy, which ultimately leads to his jokes being dry and unamusing.Christian Bale as Gorr is terrific. His acting is terrific and works tremendously well with what little he is given. And that is what's key, how little he is given. Gorr is greatly underutilised. In my opinion, Gorr should have been far more violent and dark than he was, truly juxtaposing the light hearted and virbant nature and colours of our heroes. His backstory is fantastic but is not developed upon enough I believe.Finally, the heroes are great as usual. I think Natalie Portman as Mighty Thor is amazing, and I think that she is used far better than she was originally. Chris Hemsworth once again devilered a good performance as Thor and Tessa Thompson, like Bale, was amazing but underutilised.Overall, this movie tried to hit the same strides as Ragnarok but feel short, which is dissapointing given the potential with Mighty Thor and Gorr as additions to the casta and the overall direction the film good have taken.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

L&T seems more like a farewell to the Marvel Universe as it once was, especially since it is likely to be the final ""solo"" project of any of the original Avengers. It contains a lot of broad humor, some pathos with the villian, a lot of Easter eggs and in-jokes, and some decent set pieces. Unfortunately, it all seems as though everything was included in order to check boxes on a list. What it does, it does well, but there's nothing NEW. (After 23 movies, how can there be?)Christian Bale does well with his sympathetic villian. The scene where he confronts the children is chilling, and the children deserve kudos for their frightened reactions to his performance. It's fun seeing actors like Sam Neill, Matt Damon, and Russel Crowe in their cameo roles. Original Thor movie characters Lady Sif, Darcy Lewis, Heimdall, and Erik Selvig are each nicely included with brief appearances. The soundtrack is suitable for the movie, and led to a brief conversation between my wife and myself whether ABBA would ever open for Guns n' Roses.It is all a lot of fantstic icing on a very small piece of cake. Nothing about the movie is bad, per se, but there isn't anything particularly outstanding either. The days when an audience could expect something original from a MCU film are definitely over.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Luckily, a movie critic recommended this assuring me that this time it worked.Beautiful colours (and even beautiful when they're not there, eat your heart out Zack Snyder). Such a fun adventure with a cast that keeps it moving but giving it time to more heartfelt scenes.As it happens with a lot of movies that want to target as broad an audience as possible, sometimes the female leads/villains are """"""empowered"""""" but through classic male gaze (or even worse, using maternity as the end all be all for motivation). This movie just flows naturally, it cherishes its characters and doesn't make a mockery out of anything, while still poking fun at the genre and the tropes.The music might feel a bit overused, but if you enjoy eighties movies, this might be right up your alley.Mythology nerd? This movie got you covered, with winks here and there.Not completely caught up with the MCU/previous Thor movies? The recap at the beginning is the best one I've seen so far. No two characters giving expository dialogue, it's just performance within a performance.It's an adventure comedy and I'm quite baffled at the amount of negative reviews accusing the movie of... being... too funny? It was such a fun and genuine experience.I just hope other people can see the difference in mediums and watch this movie for what it is and not for what they wish it had been.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

The jokes continued go get sillier to the detriment of the story.Christian Bale was great as Gorr but was under utilised and felt like he was in the wrong movie. He would have been better served in a 2 hr 20 min deep dive into what it means to be a god and work on a deeper level to challenge thor to think about the duty of the gods to their subjects.None of the events had any real weight and didn't really linger after the conclusion of the movie.This was the best use of Jane Foster and her overall arc for the film was well done and there was a better chemistry between Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth this time around.There were some strong visuals, particularly the sequence drained of colour except for the lightning of the weapons and Gorr's eyes.Overall the story had potential for something deeper but most of those moments were played for laughs (some of these worked, others did not). This leaves me losing confidence in the MCU going forward with 4/6 phase 4 movies being at best decent.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's stylish, hilarious, balanced, and treats the source material with dignity.I saw the trailer for Love and Thunder and immediately wanted to see it opening night, which I rarely do anymore, but thought this warranted a big-screen viewing.Without spoilers, my opinion of what we got is too much silliness and irreverence and poor writing, pacing and plot in the first half of the movie that dampens the very exciting and fun second half.A very important plot point happens in the cold open in a very fast vision, and multiple plot developments happen off camera, yet we get a multiple moments of on-screen gags like Natalie Portman coming up with catch phrases, Stormbreaker being jealous of Mjolnir, the Zeus lightning bolt show from the trailer, and easily ten minutes of goofy flashbacks narrated by Korg that get old really fast. There are times that it apparent that director Waititi just likes the sound of his own voice (as Korg)As for the acting: Christian Bale's Gorr is the only character that works; Natalie Portman looks out of place and amateur trying to be Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson barely gets a line in despite being King of New Asgard, Russell Crowe's Zeus sounds like Borat and made his scenes unwatchable, and Chris Hemsworth goes full himbo Thor.Where Ragnarok felt like a love-note to comics, Love and Thunder felt like everyone involved believes Marvel Comics and the MCU are undignified and something to be mocked.As for content, if you are taking kids be aware that there is a lot of sexually charged dialogue, a scene about orgies and when Chris Hemsworth is disrobed a lot of jokes about the size of his genitalia.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

Taking Thor, Valkyrie, and Almighty Thor who is Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) going on a space adventure to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) who is hellbent on killing all gods.The plot is great. It covers theme of finding self purpose, love, and meaning. The film does have a lighthearted theme. Even the opening sequence of showing Gorr and why he became the way he is and his motive for killing all gods was a neat addition of giving some emotional depth to the characters. Same goes for Thor who is trying to discover himself as well when he starts off with some space missions with Guardians of the Galaxy which they were trying to get him to go on his own.The film is fast paced and moves quick from one set piece to another. The visual effects are colorful and awesome. The cast ensemble is great. Christian Bale delivered a great villain performance and stands out compared to other villains with his horrifying and creepy performance.The film does have some fun and dumb humor just like Ragnarok from Taika Waititi script which the actors seemed to be having fun with improvising and adding a little humor every now and then.Michael Giacchino music score is also a great addition to the Thor film as well. The film has two scenes in the mid and post credits which was worth it to see where it can go next.Thor Love and Thunder is a fun action packed adventure that shines and stands out as a 80s rock em up marvel adventure.","20 out of 53 found this helpful.

Instead of trying to repeat a success, to make a new one from scratch on a different level (he is surely capable of)
He tried to contrast humorous characters with serious dark notes in order ro create a funny, then again serious movie and achieved only to reveal the nakedness of mediocracy. Kristian Bale made sure of that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot unfolds with a slow opening of a tragic survival story and the introduction of a new menace threatening the universe. Then the story uses a juvenile-level narrative flashbacks and adds a romantic dimension along with the threatening menace which by the end of the movie becomes like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness a strong redeeming climax that helps to greatly lift the overall assessment of the movie. For those unfamiliar with these characters, a number of well-known actors offer up some surprising, disguised performances, perhaps credit to their acting abilities and make-up, except for surprise appearance of Matt Damon (uncredited) whose presence is almost always impossible to disguise. In sum, Thor is an enjoyable, summer romp that does not break any new ground, but Chris Hemsworth makes great use of his light, comedic lines. Mostly tame, off-beat almost overly cute humor along with the typical fantasy action sequences describe this movie, but it is the relational moments that shine.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

The film had a somewhat good dose of humour. I loved the funny awkwardness created with Thor and Stormbreaker and the screaming goats were funny. Chris Hemsworth was born to play Thor and does well in carrying this film. It was great to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) play a hero figure who was equal to Thor but with a sad twist. It was the most serious film in the Thor film series with Jane having cancer and the death of the villain's daughter at the start of the film. I felt they could added a bit more humour, used the Guardians of the Galaxy more and perhaps Zeus and the gods could have teamed up to fight Gorr. I was not impressed with the black and white fight scene on the planet that looked like the Moon. This was far better than Doctor Strange which was disappointing and it had a great soundtrack. Overall not all bad.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

As a movie, it was mostly entertaining. Thor felt like a kids' movie that used the the s-word more times than acceptable to make it PG and the goats...the goats really made it feel like a kids movie. I'd rate it a 7/10 as a family movie.As another entry into the MCU, I'm giving it a 5/10. Mighty Thor/Dr. Jane Foster's storyline was fine if not too rushed to make me feel anything. The intent was there without any of the follow through which is a statement that could be used to describe most MCU movies being made now. This movie is just another cog in Disney's movie manufacturing company. The market is over saturated with too similar superhero movies and it's been showing for some years now.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Since 'End Game' with the exception of Spider-Man we mostly have been subjected to quite poor MCU outings whether on the big screen or TV and Thor 4 is no exception.Thor 4 tells the story of a god killer seeking revenge on all gods due to enlightenment that his own god never really cared for him. Thor seeks to prevent this and you can probably guess the rest.Whilst the overall story is is fine and could have resulted in a fine movie, it's executed rather poorly here. Having thought about it somewhat I think it boils down to poor writing. The prologue which sets the scene for the bad guy is ridiculous and lazy. The script leans heavily on the humour throughout and only some of it lands. The character of Thor which started out as a fish out of water, has transformed to full on Michael Scott. And whilst the movie does deal with some serious and weighty issues theres never any emotional turmoil for the viewer. It just is what it is and the movie suffers as it progresses because of this.Performances overall are particularly lacking and dare i say it a very lacklustre performance by Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. The casting of Russel Crowe as Zeus was interesting, but his mock generic european 'Greek' accent was frankly bizarre and off-putting. Christian Bale will be highly disappointed that this is the MCU movie he took on.Axel Rose will be happy with the movie as the soundtrack was basically a best of Guns N Roses and he also gets name checked by a character who insists that he's called Axel for literally no reason whatsoever.To conclude, it is watchable and somewhat entertaining in that huge big budget superhero way we've come to expect but this is comfortably the worst MCU movie to date.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The storyline follows Thor post Thanos searching for meaning. Meanwhile Jane Foster, his one true love, is back on Earth, dying. In her research she discovers Thor's hammer has healing effects and she tracks down his shattered hammer. The hammer, recognizing Jane, rejoins and turns her into a female Thor. When a God killer emerges in the galaxy destroying worlds and religions everywhere what better to stop it than two Thors?This movie is directed by Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit) and stars Chris Hemsworth (Snow White and the Huntsman), Natalie Portman (The Professional), Christian Bale (American Psycho), Tessa Thompson (Creed) and Russell Crowe (Gladiator).I'm not sure what I liked better, the legendary GNR soundtrack or the screaming goats...both stole the show. There's very little not to love about this film. The cast is well selected and Bale's villain is perfect in every way (cause, attire, makeup, etc). The special effects, CGI and cinematography are all classic Marvel and tremendous creating wonderful environments, characters and action scenes. The Guardians of the Galaxy opening was a perfect way to kick the movie off and the dialogue throughout is spot on and hilarious. There's also some memorable cameos sprinkled in here and there and they did a pretty good job with pacing as the storyline unfolds well and doesn't feel drawn out like a lot of super hero movies recently.Overall this is worthwhile addition to the super hero genre that's a must see for fans of the Marvel Universe. I would score this a solid 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.","15 out of 38 found this helpful.

But now, between ""Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness"" and this mess of a movie, it seems like producers and writers are simply throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. And what stuck kind of stinks. Thor has become like Ross on Friends: He started out cool and interesting, but the writers have turned him into a total goofball. Thor's humor is great, but not when goofiness becomes his chief defining characteristic. The basic plot had potential, but the development of it is mostly ridiculous. To avoid spoilers, I'll simply say that some of the new gods introduced in this film left me scratching my head. The backstory that is included about Thor and Jane is poorly conceived and lacks any compelling substance. While the woke content in this film is relatively minor, what little there is feels entirely inorganic, like it was forced into the film in order to appease political activists. And, while there is a never-ending barrage of jokes in the film, very few of them are very funny. There was very little laughter in a rather-full theater (especially after the first 20 minutes or so). The film still features beloved characters, and the action sequences are good, so 5 stars.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

This movie starts out strong with an introduction to Gorr and his daughter. It's a good, simple set-up for his tragic motivation as the villain. There's tension and emotion. Unfortunately from here, Waititi takes every opportunity to undercut any tension or drama from every scene. He saw that his trademark silly humor worked for Ragnarok and he dialed it up to 11 for Love and Thunder - to the detriment of the entire movie. Gorr kidnaps a large group of children from New Asgard, and considering the magnitute of this act, Thor and Valkyrie coming off as entirely unphased and jokey about the situation absolutely destroys any sense of urgency or consequence that should be present. And despite the potential Bale had as Gorr, he comes and goes and is entirely wasted instead of remaining a lurking threat among the MCU. Despite losing a significant Thor character by the end of the film as well, that outcome is predictable at every turn and the plot as a whole seems totally inconsequential in the long run. While Ragnarok was able to portray some weight to the loss of significant characters, Love and Thunder can't take itself seriously for even a moment. The visuals, while very much the kind of over-the-top comic book visual style I enjoy, come off as significantly cheaper than it's predecessors. The green-screen is horrendous and the CGI characters and creatures stick out sorely as if they were made 10 years ago. The action and wirework is much sloppier and obvious this time around. The only graphically stand-out moment is a brief battle sequence in black & white.The last gripe I have - and this is insignificant and personal - is the use of Guns N Roses in the soundtrack that completely ruins some of the more exciting moments. God I hate that band.All-in-all, this was not a good Thor movie. It wasn't a good Marvel movie, and it wasn't a good movie in general. This movie made me want to go back to Dark World just to clense the acid-trip color palette from my mind. Unless you have kids, or have the cognitive functions of a (12 year old or younger ) yourself, I see little reason anybody would come back to this movie for a second viewing.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Worst MCU film by a long shot. And the only movie that I will refuse to buy to add to my collection of every other MCU movie.It was a given as a blockbuster - with the amazing weight of the prior movies behind it and the cast of good actors, you'd think it impossible to ruin. But no, he did the Disney 'Kidification' to it.Good core story line bones but made trite and weak by no storyline depth, broken continuity of disconnected movie phases they didn't connect and were hugely different - from comedy to DC-like dark action and back, and NON STOP attempts at comedy lines in EVERY piece of dialogue! Marvel stories just don't need or want that. Occasional, yes. But not every piece of dialogue should be a setup and delivery of attempted gags.The main actors should be ashamed that they sold themselves out for the money on this movie, and lack of integrity to the franchise values.And Disney took what should have been great action for older children and teens (and us adults who grew up with it) to try and appeal to the mass young children. Who may like it now, but this movie will have no longevity, as it's exactly that - a movie you may like as a young kid, but would be embarrassed to own up to and ever watch again as a teen or adult.Needs a remake by someone like Peter Jackson who crushed the LotR and Hobbit movies.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

Case in point, I knew for a while that Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) became Thor for a while for medical reasons. In Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), this somewhat recent plot line from the comics combines with the modus operandi of Phase 4 of the MCU: wrapping up the loose ends from Phase 3 of the MCU.Doing a victory lap after his well-received Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Taika Waititi still brought his trademark comedic sensibilities to this movie but seemed to falter a bit with the much heavier themes of the God Killer (Christian Bale). In fact, I was expecting a bit more out of Bale, considering how dedicated he is to his roles. Don't get me wrong-there were still a bunch of really great action sequences in this movie, and the revelation of a council of gods is a profound theological can of worms that I'm sure will come into play in future films.The real problem with this movie was its lack of focus. Sure, it tied up the Jane Foster storyline from the first two Thor movies, but the only thing it really set up was a potential addition to the ""Young Avengers"" that Marvel keeps hinting at but not confirming is coming. Without knowing what this enormous Phase 4 of the MCU is headed toward, it's difficult to justify movies like this. Still, Love and Thunder was a fun action comedy to turn your brain off to for a few hours.A fun movie that lacked focus, I give Thor: Love and Thunder 3.5 stars out of 5.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thor is now portrayed as a moron and does not seem like his usual character from his many other appearances in Marvel movies. That said, Chris Hemsworth does deliver a fantastic performance and his comedic timing is always excellent. Unfortunately, it is not enough to redeem the film. Zeus was not as exciting as he could have been. Jane Foster had decent chemistry with Thor, but her backstory is shallow. Gorr, played by Christian Bale, was a good surprise and was quite unsettling as an antagonist. It is too bad he wasn't in more scenes, so he didn't seem that ominous.Overall though, the action was superb and the final conclusion was satisfying to watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Another Entry on the List of Mediocre Phase 4 Movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8379195/?ref_=tt_urv","mitchell5954","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42936359/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2022","Thor Love and Thunder is the latest Thor movie, as well as the latest Phase 4 MCU film. As far as the Thor movies are concerned there hasn't been one I flat out dislike. I enjoy the first movie. Dark World is okay. Everyone hates that one, but it had some hype moments for me, and I was never truly bored in it. Ragnarök is one of my favorite MCU movies. So, I was somewhat excited for this as it has the same director attached. Although, my excitement dwindled after seeing Dr. Strange 2 and seeing the reviews for this film. I personally have found Phase 4 quite disappointing. The only entries I think have actually been good are Spiderman No Way Home and Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Everything else has ranged from okay to incredibly subpar. Dr. Strange 2 especially has been one of the most disappointing MCU films for me. This movie, unfortunately kind of follows suit on that trend.I will say that I was never bored in this film. Other films like Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow, and Shang-Chi gat pretty boring in places. This film is fun on a dumb action movie level, so it has that over other Phase 4 entries even though it probably is on par with them on a quality standpoint. There first twenty minutes of this movie in particular were really strong. I was always entertained, though that's more to do with the actors than the writing. Chris Hemsworth is such a charismatic actor that you love to watch even when he's given garbage scripts. I really like the villain here. I love his design, and Christian Bale, as always gives a good performance. I found myself sympathizing with him a bit, which is more than I can say for most MCU villains. The film, like Ragnarök, is beautiful to look at.Many people hate Jane as a new Thor, but I didn't mind too much. Jane as a female Thor did not surprise me, as I know of her from the comics. This is actually the most I've ever like Jane in these movies. In the first two she was just the token love interest character, especially in Dark World. Here she's given much more to do and is given a sympathetic arc of her own. She also didn't outright steal the show away from Thor, which is what I was afraid of happening. I will also say, the film's ending surprised me. I did not think it would end that way, especially since the MCU has been becoming more woke these days.On to the negatives now. The other gods featured here are terrible. Zeus and the Greek gods are a complete joke. I'm a Russel Crowe fan, but he's awful here. This is his worst performance that I've seen from him. You know you screwed up when the Percy Jackson movies did the Greek gods more justice.Also, just like in Dark World, the humor is very hit or miss. Ragnarök had this problem to an extent, but the jokes in that were more hit than miss for me. Plus, you had Loki or the Hulk for Thor to work off of. You don't have that here. You have the Guardians of the Galaxy, but they're not in the movie nearly as much as the trailers led you to believe. Much of the humor fell flat for me here.Overall, Love and Thunder is harmless fun. It will entertain you while you're watching it, but it certainly is not one of the more memorable MCU movies. I'd say it's on par with Dark World. Sadly, much like a lot of Phase 4, this film feels very much like a throwaway entry. The only MCU movies (and show) that has felt impactful in terms of the whole MCU are Falcon and the Winter Soldier, No Way Home, and Eternals. Everything else has felt very much like filler.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first Thor film may have been over-serious, but it pulled at the character in different ways and gave it depth; Thor had a genuine soul. This one reduces the character to a running joke about incompetence in anything but fighting - it's as if Marvel (Disney) made the series for a younger and younger audience each go round. All the characters are slight and one-note, the is plot thin and moves fast but randomly, like a drunk on a country road. It's such a shame - the original was about family, trust and honor - there's absolutely nothing honorable here.

Sadly there are lots of things that if changed could have made this the best Thor movie yet.Firstly the jokes; some were on point, like the banter between Thor and Star-lord, but i think we could have all done without Beer being poured over Stormbreaker and those damn Goats. Taiki does realise we're not in 2012 anymore right?Then there's the plot holes and some are pretty big. The biggest; Gorr baiting Thor to a trap by kidnapping kids, when he believes all Gods are selfish. Great logic there Taiki.Lastly and most unforgivably, both the Guardians of the Galaxy and Gorr are both massively underused. The GOTG are widely loved and provide funnier humour than Thor, especially when together and Gorr was played so well by Bale. We really should have seen him butchering Gods, otherwise he just looks menacing but there's no context.If this movie had have been made more darker, like The Batman, and focussed on Gorr, it could have been fantastic and if the GOTG were in more of the film it could have been hilarious. Unfortunately as it is, it's simply mediocore. Lets hope Taiki doesn't ruin and more movies, Star Wars is bae for me, Waititi, i'm watching you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Here we see a version of the God of Thunder that makes mistakes everywhere he goes, he destroys things he's trying to save, and is so stupid even Star Lord has to explain things to him.Bale's performance is pretty good though. It's pretty evident he's giving a solid performance, not only because he's trying, but also because all the other characters are a joke, so the actors don't even have the opportunity to display their skills.Bale's character is the only one with an interesting development and his motives are easy to emphasize with. We can't say the same about the other characters, returning characters are a mere carcase of what they used to be, and the new ones are there just to make fun of them.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

The focus has definitely been on the Disney+ content as mentioned by Kevin Feige in majority of the press conferences. Both Spiderman No Way Home and Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness were about exploring the multiverse concept mixed with nostalgia. While the other TV shows are exploring many new characters and storylines, we wonder how much of them will get integrated into the big screen releases. Amidst all this, Thor Love and Thunder somehow comes off as an unexpected breeze in the midst of a multiverse storm.Thor Love and Thunder definitely lives up to its expectation as to what was shown in the trailer and also manages to surprise you beyond that. The plot is about Thor taking on the new nemesis Gorr The Godbutcher while also exploring more on his life and love. The movie is not so heavy on action but it doesn't necessarily need it as well. Although the humour element feels recycled from most of the previous MARVEL movies, there are some really funny moments. The movie kind of carries the vibes of initial Thor movies and isn't as chaotic as Ragnarok. Michael Giacchino's score is impressive as always and the use of rock music to enhance the action sequence works once again.Thor Love and Thunder is all about characters and their arc. Chris Hemsworth continues his charming ways of playing Thor and at this point of time he's just living it. Natalie Portman's comeback as Jane Foster and also Lady Thor (or should I say Mighty Thor ;-)) is backed by a very strong reason. She may have had some issues with MARVEL in the past but I believe the script has been well adjusted to overcome all those things. Tessa Thomson as Valkyrie probably although a bystander is uniquely funny. It is Taika Waititi as Korg who takes all the cherry on cake with the majority of the humour associated with his character. Christian Bale is without a doubt impressive as Gorr The Godbutcher and also has a great character arc to support his performance. Most of us may feel he may lack a bit of screen time but considering the movie runtime it is just about fine. Along with the above there are multiple funny and interesting guest appearances in the movie including that of Russel Crowe which fit well.Thor Love and Thunder may not be an action adventure extravaganza like some of the recent MARVEL movies, but it is a movie with character and love. Lots and lots of love.","13 out of 33 found this helpful.

With confusing character arcs, a good chunk of humor not quite hitting the highs you expect, and the lack of stakes, Taika Waititi's second Thor flick severely lacks the liveliness of Ragnarok. The GOTG cameos don't mean anything, and the entire scene with Russell Crowe's Zeus simply makes for a subpar comedy sketch. Heck, I'm sure Sam Neill, Matt Damon, and the Asgardian performers could've come up with something much better.The MCU continues to struggle with its inability to write off characters even when they're dead, and it's the case with Love and Thunder too. Jane Foster, her sudden cancer, and her mysterious connection to Mjolnir all remain underdeveloped aspects in the film. There is a constant back-and-forth when it comes to tone, and somewhere between humor, drama, and darkness, my interest levels waned. What keeps it engaging, however, is Waititi's visual craft. He creates both a colorful and a colorless world within the same film, and the GnR tracks are perfectly placed.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love these types of films when done well, but lately the marvel universe seems to be written as a terrible 1970s parody of a big budget film. The writing is poor and vacuous. It's like a school year 7 drama lesson on improv. I seem to be writing a lot of reviews like this these days. So why is Disney running all its franchises? All the lead actors in this are playing it as though they are in a low budget children's TV series. Thor is bad enough, but when e get to zeus, I can't believe how far both actors have fallen. I am so glad I didn't see this at the cinema. It seems to me the special effects budget outstripped the budget for a script. Save yourself some misery and don't watch this.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Perhaps even here it seems.We watched it on a Friday night. The popcorn was implied, it's a Marvel movie, so yeah all of life is at stake, or is it all of afterlife. But Taika is the man behind the curtain and the green screen pajamas, you know he's going to be clever but in a good-hearted way. There's a contrast of mortality, for mere humans as well as for the powerful beings.And no, I'm not talking about those powerful beings here flexing their reviewing might with ""1"" reviews (or the begrudging ""2s"" whose Mothers used to sing them Guns and Roses lullabies. I know you wanted this movie to be more of a crossover between Agnes Varda and Abbas Kiarostami, maybe next time.Not to digress, but how has this actual world become all about the outrage? Even Spinal Tap did a few unplugged gigs.Speaking of outrage, I did catch a few minutes of the alternate version where Sonic Youth's early music was used as opposed Axl/Slash - and man that scene where Lady Thor takes out a certain son of a carpenter. Not sure I understood the whole pro-life is actually tied to ur-death motif. /sBack in the actual film, I did find an interesting contrast of superheroes and deities, granted deities that are pretty much no longer worshiped by anyone. Christian Bale was captivating on screen, and Taika does bring in some pretty big stars (and their kids per the credits).I get that it's not just incels who struggle with their impotence, and that while we may want heroes (or even hope against hope for honest politicans), life ends up being more complicated and disappointing than that.Love may feel like a treacly antidote. But like this film if you approach it more eager to appreciate than annihilate, and you toss in a few laughs, even some at your own expense, you can worry later about What the Thunder Said.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, even as I walked out of the theater after seeing that film, I didn't think it should be established as the standard for any and all Thor stories going forward, but it looks like many in Hollywood and its own writer/director Taika Waititi thought very differently, and as a result lightning doesn't strike twice.Firstly, there are many other epic stories from Thor's comic history that would make excellent blockbuster cinema and work fine in the continuity of the established Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet they decided to use more recent runs as the basis for its story - not that that is a bad thing per se, but it's still disappointing.I did like Natalie Portman quite a bit as Jane Foster in the first two Thor films and found her chemistry with Chris Hemsworth to be very good, so I was fine with Portman returning. Gorr the God Butcher being brought in felt like an interesting idea for the screen and Christian Bale playing them raised expectation, and then you have the introduction of other Gods with Russell Crowe as Zeus and that just excited the Marvel Zombie in me, but unfortunately Taika Waititi seems to be in-love too much with his brand of filmmaking and tries to recreate Ragnarok all over again and does anything but succeed in their attempt at doing so. The movie has too much humor to the point where any stakes and drama lack impact, and it will echo memories of the superhero movie duds of the late 1990's and early 00's with its desperation to entertain the viewer.I personally think there is still a lot you can do with Thor and his lore for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Taika Waititi should hand the directing duties to someone else - personally, I wish Sir Kenneth Branagh would return and reclaim this franchise. Branagh's 2011 introductory film was a solid representation of the Thor character and his cast of characters, it's operatic and Shakespearean drama coupled with genre filmmaking worked fantastically.As it stands, I would rate this as the worst Thor entry to date, even worse than The Dark World - because even that had more going for it and didn't treat nearly everything as a joke.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yes, it is definitely a much weaker movie than Ragnarok and I understand how disappointed you can be if your expectations were pretty high; I happen to be in the same boat.

Is the overall tone a little too lighthearted especially considering the supposedly seriousness of the villain? Probably. But I think it is still in line with what we can expect from a Taika Waititi Thor movie. All in all, I would still recommend it; just know what you're getting into and you will have a good time.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

They did succeed in making the film funny, but when you try and get a laugh in pretty much every scene then you are going to get a laugh sometimes aren't you.

Thor's character seems to need that competitive dynamic. Also the writing for this movie just isn't working. Major moments are simply glazed over in order to quickly get to the next scene. At one point all the heroes do something incredbly cowardly and we aren't supposed to notice. A lot of attempted comic relief is not landing. And the film score is very ""blah."" The GnR tracks are also not motivated, and pretty obviously an attempt to hit on a trend. While the villian has some backstory, his power has basically none, just another glazed over detail. That being said Christian Bale brought it. He's so good everyone else's performance seems to dwindle. If we're keeping score here the Loki series blows this out of the water.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

If u are really big Thor fan, then u should go and see this movie. But if like Thor but want to watch better things, then u don't have to go and see this movie. It effects MCU not much.

Sadly, the once mighty Thor has become a joke, and has been deliberately weakened in order to build up the two other female characters in order to be woke and inclusive; It's ok! A powerful man can still rescue and damsel in distress, some of us still like that concept! Speaking of woke and inclusive, it tried too hard at that too, where it almost felt forced and was only included to simply tick a box. Didn't like the talking to his axe and hammer, just stop.

However, I still had a blast watching it and Gorr the God Butcher was a fantastic villain. My issues with the movie mainly surround the pacing, it went by SUPER fast. The movie didn't allow you to hang out to a scene for long before it moved away. Where this movie shined was with the villain, and unsurprisingly giving the name of the movie, the dynamic between Thor and Jane. I won't get into spoilers, but this movie does have some emotional moments. However they get kinda overshadowed by the fast pacing and the comedy. If you liked Ragnarok, you might like this.

While there were a few odd scenes and the opening caught me off guard, it was overall a well made movie that entertained me for two hours, thus I am rating it a 6/10 like the previous Thor sequels. I liked the music and the sense of humor, I know not everyone does, but I did. In fact, Hemsworth is a great comedic actor whose manner has really defined this modern Thor character. I enjoy the slight silliness; I don't need overly dark and serious superhero films as some people do. I also liked him in ""Men in Black: International."" And even playing a real bad guy in ""Bad times at the el royale"" he still can't help showing off that odd sense of humor and his fit body of course. Obviously not everyone likes these Thor movies and that is ok, but I do, and I'm not a big superhero genre fan. Though I don't like some of the flashing lights and stuff, but that was really only an issue in the first film of the series, which is why I rated ""Thor"" only a 5/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But! If they want to do so, then it's clear that they'll absolutely HAVE to get 100% behind the director's visions, and trust them to make the movie that they want.Also, to talk about the actual film, it's amazing. The acting is great from all the leads, the directing and cinematography is stunningly beautiful. Like, I had to wait weeks and weeks to see this in the cinema after my original trip got ruined, but it was absolutely worth it. The story is everything I wanted it to be, and more honestly. And after seeing the film, I really think that Thor is one of the best characters to have come out of the MCU. Sure he had a bit of a rough start, but as the films have gone on, he's gone through such an amazing arc and character development that he's really become one of the all time great superheroes.Overall, this film pleasantly surprised me and broke my heart in the best way possible. It was emotional, thoroughly entertaining, and totally awesome!","18 out of 50 found this helpful.

This movie is a 2 hour film with mainly the same 3 or 4 jokes over and over. Thor Ragnarok was one of my favorite MCU movies too date so I was so excited for this. However it misses on 90 percent of the comedy, and while that sounds like an extreme, this film is basically a joke after a joke from the first time we see Thor to the end. It never stops. While the comedy was horrible though you have to give credit to the action and visuals in this movie. They are tremendous and truly fun to watch. The standout here was Christian Bale, his portrayal of Gorr was incredible and he stood out as an actor in this movie. Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor works really well which I wasn't expecting and the universe it starts to make cannon in the MCU is also a huge plus.Overall Thor Love and Thunder is a bad comedy mixed with a great action film and a standout performance. I think that earns it a slightly above average rating and is not worthy of a rewatch for a long time.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Having seen Taika Waititi's other films I felt fairly prepared for there to be a joke every 5 seconds, not every joke landed and there were moments when jokes didn't fit the tone but overall, I wasn't too distracted by it. I think this film failed in a lot of other ways but for me at least the overabundance of humour was passable.What I wasn't such a huge fan of was how rushed everything felt. Alright, maybe rushed is the wrong word, we spent ages watching the stuff that I was less interested in and then just skipped over the stuff I was there to see, namely Gorr. Gorr is the villain, played excellently by Christian Bale. Bale is one of the most talented actors alive so you would imagine he would be given time to show off, for some bizarre reason though, we never see Gorr the God Butcher, Butcher any gods. He kills one early on and then is relegated to off screen evil doing, while we instead follow Thor and his gang on their merry adventures. Whenever Gorr was on screen I was excited, but they only gave him like 20 minutes of screentime. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Thor 2 and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie were all good, but come on. None of them come near to the charisma that Bale brings to the table. So not only did the film just skip over all the most interesting parts, which reportedly were filmed but just not used in the final cut, but then the rest of the film is just a mildly entertaining comedy? I was disappointed.The best scene, that single handedly dragged this film up from a 5 to a 6 for me, was when Thor fights Gorr on a planet with no colour. The way this was shot was so different from the usual MCU fodder and actually seeing Gorr in his element was great. If the film as a whole had been as inventive and interesting as this one scene then I might have had a brilliant time. It wasn't and I didn't so before I finish I'll just throw in a few nitpicks just to kick this film while it's down.When Thor and friends seek help from other gods, the majority of the gods feel like really boring designs, they could have had so much crazy stuff here but instead just had a couple weird designs and played the rest safe. There are two goats, they annoy me and aren't funny. Thor's outfit is actually painful to look at. Just a terrible design. Korg is treated as a main character, he was better in the first when we just got small bursts of him, here it starts feeling like too much at points.This film isn't terrible but it just lacks in a lot of places, the ending was nice enough and certainly tried to get you more emotional than anything else in the film but it was difficult to feel for the characters after an hour thirty of them just quipping. Also all emotional value was ruined by the post credits scene.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, there is still a lot to enjoy when you view this as a Taika Waititi film, and not a Marvel film. In this post-Endgame phase not every movie or show has to directly lead to another epic event, and this can certainly be enjoyed on its own if you don't go in with the high expectations of a Winter Soldier or Infinity War-level film.

The movie Love and Thunder is to Thor (the first movie) and the super hero genre as Spaceballs is to Star Wars and the sci-fi genre. It felt like a parody of super hero movies, not once taking itself seriously. I like jokes as much as the next guy, but to have one every minute that undercuts the moments of the scene is ridiculous to the point where it was no longer funny. For the sake of being a comedy it lost sight on world building and actually presenting a plot worth the price of admission. Marvel has been on a decline during phase 4, with movies like Thor: Love and Thunder now seaming to be a quick cash grab that people will buy into because of the name Marvel; a name that used to be fun and exciting, knowing how to balance the different tones of both its own individual movie and the cinematic universe.In summary:For the jokes I give a 3/10 because it undermined some heartfelt moments and action, though there was some good lines in the beginning.The plot is a 1/10 because it follows the new Marvel formula so if you have seen one Marvel movie then this movie will be EXTREMELY predictable. In addition it feels rushed with heavy expositions dumps every now and then, with the ending feeling unresolved and incomplete. However, there is one moment that was decent but I will not elaborate just in case you still wish to see Love and Thunder as that way I don't ruin the one enjoyable scene in this movie.Rewatchability 3/10 because, as with all other Marvel movies, there may be some easter eggs scattered throughout this film. So if you are into that then it can be rewatched. However, it is not that fun of a movie as a whole, which was disappointing.Overall, don't wast your time and money. Buy ice cream or something better.","19 out of 33 found this helpful.

Some people act like it is worse than Thor 1 and 2 but it really isn't that bad, it is flawed and slightly underdeveloped but a fun nonetheless.The Good:
I generally liked this film. I thoroughly enjoyed some of the visual jokes in this film and thought Taika Watiti as Korg, Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie were the standouts when it came to the comedy. As well as I thought some of the cameos were very fun. Not to mention Christian Bale as Gorr was really interesting and thought his origin was very interesting but I will talk more about him soon. And I think some of the costumes were quite good as well. As well as the main theme of love was thoroughly explored in a fun and interesting manner.The Bad:
I liked this film but that's not to say I wasn't slightly disappointed, especially after the gem that was Thor: Ragnarok. I also felt that when it came to Thor's main costume in the film that it wasn't great, it wasn't as awful as it looked in the original posters but it still wasn't great And don't get me started on the helmets. For some reason they decided that instead of having practical helmets, instead they just used CGI and you can really tell, it does not look good. And I was very disappointed by the lack of Guardians of the Galaxy in the film as Thor joining the Guardians was one of the most interesting things to leave us at t he end of Endgame and they were almost not in the film. I thought Gorr was a very interesting villain and I thought he was even more interesting than Hella from Ragnarok but I still think Hella was a better villain as Gorr just wasn't explored as that well as he could of been. I thought his introduction was really good and so were all his scenes but I think he just wasn't in the film enough. As well as I felt they were missing a whole third act of the film and the final battle felt a bit weak until the end of it.Overall I think if you are fan of Ragnarok then you will enjoy it enough but it definitely isn't as strong as Ragnarok in any of the aspects of the film. However it is still a fun watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This time around Natalie Portman returns to the series as the central character taking on a version of Mighty Thor which allows for some great romantic comedy tropes to come into play. The action is bigger, the laughs are louder, the premise is outrageously camp showing there is still life left in the Thor series, Thor : Love and Thunder is the best MCU movie in the current phase, and perhaps the best Thor movie of the series.The movie picks up slightly after the events of Avengers Endgame. Thor has his eye back and has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy as he is feeling empty and searching for meaning in his life. Meanwhile, New Asgard has settled on Earth and become a major tourist destination for the world to encounter the Asgardian's lifestyle. When Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is told of a monster Gorr (Christian Bale) equipped with a sword that can kill gods is on a mission to eliminate all gods travelling across the different realms to do so. Thor must enlist the help of Zeus (Russell Crowe) and bring his friends Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) to stop the slaughter and save the gods and children of New Asgard.The MCU have been taken huge creative risks lately with projects like The Eternals, Doctor Strange 2 and the array of Disney + spin-offs that don't centre around main characters not delivering the billion-dollar blockbuster hits and near-perfect critic scores the studio is used to. Thor is the first character in the MCU to be given a fourth solo film and while there are many ingredients here that make it worth it, the return of Natalie Portman to the series, and to take up the mantle of Thor seems worth the money alone. Director Taika Waititi has taken the ingredients that made Ragnarok popular with Korg and Valkyrie returning and blending them with the cast of the original movie to deliver a story that won't result in the end of the world (well human world at least!) Taking the fight to the gods in different realms is a clever tale to tell and with Waititi's whacky mind to write and direct, only accelerates this turning into a blend of campy 80's inspired action that will make you laugh, sometimes cry and a reminder of the power of Marvel comics characters when done right.Hemsworth remains settled as the character, cracking out the one-liners at every turn. Bale was a great addition as the torn father turned murdering psychopath able to summon shadow monsters at the click of his fingers. His performance was outrageously campy and felt like a mix of Arnold Schwarzneggers Mr Freeze in Batman and Robin with Ray Fines Voldermort. There were times he appeared and it was incredibly creepy and threatening, and others where it felt outrageously camp. Portman's return was warranted with an extended backstory and throwback scene explaining the reasons they broke up and why Jane feels the need to reach back out to Thor. Portman and Hemsworth were not a solid sell in the first two films, here the balance of power has shifted and their relationship is understandably different and fortunately feels more authentic.Visually the film is clearly sticking close with its 80's poster promises and trailer. There is a heavy neon aesthetic that is mixed up a bit in a few parts of the film. Waititi plays with black and white in the Shadow realm and allows the visuals to transform offering a different vibe and the shadow monsters to feel like creepy characters from an old black and white horror movie. It is good to see the studio trying different things, particularly in a movie that is bursting at the seams with colour and light for the majority of its two-hour runtime.There are a ton of throwbacks to romantic comedies as Thor and Jane explore their new relationship and the possibilities that it may bring to each of them. Thor feels lost and clearly still loves Jane. Jane has a life-altering decision to make and must choose between life and love. This would be the first film in which their love story feels earned and the pay-off is extremely bittersweet.The action scenes in this do feel a little light. While they are chaotic and loud, you can almost see the wires as the different characters fly across the screen or embark on large leaps and rolls set against the CGI landscapes. This is particularly true when it comes to Portman possessing the power of Thor. A few tumbles and hammer swings are effective, but after a few times, the cracks do appear. This is the same for Hemsworth who doesn't get as much to do action wise this time around when it comes to fighting sequences.Russell Crowe is the big addition here with the character of Zeus revealed, his take on the ultimate god of gods is different to say the least. Donning a white Australian trying to do a greek accent comes through as Con The Fruiterer from The Comedy Company (for your reference if you don't know click here) This may sound like a negative, it is actually incredibly funny and his take on Thor and the god-killer is a great addition to the story.Thor : Love and Thunder is everything that I wasn't expecting from this film. It does offer a large neon world with a romantic comedy space romp with the characters from the franchise we all love, yet still remains to hit all the emotional beats it needs to and solidifies Natalie Portman's return to the franchise. While this won't be to everyone's liking, there is so much thrown at the screen, so quickly, it all just kind of works. There are two credit scenes, both worth watching so make sure you stick around for both. Thor : Love and Thunder is the best film of the current phase of the MCU, with a refined pallette, two screaming goats and the original cast back, director Waititi takes the Marvel concept of gods and puts his own unique spin on it resulting in a gloriously camp romantic romp through space.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

The best Ragnarok bits seemed like ad-libbed gold. The funny bits in Love and Thunder seemed forced or too carefully fabricated to be cutesy. Christian Bale's performance was great. His screen time highlighted, in a negative way, how light the rest of the film was. The mix of actual story vs generic hi jinks was off.Helmsworth is committed (jacked for the role). Russell Crowe was entertaining if we can all agree that the heavy Greek accent is acceptable. Natalie Portman does not seem capable of being funny in a film (SNL shorts the exception to the rule). Tess Thompson was great.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Christian Bale is perfection in the role of Gorr, and Taika Watiti finds a way to turn Jane from bland and boring to a very awesome, likeable character. And I don't think this is a Spoiler, as it's been revealed before: Jane has cancer in this movie, and what the film does with it is very great and full of emotion. Chris Hemsworth as THOR IS JUST AMAZING!! Most of the jokes land, though there are some moments that didn't hit with the audience.

But Thor's retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who - to Thor's surprise - inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance and stop him before it's too late.Returning to the franchise after helming 2017's Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi has once again put his unique stamp on the connected universe, creating a film that only he could. With Ragnarok, Waititi debuted a madcap rock-infused adventure romp with a far less serious Thor, creating a break from the previous two films that while, with moments of brilliance, didn't quite live up to the character's potential. Here in Love and Thunder, Waititi brings the same manic energy but slightly tempered, choosing instead to deepen the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster. The result is a film that is true to its name: love and thunder, bringing plenty of humor, action scenes, and a generous helping of character development.While there's plenty to like in Love and Thunder, the film is not without its problems, namely in its villain and its pacing. The first act is a jumbled mess of scenes, hopping all around the galaxy without giving the audience time to settle and orient themselves. The opening scenes lack the emotional gut punch of the original Guardians of the Galaxy; where James Gunn made us immediately care about young Peter Quill and his relationship with his mother, here in Love and Thunder, Waititi doesn't take the effort to fully develop the relationship between Gorr and his daughter. That, plus the subsequent scene after as Gorr meets his god, make for a rocky start to the film that takes a while to recover from. Speaking of The Guardians of the Galaxy, the team appears more as a reminder that they exist and a nice treat to hold us over for Volume Three than for any real plot specific reason, outside of them receiving the initial distress call. Each member, with the exception of Star Lord, gets one or two lines before they take off, making their inclusion for the most part unnecessary. Once the film settles, which unfortunately isn't well into the second act, the ride becomes smoother and more enjoyable.Thor: Love and Thunder doesn't do much to further the overall development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; much like Ragnarok only has a scene of two that props up Infinity War, any longstanding ramification of Love and Thunder are either unclear or nonexistent. Not that that's a problem; the main focus should always be on the film at hand and not the tie in possibilities (looking at you, Age of Ultron). Still, while the fourth phase of the MCU continues to remain murky after the events of Love and Thunder, there are hints of future antagonists for the God of Thunder to clash with down the road.Starring Chris Hemsworth in his eighth outing as the Thor Odinson, Love and Thunder brings a return to form for the chiseled Australian actor. Gone is the flabby dad bod of Avengers: Endgame as the character emerges from his slump and continues to find his purpose in the galaxy. With director Taika Waititi choosing to tap into the previously unharnessed comedic abilities of Hemsworth, Thor as a character has become immensely more charming, if not a bit dumber for the sake of the jokes. This dumbing down of a person who was initially presented with the Shakespearean gravitas of a demigod wrestling with becoming king has ultimately suffered for the drastic change of tone. While Hemsworth seems to enjoy this lighter, campier version, the silliness of his nature juxtaposed against the seriousness of events can at times create a tonal imbalance that was present in Ragnarok and is again present here in Love and Thunder. Still, Hemsworth is never more loveable or dashing then when he's playing Thor and if it's a role he wants to continue to revisit, then it's a role that's guaranteed to keep the audience returning.As for returning, Natalie Portman makes her way back into the MCU as astrophysicist Jane Foster, the first character Thor meets while banished on Earth back in the franchise's first film. Initially unsatisfied with the direction of Thor: The Dark World, Portman departed and has only reappeared through cut footage in Avengers: Endgame during the time heist. Fortunately, lured back by the promise of becoming The Mighty Thor, Portman's grand reentry into the franchise is a bittersweet one: years have passed and when we pick up with Jane Foster, time has not been kind to her. As Jane suffers her battles, Portman once again proves that she's a top-notch actress, delivering the gravity, the humor, and holds her own in action scenes with Hemsworth. The chemistry between the pair is better here in Love and Thunder than it ever was in the first two Thor films; whether that's due in part to having new writers and directors that understand the source material or due to the time the characters have spent apart is inconsequential, it's great to see Thor and Jane mix it up again in both action scenes and in the classic will-they-won't-they trope that only works as good as the actors' commitment to it. Thankfully, in this film, both Portman and Hemsworth commit fully and almost all of their best scenes together over three films are collected in this one outing.Unfortunately, the restoration of Jane Foster's character comes with certain sacrifices, namely by way of Valkyrie, our favorite scrapper from Sakar. King of Asgard, thanks to the denouement of Avengers: Endgame, Tessa Thompson's presence is almost completely overshadowed by the return of Jane Foster. Thompson, equally as charming and charismatic as Hemsworth, doesn't have much to do in the film; a good bit of her time is spent observing Thor and Jane from the sidelines as the pair attempt to figure their relationship out. What little screentime she gets is mostly as a background character with a handful of lines. There's no development to her whatsoever beyond being a beleaguered ruler of her tiny fiefdom who longs to still mix it up in a good fight. Thompson's talents are mostly wasted in this film, which is a shame since she's featured so prominently in Ragnarok.Possibly the most underserved character in the film is its villain, Gorr the God Butcher. Played by Christian Bale of Batman fame, the actor jumped universes to embody one of the most menacing and problematic villains of recent Thor history. With a moniker like 'the God Butcher' and the means to do so, Gorr could easily have joined the ranks of Thanos or Killmonger in terms of threat level and sympathy, but the end result is instead a weak performance backed by weak writing. Far from Bale's best work, Gorr the God Butcher goes missing from the film for entire swaths of time as the heroes traverse the galaxy looking for help in defeating him. He comes alive far too late in the film's third act in a brilliant black and white set piece but by then the damage is done. Instead of a fascinating and complex antagonist, we get something akin to a Phase 1 villain with decent motivation but little development. Bale suffers for it and the film itself suffers for it.Written and directed by Taika Waititi, his second entry into the MCU, Thor: Love and Thunder once again has his fingerprints all over it. Waititi's trademark humor and oddball characters are on full display throughout, delivering a movie unlike any other in the cinematic universe. Where the filmmaker has stepped his game up, however, is in the cinematography department; he, director of photography Barry Idoine, and the visual effects team have managed to create some of the most visually stunning interstellar scenes the audience has been privy to within the MCU so far. While the Phase Four films continue to suffer from some spotty CGI, and Love and Thunder is no exception to this, it's clear that Waititi has thoughtfully crafted a movie that, while less colorful than Ragnarok, is still full of Walt Simonson-inspired treats.Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder takes the zaniness and camp of Thor: Ragnarok and doubles down. Taika Waititi's love of classic rock shines through again as the audience is treated to a number of well placed needle drops and cheer worthy moments. With a visual palette that completely differentiates itself from the rest of the MCU, Waititi has created a film that manages to stand out as one of the more distinct looking films in the oeuvre. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman's chemistry is undeniable, and after almost a decade apart, it's a delight to see the pair together again. Even with its botched first act and underdeveloped villain, the film is still a fun ride in theaters.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Glad to see Portman back in the mix, and how she & Hemsworth get to bring the story of Thor and Jane Foster the closure it deserved. Christian Bale was incredible and I wanted to see more of him as Gorr!!!Not great by any means, but still enjoyable and worth plenty of lols. 6.8 rating.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was very excited for this movie. Visually it was great! Chris Hemsworth is both dramatic, jacked and funny. Sometimes, I agree that he was too goofy, but still funny. Christain Bale as Gorr the God Butcher was fantastic! Perfect role for him. Could have used more of him in this movie. His character needed more backstory to make me care more for his rage and to see his intelligence. The ending of the movie was perfect. Good message, warm and inspiring.My strict criticisms are more about why we needed an Earthling to be Lady Thor, why it has to be Thor's ex, and why they needed Korg to be male if two males can make baby Korgs. Natalie Portman is a very capable actress and plays the human character very well, so I can imagine the Disney writers and producers saying ""Hey, let's screw up this story by forcing in some gender inclusion and feminism regardless of how it compromises the characters.""Well... the effects are that the impossibly brilliant, brave and 'worthy' Dr. Foster and Thor had little chemistry on screen. Thor had better moments with his old hammer. Remember that they met by accident, and then she turns into Lady Thor on her own. She was like a smaller, weaker looking Thor but ironically, just as effective with Thors hammer. It's like Disney lifted this character out of ""Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness"". Dr. Palmer (Rachel McAdams) was the ex-girlfriend of Steven Strange. She turned out to be impossibly brilliant, brave and emotionally superior in that movie thus ruining the dynamic between those characters. What is with Korg? He was funny before, but now he's just a rock face the writers kept around to inject some trans-wokeness into the story.When will Disney just focus on making a good story again or do we need to suffer through hasty written stories with forced ideological elements that few people really to want to see?","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not ""you'll have nightmares"" scary of course, but more like ""this guy is serious"" scary. There is also very mild blood violence in the movie, to a point where it's cool for children to enjoy but wouldn't dissapoint an adult who came there with no serious expectations for gore.The ending is surprisingly unpredictable, and the final battle is equal -dare I say better- to ragnarock.My only setback is how they handled Korg in some moments, and thor's relationship with his weapons is a little cringy.

It seems unable to find the genre it wants to fit in, keeping the same humour from Ragnarok, but mixing it with horror in Bale's Gorr. Neither genre is able to build momentum, meaning typically funny scenes, which would have landed in the previous film, have far less impact, yet the comedy is too constant to allow any other tone for the film.For the most part, the performances of the cast are brilliant. Hemsworth is in phenomenal shape and perfectly encapsulates the Thor character that has come to be the norm, funny and zainy but able to pull the emotional parts off easily. Portman makes an excellent return, displaying the contrast of frailty and power superbly. Bale is outstanding, its a shame Gorr isn't allowed to flourish in a darker context given Bale's performance.Crowe, for me, had a very dodgy 'Greek' accent, and was used as comic relief in a time when it wasn't needed. Zeus was wasted as a whole. Axl/Astrid was also particularly rigid playing Heimdall's son.There is a period around the halfway mark in the Shadow Realm where everything becomes infinitely better, and Bale is able to shine. The use of colour (or lack thereof) is powerful and is the only time where a clear period of terror/darkness is created. They are great scenes, and everything appears to improve, even the CGI.The CGI largely looks pretty good, but particularly during the early stages of the film does appear less crisp, as is frequently becoming the case in MCU films released in this period. However, screen ratio is used very well, often switching, but without much rhyme or reason. Taking up the full screen does make those scenes look particularly good though.The story is from great source material and holds up, but often isn't executed the correct way, and characters feel a little twisted to fit the comedic tone. That's the issue with Love & Thunder, it does not replicate the fun success of Ragnarok, and doesn't have a lot else to fall back on.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Seeing reviews saying Gorr has too little screentime confuses me, I think it was nice as they did it. There were no unessecary plotlines in this movie, which other MCU movies are known for.The movie was visually stunning, even more than Ragnarok. The action was nice and well choreographed. The character had nice development, and I loved that Jane finally had something to care about. After this movie you actually know something about her. About the pacing of the movie, I am not so sure. I had the feeling it was a bit too short maybe. The other Gods in the movie were done very nicely.

"6","/10","An Above Average Mess Of A Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8328592/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2022","One of the most hyped films, Thor: Love and Thunder is out and I have now finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Thor attempting to work himself out when he must team up with his ex Jane Foster in order to stop a new enemy.Main Character
Chris Hemsworth has now played Thor for 11 Years and he could play the role in his sleep. He is great in this film and he is just so good as the character and has made him into a really fun lead character. Thor had a great story arc in Avengers Endgame and it kind of continues here with his character getting an interesting deep dive with a continued progression which is good to see.Supporting Characters
Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was a pretty dull part of the previous Thor films but I actually liked her here and I definitely feel like this is the best she has done. Seeing her take up the role of Mighty Thor is really entertaining and seeing the two Thor's in action adds something fresh to the film. The story between the two of them is well handled and I thought this was the most chemistry that Portman and Hemsworth have had. Tessa Thompson is back as Valkyrie and she is pretty fun once again, her character doesn't get much development but she is always entertaining and Thompson is clearly having a lot of fun in the role. But there are some falters here, Christian Bale plays Gorr The God Butcher and it just didn't work for me. He was a dull villain who wasn't given enough time for you to really care and Bale switches from intense to goofy too often for me and it just makes his character feel inconsistent. Korg is one of my favourite characters in the MCU but he is in this film way too much and his overuse of comedy is too forced and takes away from the overall product. I think it shows that he is best in smaller doses and they shouldn't have him as front and centre as he is here.Story
The story is at its best when it focuses on the relationship between Thor and Jane. There is some real drama here mixed with some nice humour, in interviews it was claimed it would be the biggest part of that film and it succeed here. But the story just feels incredibly rushed and a bit all over the place, it tries to balance really serious moments with comedy and it really doesn't work at all with an ending that also didn't quite work for me.Script
The script is actually quite funny, its not as funny as Ragnarok but there are some chuckle worthy moments. There is some good drama here that is actually quite dark which I don't think people would be expecting to see here. But the film goes way too hard on the comedy and it just doesn't work, the two things clash and create this mess of a script.Style
The film looks really good, the action is pretty exciting and in this day of age the CGI looks really good. Seeing the two Thor's in action is really fun and made the action scenes a bit more fun then it would have been if it had just been Thor. But the film isn't paced very well, it clocks in at around 1 hour 45 and it feels rushed. Also as good as it is, there wasn't one action set piece that really stood out for me.Overall
Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is an above average film that has its moments but it falls way short of expectations and I think only big MCU fans will appreciate it as much as me.Rating - 6/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The relationships between Thor, Loki, Valkyrie, Hulk & Korg are well observed, funny & touching.Now we have Love & Thunder & I couldn't wait to see what Taika Waititi did with Thor in this new adventure.The answer, I'm sorry to say, is make a complete joke of him.I love the underlying humour in the Marvel films, it's what makes them infinitely more watchable than most DC efforts in my opinion, but here the joke wore very thin & very quickly.Cast your mind back to the original Thor film. Chris Hemsworth played him brilliantly, from reckless joker to Earths saviour through his sacrifices.He's a character we all love because he's a God yet utterly relatable & fallible.Well in this he's a clown from start to finish. Every scene with him another opportunity for a cheap gag.Well I'm not laughing & honestly, there wasn't as much as a snigger from the audience today.Christian Bale, one of my favourite actors, is criminally underused when there was the potential to turn Gorr into the next Thanos. Why cast an actor of his credentials & do so little with him?& please, please, please, for the love of Zeus (see what I did there) can films just be made for entertainments sake rather than the current trend of having to fulfil an agenda. 'King' Valkyrie, Korg (who can only mate with other males)
It's just unnecessary tokenism & clumsy.I wondered where Marvel would go after Endgame, & with the exception of Shang Chi & No Way Home, the answer is rapidly downhill, reaching optimal velocity with Thor: Love & Thunder.I shall keep everything crossed for a return to form with Wakanda Forever.","16 out of 27 found this helpful.

It is NOT. I don't think any 5 year old would ask that kind of perverted sexual content.The ""silly"" aspect of Ragnarok had worked because of its deep characters and it had balanced out the burden, the terrible tragedy of Thor. It had so many tragedies and redemption.Love & Thunder follows the same path, minus the tragedy, deep characters and any sort of redemption. I didn't care for anything and anyone in this movie.Ragnarok was hard to watch in theaters because of all the laughter. This one didn't have that problem. I think I laughed once or twice and smiled a couple of times more. The room was silent otherwise.The ending was terrible. Maybe it is because it was too easy to guess. In about 15 minutes, I knew exactly how the movie would turn out. That's not always a bad thing but it doesn't help either.All in all, the movie is naked, like Thor at one point in the movie. Very shallow content on top of vulgar street humor.Then why 6 points? The actors. Chris Hemworth is as charming as he always is as Thor. Natalie Portman and Christian Bale are both accomplished actors and they don't disappoint despite the extremely shallow script they were handed. Tessa Thompson is very good at bringing seriousness to the show. She is truly the Queen (King?)Watch the movie with zero expectations and you might have some fun. Expect another Ragnarok and you'll be sorely disappointed.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Christian Bale NAILED his role in the film, tbh was the only good thing about this movie, other than that, the film was awful. This joky formula Taika has been putting on these last Thor films has already ran dry. Idk I felt this film was too pushy that actually felt forced, they took off all the seriousness and focused issues Thor experimented on the first two films. Luckily for Taika, Ragnarok turned out to be (in my opinion) a great movie, but he wanted to repeat the same formula on this last film but went too far, he just overpassed the limit that it felt actually cringe. I really liked the dark scenario for Christian Bale's scenes but they ruined them with even more silly jokes moments later on.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Thor joins forces with Valkyrie(Tessa Thompson), Korg(Taika Waititi) & old flame Jane Foster(Natalie Portman), to fight Gorr the God Butcher(Christian Bale), who plans to eradicate all gods.Thor: Love and Thunder is a mind-blowing film. Director Taika Waititi has knocked it out of the park yet again, after Thor: Ragnarok(2017). The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor in the movie is guffaw worthy. There are also emotional moments, that differentiates this film from its 2017 predecessor. My favorite movie in Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. Hemsworth goes from strength to strength each time he plays the God of Thunder. Natalie Portman is spectacular as Jane Foster/The Mighty Thor. Portman's triumphant return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe surpassed my already sky high expectations. Chris Hemsworth & Natalie Portman share effortless camaraderie together. Christian Bale is unforgettable as Gorr. Bale's performance makes his character one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tessa Thompson is excellent as King Valkyrie. Taika Waititi is hilarious as Korg. Russell Crowe is superb as Zeus. The supporting cast is great. The cameos are memorable. Thor: Love and Thunder is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Go, have a whale of a time watching it on the big screen. Can't wait for the next Thor film!","18 out of 52 found this helpful.

It's decent, and Christian Pale (sorry, terrible joke) gives a great performance as Gorr The God Butcher - an interesting antagonist with a great motive. Like I say, the movie had a pretty great start with a solid first two acts. It just goes way downhill after that with a bad ending.

And you get into the edit. You're like, ""I still kind of like it."" And then, after about six months of it being in the movie, you realize it was fun on the day but it doesn't have any business being in the movie""Thor - Chris Hemsworth: ""It was Taika at his craziest. Taika, normally, is kind of at an 11, so you can do the math there. He described it as like he'd been given the keys to the kingdom, and someone said, 'Here, if a seven-year-old was making a movie, what would you do?' He said, 'Well, I want to put this in it. I want to do this. I want to try this.' And everything he suggested, I said yes to, and then we had this insane film in front of us.""Story - the core plot of the movie is actually good and has a lot of potential. However the scenes advancing the plot are few and far between, edited to be as short as possible feeling rushed. Each plot scene is then undercut with a comedy scene that immediately follows. Serious plot points aren't given room to breathe the way they were in Ragnarok. This movie plays like a clown dancing at a funeral.The worst issue is that the comedy doesn't work like it did in Ragnorok. Taika Waititi appears to be a one trick pony like M. Night Shyamalan. He doesn't evolve, he just gives you more of the same. All of the comedy is basically ""look at this random thing"" e.g. The goats bleat dozens of times for a supposed laugh. Just like Shyamalan, Waititi inserted himself into this movie. His character Korg unlike in Ragnorok is now one of the main characters present throughout the plot.Performances - The performances were good. Chris Hemsworth literally embodies Thor, Christian Bale is amazing and plays a complex and sympathetic character (too good for this movie). The rest of the cast does a good job as well.Visuals - Overall the best way I can describe them is a supersaturated rainbow splashed all over the screen. Visuals however are poorly done. The movie uses new tech that projects the background behind the actors. Problem is that in all the close up shots, it looks exactly for what it is. Actors appear in the foreground superimposed on the environment. Try watching the trailer in slow motion, you'll see it. Overall it's underwhelming for a modern movie and disappointing for an MCU oneOverall - This movie commits the worst crime of all: it was boring. You can't invest yourself into the story as it's constantly uncut by jokes and you can't enjoy a comedy since the jokes don't land, seemingly targeted at very young audience.Unfortunately I have to give this 1/10 judging by the MCU standards.","22 out of 40 found this helpful.

The way I see it, before we get anywhere near where this new stage is going, it's more of a comic relief then serious plot.My issue is that they tried so hard to make ""modern"" Journey comic alike. Feeling but with a movie cannon instead of comics, resulting as many pointed out, really really lame jokes and wasted potential.Performance, production and overall CGI aside, the entire plot was like a side show, just to change a direction and somehow invent purpose of keeping Thor as part of universe, and maybe some small part in the main cannon.The whole Jane and Thor love saga, got it's conclusion and.in a way, it was lame and crafty way to put a final touch. Now the question is, are we going to stop pumping 70% of video tape, lame jokes and actually focus on building stronger plots and characters?I really love marvel and I sticking with it, for that reason alone, I am no where near diehard fun, hence I am losing interest with each new installment rapidly and this new trend needs to stop.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, what happens in between, particularly the humour I found to be very hit and miss. I do appreciate though that humour is in the eye of the beholder and others may find that it works.There is one concept associated with the Jane Foster character that was a great idea and the most serious aspect of the plot. Having this in a screenplay that tries to be mostly funny could have worked had the comedy been better, however for me the jokes are not strong enough to pull it off.The funniest parts involve the Guardians of the Galaxy characters interacting with Thor. From then on it relies exchanges between Thor, Valkarie and Jane to entertain. The actors do a great job with the lines, but I don't think the banter is funny or witty enough during the majority of the scenes.The scene involving Zeus is not overly bad, but again I didn't find the material good enough to be played as much for laughs as it is. Personally I think they should have done it as a suspenseful dramatic sequence, with light elements of humour and have the heroes emerge triumphantly to the same piece of music.Christian Bale's performance is a big positive and he brings to life one of the better MCU baddies. Chris Hemsworth leads it very well. Natalie Portman is good and so is Tessa Thompson.As you would expect from a Disney product, the visuals are quite spectacular, but for me scenes of superheroes battling various computer generated monsters all blend into one these days. There is a memorable sequence involving children in battle that is the best moment of spectacle for me.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

And this is also the first time I have written a review for a movie on Imdb. Even though I have watched almost every movie ever made; I feel compelled to write something for Thor: Love & Thunder.For those who have not encountered Taika in his true form; or maybe have just learnt about him, you need to understand a few small things. Instead of describing what you ought to know about him, watch these movies instead - ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"", ""Boy"" and ""Eagle Vs Shark"".As someone who grew up with the cinema that inspired Taika, I understand how amazing this movie is. And I also understand why most people find this movie strangely discontinuous (be it through humour or tone or anecdote).Taika's ability to direct a movie has always come across as ultra-subjective; from the point of view from one character. This distorts the reality of what the viewer experiences. It shades it. Colors it. And gives it a true comic realization. ""Jojo Rabbit"" was one of the best examples of this. Another movie that most people didn't quite get; 'a small boy that has an imaginary friend that is ""his"" idea of Hitler'. There are details in this imagination that shows that ""Hitler"" is purely from the point of view from someone who doesn't have all the facts. He tells a story based on what he thinks is real. This gives the story comedy, satire and tragedy all at once.This is what Thor: Love and Thunder is. It is a story based on Korg's idea of what happened. We felt the same in Ragnarok when Thor told the story. Everything has a 'shade' based on the recollection of one person (if you are unsure of this, watch Ragnarok again with this in mind). And that person shifts the story to be reflective of themselves (characteristically speaking).If you are going to watch this movie; try to imagine that Korg (everyone's favourite character from Ragnarok) is telling us a story.This is a fable.Accuracy is not required in fantasy.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

In that film, Thor completely shed the Shakespearean grandeur that was given to him by Kenneth Branagh, and the character transformed into a generator of quips. In some aspects, Love and Thunder doubles down on that, and it also does some things better. The end result is a serviceable product that can entertain you for two hours, but the character of Thor deserves so much more.For a movie that so ostensibly identifies as a comedy, the majority of Love and Thunder is painfully unfunny. Taika Waititi seems to genuinely believe that the joke becomes only better if you keep on repeating it throughout the whole movie. The best example of it is Korg, a character played by Waititi himself. He was loved by many after Ragnarok, but the movie keeps shoving him into almost every scene until you become sick of his shtick. In the interviews, Waititi likes to mention how he wants to avoid cliches, but his writing of the dialogues is full of them. For example, a joke based on contrasting Korg's naive and childlike behavior with him suddenly starting to psychoanalyze Valkyrie's drinking issues using pseudo-deep speeches. Last time a joke like this was good was in one of the earlier SpongeBob episodes.Even the comedic performances seem stilted. It's like Waititi decided to cut the real takes from the movie, and then replaced them with bloopers, which is why so many scenes just feel awkward and not really genuine. Waititi uses comedy to deflate drama so often that even the moments that are supposed to feel epic feel empty, because you stop expecting the movie to be serious. Only the romance between Thor and Jane somewhat overcomes this problem. Their story has real stakes, and Hemsworth and Portman are able to elevate this material even higher.Christian Bale is undoubtedly the best part of the movie. However, there is no continuity between Gorr we see in the opening and Gorr of the rest of the movie. Yeah, the dark forces gave him a sinister motivation, but there was this sudden shift in personality as well. It could've been built up better, and maybe it was. Apparently, many scenes were cut, and it's possible that at least some of them contained important character development for Gorr.The action scenes and the soundtrack are good. There are some bad VFX shot, but the dynamic color palette of the movie makes you ignore it. Together with Thor and Jane's storyline, as well as Bale's performance, these elements make the movie watchable. However, they may not be enough to make it memorable.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The pacing is atrocious, there´s no depth to characters or moments, scenes cut and bleed into each other with no moment to spare for breathing or relevance. Theres this sense of lack of focus on the creative team, making the film unbearably light toned like it was made for 12 year old's.

There are pros and cons to this film 100%... Christian Bale 10/10 performance definitely was the highlight of the actors on this film maybe almost under utilised with Chris Hemesworth of course playing a fantastic Thor, Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman also respectively playing there roles well.

And I have to admit that this wasn't a movie that I was going to be rushing out to the cinema to watch.But now that it has become readily available for the streaming masses, of course I opted to watch it. Granted, I am not really much of a superhero movie fan, but I do watch them for their entertainment value. And Marvel Studios do tend to make some entertaining enough superhero-based movies.Writers Taika Waititi and Jennifer Kaytin Robinson managed to put together a very entertaining movie here. And I don't really understand all the grief that this movie has been getting. But hey, I suppose every movie franchise has a group of toxic fans. I was genuinely entertained by ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". And it turned out to be a good combination of archetypical superhero movie mixed with comedy. I liked that particular approach that director Taika Waititi took with this movie.The storyline was good and well-written. It definitely felt like a ""Thor"" movie, and also like something you would find within the pages of a Marvel comic book. So thumbs up on that accomplishment.Something that really impressed me with ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was the cast ensemble. This movie has so many talents on the cast list, granted lots of them in smaller roles, but it was such a great cast ensemble. But the real stars of the movie were the two giant goats. They just cracked me up.Visually then ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" was everything you would expect from a Marvel Studios movie. Lots of great visuals, vibrant colors, fantastic costume designs, amazing sets, and so forth. So you are in for quite a visual treat here with this movie.As for the music in the movie, well, that was a mixed bag of nuts. The score was good, but the songs in the movie, well, not so much. I just didn't find Guns 'n Roses to be a particularly fitting band for a movie such as this.I am rating ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" a solid six out of ten stars.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's not a marvel movie. It's not a rom com. It's not an action juggernaut. It's
a spoof of all the above. This is not a movie that doesn't take itself seriously. It's a movie that is seriously trying to not get made. Every scene and every joke is made with the intention of Disney/Marvel sitting it down. It's like the play in The Producers. It feels like Taika and company knew that this movie had no expectations and that marvel and its fans Will accept almost anything at this point. I love the romance angle being about the weapons and shunting every characters emotions off to the side just for Korg to over explain every detail so we can move onto the action. This movie doesn't care at all about what anyone wanted or expected. It serves one purpose: to question the validity of super hero movies and then amount of quality, attention, and detail it takes for people to actually be tricked into thinking they're good movies. This movie is the ultimate self aware super hero satire.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's good that Waititi didn't give a rat's behind about anything and just made an entertaining film instead! If you liked Ragnarök, you will probably like this one, too.It's not all perfect, though. The first half an hour felt like a long exposition on an amateur theater stage. The next half of hour seemed like every friend of Taika's showed up for a cameo and a free lunch. The film never takes itself seriously, which is either good or bad, depending on your expectations. Also, it felt like a lot of stuff was crammed into one hour and a half and maybe a two hour movie wouldn't have been so... staccato.Yet the pros are stronger than the cons: Christian Bale did great with the few scenes where he got to act, there was a lot of humor and the Guns'n'Roses theme of the film helped a lot with the heroic battle scenes. Hemsworth's charisma was at full strength and even Natalie Portman's character, usually a filler with little agency, was interesting and fun. Too bad about Sif, who had like two scenes in the entire film and didn't leave it intact.Bottom line: a godly rock'n'roll extravaganza, bordering on parody, but entertaining. Just don't try to take it seriously.","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

Thor L&T is exactly what I was expecting and hoping, a lighthearted, sweet funny movie aimed to out inner child with a bit of rom com, a pretty decent baddy (Christian Bale will always do his job mightily) and a few hilarious cameos (the mid-credit scene made me explode), not to mention great Guns'n Roses themed soundtrack. Please stop complaining that Marvel lost his touch after Endgame, you know what? The new phase might be not aimed at you, hardcore fan that checks every detail by the book, perhaps to a new generation of 12 years old. Beside, Chris Hemsworth is comedy gold and I will never get tired of it.

Thor embarks on a journey pretty different from anything he's ever faced its a bit goofy and silly LOL but is ultimately a quest for inner peace. However, his retirement gets interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher, a galactic killer who seeks the extinction of the gods. It is probably best to call it a Marvel 'comedy' because you cant take the plot seriously but its visual effects and Marvel authenticity do not disappoint, I know people are saying its bad but its honestly just not what they are used to when it comes to Marvel, especially with the image of Thor that is in everyone's mind before watching the movie. I have no bad words about it besides my personal dislike to the female Thor, but the ending was absolutely beautiful and I think I can call it a classic.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It essentially was a 2 hour film that made a joke of his character mixed with action. But the movie wasn't all terrible. It was enjoyable to some degree and made us laugh with as well many battle scenes that left us on the edge of our seats as well as the sweet ending that left us pondering what's to come next especially with all these new youngsters entering in... but overall we gave it a 6/10 because all though we would like to see Thor in a more serious role/being taken more serious the ending reeled is back in and gave us im enjoyment that the beginning didn't.

The trailer. If you've seen the official trailer then you've seen the best parts of the movie.I have thoroughly enjoyed every MCU movie so far. I was hoping for something along the Ragnarok lines, but this was horrid. This thing is swimming in ""B"" movie waters.With Disney at the helm I should have been prepared for the underwhelming writing/plot/directing etc. - the movies humor is targeted towards tweens. There aren't any witty subtleties one would expect from Marvel. Knowing what I know now, I would have waited for it to come out on a streaming service. Do not waste your money! The theater was only about 1/4 full on a weekend which should have told me something. If my wife who bought the tickets wasn't sitting next to me I would have left half way through or at least started reading the news on my phone and finished my popcorn. The audience never laughed or anything. They were like how Drax describes his wife in the second Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It was amazing that people were so quiet.I found myself tuning out and looking at my watch for most of the movie. I hate writing a review like this for a MCU movie but with enough reviews like this maybe Disney will do an about face on future MCU movies. The fact they took a strong character like Thor and reduced him to a bumbling fool to elevate others in the movie was sad.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

The rating obviously a reflection of people that were overwhelmingly seeing those problems and yet failed to grab the true meaning of the movie. This is actually a good mockery of the people in power or authority, and those who follows them blindly without questioning, well as the people who worship false idols. The other great message of this movie is the choice and struggle between love and hatred, and the consequences it would cause. Of course the movie is full of bad actions, silly conversations and costumes with cgi quality of commercials with bad composing, which was quite the result of changing endlessly by marvels directions which has ridiculously little time for the artists to execute, but actually by the meaning of it this movie deserves a better review and credit, which was way better than soulless and empty ones like shangchi and black panther.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Some great things were done with light, darkness, and color. I know shadow monsters are supposed to be shadowy, but there could have been a way to make them a little more distinct from the background for the purpose of viewing.Sound: B+
Technically very good. I thought some effect could have been used on Gorr's voice to draw us in more.Plot: A
I really liked the storyline. I thought it was stronger than Spider-Man: No Way Home, which was a much better movie. How the story was executed was a bigger issue.Pacing: C+
It didn't seem overly long or drawn-out, and it didn't do too much ADHD editing. Some of the exposition was superfluous and came at the expense of scenes that should've been included.Screenplay: C-
I would have enjoyed more scenes of Gorr before he encountered Thor to build a level of dread and tension. It seemed as if Waikiki were too concerned about breaking the tension that he didn't allow it to build. Some of the problems with the dialogue overlap with the acting. The tone was a little too campy. It wasn't Schumacher Batman and Robin levels of camp, but it was a little much. A lot of the jokes didn't quite land. The goats were funny, but they quickly became tiresome.Acting: C-
I know Hemsworth wants to show his comedic chops, but Thor plays so much better as a straight man, both for the purpose of the story and for the comedic elements. It didn't seem like there was a straight man in the bunch, which made it a little tiresome. One of the worst things actors can do is try to be funny. Hemsworth and Portman, who are both very good veteran actors and can do comedy, seemed to have been trying too hard with some of the banter. Tessa Thompson probably did the best job of striking the right balance between earnestness and comedy among the heroes. Christian Bale was Christian Bale. I think audiences were robbed of what could've been an even better performance by how the story was executed. Russell Crowe was enjoyable as Zeus.Other: The effects looked nice, but I judge current comic book movies by how well they mesh live action and CG elements. I thought the meshing could've been a little better. I think future directors should consider using practical effects and set pieces to a greater degree if possible.Overall: C.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

THAT'S what this movie is to me! It came out today on Disney+ and I was so amped to see this one! IT'S MOSTLY STUPID! Sure, it's got a few serious moments, but again mostly stupid and goofy! So far, this is my LEAST favorite Thor movie. The other ones had a few laughs and funny moments, but this one was obviously written by a gag writer! The beginning starts out with Thor on another world with the guardians of the galaxy, minus one member, (I'll let you figure out which one...) and it just gets stupid from there. I'm REALLY glad I didn't go to the theaters to see this. RAGANOK was better than this! And by the way, the ONLY reason I gave this a higher than 4 rating was then ending made me misty.

But there's so much wrong about this film like the fact that it's a rom-com. It shouldn't be a comedy with someone as dark as Gorr as it's villian. The movie felt too short. They definitely could've expanded the runtime by adding sequences of Gorr killing Gods since it really lacks that considering that Gorr's is literally called ""The God Butcher"". It was very strange and made zero sense for Mjolnir and Strombreaker to have feelings. And Gorr should've lived for at least one more movie. Christian Bale's performance was too good but unfortunately he didn't get as much screentime as he deserved. Overall, it's a solid, fun movie. But that's the problem, it should've been more serious. If that's not a problem, you will certainly enjoy Thor: Love and Thunder.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While the comic book version is a well respected, epic and powerful character the MCU version is the complete opposite. Kevin Feige has allowed Taika and Chris to run-a-muk with the character to the point where he is clearly being mocked. It is unfortunate because Thor could have been Marvel's Game of Thrones sans the f-bombs and sex scenes. Love & Thunder was difficult to watch. The ill timed, drag on, and eye rolling gags spoiled an epic story from the comics. It was also not necessary. Man of Steel reintroduced Superman without forcing the humor.

I fully understand people's complaints about the humor but I still had a great time with this movie. At times, it does feel like a spoof of Thor, which does undercut the movie's serious moments(which it does have a few of). However, it's just hard to hate a movie that I saw with my loved ones and put a great smile on my face. And let's talk about those aforementioned performances. I wasn't sure what I'd think of Lady Thor, Natalie Portman did very well in the role. And while it was nice seeing Thor and Jane reunite, the real standout here was Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher. He was extremely creepy and intimidating, which is a slight departure from his performance as the caped crusader but a welcome one nonetheless. If you're looking for a fun time, go see this movie, but if you thought the humor was cranked up too much in Ragnarok, then you definitely won't like this one. Overall, I rank TLT above the first two but not quite as good as Ragnarok. Rating: 7.5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thor (the original) and Korg are just interested in giving goofy lines devoid of seriousness in anything.

I understand Thor's behavior sometimes is silly and childish but this is what makes his personality more interesting and funny, and I always want him to be like this.

It had its funny moments but why were the guardians even in this movies tasting? If you were late in the concession line you probably missed them. Probably a little disappointed that marvel continues the slow rollout of characterstoo. Starting to think marvel is more worried about pumping out cookie cutter movies than putting the effort into following what the guys who actually created these characters built. Up next Thunderbolts...with 6 characters with the exact same skill sets. Yawn.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ragnorak is simply one of the very best MCU movies there is. While they failed to get close to Ragnorak's greatness, they did manage to still make a pretty decent movie worthy of being in the MCU.I was worried at first because I HATED the first 15 minutes or so. The use of the GOTG just seemed to forced and mis directed, but after that they did manage to redirect the energy and pump it up a notch.My only criticism (other than the GOTG issue) was the inserted woke ism. I come to the theaters to get away from the issues of the world for 2 hours and just enjoy myself....now this isn't a unique Love & Thunder issue, its a Hollywood issue so I do give the director a bit of a pass for that.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are more than a few flat and cringy moments in this movie. Thor: Love and Thunder would have worked better if there had been fewer forced jokes and more serious moments. The opening battle scene was chuckle-worthy but the phoned-in delivery by the crew of GOTG was a hint at what was to come. Don't get me wrong, I thought the acting by the main actors were fine. But they didn't seem completely sold on the script or the dialogue and didn't have the heart or nerve to tell Waititi. So it's off to work they go, delivering their lines the best they could, hoping that the audience would go along for the ride after 2+ years of Netflix at home. The 3 or 4 times that I actually laughed were honest laughs but the majority of the time, I was wishing that Taika would dispense with the attempt at humor and just get on with the story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this one is next. The problem with this movie is:1. It's the same subplot with Thor ""finding himself"", which is overdone at this point.2. The dark/sad tone and moments of this movie is often overshadowed by the humor. Which just doesn't work well as even in the darkest moments, they follow it up with some cheesy joke that just feels out of place.3. The humor is great as always. But sadly many of the jokes end up feeling less funny and more cringy. The tried to hard.4. The goats..... people either loved them or hated them...strongly. And they really went over board with the goats to the point of the joke lost its charm afterawhile.5. While Bale did an amazing job as Gorr. Again, the serious/dark nature of him was still lost or less effective due tot he constant humor. The contrast really threw things off.6. The story overall sort of felt all over the place and almost rushed. I hate to say it but the best parts were in the trailer.7. Lastly they really pushed the bounds of ""out there"" ideas from the comics. It had its moments of corniness where many said it was overboard. For example one of the gods we meet is literally a cartoony looking. Boa is the dumpling god. He has a anime look and smile. I laughed, but many thought it was just stupid. Moments like this were to much for most audiences it seemed.In the end, I personally enjoyed the movie. But I can see why so many felt the movie had some issues. I love Thor, I just hope in the future they resolve these issues. I think part of it may also be Taika Waititi's role in the making of the movie. As great as he is, sometimes he needs to have some more restraint.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

V. show possible, this was just painful. There was no depth and any pieces that should have been serious were ruined by throwing in jokes that just didn't land. When I saw Ragnarok in theatres, people were laughing and cheering. With Love and Thunder, I think I heard 10 people laugh in a crowded theater?Russell Crowe, thank you for making this SO MUCH WORSE!!! The acting was awful, accent horrible and character development atrocious. Zeus was supposed to be the most powerful god and then a past-his-prime Russell Crowe came out, started talking in whatever accent he thought that was, and my husband and I just looked at each other and sighed. I truly hope that they NEVER use him in this role again. It hurt to watch.Christian Bale was probably the best part of the movie, but I agree with others that the ""god-slayer"" didn't really do enough slaying.They truly did Natalie Portman wrong in this movie. Everyone got their hopes up and she could have been incredible, but the writing just didn't push her to her full potential.Marvel, PLEASE stop trying so hard. Everything about this felt forced. Just like certain parts of Dr. Strange and Eternals felt forced.Overall, the worst Marvel movie I have seen. Hands down. I wasn't worried about the future of Marvel, even after slightly lackluster Dr. Strange 2 and Eternals, but now I am.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was disappointing though. I thought the pacing a too fast and they could've dialed back on the humor a bit. Some of the jokes didn't land either. Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher was underutilized, but whenever he was on screen, his performance was spine chilling. He was definitely a better villain than Hela. What would've really added to his character is if they had shown him slaying the gods to show how much of a threat he is, rather than having it done off screen. The strongest part of the film was the dynamic between Jane and Thor. Their dynamic in the first two installments was lackluster, but in here we get more emotional weight that works so well. Natalie Portman was fantastic as The Mighty Thor. Overall, this wasn't as bad as some were saying it was but it's nothing groundbreaking either.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Undercutting the requisite heroism with sly, at times anarchic, humour, Ragnarok delivered one of the freshest and best movies in the MCU.So how does Love and Thunder get it all so wrong? One word: Comedy. Whereas it's predecessor balanced the story and action almost perfectly with it's humour, here Thor's world is turned into an almost slapstick farce with every actor involved seemingly out to prove they can do 'comedy ' (yes, even Natalie Portman, unbelievably). Unfortunately, most of the humour falls flat as a pancake.Love and Thunder also manages to waste two of the biggest recent storylines in Thor's comic history and squander one of his best villains in Gorr the God Butcher. Thor himself has been reduced to a bumbling man-child, who spends the entire movie staring at Jane Foster like a lovestruck teenager with a hammer fetish.Talking of fetishes, someone involved in the film also has a serious Guns 'n' Roses obsession. The band are plastered all over this movie to a distracting level for some bizarre reason - tunes, posters. T-shirts all feature prominently, with even one character insisting he be called Axl! No doubt it helps Slash's retirement fund, but it's just another strike against the film.Overall, it's a massive disappointment and Thor needs a giant course correction if the character is to stay relevant and have any real heroic purpose within the MCU.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline was shallow, there is good humour yes and I get that it's a big part of the show, I love the comedy aspect but I need a properly told story with it - and I'm not getting one.Some elements were just silly, and the whole film seemed more concerned with how many one liners they could fit into the 2 hrs (which felt SO RUSHED, why not longer?), than they were with creating a storyline that the cast and characters deserve.I personally believe James Gunn is the man for these movies, but that's just me.If Thor is returning - give him different writers and different directors, because the current ones are failing to produce what could be a masterpiece.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it seems what he wanted to do with his latest Thor offering is either push the boundaries as far as he could, or dump on a franchise so much that it's beyond repair, or both. The result is a slap in the face to fans and another dent in Marvels credibility.Stick to vampire spoofs and stop vandalising comic book characters.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Once I was completely delighted and even admired some films. Then the pictures became average, but they could be interesting. Now I see Frankenstein's monsters on the screens more often, screaming, trying to squeeze something out of themselves.It's always very difficult to find the line between humor and drama. And if the cinema can show both faces in one work and find the right edge, then it's just great. Taika Waititi has already missed the second time with a film about Thor. And if in the last picture it was still possible to really laugh or be sad, now everything is very bad (at the same time I just adore his film 'What we do in the Shadows'). Why, after a really sad scene, immediately give out a humorous, which is not even funny, but stupid? And so on throughout the film. It knocks down the whole pace of viewing so much that the finale is just bland and non-working. Our children have been kidnapped here, and we immediately move on to the idiotic showdown of Thor and Jane.

Thor: Love and Thunder has finally been released in theaters. The MCU is back before us with more content that we've been clamoring for. This movie follows Thor as he enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Bestie Korg and ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster, to fight Gorr the God Butcher, who intends to make all of the gods extinct.You know with these MCU movies we have to talk about the storyline and the bigger picture. First, a newbie could definitely just watch this movie and not be completely lost about what's going on. As Korg narrates at key points in the movie, he's able to bring us all up to speed. Secondly, I'm no comic book expert but to me this movie doesn't move the universe along that much if at all, which is good. I feel everyone is too wrapped up in how it plays into the phases and multiverse and blah blah blah, which just causes people to not be immersed in and entertained by the product in front of them (*cough cough* alluding to what people did to the Dr. Strange movie but no one asked me, so I'll move on). Lastly, this movie is full of heart. Thor, Jane, and Gorr will pull on your heartstrings throughout in unexpected ways. While some of their plot points weren't fully fleshed out, I recognize that it's hard to make these movies feel important after the emotional depth in Endgame. Nevertheless, Taika's direction and the writing definitely tried their best to fill the movie with heart and humor. Let's move on to the cast.Christian Bale does his thing as Gorr. He's so creepy in this. Bale has a way of slithering across the screen and being menacing even though he's not necessarily physically imposing. Marvel could've taken this to the next level in dastardliness, but it seems like the MCU is building to an overarching Big Bad and don't yet want to give us that Thanos-like figure. Who knows? We may have seen that Big Bad already, but the MCU hasn't truly featured them yet. Anyway! Thor, on the other hand, while goofy and fun, campy, and still beastly, he does come off a bit too corny. And, it's hard to say because some of the exact same moments are definitely going to be moments that people enjoy. The same goes for Korg as well. Taika does a great job voicing Korg, but at times it's a bit much or unnecessary. The fact that he narrates a lot of the movie could be a turn off to viewers. Korg is great in small pebbles but the whole rock mound gets a bit annoying. Our friend, Jane Foster can be annoying too but her bash head Thor-ness is definitely fun to watch. Marvel definitely found a way to make Jane come into her own and not just as a Thor carbon copy, which I enjoyed. I wish I could say the same for Valkyrie. They didn't really let my girl Tessa really shine in this movie. After Ragnarok, I think we wanted that boss chick featured again. Unfortunately, she was more of a bell and whistle than a co-star. Those are the people you come to see but there are a bunch of small characters that either melt your heart, annoy you a bit, make you laugh, or want to see more of. Srangely that mixture, actually gives a movie life. It's just Marvel doing Marvel things making you want more.Long story short, Thor: Love and Thunder while maybe not Ragnarok doesn't fall too far from the tree. Marvel, Taika and Kevin Feige just continue a strong MCU/Thor Franchise. This movie will make you laugh, hold on to your seat, awe at the action, suck back thug tears and more.

I love Taika Waititi style and how he combin comedy and drama, but in this case the comedy is in way higher levels. The epic scenes are ruined by some dad jokes.The acting is the strongest part from this movie. Evryone is brilliant. I love the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Christian Bale.The characters are just ok, nothing more, nothing less. I'm really not a fan of there interpretation of Zeus.Overall: This is not the best movie you can watch but fun is garanteed!

Good villain. Jane is back. Interesting plot. And then in the second act it feels like the Santa Clause 3 with the tooth fairy and Father Time. Improbable things even for an MCU movie. Or maybe it felt more like the Lego movie with all the heroes in the great hall. Either way, it killed the momentum and made it a farce before act three where it came back down to earth. Bale was great. Portman was good as well. It's just unfortunate that odd story devices were introduced to the movie. Overall, not the worst Thor movie, but nowhere near the level of Ragnarok. Waititi might be getting a bit of a big head and taking his directing a little too far. Bottom line... if you like Thor you will find things to like. It's an enjoyable movie with many great parts. It just has parts that really drag it down as well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Let me start the review with saying Thor: Love and Thunder's first act (or first half,) is indeed not great. The humor falls flat a lot, the CGI is questionable at times( this is actually a problem throughout the movie ) and I just couldn't shrug off the corporate-lifeless feel during those parts. I was patiently waiting for the movie to move onto the more interesting scenes. And luckily, the movie did! (Sort of)When the movie entered the 2nd act and started to focus less on comedy and more on action and emotions, my investment improved quite a bit. (Even though jokes were still there and they were still kinda cringe, but they were better than before) The battle of the Shadow Realm has one of MCU's most visually interesting choices, and I actually had to hold back my tears during the final moments, did not expect the villain to be the heart of a MCU movie. But Gorr definitely would have benefited from more screen time tho. Since he was basically absent during the second act. Even though the movie does have some emotional moments during the final act, I'd say one of the biggest problems of the movie is the lack of tension / urgency. A character supposedly dies or gets injured badly, but turns out it is not a big deal later on. Also, The movie sort of feels like a 'Stepping Stone' type movie. While the movie overall was fun, I don't think there were any meaning ful arc for Thor. After watching the movie I am more interested in directions the Thor character can go after this one.Overall the movie definitely could have been better, and lowering my expectations did help my experience I think. Same thing happened with Eternals last November. But just like that movie, it was overall a decent experience. I don't know about my feelings about the movie after some time passes tho.6.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I expected worse. Lately, Marvel movies haven't been reaching the quality they once did, so I wasn't expecting anything special, and that's probably why I'm not disappointed in the finale. It went by pleasantly quickly because there was a lot of action, which I thought was pretty epic in places, but there's just one catch. Story-wise, it's not such a joy anymore. There is a lot of humour. A lot. That's a classic with Marvel movies, but here there's perhaps I would say a little more of it. I generally don't like a lot of jokes in superhero movies. I prefer more serious superhero ventures, like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but that's beside the point. There were several times in the story where one character was speaking to tell the story and that bothered me. I don't like it much and rarely like it, but sometimes it's cool, but here I didn't like it. Then as I mentioned the humor is really over the top here, which wasn't my cup of tea either. I don't want to spoil, but story-wise it wasn't a total win either. Well it was saved for me by the aforementioned action, which I enjoyed and which Marvel can and probably always will, except for Eternals. That was pretty damn weak in my opinion and Thor: Love Like Thunder is still fine in comparison. So, for me, a good movie that although I would recommend to Thor fans, I might not after all because it gets quite the hate. It's hard to say. My friends were really disappointed with this movie. I'm satisfied though and for me it was fine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought the humour in it did a great job counterbalancing the really dark subject matter (destruction of Asgard); the humour enhanced the film. I went to see Thor: Love and Thunder giddy with high expectations, but was immensely disappointed.The quality of writing in LaT in comparison to its predecessor is like particularly sordid fan fiction by someone who completely misinterpreted what made Ragnarok so great. (It's worth noting that Taika Waikiki did not write Ragnarok, only directed it. And none of the screenwriters from Ragnarok were involved in the making of this film.)There is no real plot. Dialogues are horrid, chock-full of very forced out-of-place elementary school level ""humour"". Directing, editing, and even a lot of the CGI feel like rushjobs. Most acting is bad. The only one who seemed to put real effort into this was Christian Bale, who unfortunately has very little screen time.To sum it up, Love and Thunder is an astonishingly bad movie. It is nothing but a cavalcade of bad jokes, pointless meandering, glaring plot holes, and degradation of the character that was Thor.","58 out of 122 found this helpful.

After the highs of Ragnarok, this movie is really a letdown. Only Dark World saves it from being the worst Thor movie.Chris Hemsworth is back as in-shape Thor. There is a silly montage showing him getting back in shape. He is bouncing around with the Guardians of the Galaxy before returning to New Asgard when it is in trouble. Tessa Thompson returns as King Valkyrie and quizzically seems incredibly disinterested in the role. Natalie Portman is back after missing the last couple of movies and she is supposed to be taking over the mantel of Thor. Even Jaimie Alexander is back as Sif, but her role is so small and inconsequential, I'm not really sure why she bothered. The new villain is Christian Bale as Gorr, the God Butcher. He is okay in the role, but the character doesn't really elevate the movie the way Kate Blanchet did in Ragnarock. Even Russell Crowe gets dusted off to play Zeus...yea, the Greek god. And its cringe inducing.Oddly, there is almost no chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman in this sequel. Their romantic scenes have no spark and Portman seems so detached. I got no sense that they were in love. The events in the move have almost as little spark as well. There is nothing that hasn't been done in prior movies and it felt so blah. If this was not an established part of the MCU, this movie would have bombed...hard.One highlight is Matt Damon, Liam Hemsworth, Sam Neill and, even Melissa McCarthy, as the Asgard actors doing plays about the events of the previous movie. It was pretty funny, but when the highpoint of your movie is a small callback to the previous film, you might have a problem.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has very little contributions to the rest of the MCU and has little impact. And, honestly, I like it that way. It feels refreshing, light, and easier to watch for viewers who have not kept up with the MCU's ever-increasing library of projects.This movie does not have an amazing, touching, or perfect plot. There are logical fallacies, there are lazy plot devices, and there are so many cliches done over and over. But that's OK. Because this movie never wanted any of those things- it simply wanted to deliver a hilarious, Thor-centric story from Taika Waititi's amazing directing mind. These other reviews are insanely idiotic for not understanding the point of film- it is purely based on enjoyment.This movie has an objectively weak plot. I will not deny that. But it was never intended to be anything more. This movie is a Romcom, through and through. Shallow, maybe, but hilarious all the same.And just like Thor has done before, I say ""another!"" to you, Marvel Studios.

The film has a great collection of great actors who I don't know how they agreed to participate in this fraud (They are only reason I gave one more star).

If you want a typical superhero movie that takes itself very seriously this isn't the movie for you.I'm so glad this movie wasn't a bunch of people in tights acting like this latest super villain and their menacing CGI Army is as serious as, well, cancer. Which isn't to say it doesn't have a super villain, it has a sensational one that Christian Bale really poured himself into. And to be share, it has plenty of CGI minions, too, but here all of that fades into the background and the movie really finds itself when it becomes a story about two people coming to terms with their past, present and future. Life, as it turns out, is what happens while you're busy saving the universe.If you want something different, you just may find what you're looking for. Thor: Love and Thunder wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn't apologize for it as Taika and friends dare to tell a story about loss, love, and the search for meaning, with space goats and somehow, they pull it off. I found it to be a breath of fresh air.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

That aside, I wondered if I was watching a rehashed 1990's romantic comedy rather than something belonging in the MCU. Granted there are some fantastic set pieces and battles, but unfortunately the storyline and humour level are way below what I was expecting, given the last Thor movie was Ragnorok (a riot).Some great cameos playing the 'actor' parts of Thor, Odin and Loki, but the biggest shock was Russell Crowe as Zeus!Fortunately there are not too many out there who still worship the Greek Gods, but I am certain there will be some areas of 2022 society that consider his portrayal as blasphemous.Overall, a decent couple of hours entertainment, but don't expect it to influence the MCU in any way going forward.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I would say Marvel knew they has a lot of loyal fans so they wouldn't bother to write a decent plot for their films anymore because they knew people would still watch their films no matter how bad they are going to be.Visually, the film was really great alongside with the scoring. While the characters and the story line felt very rushed since the first phase of the film, should've been extend the duration to avoid those problems. Unnecessary jokes also ruined some good moments for me throughout the film.Marvel's CGI quality has been getting worse and worse since Black Widow released (excluding Eternals), and Thor: Love and Thunder has the worst CGI quality so far, on par with No Way Home.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

In the wake of the amazing Thor Ragnarok, where does he take the franchise? Most of the original MCU Avengers have retired, yet the sparkles, the Lord of Thunder, is still putting in the work to change odd bod into god bod. Following all he has lost - parents, brother, friends, planet - he has a lot of issues that he needs to work out. And into this mix comes Gorr, played by an amazing Christian Bale, who challenges Thors strength and other emotions, with his own quest. And in the middle of this epic grudge match of god and god killer, steps Natalie Portmans Jane Foster, reintegrated into the Marvel fold following the falling out over Patty Jenkins, and given a much more beefed up role than just the scientific side kick and love interest. Her transformation is straight out the comics, and not to be questioned, though given all the space magic we've seen in previous films, it's good to see Kat Dennings asking some good questions.But the main conflict comes from the Asgardian weapons; despite throwing Mjolnir to Captain America in End Game, it's obvious he still pines for the only object that properly pull him off and there is a lot made of that, to the point it does get juvenile. In fact, quite a lot of the script reduces the thunder god to a doey eyed hippy, which placed against the sinister Gorr - channelling a combination of Voldermort, Marilyn Manson, Joker and other creepy bad guys - makes the story leap from yelling goats and All Spice adverts, to shadow monsters and dead gods. Russel Crowes Zeus sounds like Borat, and while his scene is one of the better set pieces in the film, it does feel like it could have gone bigger.Marvel have access to a vast array of computer generated content, and there are some amazing set pieces, space ships and battle scenes, though I was left wondering if they'd tried deaging Hemsworth and Portman, that left neither actor looking that great.It was a fun pop corn film, with plenty of comedy and action, though tinged with sadness that Bale didn't get more screen time,.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Christian Bale tries hard to save this but is not given enough screen time .

For me Love and Thunder is even richer and more creative. I think it's not MCU quality that is reducing, but the fans expectation that's getting higher. Y'all get stuck on endgame and want every new movie to be on endgame level. Instead of setting the standard, we should focus into the new/fresh idea that MCU bring to us.

I have a lot of good things to say about it but it had flaws as well... many flaws!Visually, this was a great movie. Settings were amazing and it looked like a real Thor movie. I suspect, not having read the comics of Thor (yet), that this movie came closest to what the comics look like...
We get a lot of new characters (lots of Gods) and see some return (lacking a few familiar ones as well, as they died in previous movies) like Lady Sif, Darcy Lewis, Erik Selveig and of course Jane Foster... and this movie has one of the best villains ever brought into the MCU, Gorr the God Butcher!But they don't use him and his acquired powers enough. The focus on this movie lies too much on the comedy side and the relationship between Thor and Jane aka Mighty Thor. That's all fine, I love both, but this movie needed more scenes where Gorr did the butchering! It's not until the third act in the movie that we actually see Gorr do his thing, when fighting Thor, Valkyrie and Mighty Thor!The movie has some Guardians of the Galaxy kind of vibe at the start and then it strays away from that path as well... so it feels like we are watching three different kinds of movies in one, which is a bit confusing if I'm honest. So yeah, it has flaws.The music by Giacchino is spot on, so that's good!My favourite scenes are the meeting with Zeus and then the climatic battle with Gorr... those will remain in my memory best...
So not a bad movie but I expected more, if I'm honest...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You are a real artist. The classic Thor adventure takes place in a humorous and balanced context. Everything indicates that there is some kind of perfection in this film. Imagination is experienced in a completely enjoyable way. But the key of the film is Gore and his characterization which makes the film even more high. We have less here than ever, certainly less entertainment and more art. Less than ever because advanced entertainment tools are not used according to the audience's wishes, and when we say that we have a work of art here, it means that we are actually facing a balance in their feelings and romantic characterization. It is really the best joke that we can give an example in the history of cinema. Taka Waititi is a stylish director. And having a style is an important thing that makes the image form and uniform. The story does not suffer from false emotions that destroy the entire structure of the story. I mean, it doesn't deviate from the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie. And that focus is what Taka Waititi has perfected. Even in the great stories that we read from classical literature, for example, this focus is not present in the entire structure of the story, and this point is very important. There is drama from the beginning of the film to the end of the film and that is what makes this film a masterpiece. And again, we have to consider that we are watching a Marvel movie. And the ground for doing such work is hardly prepared. Another thing is face painting. The facial expressions of the characters in the film stimulate our senses in a wonderful way and serve the script. Taka Waititi has won an Academy Award and several Emmy Awards for hit series. But clearly his best work is this movie. No matter how many times we see the movie, we are caught by more things. And this means depth. Artwork must have depth. I always keep this point in mind that the work of art must have depth. Not by flipping the script and creating artificial complexity in it. The depth of a work of art comes from a complexity that is not artificial. For example, in this movie, the three main characters deepen the story. The rhythm of the film also gives depth to the film. Chris Hemsworth adds emotion to the film. Natalie Portman gives it a deep sense of humor and Gore balances it. Everything in the film becomes form and there is no trace of defects in it. Let's face it, Marvel needed a change. Now the She-Hulk series had an excuse. But why should such a movie get so much hate for no reason. It's not just about Marvel fans, hitters have a problem with work form.Result: The cooperation of two big companies, a professional director and an excellent acting team seems to be quite successful. And it leaves no doubt that the maximum result we can get from a cooperation in 2022 is something like this.Any opposition to such a matter only makes it worse and does not stop it at all. Of course, the last part of the sentence is also dependent on several other things that do not fit on this page.","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

Every moment it becomes more beautiful and reaches its peak. We have succeeded in developing the seventh art. The criteria certainly did not feel the sting of it. This movie is extremely heavy. There is an outpouring of feeling in it. Like a canvas painted by a painter in the 16th century. How is such a thing possible? This movie is extremely heavy. Every moment it gets heavier and it can no longer be tolerated or it is hard to bear it. How is it that this film is so beautiful and at the same time so heavy.Thor does not feel pain but is full of pain. He does not show his pains. Taurus is shy but smart. He speaks like a real hero.

Primarily due the injection of some really excellent well written and performed comedy aspects. To me it seems that this new offering was determined to pile more and more comedy into it and as a result the movie is unbalanced and can't quite make its mind up what it is! There is still much to enjoy but there is a missed opportunity here. Thor comes across as a bit of a buffoon essentially. Natalie Portman is the heart and soul of the movie really and gives an excellent performance. Christian Bale is a menacing, scary villain but we don't see enough of him and the ending is rather contrived and poorly thought out! Tessa Thompson is underused too. As I said there is still much to enjoy but maybe next time a little less humour and higher stakes for our hero is called for!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It presented a bit arrogant prince, his family and his world. Thor 2 is one of the most underestimated movies of the MCU universe. Thor is now more mature and his relation with with brother is developing marvelously. Thor Ragnaroc was the best Thor movie, with great plot, music, CGI, and a main hero who was reaching the peak of his wisdom and power.The first problem with current movie, is that it doesn't seem to belong somewhere. It seems stray like the rest of the MCU movies after Endgame. It's behind Ragnaroc in almost all aspects, except from humor which may be good, but it starts to destroy the recipe for a balanced movie.The second problem is the backs and forths on Thor's character development. By now, he should be wiser and stronger than ever. Instead, he seems to be as naive and arrogant as in Thor 1 and as strong as.. Thor 1. That's not good.I think Watiti falsely let his protagonists to be so relaxed and silly on the shootings, and this applies both to Chris and Tessa.On the other hand, if you want to simply get entertained with some good action and want to have some good laughs, well - with the exception of the sad substories - the movie is hilarious and I caught myself unable to breath on a certain fight scene with certain sounds from certain animals.I just hoped to see something better, and maybe a small Loki appearance.For the rest of the cast, Christian Bale as a consumable 1-movie villan is great, and as a Greek, I surely wasn't offended by Russel Crowe's accent. I was only offended by the trailer describing and promising a different movie than the one I saw! But it's still good!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's begin with the positives however.PositivesBale put in a stellar performance as Gorr. I am glad his children convinced him to do this role. A villain with an actual legit motive. How about that ! However it does feel like he is a little wasted in the movie, and the usual decent performance from the cast. Portman is impeccable as Thor.The vibrant visuals and the soundtrack killed it.NegativesThe movie seemed so rushed and fast paced it feels a little messy and the plot just seems kind of weak. It does attempt to slow down and delve into the more emotional side of things between Thor and Jane.. But it is still at least much better than the pile of heap that was Eternals lol. A forgettable movie in my opinion that lives in the shadow of Thor Ragnarok.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A kiss and a few montages doesn't magically make us feel their love.Too many distractions in final act kept the audience from being with Thor & Jane to really feel those powerful moments in the end. An extra 15-20 minutes of relationship building would have gone a long way. And I say this after watching Thor 1&2 with Jane before watching this one.Also Zeus/Russell Crowe was just weird. I get that you wanted to make him ""different,"" but you got the Gladiator to play Zeus and you took away his commanding presence/voice.Still... many great laughs along the way, Hemsworth is always great as Thor, Bale was great too, shadow monsters were cool, and imagery mind-blowing.

There's a good amount to like about it. The electric guitar tracks are great and give the film a consistent vibe of childlike fun that compliments the action. The action itself is well done, the visuals are absolutely breathtaking and the comedy I found to be significantly better than Marvel's average attempt.However it was otherwise very average. The plot was incredibly linear and didn't have the character depth to adequately fill the gap that left, and I found the antagonist to be overly basic for a character who has gone through as much as someone like Thor. That said, the film is occasionally quite touching, particularly at the end, which is the most important part.Overall this is a very simple feel-good action movie and a good bit of escapism, but definitely not a masterpiece.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, after watching it, I can only say that it is a mere shadow of its predecessor and is lacking in many departments that make this movie anything more than a fan-service sequel that cannot stand on its own as an individual film.The film is of course not without its pros. Christian Bale does not disappoint with his introduction to the MCU as the villain Gorr, with a powerhouse performance that makes the character both a sinister, vile being but one who you also sympathise greatly with due to all the things that happened to him. Natalie Portman is also great as Dr. Jane Foster who shows she can kick some ass and there's good chemistry between her and Chris Hemsworth. Korg is as usual always a treat whenever he is on screen, and the brand of silly Waititi humour is still charming more often than not, with the story also sneaking in a surprising amount of emotional depth at various moments.Where the movie falters the most is that it just seems too inconsequential and devoid of substance. Many of the character developments are rushed, including that for Gorr and Dr. Jane Foster, where there is enough exposition to know who they are and what they want but not nearly enough for me to be attached. Gorr is supposed to be this monstrous god-killing being but we are hardly shown any of that in the movie, and for Jane we barely get to understand her backstory and her past relationship with Thor (apart from some flashbacks). Coupled with some more hastily rushed through scenes that includes a weird cameo from the Guardian of the Galaxy and one fight sequence with Thor, where both parties are not seen again for the rest of the movie, I found myself caring less and less as the runtime went on and was just left feeling hollow and unsatisfied when the credits started rolling.Overall, fans of the original Ragnorak will still find things to enjoy in Love and Thunder, but the latter only has the spice and seasoning of style and humour without the main course of proper story and character development. Still, you will probably have good fun watching it because it is a Waitit movie. Here's to hoping that his next venture will be a bit more inspired than this one, however.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Christian Bale's character is like a stand-in for God of War's Kratos in terms of archetype, make-up and also fees like a 'campy-go-grumpy' stand-in for Tom Hiddleston's iconic trickster.There's stuff that works here, and stuff that doesn't. It's like a birthday cake that's got too many flavours in it all at once instead of being squarely triple-choc or vanilla; instead it tries overdoing the sweetness without distinction of flavour or craft. That's Thor: Love and Thunder, a film that tries being more by doing the exact same thing pretty much. It's feel-good without ample risk, but at least the typical MARVEL sense of fun is still there. It may not be inviting for anything particularly inspired, but this Thor film is determined to reinforce the character as a mainstay from here onward.This film has spark, but no real sense of awe beyond the action spectacle. Thor may not be as tried-and-true as other more established superheroes out there, but there's clearly room for improvement in the future.Thor: Love and Thunder gets 3/5 stars. It's the standard MARVEL-fare that's become a to-be-expected box office hit.Clearly MARVEL's formula is being called out by some; it works for others, but some see through the innately formulaic structures starting to get in the way of these adventures feeling fresh and inspiring. It's not a bad film at all, but long-standing characters deserve (and don't have any real right to be denied of) character development and expanding the creative horizons of their respective world.Even satisfying candies refine their formula to make themselves feel less 'complicit' with ordinariness from time to time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Extremely disappointing, since Ragnarok is one of the best MCU films. This one has a big Hiddleston-sized hole - he was a great foil to Hemsworth's Thor.Tessa Thompson and Kat Dennings are both underutilized, Hemsworth and Portman continue to have zero chemistry, and the jokes felt like a comedian who is opening a set - and bombing. Just an all-around train wreck. I'm just
disappointed that I paid for tickets and given the MCU's record as of late, next time I'll wait until I can stream it.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

I'm not sure what it is about Thor L&T but I just didn't find it that funny. I felt like they tried so hard to push jokes out and they often didn't land with me.I think there were too many jokes right at the start, it became obvious that the dialogue only served for humour reasons and because that failed to land with me it took away any storytelling or narrative immersion.The film is still entertaining and it definitely gets better by the second act, even the comedy improves once 'Jane' is introduced into the story alongside Thor. There are great action scenes and the film definitely doesn't feel too long. I think it's the perfect length.The villain is the best part of the movie, Christian Bale portrays his character extremely well. I will say, it felt very clear that Natalie Portman had only been contracted for one marvel movie. Immediately we are met with her character in a terminal situation which implies she won't be returning after the movie concludes. Maybe they could've made it a little more subtle.Overall, this movie is alright. It's funny at times and has enough action to remain entertaining and compelling, with some neat cinematography here and there, but not the greatest marvel movie I've ever seen.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And then it quickly went into the over-saturated comedic relief we are bombarded with seeing in most Marvel movies now. Moments cannot be their own, tragedy, astonishment, shocking, no. You have to ""lighten it up a bit"". Sometimes you need to let a negative moment just be a negative moment? This comes across as just another ""amusement park"" movie.The character development is simplistic, dull and shallow for most of the movie. No complex conversations or complex thought processes of approaches are taken toward the adversity. The story wants to be deeper, but it's rushed in important scenes and crammed with filler jokes and unnecessary banter . Bale almost seems to be overdoing his role, until you realize the other characters were just written so poorly in the story, compared to his.I love Taika's other personal projects, but I am not a fan of his Marvel projects. Seems like they (Marvel or Taika or both) really wanted to make this movie more for the kids than the original audience. That would explain the avoidance of adding anything more profound and simply making it entertaining enough (but Disney and Marvel have had many profound engaging G and PG-13 rated movies in the past, to have an excuse).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I have to say, Natalie Portman brought a much-needed breath of fresh air to the character. Like most characters in the previous two Thor films, Jane Foster felt very bland and her chemistry with Thor wasn't believable. However, in Thor: Love and Thunder, we see the two spend time together doing normal things a couple would do. This makes it all the more heartbreaking when we see how they broke up and cathartic when the two are reunited.Before watching the film, I was most curious about how well Christian Bale's acting would mesh with Taika Waititi's direction. And I have to say, Bale is perhaps the best aspect of the film. Not only is he a master actor who's rivaled by few, but Gorr is a genuinely interesting character. If there's anything that everyone can agree on, it's that Phase 4 of the MCU has some of the best villains. Gorr's character motivations are very clear: he wants to kill all gods because he believes they are inherently selfish beings with no regard for their followers. If you take a look at various religions across history, he has a point. Gods are often portrayed as morally ambivalent and are not paragons of justice.When I watched this movie, I felt like I was watching two different movies at the same time. The scenes with Gorr are very dark and somewhat horrifying, with Gorr becoming more and more corrupted by killing gods. Bale's performance wavers between camp and downright horror, hell, he'd even scare The Scarecrow with how terrifying he can be. Yet whenever it cuts to Thor and his friends, it's always bright and colorful. These cuts almost felt like sensory overload in how different they are. Not to mention the plethora of typical MCU-styled jokes littered throughout the film detracting away from any tension. Which brings me to my next point. The lack of tension in the film. I never thought for once that any of the main characters were in any mortal danger.Besides this lack of tension, I felt that Thor's goofball nature is dialed up even more in this film compared to Thor: Ragnarok. Thor was funny even when a situation doesn't call for it. Although Chris Hemsworth is naturally funny, seeing Thor act funny in dangerous situations started to grate on my nerves. While Waititi is a very talented filmmaker and actor, and the performances, especially Christian Bale's, are superb, Thor: Love and Thunder feels hollow compared to some of the MCU's other Phase 4 films. With conflicting tonal shifts and excessive humor at times when it wasn't appropriate, it appears that lightning seemed to have missed its mark with Thor: Love and Thunder.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thor: Ragnarok got the mix of comedy, story and playfulness just right. This one goes too far on the parody side, and makes fun of itself too much. Worse, the comic side does not mesh with certain parts that are meant to give weight to the story. It just feels off and some of the comic elements just don't work.It's not terrible, it's just not good either.The good bits.Christian Bale is amazing, much of the time you forget it's him. Gorr the Godslayer is actually an interesting bad guy, with pathos and reasoning behind his actions.Hemsworth is good and has fun, I particularly enjoyed the emotional issues between him and his axe. However, at times he plays it too light and it just becomes one long self reverential joke that you are sick of half way.Korg is fun, but could have done with some paring back. He begins to grate as it goes on.The bad
Russell Crow as Zeus with awful Greek accent that is more racist than anything. I mean Thor doesn't speak with a Scandinavian accent nor do any of the other Gods. Doesn't help the part is pretty crap anyway.The goats. Funny for maybe 30 seconds, after that I wanted them in a stew.The mediocre
Postman's issues as an actor rear there head, she's ok but vacuous and unconvincing as lady Thor
I loved Valkyrie in Ragnarok, but she is often under used in this and lacks the park in the previous movie.Goes on too long, could have been paired back.So in the end it's not a terrible movie, has some fun but ultimately just feels a bit off and too self reverential. I think the gloss on Waititi is finally wearing off and he is doing too much, and a lot of the same.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thor is no longer the serious honorable viking god who used to be funny cuz he was too serious in casual situations... he is now intentionally goofy (not sure if I like that)There is good use of Guns'n Roses songs which I grew up with. Even my children think it's catchy, good intro to some oldy rock music.Some serious plotlines were wasted, though, unfortunately. The God Butcher (Christian Bale) is a badass villain, and the return of Jane (Natalie Portman) could have been so much more. I feel these two were wasted in what some reviews have already harped on... a silly movie. And so, the dialogue was not such sharp comedy, but mostly goofiness for cheap laughs. Even the remaining Asgardians seem like a bunch of refugees of idiots.

The scene with Russell Crowe, I laughed so hard at the embarrassment all these actors must've felt doing it. In front of a giant green screen acting like complete fools to entertain no one.Speaking of the CGI, I'm not sure where Disney put all their money into this because is wasn't for the CGI. Everything and I mean everything in this movie is built In a computer. I'm pretty sure even the hospital scenes with Natalie Portman were in a green screen room. At one point in the first act Thor & Mighty Thor are talking and I swear they digital deaged both Natalie Portman & Chris Hemsworth to make them look better. I know they do this in movies now to get rid of wrinkles and stuff but it was so blatant and distracting I couldn't help but be baffled at what I was seeing. This is by far the worst effects I've seen in a marvel film hands down.That leads me to the action scenes, first of where were they? Whenever someone had to fight I honestly could care less. It was so boring and the villains shadow monsters were completely trash and forgettable. The action is not existent in this. It's really beautiful people standing in front of a green screen improvising every single word of dialog. I'm truly embarrassed for this film.So Thor, he honestly should've ended his screen time after endgame as well along with Ironman & Captain America. I don't see how he fits in the future of the Universe at all. If you were going to keep him around I would've much rather of seen an entire film with him with the Guardians of the Galaxy & working with James Gunn. Speaking of, no one should direct the Guardians of the Galaxy but James Gunn. The scenes with actors from that film are all off with a different director. All the characters just felt off in this movie and that lives and dies with Taika Waititi. Now I like his films, he is a great filmmaker and funny in general but the tonality of this film is just all over the place and he really isn't a great fit for this anymore.Now the only and I mean only saving grace in this film is Christian Bale hamming it up in spectacular fashion. The film was only ever good when he was on screen. Far and beyond the only interesting character in the entire film and he's honestly barely in it. Just a complete waste of his talent.So from here I have no idea what marvel is doing. Their ""storyline"" is all over the place since Endgame. They better figure it out quick because this was just a mess from beginning to end.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

I laughed at a couple of things but I didn't laugh that much at all throughout the movie really. And that makes the approach taken with it that much worse. And let me just say that the running gag with the goats was not that funny at all. I don't think there was one time where I was actually laughing at it, but I was amused by it once and then every time after that I was just like ""okay it's old now"". I liked the performances, and I think the movie mostly looks good for the most part (although I do think these movies are starting to look the same now). You got Christian Bale, one of the greatest actors in the world to be the villain. I don't like how he was used here. Bale was great, but Gorr the Butcher was a disappointment. Taiki Watiti said he was going to be the best MCU villain ever. I know that's the kind of thing that directors say about their own movies, but I at least thought he was going to be one of them. I understood his motivations, but as a villain, he didn't really do anything. He was hardly in it. The ""god-butchering"" took place off screen. And Russell Crowe was a cartoon as Zeus. Honestly, as much as I love the Guardians of the Galaxy, they didn't need to be in this either. They were used to be part of the set up concerning what Thor was going through but I'm not sure if they really had to be. I feel like they just did it so that fans can get a whole hype train going before the movie comes out and say ""oh the Guardians of the Galaxy are going to be in too!"" and then they're in it for like 5 minutes or so. Speaking of them, let the Guardians of the Galaxy be the Guardians of the Galaxy. What I mean by that is I feel like the direction that the Thor movies are taking are because they want to emulate the success of the GotG franchise. That franchise deals with humor better though because it feels baked into the personalities, whereas with this movie it brought things to a halt at times. This movie needed more balance and nuance. If this is what we can come to expect out of Thor movies going forward then I'm not really looking forward to any solo outings with the character, even with what the mid credit scene suggests. I did like some of the action in the third act though.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's fun to see Thor's interactions with the Guardians of the Galaxy and great to see him fighting back from the rock bottom he hit between Infinity War and Endgame. Chris Hemsworth does a lovely job of depicting Thor as a superficially oblivious heroic meathead, while giving us glimpses of the character's underlying vulnerability and brittleness after his world and family has been systematically destroyed. He, and the rest of the cast, give us plenty of laughs along the way. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the chemistry between Hemsworth and real-life daughter India Rose as Love at the end of the film is just adorable.Unfortunately, despite its many good points, the film is marred by self-indulgence. Director Taika Waititi's character, Korg, who I've enjoyed in previous films, it turns out is better in much smaller doses than we get here. Too often we descend into cheap jokes or clunking parody, eg about Thor's ""dad bod"" at the start of the film and Russell Crowe's cringeworthy Zeus. At its best, the film successfully both upholds and affectionately sends up comic book heroism, but it sleepwalks too often into the obvious gag or cliche. I do hope we'll get to see Thor again, but also that the mixed reception to this film will be the wake-up call needed to prompt a more thoughtful and interesting approach to his next appearance.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That character could've been much deeper with such a great actor, he should've had more screen time to furthur explore his arc.

Like Ragnarok, it doesn't take itself seriously. Unfortunately, in this case, the jokes are just not funny. So while Ragnarok carried its audience along through its humor, Love and Thunder fails to do the same, and the audience is left staring at a not funny film that doesn't believe in itself. Soon enough the characters abandon the screen and the worst risk of all superhero movies materializes: all you see is grown-up people in superhero costumes. It's embarrassing for the actors (aren't you a bit old to be wearing superhero costumes?) and by reflection, for the audience.I find that poor directors can hide their weaknesses for so long, and Takia Waititi is one such director. His most famous films, Jojo Rabbit and Thor Ragnarok were generally weak, but went by, disguised in some humor that worked okay. Without that artifice, the gaps of Waititi as a filmmaker are fully revealed in this new Thor.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

There's just no winning is there?Thor has been through A LOT, from losing his whole family, to his home, his friends, the love of his life, so this could have gone two ways: shutting down completely and becoming a shipwreck of a man, or try and move on and help others in need so that no one has died in vain fighting all those villains. He chose the latter and began all sort of adventures filled with action and humor. This is what this film was. A great, amazing story and a fun watch, we got a bit of everything and I for one am extremely excited to see the next one. Taika Waititi is gifted, talented and I do hope he directs the next ones as well.Those 1/2 star reviews are irrelevant, don't listen to them.

I think it was even better than Billy Wilder's comedy movies. Who's watching some of these movies, doesn't want to think about any other movie. To perfection You see, everything is found in this movie. The depth of the story, character, dialogue, rhythm, what else can a science fiction movie do. Dad, let go of the previous bulls, Martin was right when he said that it is a game city, it is different. This is a movie, now someone wants to think that it belongs to children, and someone will tell me why it was not like previous episodes. Marvel came out of its replica mode. Marvel is changing, but the change is not bad at all. It has not been successful so far, but in a film like this, I see that we are on the side of an artistic director who knows the language of cinema. The movie definitely has a direct impact not only on Marvel but also on the entire science fiction cinema from now on. But the important thing is that the movie itself has become a masterpiece. If we want to look at it objectively, we will hardly realize that it is a good movie and we have to watch it several times, but if we look neither objectively nor subjectively, we will realize that it is a masterpiece. From an objective point of view, this movie is not as memorable as a show, but with our second view, we deeply accept that the movie is either a masterpiece or it doesn't suit me at all. Enough of the weaving philosophy. Regardless of any asides related to previous Marvel movies, there are scripts here, not humble remakes of outdated sci-fi.

"6","/10","A solid story that touches on themes of grief and loss that finds itself suffocated by directorial excess and an overly jokey tone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9011358/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","23 April 2023","While working alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his companion Korg (Taika Waititi) part ways with the Guardians after learning of a distress signal from his Asgardian comrade Sif (Jamie Alexander). As Thor comes to Sif's aid he learns someone known as Gorr The God Butcher (Christian Bale) has been murdering the various Gods throughout the universe using the Necrosword and now has his sights set on New Asgard on Earth. Once there Thor fends off Gorr's shadow monsters alongside New Asgard leader Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and is met by surprise when he learns Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) now wields Mjolnir which unbeknownst to Thor was a last resort by Jane to stave off her aggressive cancer. When Gorr manages to abduct the Asgardian children, Thor, Jane, Valkyrie, and Korg team up and set out to find help from the other Gods and stop Gorr's rampage.Shortly after the enthusiastic reeception and box office success of Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi and Marvel executives reunited on a greenlit fourth Thor movie. Many of the cast were interested in returning including star Chris Hemsworth who credited Waititi with revitalizing the character after initially growing exhausted with the role. From a business standpoint it just makes sense to give Waititi another go at Thor given that Ragnarok was the highest grossing and best reviewed film in the series, but while Ragnarok struck the balance between its humor and taking its story reasonably seriously, Love and Thunder stumbles hard with its tone often feeling at odds with its thematic material.If there's one thing I think many people will agree on, it's in Christian Bale's performance as Gorr The God Butcher in that it's probably the best villain we've seen for a standalone Thor movie yet (keep in mind Loki didn't go full force until the first Avengers film). The opening sequence where we're introduced to Gorr traversing a desolate wasteland with his daughter who dies of starvation and thirst in his arms only for Gorr himself to find the God he worshipped is indifferent to his suffering makes him a sympathetic villain and his transformation through the usage of the Necrosword makes him an intimidating villain with a lot of depth. In many ways it reminded me of a better version of villains like Ronan the Accuser or Malekith who had very similar motivations but were paper thin in comparison to Gorr.Unfortunately, that's where we have to transition to the weak points of the movie, of which there are many. Right out of the gate the movie has an abrupt tonal shift from the ending of the scene where we see Gorr's corruption to a montage sequence where Taika Waititi's Korg narrates a heavily abridged version of Thor's life glibly discussing character deaths in a rather offhanded way which transitions to Thor still with the Guardians of the Galaxy who are really only an extended cameo. Despite the lingering threat of Gorr the movie overplays its comedy to an obnoxious degree with Korg now having warn out his goodwill from his restrained usage in Ragnarok to terribly running gags about a pair of screaming goats Thor uses as transport who aren't funny and just annoying. Jane Foster is given a richer role than previous incarnations as she's not only taken on a separate mantle as Thor but is battling cancer but rather than explore Jane and Thor's relationship regarding either of those two points, the movie thinks it'd be more interesting to see yet another terrible running gag of Thor's weapons acting like his ex-girlfriend and currently girlfriend with Stormbreak now jealous of Thor's hangups with Mjolnir now loyal to Jane in what's less a running gag and more a limping gag. The sad thing is, if you look at the nuts and bolts of the story it's pretty solid. The main problem that takes the movie down is in the fact is afraid to let our characters have any stretch of pathos that isn't interrupted by a stupid joke. But there are at least a few scenes that hit emotional resonance such as the ending.Thor: Love and Thunder has all the right elements and a really good villain and performance from Christian Bale, but the overly jokey tone makes Love and Thunder very much the Yin to Ragnarok's Yang. With that said: I don't think this is a worse movie than Thor: The Dark World because I will remember Love and Thunder (both good points and bad) but I still struggle to remember The Dark World. It has some issues that weigh it down to being the weakest Thor movie alongside The Dark World but both movies aren't great just for different reasons.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is often hilarious due to how unpredictably absurd it is, but sometimes suffers due to the overbearing need it seems to feel to always have jokes in every scene, regardless of whether they fit in with what's happening in the movie.But, this is nothing new for Marvel. I only bring it up because it happens far more often in this film than in any other Marvel outing.What is new in this film (and quite fresh) is the villain. Christian Bale gives a surprisingly both creepy and heartfelt performances as the God Butcher. Right from the opening we have a deep compassionate understanding for why he does what he does, and the conclusion of the story gives him a very satisfying conclusion for his journey as well.I just wish there was more of him. He gets a great introduction and a great ending in which compelling parallels are drawn between him and Thor, but throughout the rest of the movie he's just ""evil possessed guy."" The motivations are still there, but I wanted to see more of what he was doing and how his possession was affecting his mind or personality.I was worried about how Jane would be as ""Lady-Thor,"" and thankfully her presence in the movie is warranted. She's written into the story in a way that both makes sense and actually amplifies the emotional stakes, which are sadly nonexistent in a lot of these Marvel films.The action is mostly pretty good, but kind of a mixed bag. The camerawork and selective use of colors is fun and frenetic, but the overuse of CGI is sometimes far too noticeable and makes the movie look...cheap. Cheaper than any other Thor movie. Cheap is not a word I like to use when describing $200 million movies, but there isn't a better one to use for this.Endings are hard to write, and the ending of this film (no spoilers) both works and doesn't work. There's a satisfying payoff to the themes of love and loss, but at the very end the story asks us to care about Thor's relationship to a character who we have not seen and know nothing about.It's a sweet and charming ending, but it left me feeling...colder than I think the filmmakers wanted me to feel. And that's because they didn't put in any work throughout the movie to make me feel as satisfied as the characters in the movie are by the ending's outcome.I do recommend this film, for Christian Bale's performance and for Taika Waititi's very distinct (if flawed) absurd method of telling stories with a lot of humor and heart and ambition. A lot of ambition.","34 out of 68 found this helpful.

This is an unabashed laugh out loud comedy, but with a lot of heart. And it ends on very high notes (including the final post credit scene) unlike Ragnarok does. (Not saying L + T is better than Ragnarok because that film was epic in scope and I possibly prefer it, if only slightly more so).In the previous Thor films, I honestly didn't think Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman had good on-screen chemistry, but that changed here. Wonderful chemistry between them. I'm glad they fixed that.The screenwriting is probably this film's strongest aspect for me. Taika Waititi & Jennifer Kaytin Robinson nailed the plot, the structure, the dialogue, and the pacing. Taika Waititi's comedic timing shined in directing. I loved the reoccurring gag with the screaming goats.Finally, that 80's rock n roll theme and the gorgeous end credits. This really dialed up the fun to 11. It's that vibe that I hoped Wonder Woman '84 was going to bring but failed miserably to deliver.As I'm getting older there are few films I will spend the time to rewatch, but 10/10 I will watch this again.","17 out of 54 found this helpful.

This film had a palace of story and action scenes.Thor 4 does have a lot of comedy scenes with Thor. We get to see a small bit of the Guardians with Thor.Thor 4 feels like a Guardians Of The Galaxy film which is what the director did for Thor 3 and it worked for Marvel and it has worked again. Just does not feel like a Thor film but I liked it a lot.Can we please first talk about Christian Bale who acts as Gorr who is the best part of this film as he was amazing, he saves this film and for me is the second best marvel live action villain. Christian Bale really brought his character to life, you can feel the pain and hate he has towards the people who let him down.It was good to see Natalie Portman back as Jane Foster and as Lady Thor. She was good in this film and brought her character to life.Chris Hemsworth as always does a good job with Thor, being so funny and just make this film watchable. He is too funny in this film but for me I like it but I would have also liked to see him in a bit of a serious role like how he was in avengers 3. We also get to see Thor dealing with the events of Avengers 3, 4 of the people he has lost and see his past coming back in his life.The problem with the last two Thor films is that they have made it to feel like a Guardians Of The Galaxy film which beings that this film can't be taken serious or you the fans can't take Thor as your serious hero like Iron Man and Captain America but I love that Thor is made to be different in the films.I think comic fans who want better storyline like Captain America 3, Avengers 3 or the Batman films, will be tired of the same marvel comic movies that have a simple story with no character development, but marvel films are different to DC Films. If you are looking for a film that has a good balance of comedy, action or if you're a Thor fan then watch this film. The soundtrack is good as always.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The worst thing is every male character in the Marvel Universe is in the same cross hairs of this evil unseen force. This is undoubtedly the most menacing foe our heroes have ever faced and one in which they are unlikely to recover from.Surprisingly however, spiderman no way home seemed to buck to trend and was arguably one of the best marvel films ever made with wokeness kept to a bare minimum.

Fortunately, I ended up having a great time at the theater. If you've seen the trailer for this movie, that's exactly how it felt the whole way through (and the run time was under two hours). Taika Waititi had his fingerprints all over this film, so if you're a fan of his like I am, you might find it a fun ride, too.Chris Hemsworth reprises the titular role, who has been on a journey to find himself, so to speak, as he finishes up his tour with the Guardians of the Galaxy and heads back to New Asgard to see how Valkyrie and the rest of his people are holding up. Tessa Thompson provides a grounding force, as his friend Val, for the god of thunder to hold on to as things quickly go topsy-turvy for the now-fit-again Avenger; after the events of ""Endgame,"" he got back into training and turned his ""dad bod into a god bod,"" as his other buddy Korg (played by Waititi) put it.While I believe Gorr the God Butcher to be one of the better MCU villains, both because the character was written with a relatable motivation and because Christian Bale is amazing in anything he is in, it would have been nice to see more of him in the movie. My understanding is that there were several scenes cut out because they were too dark or scary for the general audience that Marvel prefers to attract, but I think it would have been worth it to enhance to story. If we actually see Gorr mow through different gods, we not only would see how powerful that necrosword is, but we would see how much pain he is in to want to serve up so much death.It seems, though, that doing something like that would have taken away from the Jane Foster storyline, so I understand the decision (but still disagree: just make two separate movies!). She becomes the Mighty Thor herself when Thor's old hammer, Mjolnir, calls to her. Foster, a role reprised by the mighty Natalie Portman, is dealing with some major health problems, while Mjolnir (I'm surprised the spell check on my computer doesn't have a problem with that word) is in a bit of shattered state itself, so they appear to help each other out.Keep in mind, even with the topics of death and deicide, Thor 4 remains a comedy, through and through. While the visual sequences, 80's rock cues, and screaming goats might be better experienced in a movie theater, watching this at home (when it moves to streaming) will get you most of the way there. Just make sure to turn the volume up.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Excellent performances by Natalie Portman and Christian Bale whom both stole the show! The story pushes Thor and Jane back together but fails at the romance between them. Also, the movie seems to be afraid to kill off characters. I counted 5 times where I thought a character died but simply recovered by the next scene. On a good note, the mythos and action were ramped up as you would expect in a Thor movie! Post credit scenes paved way for future stories to be told.

The broadest comedy of the series and almost a reinterpretation of the character of Thor that sticks to this day. So, anticipation was high for ""Love and Thunder"", perhaps too high, as having seen the film it's a 'like' rather than a 'love' for me.Having received a distress call from Lady Sif (Jamie Alexander), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to New Asgard in time to intercept an attack from Gorr The God Butcher (Christian Bale). He is not alone though, as alongside Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) has taken the power of The Mighty Thor by reuniting the shattered Mjolnir. Though they repel Gorr's attack, his minions kidnap the children of the town forcing the three heroes to begin an assault, but not before they look to the other gods for assistance.For me, the problem wasn't too much humour, or too weak humour. I thought that Christian Bale's Gorr was a compelling villain and like many MCU antagonists was justified in his rationale. I liked the performances, even some of the ones that people have found controversial, such as Russell Crowe's Zeus. I thought the film looked excellent and the transitions into the black and white sections were great. I think my problem was that it skirted over a bunch of ideas without ever going deep enough on any of them, particularly when some of them have been anticipated for a while. Asguardians of the Galaxy was fun whilst it lasts, but over before the film really starts. The kingdom of the gods, again amusing, but lacking in cameos we might have expected (Khonshu?) and really not much more than a way of padding the film out. Even Jane Foster's Mighty Thor isn't in the film enough to be explored properly. I appreciate that not all actors are willing to do nothing except play their Marvel characters, but I'd have preferred two separate films, one for the adventures of Thor with the GOTG and another full film for Jane to become accustomed to her powers, then have them reconnect. I'd also have liked slightly fewer call backs, the attempt to recapture the Immigrant song moment is overdone, as are the returns for the acting troop.Again, I don't think that this is the disaster that some other reviewers have made it out to be but it's certainly not all I hoped it would be.","0 out of 11 found this helpful.

This one tried to be a little more sentimental. Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale) could have been a lot stronger of a villain. There's a lot of ""could haves"" with this movie; it could have been funnier, could have been more sentimental, could have done with more spectacle. This is just another run-of-the-mill Marvel movie.Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Christian Bale are all good here. Korg (Taika Waititi) is again the standout character, I love the comedic relief he brings. The movie starts off strong and ends strong but it's very messy throughout.Side note (and I'm not sure if this was just the theater I went to), but there were some weird audio issues like the sound mixing was off. The volume was very low at points like I couldn't hear a thing, and there were points where the music or the sound effects drowned out the dialogue and it was hard for me to hear what the characters were saying.Overall, not bad but no where near the level we've seen Marvel produce at. It's just very average and gets a couple extra points merely for the Marvel polish but there's nothing here, really, that is redeemable or warrants any sort of in-depth discussion or analysis.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Tessa Thompson drinking herself off an entrance? Gold. Thor hijacking Gamesmaster's ship (Don't touch anything"")? Another gem. Love and Thunder certainly began with hope when Thor throws his cloak at the beginning of the movie, but by the third song recycled from the Appetite for Destruction album alone (there was no other hard rock band they could use in a hard rock themed movie?), the film was showing its wear and tear. That's not to say Love and Thunder is a bad film, since the cast is all staying true to character, the pace of the movie is on point, the colour, the design, the shade... Love and Thunder is in fact a sharp movie, but the film itself is handcuffed to way too much continuity that has to be answered to.A god worshipping soul loses all faith when unanswered drought claims his daughter. Answering to a cursed sword's call to seek revenge, all gods are put on notice as they are starting to be exterminated. Thor, who returns to shape and spirit after his latest trials, has a target on his back as he holds something of value to this God Butcher.What I do like about Waititi's approach in Love and Thunder is the use of the children. Say what you will about the climax (it's a superhero film, people), Waititi's movies have usually featured kids as the protagonist and Love and Thunder could have used more of their screen time, particularly with Gorr, or have them enjoying New Asgard. What we get instead are some very tiring cliches bogging down an already heavy film. In the face of cancer and abducted children, we didn't need to know Korg's mating rituals. Thor's romance over a former flame (not Jane) was also adding to unnecessary screen time. The key that made Ragnarok feels effortless was the successful banter between characters and parties that made the plot hold. Love and Thunder, though flashy and full of heart, misses that same effortlessness, making for a sometimes tiring watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It actually went quite well and was pretty smooth without much plot holes in the whole marvel timeline.Only downside for me was when the final fight scene ended I wasn't left feeling wowed or satisfied. With so much build up and hype, it's very much normal for us audience to expect an ending befitting the show. This afterall, is a superhero show.I did enjoy myself but not as much as I expected or hoped for, esp with Thor being my favourite marvel superhero. Anyway thanks to the whole production team and cast for their efforts in filming this movie, better luck with the next one!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

While Ragnarok made it work this just didn't feel like a Thor film. I miss the feeling one got from watching Thor or Thor The Dark World.Being a marvel film the movie has a massive budget and it looks and sounds amazing. The cast is really great and it's an enjoyable movie all told. However it just doesn't feel like something I want to go back and rewatch multiple times.I will give the film a decent 6/10 rating. The acting is fine, the VFX and SFX are great. The story is not terrible but could definitely have been done in a much more enjoyable manner. The comedy was overdone and gave me a headache after a while.Thor fans will still enjoy it and seeing Jane Foster wielding Mjolnir is interesting to say the least. All in all, worth a watch but be prepared for what you're going to get.P. S. It feels very rushed, like a rollercoaster ride without time to actually enjoy any of it or give enough time to it's characters.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Of course there is a major play towards humor: the remaining parts are basically laying out the real joke on mankind, religion. How gods are basically not listening or will raise a finger to help the people who give them their praise and life. Really drives it home in one line Gorr utters in the end. On first watch, I too felt the humor was a bit much, but upon discussing with a friend of moments I liked, I realized how intense the subject matter was, and how cleverly Taika Waititi hid it. Go and check the Christian reviews, all hung up on the homosexual notes and ""false pagan gods"" (their actual words) yet not even noticing the defiant cry at the absolute useless nature of their own religion. I am definitely looking forward to a second watch, being more aware.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's just say that the writers of Love and Thunder did not pay attention because they broke pretty much all of the rules (in a bad way), producing this hot mess of a movie. The script is awful, Jane becoming the Mighty Thor relies on total randomness not previously set up in the universe, the tone constantly shifts between over the top violence and comedy, and the characters are not serious people. Christian Bale as Gor tries throughout the film but even he cannot save this movie from becoming a self-parody. I guess this is what happens when the studio rushes production and cranks up the absurdity to 1000.

But in this movie it would go from goofy and silly to intense and dark when Gorr would come on the screen.All the other characters were kind of pointless, we see Russell Crowe as Zeus for a short period, but his character didn't serve much purpose to the film.

Thor embarks on a journey unlike anything he's ever faced -- a quest for inner peace. However, his retirement gets interrupted by Gorr the God Butcher, a galactic killer who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie, Korg and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster, who -- to his surprise -- inexplicably wields his magical hammer. Together, they set out on a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance.Chris Hemsworth is still great as Thor, but there's too much goofiness now. Although Natalie Portman had a really big role this time and she did really well portraying that role, her acting seemed a bit off in some scenes. Gorr (and with an incredible performance by Christian Bale) is one of the greatest MCU villains, so he definitely needed more screen time. Also, the little cameos were really fun to see.The movie had a fun and promising start, but it got really slow and boring in some scenes towards the middle leading to an underwhelming ending. Despite all that, the post-credit scene was pretty exciting.The movie attempts to be funny with some successful laughs, but it's packed with many jokes that are really foolish to the point where the movie gets quite silly.The CGI (especially the floating head part that everyone is talking about) is very bad compared to ""Thor: Ragnarok"".Score:7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, taika really ""over-egged the pudding"" with Love & Thunder.

Also, as much as I like Natalie Portman, she just can't do this type of comedy.It's a shame because this movie is quite poignant in places, and could have been a great emotional ride. But the act of cramming in as many gags as possible really takes the edge off any deeper meaning the story could have told.On the plus side; Christian Bale is amazing. Really, really, amazing. Again though, I feel slighly embarrassed for him that he put in such a great performance against so many dumb jokes. Russell Crowe was also hilarious - I never knew he had a performance like this in him.All-in-all, I was entertained, and I did actually LOL a couple of times.

I think back to it, and it all just felt so hollow.While Christian Bale's opening scene was really compelling, I already got a sense of problem of the movie to come. His role was greatly reduced and rushed, to the point where the villain doesn't appear for what felt an entire hour. His arc particularly at the end felt like it came out of nowhere and not given any weight that it should have.Ever since Endgame, I've been progressively feeling that Marvel burnout. I think I've reached my breaking point. The MCU has officially written itself into a corner. Where do they even go from here? There's nothing left. There's no direction, and I'm just done. I feel like I've eaten a crate full of Peeps and I'm now sick to my stomach. About the only left I care for use Guardians of the Galaxy 3, and I'm not sure how much I care for that anymore.Please, I just want to watch anything else than Marvel and Disney anymore, but it's so hard to avoid when even previously competing blockbusters like Avatar is now owned by Disney!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Maybe Thor is signalling the downfall or end of superhero movies, at least for the big screen. They should still be high demand on the small screen for another decade or so.This is definitely the worst of any marvel or dc movies, the director seems wanted to cover the original movie and a parody of that movie, all in this one. There jokes and comic moments just follow one after another in the first hour more than action scenes.

Loved the story a lot: children, love and that life is not eternal.Some say the movie was a joke, which I don't agree at all. I always preferred marvel over DC for arcade-like actions and vibrant colors. The jokes in this movies just make Thors character more witty.By the way there is something I disliked about this movie: old spice product placement was too straight.I wasn't high expectations about this movie. I've got what I wanted from it. Just feel really sorry for Taika.

coming to story, Thor already lost everything previously & now there was nothing to loose so Thor was like pretending to be a person who don't care but want to be one who cares in this film's 1st half 2nd half is full of Jane Foster & Gor, Christian Bale has done decent job portraying his character he had looked & act brutal & one can feel his presence all the time, where as Natalie Portman aka Jane Foster aka Mighty Thor is amazing in this film all points to her when she is on screen you can't look anyone else so this film's must have been ""Mighty Thor & Gor the God Butcher""I think Taika Watiti must be having a pressure to make this film under or upto 2 hours so he has done what was necessary but it could have been more
Big Problem I thought after watching this film was how Zeus was introduced it was completely Shame or i would say insult to whom which follow Greek mythology as Zeus is most powerful Greek God.All & all i would say if you are Thor Fan you will like this film otherwise 1 time watch#marvelcomics #marveluniverse #MarvelStudios #marvelindia #ThorLoveAndThunder #MightyThor #thor #thorsday #Stormbreaker.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There were things I liked and enjoyed about it but also things I didn't. For me the biggest issue was the first act. It felt rushed and could have used way more. For instance, I would have liked to have seen more backstory with Gorr but also more with Jane as well and what she was up to with her cancer diagnosis and all. Another thing is they should've actually showed her initial transformation into Mighty Thor, they had to have filmed it, I know they filmed it. Also her first meeting with Valkyrie and their relationship. Another thing I wasn't a fan of was the stuff with the Guardians. I just didn't care for that section and thought the jokes were a bit overkill at times.What I did like and enjoy was the little we got of Gorr the God Butcher. I liked Thor & Janes interactions/relationship in the movie. The flashback to their breakup was a great sequence. I also enjoyed several of the fight sequences and the ending. Thought it was unexpected and surprising. Curious as to what's next with that ending.All in all, I think this movie could have used a lot more of a lot things and a lot less jokes. It was mainly lacking the balance that Thor: Ragnarok possessed. Which is its main problem. Regardless, I still had a fun time but left wanting more in areas.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Another Fun Popcorn Movie from the MCU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8900736/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","1 March 2023","The Thor series of movies were ones that I wasn't fully interested originally but have become my favorite of the original group of Avengers. This one also pulled my interest with the villain being Gorr and played by Christian Bale. This one I watched with Jaime as there are certain superhero films she will still watch.For this movie here, we are first introduced to Gorr as he is given the Necro Sword that allows him to kill gods. He goes about this hunt after dedicating his life to one that turned his back on him.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is still hanging out with the Guardians of the Galaxy. They split ways here as Thor learns of Gorr, who is known as 'The God Butcher'. This pulls Thor to Earth. He goes to New Asgard where King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is in power still. Korg (Taika Waititi) joins him.There is a wrinkle here that I picked up on from the subtitle, Love and Thunder. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) has cancer. She is slowly dying and it feels like she is giving up the fight. Darcy (Kat Dennings) wants her to reach out to Thor, but things didn't end well and there is unresolved feelings.The two of them run into each other when Mjöllnir calls out to Jane. Thor has a big surprise from this as well. He might be a bit jealous. Thor enlists the aid of those that will join him to defeat this new threat that is killing gods and there are none that can escape his wrath.Now that I've recapped this movie, I did want to say that this another solid installment. What I noticed here is that this one is another dark take while also being whimsical. Jaime wasn't even entirely sure if she liked this one as it seems to be more comedy than others. I was looking for the best way to put this since The Dark World and Ragnarök also have dark elements too. This seems to be a thing with Thor movies. I should say that I like the comedy aspects as it made me laugh.Then back to the darker elements. Gorr is a great villain. I'm not familiar with the comics so I don't know about him as a villain. It is interesting since he uses a weapon called the Necro Sword that would be right out of video games I've played like Final Fantasy. I like that aspect. It also brings interesting powers. Gorr also kidnaps children. I never feel like they're truly in peril. I still like it.I'll then go over to the acting. Hemsworth is great as Thor. I like that this movie makes him a bit more human which is good. Bringing back Portman is good too. There is good heart and emotion there. I like Bale as the villain. He fits that role well. Thompson and Waititi are solid in their supporting roles. They're both great with the comedy. We also have cameos by Russell Crowe, Jaimie Alexander, Idris Elba, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, Dennings, Stellan Skarsgård, Luke Hemsworth, Matt Damon, Sam Neill, Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. We also get the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper as well.All that is left to go into would be with the filmmaking. This has good cinematography. There is good contrast between the place of the gods to the desert we first see Gorr and then even going to the shadow realm. There is a lot of CGI, but I come to expect that. This has Disney money so it looks good. We also get a heavy dose of Guns-n-Roses which I wasn't expecting with the soundtrack. This is worth a watch and one of the better movies during the Marvel Cinematic Universe for Phase 4.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

His idea to lighten up Ragnarok was somewhat good idea, but Love and Thunder is a complete flop where cringe comedy, and over painted costumes badly clash against the dark theme of Gorr and Necrosword.From Thor's costume being blasted with few too many paints, and looking like a toy, to overuse of jokes, the show just falls apart with every minute. I mean, how many times they will overuse the whole Mjölnir/Stormbreaker ""drama"" joke, to then make an absurdly cringe scene where Thor pours the beer over the Stormbreaker, and scratches it, like it's a dog.In the end, the only good parts of the movie are the beginning which depicts how Gorr came to be the host for Necrosword, and the ending where they all stand before Eternity, and we are witness the final resolution.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This one would be second. They recycle a lot of what worked in the last movie (eg similar tone and how they use the soundtrack), and don't introduce much new. I'm ok with that. They threw absolutely everything they had at Ragnarok, Immigrant Song was practically made for a Thor movie, so that is hard to follow up.After Infinity War they had to spend time getting Thor out of his funk, and I think they've done that here. I'm glad they were able to bring Jane Foster back because they had never really addressed what happened there. I hope they do another because I'm excited to see where a Thor with a purpose ends up next.If they do another I hope Tiaka uses Iron Maiden for the soundtrack. Run to the Hills would be epic during an action scene.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Whilst this drastic change was very welcomed at the time, the idea for this film , including the casting of Christian Bale who is known for his intense and serious characters, doesn't match Waititi's style. The film had very contrasting scenes so close together, going from the wacky comedy the director is known for to very dark and intense ones straight afterwards, then vice versa all too quickly. Bale did a phenomenal job as Gorr, safe to say he is the best marvel villains to come out in phase 4 yet overall the film was too goofy for such an intense character as Gorr. Chris Hemsworth also did his thing and wasn't let down by his performance and Portman's character Jane Foster is no longer the boring side character to add a little spice. Sadly, although I love Korg, he had too many corny jokes that came quite tedious and a legthy amount of screentime for a side character especially compared to Valkyrie which was a shame as Thompson is great.All in all I think Waititi was perfect for the revival of the Thor franchise yet this film needed less of a balance between goofy and dark themes as simply, the villain did not suit the film despite his brilliant portrayal. Maybe Sam Raimi would've been a better fit with his tendencies to make things a little more intense.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie didn't wow me like Ragnarok. The director of Ragnarok tried to replicate what he did but I believe it fell short.Pros- The movie was funny, Bale was amazing as Gorr, loved Portman as Mighty Thor, great story setup for the origin of Gorr, great effects.Cons- I felt Bale's Gorr didn't get enough screen time to develop, overutilized the same comedic stick throughout the movie, story as a whole was kind of weak, for a 2 hour movie everything felt rushed, The Guardians were a delight to see but not needed. They could of used that extra money they paid them to be in the movie for something else.Overall this movie was okay. It didn't wow me. As I was watching this movie, I thought the 4th installment is not going to be great or bigger than the 3rd. I reflected on the recent MCU projects and still feel Dr. Strange 2 and Now Way Home were far superior to this movie. Not just on the cameos but story, story development, rythmn and chemistry with the characters. Definitely not worth rushing to go see it. Catch a matinee or wait for streaming. Contemplating whether I want to own it on Blu ray when it comes out. It's a one and done for me I think.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Annoying in terms of how every character (except Gorr) is a comedian and annoying how much potential is wasted.The movie felt like Saturday Night Live sketch stretched out to two hours.The movie could have been a dark finale to the character of Thor. I mean, this is the same god who lost his mother, father, brother three times, his home, and lived with guilt for five years after failing to kill Thanos the first time. If that wasn't bad enough, his ex-girlfriend Jane Foster is dying from cancer, and on top of that, there is a new villain who seeks to kill gods. Again, this could have been a dark finale, as he is the most tragic character in the MCU, but here he's just a goofy idiot. Chris Hemsworth has comedic chops, but they did this character dirty. They turned Thor from ""Thor making jokes"" to ""Thor is the joke"".Christian Bale always delivers, and he was creepy and campy as Gorr the God Butcher. His storyline is the only serious part of the movie that unfortunately gets undeveloped with very little screen time. His character work was rushed because at the start he worth ships the gods, but as quick as a light switch, he wants to kill every god possible. Since he is called The God Butcher, you don't see a lot of God killing. The ones he does kill in the movie were an afterthought.Natalie Portman was good, but sadly the dramatic elements of her character didn't pull on my heartstrings. On the other hand, there are some cool action scenes with her, even though it's strange how fully experienced she is in fighting with these powers despite how recent she got it.The whole movie is one big joke, with no clear focus on what storyline it wants to go. The short runtime does not help either, as it needed more breathing room for development like character work and story.I could talk about the visual effects, but I will not since the visual effect artists have been through enough already. Seriously Marvel, treat your employees with respect.The Guardians of the Galaxy team are there with no purpose than to help Thor lose weight, and then they leave.Director Taika Waititi went way over his head with this one. One of the most unusual inclusions of these screaming goats in the movie for no reason and there keep repeating the joke of them screaming. Like, WHY????Is it me, or do the recent Marvel movies feel like quantity over quality? There are like a factory machine, pumping out many movies and an endless line of TV shows. The runtime clocked in under two hours, with this movie and Doctor Strange 2, and yet I felt those movies needed more time to breathe and flesh out the characters because everything feels so rushed and, in a hurry, to end.Balancing comedy and drama are a difficult task to get right. If a movie has a serious tone while not being a good movie itself, there is a potential for it to be funny and enjoyable. If a film has a comedic tone while not being funny, then the movie would get boring very quickly.Overall rating: The movie has everything it needs to be fascinating, yet it still turned-out paper thin.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Taika you really wasted a good story and good actors.Kevin feige needs to do something about all this empty stories .Even the trailers and advertising clips had better ideas behind them .There is no connection between the story parts and thats when you are going to check your phone and see whats the news.For sure in the way of making good movies feige needs to control his directors more.And if marvel wants to keep going up its better to find young people with fresh ideas. Fans are losing their faith to Marvel.Thor and the story of jealous storm breaker in the trailer was so much more fun than the movie .Thor and kids was another part of story which was letting us down.The hercules and zeus had nothing to say. And if taika really like orgy its better to keep it to his self. I mean there was so many other ways to show a great God has lost his way and wasting his life. Like what thor did in End game.In the next part of movie we have no mention to Thors mother who is the reason why thor is working hard.The back story of thor and jean was bad. Like you saw her 8 years ago sick and older like now. The old shots was better to use.The reason of break up showed us no feeling. The Thor of past was so much stronger in character to gave up like that.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I understand the need for humor, and have quite liked most of it in the previous films. It's a nice take on the character, but oh my god, this was just boringly stupid. It wasn't just me either. I was sitting there watching this, being privately disgusted, when my wife asked me ""Are we gonna watch the rest of this?"". I didn't say anything, just clicked it off.

Just Seems to me that Disney at the moment seems to be obsessed with making sure that all the genders and ethnicitys are covered in every film and TV shows rather than making films what film lovers and fans want to see. Hopefully Disney will start listening to real fans and film lovers rather than listening to executives who are trying there best not to upset certain groups of people.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I really enjoy the comedy but I think Love and Thunder focused on it too much. Majority of the film was jokes and then it seemed like they tried to cram the import stuff into the last 30 minutes. Again, a fan of the comedy aspect but they could have focused more on the plot and everything going on while throwing in jokes instead of all jokes and throwing in plot.The cast was great as usual and Bale did an excellent job as the villain. I think I would have liked to see more of his character, as it seemed he was thrown in every now and then. Hemsworth is always amazing as Thor. His character has gone through a lot of self discovery and changes since the first movie and Chris does a great job portraying all of that while still being funny, serious, charming and mighty Thor.Overall I did enjoy this movie but it could have used some help on getting the story together.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You see how well it turned out. I thought his best performance was in American Gangster, but now I see that in this movie. Here he plays the role of the myths of Zeus. Chris Hemsworth has become one with his role. It's like he has really become one of the gods. The music of the film is the only flaw that can be criticized. Bill is the best role after Batmans. Or at least he played a negative role. Of course, it wasn't bad in the American psyche either, but there his role was more of a black comedy. That film was not very well defined, but here it copes well with the negative role. In Ford, against Ferrari, his role does not suit him at all. He did not belong to that movie at all, not that he is a bad actor. The climax of the film's masterpiece is the presence of the Asgardians in the gate of Zeus. Here we have so-called delicious inserts, like the movie Silence of the Lambs, with the difference that the history of this deliciousness has been used up, but here we are dealing with an original movie. The delicious inserts of this movie fit in the format and do not look ridiculous. As in the movie, Jodie Foster's name is mentioned to some extent. The peak of this deliciousness is the inserts we have of Russell Crowe's face. And performs a mythological role for us completely. The ending of the movie is also unique. Disney paints mise-en-scène very well. It seems as if he has done what he misses in making the best animation in this movie. I say a mythological and since fiction film.you don't do the right thing with your hates.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

He makes quirky films, with excellent storylines and always seems to get the balance of humour right......so I'm disappointed to write, along with many others here, that this movie contains none of that and he seems to have lost himself and the magic he once brought to film, and this film just has a sense of showing-off , nothing more, no substance whatsoever!This movie will leave you walking out of the cinema dazed and confused because it just never takes off! I've never walked out of a Marvel screening feeling anything less than blown away and wanting more! The really wow of terrific writing and plot twists!This isn't a film, it tells no story, it is simply a showcase of silliness, with no plot and Christian Bales talents are absolutely wasted with very little screentime - his character was meant to be a main player, but you quickly forget about him and just get lost in being mesmerised with recycled jokes and the feeling of being underwhelmed.I never thought I'd rate an MCU movie less than a 7 or 8 but this is a 3 at best.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

He is definitely catching up to Ryan Reynolds in the 'wittiest actor around' stakes.I laughed my ass off at the string of witty jokes and situations.Valkyrie, and particularly Lady Thor were just wonderful.Zeus was a complete nutter!Gorr was a very interesting and tragic character.The Gods were portrayed in quite an interesting way here: basically, most of them are jerks, especially a certain one.I would say that is the most fun I have had at a marvel film, or any film for a long time.It is perhaps not a story that stands up to scrutiny if you are really looking at it as part of the development of the mcu history; it really does nothing in that regard.But....If you leave your critical brain in a jar at the door, and just want to have some fun, and maybe a tear or three (I cried), this might be just the ticket.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

But then they just forget about it and move in to the next thing. The film feels a bit rushed, and there is a higher amount of humor to this film that it feels forced at times. None of the actors do a bad job, in fact Bale's performance was amazing, and the plot is done well, it's more that the tone keeps flipping around and that what kills it for me. Overall, still a good addition to the MCU.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Good story, good humour, good action, good music. Go watch this movie with an open mind and you'll love it. It's always a treat to watch Chris Hemsworth and Christian bale in action. A boring movie will divert your attention for a bit, but this movie grips your attention throughout. Lovely writing and great acting. Needless to say, the graphics in marvel movies has always been top notch. Excited to see where the story of love and thunder goes from here.

I dont know if im just tired of the marvel type of humor. But I did not laugh once. I don't think the movie made me feel anything other than an hour or two is going by.The romance is there, for some parts its portrayed in a ""rom-com"" movie like when they're doing comedic outdoor activities and what not. I can detect the endearment in that, it just did nothing for me.The action is there, you get a medium shot, a wideshot, slow mo. Flashy colors and such, all that is just fine nothing special at all.The settings are visually interesting. Theres a location with lots of golds and yellows, so the character's blue, green or purple outfits contrast with that. The most interesting setting was a greyscale location where sources of light will reveal color. That was fun to look at.The soundtrack containing the licensed songs are just fine if you like 1980's rock music. Score composition was barely noticable until the final 20 minutes.Theres two giant screaming goats characters who are basically plot devices. The screaming becomes obnoxious after a while.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

This time laughs and love in equal measure as action and universal travels, through Korg's unique style of storytelling.We find Thor where he was last seen, in the company of the Guardians, but a number of fatal occurences around the galaxy force a separation: the Guardians on one ship, Thor, Korg and Taylor Swift's goats through Stormbreaker's Bifrost portal to the New Asgard. Here, Thor, Valkyrie, and a new and improved Jane must confront a new evil: a powerful force intent on ridding the universe of Gods because of his heartbreaking circumstances. As always, Thor alone cannot conquer this evil so he must travel great distances to find an army.And here the religious zealots have a hissy fit, as the gods depicted are depraved, self-loving idiots led by an indulgent Zeus, played brilliantly by Russell Crowe (I'll have to wait until it is released on DVD to pause the line up of fabled gods to see if the more well-known ones are there, but I expect they are!). Without support, they take what they need from the gold-bleeding heathans and try to confront the evil head-on, themselves.Taika Waititi's self-deprecating humour and spectacle on show once again, knocking Hollywood's heavyweights onto their knees! A superior storyteller in all aspects: design, stylings and music beyond anything that has come before!! A true masterpiece in the individual Superhero spectrum- Avengers in his hands would be a comedic Dirty Dozen: worthy of awards! He has broken all molds of what sequels should look like: this is not dark and dreary like Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, nor fun and happy-endingly as Return of the Jedi, maybe a pinch of both. Having a Star Wars film in his hands in the future is very promising!The returning list of characters, actors and story arcs is impossible to detail from just one viewing and would spoil the surprise and fun for first-time viewers, but suffice to say it is superb! The whole experience is shockingly, breathtakingly fun to the nth degree! A must-watch for Marvel fans of all ages!","9 out of 26 found this helpful.

This film is cheesy and something that does not show the power of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe can do which is quite the disappointment. This ultimately felt like a film that someone decided to do simply because they had an idea and said why not make a movie, instead of doing research on the character and create a story that fans would fall over for. Thor seems to not have much to live up to anyhow as his films never quite pull their weight in the line of films for the MCU and this one is by far the weakest film of all of them.

I cannot believe this is a genuine Marvel movie, it feels like complete parody. It's clear everyone making it was having enormous fun (except Tessa Thompson, who looks and sounds like she'd rather be anywhere else), but it's a huge shame that it's not such a fun film to watch. It is absolutely all over the place.Granted, in the Avengers, Thor had become the subject of mockery, but this film takes it even further. He is supposed to be a strong hero but he is just ridiculous.I'm surprised Natalie Portman agreed to come back for this given how different it is from the original Thor movies in which she starred.Christian Bale is excellent as a duplicate Voldemort, intent on killing Gods. His storyline is the only one which has any sense of a proper narrative and is marginally satisfying.After 90% of the film is self parody and daft jokes, it suddenly has a very heartfelt and sentimental ending, which it simply does not earn.Marvel must be drunk on the success of Ragnarok to give the creators of this film such creative leeway as to make this film which is a spoof pretending to be a proper Marvel film.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

And didn't thor learn from his first film to not be narcissistic? This movie just falls back to almost worse narcissism, same with Thor: Ragnarok where he doesn't give a crap about Banner's feelings, just ""me and my people"".Way too many bad jokes and uncomfortable scenes that i just skipped through on disney plus, too much guns'n roses, and bad pacing.Just didn't feel it with this one.

Gorr isn't given enough screen time to the point where his name, ""Gorr the God Butcher"" is earned. The audience has very little reason to fear him and to think our heroes are in any real danger.Third and final act is phenomenal and truly does its best to carry the movie. Very few Marvel movies have a better third act. Thor L&T FINALLY takes itself serious with SOME comedy sprinkled in. Jane Foster and Mighty Thor are handled VERY well and there truly is a great chemistry between her and Thor. Definitely a highlight. The only somewhat negative thing to say about the third act is the way Valkyrie's character is handled in the end.All in all, an okay movie that easily could've been great with some tweaks.

"6","/10","""Thor: Love and Thunder"" does not innovate and follows the studio's usual structure and formula and the feeling is of wasted potential with the themes and characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9547807/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","7 January 2024","Taika Waititi is once again in charge of the production, bringing his comedic approach, half parody and half sketch, which transforms Thor into a kind of crazy Flash Gordon. Many critics and a good portion of the public really liked what Waititi did in ""Ragnarok"", presenting us with a pastel space opera bursting with color, rock, humor and lots of action. Unfortunately, the sequel fails to reach the same level of quality and fun as the previous film. The film's main problem is that the plot has a lot to deal with in its two hours or so of projection. And it is precisely this ambition of wanting to deal with so many materials at the same time that becomes a double-edged sword for the film. Thor, Jane and Gorr have their own narrative arcs (with Jane and Gorr's being particularly interesting) that share the screen with King Valkyrie dictating the future of New Asgard, with the typical New Asgard gags and with the usual expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all very good, but the narrative has difficulty balancing all of this - and the production having four editors working on the film in the editing room didn't help.One of the negative aspects of the work begins with the Guardians of the Galaxy. In terms of continuity in the MCU, it's strange that the group of heroes is basically a footnote in the film. It would be genuinely fun to have an adventure between them and Thor, especially in regards to the chemistry between Hemsworth and Chris Pratt. However, considering the salary of some actors, the script that is already bloated without the group's participation and even the work to reconcile the schedules of so many artists, it is possible to understand in terms of production why the Guardians' participation is quick. But the main problem with the sequence is the fact that it is only the first of many isolated blocks of the film, with Taika structuring the narrative in a fragmented way. We have the block in New Asgard, then in the pantheon of gods, later in the Shadow Dimension and so on. It is a script full of ""mini-adventures"", which are types of sketches, all disjointed and poorly connected.The director is unable to explore the different scenarios in depth as he had done on Sakaar in the previous feature. Take, for example, that whole sequence with the gods, where the full potential of a truly crazy nucleus is restricted to a discussion between Thor and Zeus (Russell Crowe), with the Greek god doing some dances and the Asgardian team defeating some soldiers without expression. The New Zealand director's total lack of creativity is unbelievable, summing up his cinematic approach to showing Thor without clothes and placing Crowe in a totally embarrassing role. The scenes in New Asgard, despite being fun with the Disneyland thing, follow a similar path, little exploring society or any aspect of the people of Asgard so that there is more time for the play with special appearances by Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, Sam Neill and Melissa McCarthy. Even the dramatic segment of Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) return is handled with an irritatingly superficial narrative economy, problematizing the issue of cancer in just four scenes. There is no time for anything in this film, for the characters to be developed, for the adventure to breathe and for all these space scenarios to be thoroughly enjoyed.The second problem is the way the narrative makes transitions between adventure blocks. Taika simply has the characters travel left and right through their weapons, demonstrating an immense laziness to build a truly organic story. There is an obvious sloppiness in the conduct of plots and the use of certain characters in the work, such as the exclusion of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) from the final act, with the character being completely unnecessary and underused throughout the production, and also in the way Gorr is used as an antagonist. The script uses the Butcher of the Gods in the worst way that an antagonist can be developed: he is there more to move the plot than to be a counterpoint to the hero, so much so that we rarely see Gorr and Thor have any kind of interesting dialogue with each other. It's a shame, because the god slayer is a conceptually interesting character, far from being Manichaean and Bale, despite some occasional histrionics, is really committed to the role, even giving more dimension and nuanced empathy than he received from the script. There is a sequence that sums up why Gorr doesn't work in the film: when the villain makes that trap to catch the Stormbreaker, Waititi's direction is very efficient in creating a macabre atmosphere at the character's entrance, accompanied by wonderful monochromatic photography, a soundtrack sinister and a Bale committed to the character's psychopathy, and then Thor makes a joke about a dentist. It's so anticlimactic, it completely breaks the construction of the scene and, worse, it takes Gorr's threat off the table.Just like all the scenes with the villain, we never feel any real threat coming from the villain, disappointing everyone who follows the character in the comics, to the detriment of the absurd need to try to insert jokes every five minutes into the script. There is no weight in the threat of the villain, nor in the dramas (see how much drama could have been extracted from the plot involving terminal cancer). All of this is broken with a joke, not always as well inserted as in ""Ragnarok"". This time, the jokes seem to be inserted in an inorganic and forced way, it is as if ""Ragnarok"", praised by many, was written again with much more exaggerations in all aspects, especially in narrative convenience and humor, which this time does not work so well. You see: the joke with the goats screaming is funny the first and second time, but it gets diluted when done for the thousandth time. It's as if the script doesn't know when to stop and loses control as the plot progresses.""Thor: Love and Thunder"" will receive a lot of criticism because of the humor, but the comedy is not a problem as a proposal. The potential of the work is, in fact, very high, and could have been an even more insane version of what we saw in ""Ragnarok"" . The criticism lies in the lack of creativity of Taika Waititi, and also of co-screenwriter Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, in the narrative construction and cinematic approach. Waititi even gave interviews saying that the film was the craziest he had ever made and that he didn't it shouldn't have even been made. Where was all this madness? The action scenes are mostly generic, like the sequences on the streets of New Asgard and in the center of the gods, where the heroes defeat faceless armies, or the clashes with the Gorr himself that doesn't have any inventive choreography beyond the clash of weapons. There are some interesting visual ideas, like Mjolnir shattering, the Thors fighting together, the army of children taken from the best children's films, and, of course, all the block in Dimension of Shadows, but these are sparse moments and which, honestly, seem more like a merit of the technical team than staging ideas or any minimally memorable set-piece from the direction. It is, in fact, a creative and noteworthy film in terms of production design, but the impression given is that the director and screenwriter was working with a lot of freedom due to the prestige achieved previously, and does this work on autopilot to offer some kind of brand or expressiveness that we saw in his previous productions. After the film's release, Waititi said that he only made the Thor films for the money and that he had never read any Thor comics as a child before making the first film. Perhaps this explains the feeling of sloppiness when we see this production.Regarding the story itself, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" does not innovate and follows the studio's usual structure and formula. However, there is one plot point that proves to be useless and irrelevant to the overall narrative, being merely a marketing strategy to sell the upcoming film. The main objective of the protagonists is not fulfilled in this deviation and something that was supposed to be essential ends up becoming a kind of MacGuffin in the third act. The action set piece is easily forgettable and Russell Crowe's interpretation becomes an unbearable caricature, using an accent so absurd that it ends up removing all seriousness from his character, damaging an eventual powerful presence in future works. Finally, the action of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" meets the minimum requirements. The black and white sequence takes the trophy, the first act with the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" brings good levels of entertainment, but everything involving generic CGI monsters born from shadows... I understand the intention of trying to save time and money with ""remains"" of visual effects, hiding the imperfections in the darkness of the night - a well-known workaround - but, unfortunately, most of these scenes become a sometimes-incomprehensible mix of CGI, where it becomes difficult to understand what is really happening.Despite all the problems, the film has its funny moments, like the screaming goats and Jane looking for a catchphrase, and there are several interesting themes regarding mortality, fatherhood, romance and purpose that fill the dramatic arc of a character who becomes made him truly curious behind the jokes. The script is smart in subverting some things, from Gorr's dilemma, the sacrifice of Mighty Thor and a truly beautiful and cute ending with the protagonist becoming a big daddy. In the end, phase 4 is heading towards being the least connected phase between MCU productions, whether in theaters or on Disney Plus, where at this moment the focus is on leaving the darker and mystical side of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness "" aside to focus on the more colorful, playful and flashy side of ""Thor: Love and Thunder"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It feels like this could be the last Thor although the ending and character leave plenty of room for adventures to continue. But I feel like the second half of phase 4 has just been really weak.

1. It's a movie by committee, which means it exists for the sole purpose of making money. They have to check certain boxes, make sure everyone is happy, and not offend anyone.2. It takes itself pretty seriously until they decide to throw in a joke, which is about every 90 seconds
3. Christian Bale is a great actor (from Empire of the Sun to American Psycho), so let's give him almost nothing to work with, aside from (yet another) ""I want to destroy everything"" bad guy
4. Everyone loves Guns n Roses, so we should play four of their songs! But not any of the deep cuts, just the hits at cliched parts of the movie (and even name a character Axl)
5. Russel Crowe: It doesn't matter that his Greek accent sounds more Italian than anything else, people like him so maybe they'll like this movie.6. Screaming goats.","21 out of 40 found this helpful.

An amazing cast is wasted on a story that tries too hard to pull on your heartstrings, has too many comedic moments that fall flat and even the action scenes pale in comparison to scenes in past movies in the series. I turned it off more than once and forced myself to finish as a fan of Hemsworth, Bale and the Thor movies. It was fun, but forgettable and I don't see myself going back for a rewatch.

While it's nice to see funny movie, but if it's too silly then it's no good. The third has better balance between comedic and serious scene. This one feels shallow and meaningless. Honestly without Christian Bale as God Butcher, this movie would be a disaster.But is it that bad? Not really. As usual we see Thor God of Thunder in action. He looks stronger than before. Accompanied by Korg, Valkyrie, and surprise surprise, Jane Foster who now has Thor power and wield Mjolnir. As I said Bale portraying Gorr is the best thing here. He outperform other actors and actresses. The action as good as usual. So is the CGI. Russel Crowe as Zeus is fun. And we also get to see The Guardian of the Galaxy team in action.They say Thor will return again.

But with the emergence of a new threat who seems determined to rid the universe of all the gods, Thor goes out on his own and reunites with an old flame.There are plenty of mixed reviews for Thor: Love and Thunder so when I went to see it myself I was not sure what to be prepared for. It's certainly a very chaotic movie, moving briskly from one emotion to another and not really fixating on anything for a prolonged period. It made the film feel disjointed to me, I was unsure what emotion I should be feeling at times. There is a lot of character arcs at play but outside of Thor himself the other characters only get fleeting screen time and therefore I struggled to connect with them. The action scenes were okay but certainly won't rank up there with the MCU's best, infact one of them may rank with the MCU's worst - the kids fighting at the end of the film. The humour was consistent I will give it that, not always smart humour sadly often childish but it was throughout. And Natalie Portman did a fantastic job as Mighty Thor/Jane Foster, she looked great but also I believed her. Although not every emotional scene involing her hit the mark, there was one that did during the final fight of film and I admit my eyes got a little teary. There was one thing about the whole movie that just felt off... the CGI. It was too bland, and came across as cartoony and not at all realistic. It really did take me out of the film at times.Final Verdict: I'm really not sure who this film was targeted at - certain scenes look targeted at children and others were cheesy adult humour. The Jane Foster aspects of the film were pretty good and my favourite aspect although the emotional stuff didn't always land. It's a mixed bagged and my least favourite solo Thor film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thor was cocky and cringy where Loki was more sophisticated, more agile in words. There is no character in this movie balancing Thor. He is like a rockstar. Believes in his super awesomeness and there is no character that could slap him back to reality.Bale is awesome actor and his performance was top notch. This was best antagonist of any Thor movie. Way better than Hella and had enough of backstory and motive and his powers were well justified and grounded in movie reality.I did laugh my ass off few times, but my friends were quite disappointed.

Now, in 'Thor: Love and Thunder' (his fourth solo film), when a vengeful man (Christian Bale) with a serious grudge against the gods of the universe begins killing them off one-by-one, Thor must part ways with the Guardians and put an end to the slaughter. This time, however, besides King Valkyrie and rocky sidekick Korg, he has an unexpected new ally fighting by his side in the form of ex-girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who, by wielding his former hammer Mjolnir, has become the Mighty Thor! Thor and Jane's relationship takes center stage here, as this film is essentially Marvel Studios' first romantic comedy, and director/writer Taika Waititi (returning from 2017's 'Thor: Ragnarok') and co-writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson breathe new life into said relationship and truly make you want to see them get their ""happily ever after"". Chris Hemsworth's and Natalie Portman's chemistry is great, and I cared about these two more than I ever have before. The comedy was pretty hit-or-miss for me, but thankfully most of it landed. It's just as silly as its predecessor 'Ragnarok' (perhaps even more so), but there are also some really emotional moments that balance out the silliness. Unfortunately, the story does often feel rushed, and definitely could've benefited from being a bit more fleshed out. However, I absolutely LOVED the ending! I've also seen some criticism about the film's CGI, but everything looked real and convincing enough for me, so I have no complaints about it. The cast is a delight, and Hemsworth's Thor continues to be a highlight of the MCU, but Portman's Foster and Bale's Gorr the God Butcher really steal the show. Jane/Mighty Thor is such a likeable character and is impossible not to root for, and Gorr is honestly one of the creepiest, most unsettling movie villains I've ever seen, yet he's also sympathetic because of his motivations. We sadly don't see as much of the latter as I would've liked though, and I wish he had a bit more screen time. The film is also amplified by a rockin' soundtrack full of some of Guns N' Roses' greatest hits. Overall, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a heartfelt, fun, and enjoyable rom-com adventure, and a worthy inclusion to the MCU.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Bale and Crowe are instead the film's biggest standouts, because they dare to supersize their performances.To summarise, Love and Thunder offers the usual lightning-streaked action and tossed-off gags, but this time, there's not enough heft behind the flashiness.My Rating: 4.5/10.","19 out of 36 found this helpful.

I didn't like it, and I enjoyed Thor the Dark World....so...there's that. It was just too silly. I'm all about comedy, but it was just too over the top. The jokes played out pretty quick and just got annoying. Christian Bale was good. The story could have been good, at least most of it. But man the over-the-top silliness. It was almost like watching a Thor parody, like if the Scary Movie guys made a Thor movie. Some recycled jokes showed up that were funny in Ragnarok...you know...the first time we saw them. I feel like Ragnarok was so good because it was fresh, a brand new take on Thor, but that obviously has limits. Twas was my least favorite of the Thors...yep. I actually just re-watched Thor 2, aaaand I think it's better. In L&T's defense, I had very high expectations after Ragnarok, perhaps too high. Maybe I'll revisit it when it streams, but for now, nah.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I distinctly remember Mjollnir being back in the possession of Thor and Captain America after Thor stole it from the Dark World timeline... of course, the Asgardians could have scooped up the pieces left over from Ragnarok, but where is that other hammer from Avengers endgame? Maybe it is not really a plot hole, I don't remember where that other Mjollnir got to. Did Steve Rogers return it?And then it is always great to have the Guardians of the Galaxy involved, this was before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol3 and Nebula's transformation into one of Tony Starks Nanotech projects. I honestly liked her before when she was still partly RadioShack shelf rejects.And compared to Ragnarok, although there is a lot of humor in this film, it does have some serious drama.But there are a number of absurd complaints I've read in several dupe ""reviews"". Let's go over these, shall we?1) It's FUNNY.To not like a movie because it is FUNNY? That is the main complaint that I am reading, oh, this is no good because it is FUNNY. Wait, what?There are some new gimmicks in this film, nothing was wasted. And so Thor assembles a new means of transportation through by Bifrost. Out of... Watch the movie to find out what it is made out of. But it's funny!2) NepotismI also read a number of complaints regarding ""nepotism"", wait, what! That's a big so what! I don't care who plays what or who, or if they are the son or daughter of some cast or crew member. Yawn. And honestly, I did not know when I was watching the film.Christian Bale almost reprises his role as the American Psycho. - at first, we believe that this person is irredeemable. But in a major, unexpected twist, well, you will have to watch the film in order to see what I'm talking about.The film starts getting very serious toward the middle, of course it kind of slightly bothers me that Thor is still a little bit goofy after the events of avengers endgame. But then again, this is also within his character. He was handed a major loss in endgame, and this was his reaction. So, as far as I'm concerned, he is dealing with that loss, which changed him irrevocably.This is a much different Thor than the person that we met in the first film. And The Avengers. That serious person... Which is totally expected after all the character has gone through.And these changes were just for films, the comic book numbered in the hundreds, and the character was always ever-changing, even then.Remember when Thor resided within a geek that had to yell ""ODIN"" at a hammer which would then turn him into Thor? The character has changed a lot over the course of maybe 40 or 50 years. And then some of his power was siphoned off into another character named Bloodaxe, which was a spinoff title that only lasted a couple of dozen issues- it was related to West Coast Avengers, which then became Force Works.It's kind of like how the Hulk was always dumb and residing within Bruce Banner. And hulk has gone through a lot of changes. There was a time he was dumb when he was human, but smart when he was ""The Gray Hulk""- but back then he went by ""Mr. Fixit"", he accompanied Wolverine in a few issues. Anybody remember The Hulk versus Thor? It is now called ""the return of the Incredible Hulk""- at the time when it was originally broadcast, it was called the Hulk versus Thor, or probably simply Hulk vs Thor. And some of the dialogue from that TV movie found its way into the first Thor film.3) CGI?Another complaint was with the amount of CGI, which you can barely tell these days. And this complaint is made by people who don't realize that there are still a lot of practical effects and real, physical locations and objects, even in this film. I'm getting really tired of that old complaint. If we have the ability to make realistic, digital set extensions, then we should use them always. But even with a lot of digital set extensions, a lot of the detail is real physical props, and other real artwork.I like that this movie focuses a lot on the Asgardian children, and it shows their true potential- including the son of Heimdall.I like that this film pulls back from the inanity of Ragnarok, although this film includes some of that silliness.I thought Ragnarok was way over the top, but I did enjoy it. But this film has that same over the top feel at least at the beginning, but it also is balanced with some heartbreaking things.The final complaint and I see this a lot is about ""the writing""I want to ask the people who wrote those reviews, have you ever written for television? Have you ever written for Broadway or the theater?You can't just sit down and spew unplanned stream of conscious, everything has to be planned out and mapped out, especially with television.And it's even more difficult with a film.And so the question I finally have is: are these reviews taking an extremely long time to post? Because I don't believe I have put anything into these reviews that are anything near as bad as what I have read recently.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

He enlists the help of his friends, and a new unexpected hero. Unfortunately I really wasn't a fan of this film, and I just ended up getting really bored while watching it!Firstly, the cinematography was fairly decent but there wasn't much to talk about. I really enjoyed the black-and-white that was used in the film, it was tasteful and set an interesting tone. My main issue in terms of visuals comes with the CGI, which I thought was poor and some of the worst we've seen in the MCU so far. I'd expect more, as they obviously had the budget needed.The acting was good, and the characters continue to be as loveable as they always were. Chris Hemsworth is charismatic as Thor, and Natalie Portman really put her all into her performance, however I feel her character was rushed and wasted. Christian Bale was intriguing as the new villain but once again, I feel his backstory was rushed and felt incredibly basic.The humour for this film felt forced, and I much preferred Taika's approach in the previous film, Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This was a shame as I really enjoyed Waititi's previous works. A few of the jokes made me cringe, which most definitely wasn't what I expected.The music was fitting, but Guns N Roses seemed to be almost the only music used, therefore it got old quite quickly and had less of an effect as the film went on. I can't really remember the score, so I feel unable to comment on that.Lastly, the pacing was messy, and the tone was confusing. The film was both fast and slow, but It didn't balance it very well, and the film completely lost tension for me because of this. My biggest problem was that I couldn't tell what tone the film was going for, and the tonal shifts were too often and abrupt.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Although not all his films were perfect, the direction that has been decided to take with his character has been an emotional and awesome reinvention of what used to be a character that lacked an interesting personality. This film builds upon the events of the previous films that Thor has appeared in and develops a character study of a man who has lost everything and is now in the midst of an identity crisis. This is brilliantly illustrated through the black comedy approach brought upon by director Taika Waititi who is able to balance the sillier aspects of the story as well as the dramatic undertones that breathes life into this film. The visuals are stunning, injecting the world of the Marvel Universe with color and life that is the equivalent of candy for the eyes. The performances are amazing with Chris Hemsworth owning his role as Thor by injecting an admirable balance of comedy and tragedy. Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster was perfectly handled with her character arc being an emotional beat and justification for the previous films that she appeared in. However, Christian Bale as the antagonist, Gorr the God Butcher, was undeniably one of the film's greatest strengths. His performance was an artistic approach never fully explored in the MCU, delving into an emotional and sinister angle that makes him easily the best villain Marvel has produced. Although some may argue that the film is too silly for its own good, the comedy is brilliantly balanced with drama that will leave the audience in amazement at what it was able to accomplish throughout. The implications of what can happen next in the story of Thor left me in anticipation of what can come next for this hero, and I cannot wait to be there to see it throughout.","12 out of 38 found this helpful.

We are in an ""after infinity wars phase,"" there does have to be some build-up to a real bad guy and there does have to be some filler movies. If it was just action movie after action movie, you all would still hate Marvel and would complain they have lost their sense of humor. To me this movie actually felt whole, at the end the movie felt complete, unlike some other marvel content thats come out recently (i.e. Falcon and the winter soldier, multiverse of madness, and even moonknight). Thor has never been a serious character and we have to remember that, he is supposed to be silly. Similar to Shakespeare's plays Thor is the jester/the clown, he is there to break up all the darkness and distress. The first Thor movie was not serious either and guess what: the bad guy in that was a f'in tin-man! Gore is much better. My only criticism is that I wish they fleshed out his story a little more, showed him kill more gods in person and made it a little more, pun intended, gore-y. Do I think marvel need to lay out its timeline a little better and get to the point of phase four already, yes. Marvel is slacking in their game plan, don't take it out on Thor.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When Gorr ""The God Butcher"" starts killing all of the gods of the universe Thor must put together a team to destroy Gorr along with his magic Necrosword.The movie, Directed by Taika Waititi (Thor Ragnarok) is filled with many jokes and is overall intended to be a fun film. Taika's humor is filled left and right throughout the film, but surprisingly he adds a bit of heart as well. Gorr is a well written character and is played wonderfully by Christopher Nolan who delivers a believable and creepy villain. With all the films so far none has given Thor a good ending. The movie created a perfect surprising ending that just works really well for Thor's character.Unfortunately the film is far from perfect. Some of the jokes tend to fall flat when pushing a little too hard for a laugh. For a film that the whole family should enjoy, there is quite a bit of unneeded content as well. The story line was good but we've seen Thor so many times it can feel kinda bland.Marvel seems to be at a stand still. Ever since it reached its peak with endgame it seems the storytelling has been quickly falling apart. Love and Thunder is definitely one of the better Thor movies but at times it can be just plain meh. Unpredictable. Kinda like thunder itself.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not so much bad as it is just mindless. There's no intention, no direction, the movie feels as lost as it's title character who still has a lot of growth to do after his bro phase in Endgame. The film's plot is so bizarre and shallow that it's immensely talented cast is wasted. The jokes are so inconsistent that I can't believe Taika Watiti, a future comedic legend actually wrote this movie. In my opinion, Christian Bale was spectacularly let down. I was very excited for his character, because I really enjoy his work and in my opinion, he is one of the most talented actors working today. What we got was unbefitting for someone of his range and caliber. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is as bad as Captain Marvel for me, but for the exact opposite reasons. The movie has way, WAY too much personality and ambitions, and it falls short of being memorable or coming remotely close to its ambitions. Instead, the movie comes off as more shallow then a baby pool and fails to justify its existence. Anyway, that's my attempt at a spoiler free review, I hope other MCU fans enjoy this one more than me (although that's looking doubtful).","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

But since the Sequels and the Avengers ive grown tired of the Marvel formula. Granted, action packed, 75% CGI superhero movies with a splash of comedy and silliness is a blast for a while, but it gets old quick.But this one is a Taika Waititi movie with marvel characters. Taika is a strange Director and writer, and this shines through the entire movie. Its sillier and has an almost B-movie Vibe to it. As is Custom with marvel, a lot of CGI is used to create fantastical backdrops and non existent locations. Taika's choice of characters and interactions in many of the less serious scenes can look a lot like people standing and talking in front of a greenscreen. I love how he seems to choose this Odd B-movie Vibe in a Triple A production, but to me it adds a lot to the comical atmosphere.I get why you would be disappointed, if you expected another Marvel movie. As a Taika Waititi fan I had a blast through and through. Hemsworth was more Hilarious as Thor than I had ever seen him before. Christian Bale delivered a Fantastic performance as Gorr. The ""Drama"" was Odd and mostly slathered in this Taika's strange sense of humour. But still managed to deliver some suspense and heart warming moments.As a man that would rate most of the marvel movies released within the past 8 years 5-7,5 if generous, I am happy to rate this one a SOLID 10/10. One of the oddest and funniest Marvel movies I have seen to date.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I guess that's where the money is.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too Much Love, Not Enough Thunder","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8536390/?ref_=tt_urv","JoshuaMercott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur94005246/?ref_=tt_urv","11 September 2022","Marvel did not quite amp up their action and story arcs in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". However, there were only a few dull moments. The movie was fun, funny, and curious, especially with its new character redesigns and plot twists.Taika Waititi did a good job directing this latest film in the ""Thor"" franchise. He also wrote a neat script with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. As a fictional character, Thor was originally created for Marvel comics by Stan Lee and Jason Aaron.Barry Baz Idoine, the cinematographer, was the biggest winner in this film. Both Michael Giacchino and Nami Melumad's musical scoring was great. Nigel Phelps' production design was amazing. Good work also by the art direction and set decoration teams. Mayes C. Rubeo did superb work on costume design. The hair-makeup, VFX, CGI, sound, and stunts crews also brought their A-game.Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, was amazing - his comedic timing was also on point. Jane Foster, aka Mighty Thor, played by Natalie Portman, was a revelation. Gorr, played by Christian Bale, was mindblowing. King Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson, was great. Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi, was memorable. Zeus, played by Russell Crowe, was brilliant - his every scene was masterful.Memorable cameos by Sam Neill (as stage-actor Odin, rather interesting), Matt Damon (as stage-actor Loki, rather funny), Luke Hemsworth (as stage-actor Thor, rather fitting), and Melissa McCarthy (as stage-actress Hela, rather hilarious).All other cast and crew did amazing work in ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" now streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.I loved how Waititi implemented and then balanced several captivating and entertaining angles and elements. As a result, an almost-2-hour movie felt half as short. That said, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" did not live up to the standards set by previous ""Thor"" titles.Making a superhero out of Jane Foster was the best decision for this movie. Portman hit it out of the ballpark. This was in keeping with the comic books, including ""WHAT IF? #10"" (published in 1977), which saw a mortal Jane Foster transform into Thordis, the Goddess of Thunder. Goes to show how progressive that small slice of Marvel comic history was to have made such an empowered character all those years ago.In the movie, Thor's love for the dying Jane was strong enough to ensure that Mjölnir (whose shattered pieces were still on Earth) found her worthy to wield the deific hammer, thus saving her life for the time being and granting her fresh purpose. They covered plenty of key relationship elements between Thor and Jane, and it was fun to watch. But aside from Thor and his love, Mjölnir itself saw something in Jane, and therein was the real gift of all.As a villain, Gorr the God Butcher was an excellent addition to the cast. Christian Bale was stupendous in the role. He's going to be a hit among atheists. In truth, Bale was the best thing in ""Love and Thunder"". His character brought great meaning to the story.The movie contained a few fan-crazy moments, and two more-than-interesting post-credits scenes. I particularly loved the rock-n-roll elements. Somehow, despite having more than a few corny and clichéd elements, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" did not fail to use them all to regale and entertain. It was good fun, though it wasn't as great as some of the ""Thor"" movies that preceded it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

You go to your favorite fast food restaurant. You order the XXL cup of your favorite beverage.They pack it to the gills with ice and you can see all that sweet liquid sugary goodness cascading down all those cubes; looks so refreshing.Then you get distracted by whatever and you come back sometime later....take your first sip and nearly gag because it's not the happiness you expected. Its not that sweet yuuummy yuuummy yuuummy that
you paid for. It's completely watered down. Yep, that's what this movie was.Oh, you swish the cup around and you get a couple of good sips, but man, this watery one just gets on your nerves.This movie should have been sliced up in six episodes and put on Disney+ right after the Ms. Marvel series. The disappointment reminds me of Men in Black International, which coincidentally has the same two
costars/
I like the classic Thor we started off with. Then Ragnarok gave us comedy Thor, which was fine (I guess) because he was still KewL. But, this movie they tried the same formula and it didn't work....even some
of the same slapstick Ragnarok scenes. More so, disappointment about a few things that I expected to occur, but didn't--sad.The trailer made me think this going to be at least a fun movie to watch. The Guns and Roses Sweet Child of mine took me back to the echos of Led Zeppelin Immigrant song in Ragnarok and that got me
pumped up for this movie. Sadly, it did not translate well for me in appliacation. When you go, try to sneak in some crackers because a lot of cheesy jokes are going to be served during the movie.You remember in school when you had all semester to write your term paper and now it's due tomorrow and you haven't even started?So now you gotta throw something together real quick...that's what writing in this story kinda felt like andI feel in some way about Marvel serving me this
Golden Corral dish inside a Ruth's Chris restaurant.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

He represents everything wrong with the film industry.This film is the same old garbage repackaged with some new fun ideas. For starters, yes I laughed quite a bit during many moments. You can definitely enjoy this film purely from a SNL skit perspective. Also some of the ideas Waititi plays around are fun and enjoyable, such as the 80s inspired rock-costumes and the designs of many aliens. The score and soundtrack are really well implemented.However aesthetically this film is one of the worst offenders. Rarely have I seen this much bad CGI in such a big film. The action ranges from ok to atrocious. The shot language is extremely bad and stale, not a single ounce of dynamic and movement. Just basic green screen single shots and reverse shots. Where's the ingenuity of ""Hunt of the Wilderpeople?"", it all looks so fake and textureless. Gave me Robert Rodriguez mid 2000s green-screen movie vibes, but without the charm.Every scene taking place on earth in an interior set is one of the most bafflingly looking things I've ever seen.","105 out of 251 found this helpful.

They are angry because Thor isn't behaving according to their warped idea of what masculinity is. They don't seem to get that Thor's over the top masculinity has always been a joke. Anyone displaying such ""masculinity"" is doing so at least partly because of insecurities, that's the whole thing with Thor. That's what makes him fun and relatable, and it's why the Thor movies are lighthearted and don't take themselves seriously.I think the ideal audience is a little older. I'm 40 and it was perfect for me. We get some 80's music, Thor matures a bit and realizes what's important in life, really great performances from Russel Crowe and Christian Bale - you hardly recognize them, good action and the movie has a nice message. Throughout the whole movie we get a lot of jokes and there is this lightheartedness about everything. A movie to watch if you just want to waste some time and have fun, especially if you don't take life too seriously.I'm giving it a 10 to compensate a little for all the teen reviews, it's actually more of a 8 for me.Don't miss this movie because of the reviews, give it a shot and judge for yourself.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

For me it was all over the place and I was expecting better but Marvel films have gone down hill for me and I prefer DC. Could be due to Disney. It tried very hard to be funny but failed for me. It was stupid funny which I don't find funny. Nothing really stood out that you can talk about afterwards. Bale was excellent. He usually is. Crowe was also great but nothing could save this. Script was dreadful. Everything else was average for me. Eternals was far worse and Black Widow also poor just as poor with cheap production. However, they got good reviews which makes no sense to me. I'm glad, at last, people are starting to realise Marvel is in the decline but it took them too long.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

1 - Am I planning to stay awake through the movie?2 - Do I have hopeful expectations for this franchise?3 - Would I be offended by seeing the character of Thor reduced to a dumb joke?4 - Am I over the age of 7?If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, you may want to rethink your choice of movie.

Nothing was taken seriously aside from Gorr (Bale did an amazing job). Ragnarok is a top 5 maybe even 3 marvel movie for me because it was funny when it had to be and serious when it had to be. That made it a perfect blend. This movie had my hopes very high just to be a big disappointment. Hopefully, Thor can make a huge comeback. Hemsworth did his job, but it was bad directing in my opinion. Too many jokes, short amount of time for stories to develop, not enough seriousness for scenes that should have been serioues, and not enough Gorr.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sure, there were plenty of comedic moments that I really enjoyed. Sure, the movie established stakes. Sure, there were visually stunning action scenes. But I was mostly just bored. I loved Thor: Ragnarok, so being bored here felt even worse.I was bored because I didn't really feel anything during the movie. I felt little-to-no tension, joy, love, fear, triumph or doubt. Partially it was an emptiness in the writing. Part of it was the excessive use of comedy. Part of it was a lack of immersion.Immersion was broken due to inconsistencies in power levels, character portrayals and comedy. I hated how Thor was made to feel so incompetent throughout most of the movie. He's always been heavy-handed and non-chalant, but from the very beginning of this movie he is portrayed as excessively reckless and frequently in need of rescue by the flawless and unreasonably strong female characters. Somehow Thor was never quite strong enough, and somehow Lady Thor and Valkyrie were always just strong enough to accomplish whatever the story needed them to. Comics and comic-book movies have always been loose about character's power levels, but it was very weird how characters like Thor and Zeus are portrayed. They tried so hard to make all the strong men in the movie into jokes (and all the women in the movie into unstoppable, flawless heroes) that the entire movie felt like a joke.There was too much Korg, too many goats, and not nearly enough Christian Bale. After Multiverse of Madness and this, I think I'm done watching Marvel movies in theaters. I'll wait until I can stream for free and check the reviews beforehand.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Gore's purpose is understandable, and Waititi provides a sympathetic foundation for the character before turning him into a malignant menace to the world as the butcher of the gods, which is one of Thor: Love and Thunder's great strengths. And it leaves you with the question, do you hate or sympathize with Gower? Christian, like Hemsworth, is on fine character lines, playing Gore as a well-intentioned (albeit twisted) but increasingly corrupt zealot, and while Bill's emotional scenes are great, watching an actor who As an antagonist, it's even better.Secondary characters in the movie love and thunder
Love and Thunder is full of other familiar faces, most notably the return of Korg (voiced again by Waititi) and Queen Brunnhilde (Thompson). Brunhild (aka Valkyrie) is a fun guest cast member, and her presence makes us think of a solo Valkyrie movie in Thor: Love and Thunder review. Showman Russell Crowe's haughty take on Zeus is an original and outstanding farce, a strong case for Gore's grudge against the gods. Her addition should excite fans who want to see other Olympians in future MCU installments. However, moviegoers hoping for plenty of screen time from the Guardians of the Galaxy should temper their expectations. It can be said that this case alone is one of the weak points of the Thor: Love and Thunder movie review, because during the teasers and the beginning of the movie, it excites us in such a way that the Guardians of the Galaxy are going to play a major role in this. Thor: Love and Thunder review reveals that this film is a collection of the power of the shadow of Gore as well as a fascinating match for Thor and his friends, setting the stage for unique combat interactions that require equally unique solutions. Have (which fans are sure to love). However, some viewers may wish that the villain (and his lead actor) had been given more screen time (especially since it's been confirmed that several gore scenes were cut for the short duration of the film
In our latest review of Thor: Love and Thunder, Waititi delivers a film that is as moving as it is funny, apart from his charming acting. Waititi once again creates a raucous comedy, but unlike Ragnarok, the filmmaker also packs in a truly poignant message about life and love. It's a message that ultimately informs and evolves the main character and his ex-girlfriend-turned-superhero, a storyline that spans the decade and sets up interesting new threads that could be pulled in future MCU films.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I would give the first 15 minutes an 8/10Continued watching and stopped watching after about 40 minutes. Pure rubbish, horrible attempts at jokes, it was basically a campaign to emasculate.Like the subject says, I feel bad for Scandinavians the world over, but fear not, this 'Thor' is but a half hearted mockery in the hands of imbeciles, true fans understand and remember 'THOR' proper.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

"1","/10","For a true fan of the character, this movie results offensive","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8393375/?ref_=tt_urv","clangangrel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36994870/?ref_=tt_urv","2 August 2022","I personally wonder how the cast (who were all perfect and did what they could with what there were handed over) did accept to play these parts. Even more intriguing is how Feige did agree to put the approval stamp on this painful nonsense.Do you know of that friend of yours that trying to be funny all the time turns into being unbearable? Well that is Waititi here. He is trying to put a joke in every single line, turning Thor into a bulky clown. He is also writing himself too much screen-time with a character that shouldn't be more than anecdotic, and creating delusional conflicts (with the weapons) which kill the whole point of what the movie should have been: A story of violent revenge fuelled by grief and the feeling of betrayal.Betrayal... Well, that part, Waititi manage to evoke it, at least in me.The cast is good, as they are all top professionals, but the goofy handling of the story ruins everything. It is truly disappointing that Zeus was ruined in such a way after how long we have been waiting for the Olympians to enter the MCU. Didn't anyone involved ever read a single page of the source material? What were they thinking?Now I am not sure anymore If I want the X-Men or the Fantastic 4 to arrive at all!!What is good on this movie? Bale and Portman mainly. Both have interesting characters with dramatic story arcs to deal with, however, the whole tone of the movie ruins those arcs taking away all the weight of their personal conflicts.Speaking of conflicts, and back to what I mentioned before... The delusional one between Thor and his axe must have been something decided after a very wild (drinking rampage) night out. Otherwise it can not be justified. The same could be said about the final scene with the kids being involved...Summarizing: the wrong director and the wrong tone for a character that should be handled with a lot more seriousness. This movie completely ruins the main character, a great villain (that has no screen-time to face a decent foe before meeting Thor) and nearly everything else that it comes in contact with.Ragnarok, was watchable but not Good, so no reason for Waititi to return. If there is ever a new Thor movie, lets hope that before writing a single line they sit down and watch ""Vikings"" three or four times to start getting a point of how a norse epic setup is meant to be handled. And if that is too dark for you, then at least something in the lines of 300 or Gladiator, but please no more ""Thor: Clown of Thunder"".PS: Dear Mr Feige, please deliver us a Thor movie that is in line with the seriousness and quality of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Thanks.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

As the movie briefly slips into a parallel realm of play and pleasure, you can feel the director Taika Waititi having a good time. It starts with a pasty, near-unrecognizable Christian Bale, who, having been relieved of his DC Dark Knight duties, has signed up with Marvel as a villain with the spoiler name of Gorr the God Butcher. Waititi quickly sketches in Gorr's background, giving it a tragic cast. Believing himself betrayed by the god he once worshiped, Gorr is committed to destroying other deities. It's potentially rich storytelling terrain, particularly given Thor's stature and Marvel's role as a contemporary mythmaker. But while Bale takes the role by the throat, as is his habit, investing the character with frictional intensity, Gorr proves disappointingly dull.Please visit my website link in bio.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

It didn't. I freaking loved it.Added to the awkward banter is Russel Crowe's cringy impression of Greek god Zeus. However, look a little deeper and you'll see that it is masterfully held back from being offensive.That's the thing about T:L&T. There's a lot hidden under the awkwardness. From a director who refuses to treat superheroes with reverence comes an irreverent study of love.What happens when love is betrayed, lost, denied, or is not what we expect? Can you love a memory? An object? What about an object with a sense of humour and great timing?Well, it seems, what happens is that love changes. It adapts. Not always in healthy ways, but it can change from those too.In terms of performances, Christian Bale turns a minor role up to eleven. That's not to say the rest of the cast are slouches. They really do share the confusion, doubt, and relief of their characters.If you didn't like the movie the first time, I urge you to rewatch it with 'love' in mind.Could the people who made Guns 'n' Roses cool again since 'Terminator 2' really make a dud?","8 out of 25 found this helpful.

I am really surprised to see the comments. Look at the action scenes, it was wonderful, where did we have such action scenes in the fantasy genre. Those who have watched long and boring series of this genre know what I am talking about. The film is miles ahead of all the films and the best adventure animations. See, it is not artificial at all. Even very big movies and series do not reach my feet. The movement of the camera was calculated. We have the peak of entertainment in a movie and we are also experiencing a work of art. All the characters in the movie are great. We don't have such a movie at all. It was better than beauty and the breast either. I enjoyed it a lot and got a feeling. It was a very well-made and strong movie. I never thought that a fictional film could be so strong and at the same time heavy. Or they can make it. I saw a movie once and the wonderful acting of the actors stayed in my mind. I usually do not like very serious and imaginative movies, so I enjoyed this movie. The acting of the actors is very serious and real, all the acts are correct. At the same time, jokes are included. The actress who plays the role of Thor, Natalie Portman, our actresses should learn acting from her. Christian Bale very serious and extremely good game. Enchanting script. Even mat damon plays well. The same sequence played by Natalie Portman is worthy of all the Marvel superhero movies. This movie has a special feature, which is that it has nothing to do with taste. It means that it was not made by measuring people's tastes and purposefully. So we see that even the most famous filmmakers of the last few decades use this feature. It couldn't be better than this. It makes me laugh to compare it with Ragnarok. It is the same as shown in the film itself.","8 out of 25 found this helpful.

And I am so happy to report that he has done it again with ""Thor: Love and Thunder""! I still love his comedic take on Thor so much, it still works so well for me, and I was thrilled to see that he finally was able to make the Jane Foster character, as well as her relationship to Thor, work so well and come off as so likable! I finally cared about the relationship between Thor and Jane as well (for the first time in the MCU); I was so happy to see that the elements that didn't work for me in the past were able to become something so much more in this film, and I fully attribute that to Taika's skills at writing great characters and great relationships! He is especially skilled at blending his signature style of silly comedy with some heartfelt emotion, and that is on full display here! There are moments where the film had me laughing so hard, and then in the next scene feeling like I was on the verge of tears... and it didn't feel forced at all!This movie just made me feel good! Throughout the whole film I was smiling, and by the end even despite the few flaws it has, I left the theatre feeling happy and much better than I did when I went in. It has such lighthearted fun, while also dealing with dark subject material, but the playful way Waititi tells his stories with so much heart and humour just makes you feel so good while watching... it truly is such a blast! I love this film to death, it feels like an 80s action sci-fi space opera crossed with a rom-com, with a little bit of rock ballad mixed in! And it felt like such a perfect tone for Thor! The movie is a beautifully told love story about finding meaning and living in the moment with a lot of emotion and catharsis focusing on themes of change, spirituality and religion, and as I mentioned, finding meaning in one's self. I thought Taika wrote a wonderful story, brimming with so much great humour (if you liked the comedy style in Ragnarok.... you'll love this!) and lots of awesome action and emotion. I just can't get over how well it all worked together, I fell head over heels for it!Like I continue to say, I love how Waititi blends comedy and emotion. Despite how silly the movie can be (and I love that), it never sacrifices the story for a joke. In fact, the jokes and silliness seem to have an underlying thematic exploration beneath them; we start to see Thor as someone who uses humour to hide behind his problems and insecurities. The film really did a good job at articulating Thor's inner pain through the humour, it was brilliant. We see characters express themselves in deeper ways through comedy than they could normally. Plus, I just really like Waititi's comedic style and tone, and find it's unlike anything else we are used to seeing in comedy currently. It works so well for me... every joke and gag here had me laughing out loud. And the emotion of the film is so poignant too, from the incredible opening scene with Gorr, to small dialogue scenes between Thor and Jane (I loved those moments, they were quite well written). It hits so well and with so much impact, and doesn't feel forced or tonally off in any way... Taika just has a gift for blending these tones!It shouldn't be a stretch to say that I felt this film was written so cleverly and with so much heart! I thought it told a great story with some impactful meaning and some awesome comedy. It could be cheesy at times, but I loved that, it felt like it matched that 80s rock ballad style perfectly! There were also so many storytelling decisions that I found to be quite bold for Marvel. Heck, the film opens with a scene discussing religion, faith, and the notion of gods in such an intelligent way, questioning whether gods are worth worshiping, while also establishing our fantastic villain, Gorr the God Butcher. I truly found him to be quite sympathetic, thanks to some great writing, especially in that first scene, as well as Christian Bale's incredible performance. It's not an understatement to say he delivered one of the best performances we have seen in the MCU, and he has become one of my favourite villains among Thanos, Killmonger, Loki and Wanda! Bale commands the screen, he was menacing and terrifying, and yet still had moments where he was really funny, on top of showing an emotional/sympathetic side! He had this Pennywise-like sort of cheesy, creepy vibe to him which I loved; I just couldn't get enough of Gorr and Bale's performance. He also looked phenomenal too! But I think that leads to my biggest complaint for the film... we only get a few Gorr scenes, and while Bale kills it every time, I could've used a little more! And that brings me to my next slight issue... structurally the movie does feel a little messy at times, and scenes feel very rushed at the beginning. You can tell it was really cut down, so much like with Gorr, I would've loved to see a few more scenes added in, the movie felt like it needed an extra 15 minutes at least. It still works quite well as a final product, but I found myself longing for more and feeling like we were missing scenes here or there at many times throughout the film. An extended cut honestly wouldn't hurt the film, and because I loved literally every scene we got in the movie, I'd be so happy to see even more!The soundtrack in this movie was phenomenal. I loved Giacchino's score, and the heavy metal version of the Marvel fanfare was also really cool! But my absolute favourite element of it was the Guns 'n Roses focus! Waititi made great use of classic songs such as ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Paradise City"". I thought it was really cool to have to focus on one band, as it made the movie sound more cohesive rather than jumping around to different sounding music. It did however use a few other songs, and I love the use of Enya's ""Only Time"" and ABBA's ""Our Last Summer"" over some really fun montages, the latter of which is what really made me care about Thor and Jane's relationship. I love how we got to look back at a time when they were in love, and see all the mundane activities they got up to instead of just the superhero conflict stuff we saw in the last movies. The stripped down approach helped to make me finally understand why the relationship was so important to Thor, and seeing him reconnect with and come to terms with his current relationship status with Jane was quite perfect. I also loved how they compared this relationship to Thor's relationships with his ex-hammer, Mjolnir, and his current axe, Stormbreaker, and the way they personified the weapons was so funny to me! Chris Hemsworth really sold those scenes so well too! In fact, he sold everything Thor did in this movie perfectly, from the great action to the hilarious comedic moments. I really felt Thor's pain as he was looking for purpose in the universe. And did he ever look the part here... his muscles are HUGE. He is just perfect in this role and I love how he has evolved the character over the years! His chemistry with Natalie Portman here was phenomenal too, again, this is the best they've ever been together. I loved Jane's story, and while it was so cool to see her wield Mjolnir and take up the Mighty Thor mantle, it was the underlying emotional elements that worked best for me!Now, putting aside everything else, I truly enjoyed this film purely for how it made me feel. Because it made me feel good! I went in expecting a good time, and not only did I get that, but it actually improved how I was feeling as I watched the movie; I left feeling better than I did before I saw it! It just made me happy, it made me smile and laugh so much, and even the emotion found a way to touch me in really profound ways. So yes, I may be more forgiving of this movie than some, but for me it just worked so well and really made me feel good! So if you want a fun time at the movies that makes you feel good, I'd highly recommend ""Thor: Love and Thunder"". I love it to death, and honestly I have no specific reason why, I just felt so good after watching it and find it so unashamedly loveable! It may not be for everyone as it does use a niche style of comedy, but it sure worked so well for me! I just loved how happy it made me. It's unlike anything else in the MCU and really treads some new ground, so thank you, Taika Waititi, for this movie that brought a little extra light into my life! And genuinely, can we get Thor 5 like right now? I need to see it so badly! Loved every second of this and laughed so.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

The premise is two-fold, with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) waging a war with the Gods to save a bunch of kids from the hands of a butcher named Gorr (Christian Bale). At the same time, he is also navigating his rocky love story with Dr. Jane Foster aka The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman). Along the way, Thor encounters some old friends, makes some new ones and goes from flexing his big guns to doing a full Monty in a matter of minutes.Director Taika Waititi's personal take on pop culture, music, fashion and humour is pretty evident throughout the 120-odd minutes. Mind you, the film has some genuinely funny moments, but most of them don't actually involve Thor. You will see a lot of familiar faces from Thor's universe and multiple references to previous films and some cross-over moments. In fact, one of the best scenes in the film is a long show-reel that introduces Thor to the audience.What the film excels at is giving the audience a bang for their buck. The VFX, the sets and action scenes are top-notch. In fact, the fight scenes that involve The Might Thor and Gorr are some of the best choreographed moments in recent MCU history. Russel Crowe's Zeus act is hilarious and looking at him you can't help but wonder if this was the guy who once played a Gladiator.Christian Bale is rock solid as Gorr and menacing in most parts. Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have great chemistry and their comic timing is on point as well. The soundtrack, especially the late 80's rock tracks, adds flavour to the big scenes.If you don't compare it to Thor: Ragnarok, then Thor: Love and Thunder is enjoyable. There are classic goofy Thor moments and then the larger-than-life action scenes. Here's hoping the next Thor movie feels more organic and wholesome than just a pit-stop to making a quick buck for the bosses at Marvel.","11 out of 38 found this helpful.

To me, it ruins the experience. Cut out the unfunny love story bits and you have maybe 30 minutes worth watching.

While Robert Pattinson's smash hit ""Batman (2022)"" showcased a grittier, more ground-level caped crusader, ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)"" ventured into the multiverse, opening up psychological thriller and horror elements for the MCU. Taika's unique blend of colorful storytelling and quirky comedy had single-handedly revived the Thor franchise which was down in the doldrums after the disastrous ""Thor: The Dark World (2013), infusing fresh new life and zest into the character with his quite fabulous ""Thor: Ragnarok (2017)"".While continuing in the same vein, leveraging his star man Chris Hemsworth's natural gift for sarcasm and comedy, Taika adds new elements to the arc in this edition, calling in not one, not two but three Oscar-winning performers in Natalie Portman, Christian Bale and Russel Crowe. The story follows Thor after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame (2019)"" with the God of Thunder seemingly reduced to a shadow of his former self, tired of his superhero adventures and suffering from a lack of purpose and meaning. He is, however, forced to take a break from this existential angst after Christian Bale's ""Gorr the God Butcher"" unleashes fresh hell on the universe, seemingly on a rampage to hunt down every God he can get his hands on.Armed with a mystical superweapon known as the Necrosword and the intensity and screen presence only an actor of Bale's caliber can bring in, ""Gorr"" is a fresh new interpretation of antagonists in the MCU and a fine adaptation of the classic character from the iconic ""Thor: God of Thunder (2013)"" comic. Waititi's storytelling brilliance doesn't stop there, as he warps in another fan-favorite comic book arc, that of ""The Mighty Thor (2016)"" where Thor's lady love Jane Foster becomes a female version of the God of Thunder and blends it neatly with the Gorr mythology.The writing, by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and the director himself, is continuously engaging and is peppered with unexpected surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat. While the core story arc is painstakingly told, Taika pays close attention to expanding the universe as well, throwing up some juicy easter eggs that will be cannon fodder to the fans for months on end as well as teasing some universe-shattering extensions to the MCU in the mid and post-credits scene. That an upcoming story arc might feature one of my favorite comic actors in recent times was an absolute joy!Despite this apparent plethora of characters he has to work with, Waititi manages to keep his script tight and engaging and most importantly, short with a barely 2-hour-long runtime. With scenes involving Jeff Goldblum's ""Grandmaster"" and Peter Dinklage's ""Eitri"" cut at the editing table to accommodate this, there will be a significant section of the fandom that will wait with bated breath for the full directors cut version of this fine film. ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" may not rise to the groundbreaking levels of Ragnarok, but backed by solid performances, delivers wholesome entertainment and a visually grandiose theatre experience. Recommended!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Jane had potential as a superhero only to be sidelined. Christian Bales acting and character was amazing and didn't fit in this movie. Wish I didn't watch it. Hopefully this isn't the tone that Disney is setting moving forward with the MCU. Disappointing.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Thor evolves in this film to a father figure, and it's beautiful and funny and heartfelt.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Also, the reason I don't score this lower, is the fantastic performance by Christian Bale (nothing surprising here) and makes me sad that they wasted such a great villain in a movie like this, a great achievement not from the acting department made possible by Bale and Portman but also for the villain's background story, one of the richest I can recall from the MCU.Wasted potential, Marvel and Disney are sitting on their pile of money making this Phase 4 which has been overall very underwhelming, I know this won't happen, but they should either give audiences a break from Marvel or just reinvent the Universe and explore other characters and directions.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Christian Bale, who I thought was his usual excellent self, could not save a film that had way too many jokes, cheesy, cringy special effects and the huge overuse (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) of GNR songs. It appears that someone also thought it would be really funny to have massive goats who make constant screaming noises, and these noises became very annoying, very quickly. Russell Crowe as Zeus was quite forgettable, and Korg is in danger of becoming the Jar-Jar Binks of Marvel. I have been a borderline MCU fanboy since the original 'Iron Man' film right up to 'Shang-Chi' but unfortunately it feels as time goes on, everything the MCU is churning out is becoming weaker and weaker.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

While it had more Thor than Strange was part of his 2nd movie - this was not coherent, in fact rather it was whimsical, directionless, and complete waste. I can only give credit to Bale's performance as he seemed to be the only one who was trying. Everyone else was a hollow representation, a shell of the character. Too bad Bale was coming from another film to put the 100% to this - although it wouldn't have saved this trash.Every attempt to be funny was a miss to me. Everything that was meant to have meaning was meaningless. Everything that was supposed to have a reason, either didn't or was explained in the dumbest way possible. This is just another installment of Propaganda Marvel films, and the complete ideocracy that has become Hollywood today. They do not care, everything is a tool to spread the messages that want. Nothing is sacred, nothing is nuanced, or complex. When it should be complex, it's pathetically simple. Like if you wanted to break into CIA HQ in Langly, it's not a problem because what you need will fall in your lap, and all the guards are completely inept. Oh and like an Epstein - the cameras will magically ""not work"". They think you are this dumb that you should be eating this puke pile up and be saying, ""thank you, may I have another?""
The film has so much to go over but not without spoilers so I simply say miss this one. Miss it entirely. Don't bother with it even in streaming, as it was a complete and utter waste of time. I'd rather have watched grass grow, at least I could contemplate the meaning of life and have got more out of it.","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

It was also nice to see Korg,Valkerie, And The Guardians Return since we have not seen Them Since Endgame. Gor The God Butcher in the Mcu I didn't think would be portrayed well Here. But he was portrayed amazing. Christian Bale delivered an Amazing Performance as Him. And for the first time in a very long time this is the First Marvel Movie where you don't need any context or Knowledge of The Greater MCU to Enjoy which I respect and it feels like it's on Movie.

Her workouts consisted of boxing, skipping around, core work, and weightlifting. And because she was working out so rigorously, Portman, who is a vegan, had to switch up her diet so she could ensure enough protein intake to gain muscle as opposed to losing weight. She trained for 10 months !! And it shows .Thor: Love and Thunder is a very fun film.

The humour is, as usual, targeting 12-year-olds and nerdy 20-30-year-old females.Tessa Thompson is trying so hard to be tough and cool in her roles that she turns out not to be. A bit similar to the problem that Angelina Jolie and Rihanna have had in other movies. Would be better If she instead tried to learn from her colleague in Westworld, Thandiwe Newton, who effortlessly makes her character an interesting badass because she doesn't try so hard to be - she just turns out that way.Thor is at some point shown stripped of his clothes from the rear, which the female characters are spared of in the same scene. Fair enough, but it's funny how Disney at the same time recently censored Daryl Hannah's bare rear-end in Splash. Don't the woke and the feminists realise their almost comical double standards of objectifying men while women are too holy for the same? Oh the irony.Other than that - interesting to add Zeus to the story although underwhelming. Bale is a good actor but isn't a memorable villain in this movie - not his fault though. Marvel-movies struggle to create great villains for some reason, apart from Loki.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

He really has no understanding or love for the Marvel Universe, to churn out this drivel of a movie.The way Zeus is treated as a character (supposed to be an equal to Odin in the comcs) or how the Pantheon of elder gods is shown is really cringeworthy and shameful.Only saving grace is Gorr, played in ernest by Bale and he required more character building, back story and screen time.By far, his is by far one of the WORST ever marvel movies.

The jokes never ruined the seriousness for me, no one did a dance while someone died, it was handled well and the emotional moments didn't conflict too much with the goofy moments.Overall I enjoyed it, like Thor Ragnarok before it, it is one of the better Marvel movies made.

"8","/10","A Very Fun Experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8315823/?ref_=tt_urv","kjproulx","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2022","Being a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I must say that the first two instalments of the Thor franchise haven't been anywhere near my favourites. When Taiki Waititi was brought in to direct Thor: Ragnarok, he injected some much-needed life. Since then, Thor has been a much more enjoyable character to follow and I now look forward to seeing him every time. Hearing that Waititi would once again be back for the fourth film excited me a great deal, but I also knew it would be a very hard task to top the third film. Thor: Ragnarok is one of my favourite Marvel films, and while there are more than a few moments in Thor: Love and Thunder that harken back to what made Ragnarok great, it's not quite on the same level for me. Still, Thor: Love and Thunder is a genuine blast at the movies and here's why I recommend checking it out.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame, while still being a sequel to the Thor films, the premise here is that Gorr (Christian Bale) who now wields a sword known as the ""Necrosword"", has a mission to murder every God in existence. After having killed many already, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is next in line. With the addition of a very well-done story that brings back Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), this film has a lot going for it. The villain storyline and Jane's storyline are both serious elements of the film, but otherwise, this is just a straight-up comedy, through and through. I liked the tonal shifts throughout the film because Taiki Waititi knows how to tread that line, even though a few moments tread a little too closely.If you were a fan of the silliness in Thor: Ragnarok, you'd probably love watching this film, but I will say that Thor: Love and Thunder dials it up to a hundred here. From giant screaming goats to a love triangle between his axe (Stormbreaker) and his ""ex-hammer"" (Mjolnir), I was laughing throughout. This will absolutely be a deterrent for some viewers though. Marvel is known to have a lot of comedy sprinkled throughout their films, but this one probably takes the cake for the amount of humour. The humour landed for me about 90% of the time though, so I had an absolute blast.Christian Bale is a fantastic addition here and is completely committed to this role, even though I wish he had a little more screen time. Where his storyline goes by the end may also leave viewers dissatisfied, but I kind of love how it concluded and I can't wait to see where those last few story beats lead. On top of that, I will say that Natalie Portman brings her A-Game here. I wasn't a huge fan of her in the first two Thor films, but her reason for being in this film was easily the best aspect of the movie for me. Again, like Gorr, I just wish a little more time was dedicated to her storyline. This is a film that clocks in at under two hours, but I believe an added 20 minutes or so could've fleshed everything out just a little more.In the end, this is the most fun I've had with a Marvel film in a while. Taiki Waititi's kinetic energy is on full display here, more than I've ever seen before (What We Do in the Shadows included) and Chris Hemsworth commands the screen with his portrayal of Thor, as always. The jokes fly a mile a minute, but I enjoyed that about this film, even though I was worried it would ruin my enjoyment. I do feel that it suffers a little from having multiple storylines and not quite enough time to explore them all, but I was ultimately satisfied with how everything played out. For being such a big story, I will also say that the scale of this one felt a little smaller than the rest of the Thor films. It almost felt episodic at times. Overall, Thor: Love and Thunder is absolutely a must-see if you enjoyed the silliness of Thor: Ragnarok, but some may be turned off. I personally give it a big recommendation because I had a lot of fun.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film felt like a parody movie with how horrible the dialogue and cinematography was. I am all for comedy in Marvel movies but the ""jokes"" kept on coming after every single line.

The screeching, unfunny, and highly irritating pair of goats.Every scene they are in, they make this awful strident shrieking noise which I think would be useful torturing POWs.Think of this and apply it to the whole movie in terms of humor and that's how you'll feel. Annoyed, rolling your eyes, and annoyed again.About 10 minutes into the movie, I was wondering if the poor attempts at 2nd-grade level humor were going to be persistent throughout the movie. Indeed, they were.This movie is the equivalent of a hyperactive, irriating babysitter reading you a bedtime story replete with ridiculous facial expressions in the loudest, most unlikeable voice possible. You might like it if you are 6 years old, but for adults who want to be entertained, it's simply uncomfortable.The movie is rife with unfunny, forced, ham-fisted jokes which feel completely out of place or were written by mediocre minds who wanted the movie to feel like Airplane or the Naked Gun but failed abysmally. I wanted to stop watching halfway through and see if anyone else on IMDB found the constant barrage of eye-rolling corniness as annoying as I did.Almost every review I've seen so far points out this exact thing. The movie tries too hard to be witty and cute, but comes off as contrived and forced - so much so that I didn't care for the plot.The only redeeming feature of the movie was the main villain played by Christian Bale. He nailed down the role, I enjoyed his expressions and motivations. Other than that, the constant ""fist bump"" humor was tiresome 10 minutes in (can we please get rid of that annoying rock sidekick?) and we got nearly 120 minutes of it.Not against humor, I'm against it being used out of place or out of balance with the rest of the movie. This movie could have been good if there were more counterbalance - weigh the humorous moments with more ponderous ones.This is something director Waikiki has yet to grasp. I almost feel like he's whacking me in the head constantly with Stormbreaker with all the unfunny jokes.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I giggled maybe three times. It's just not that good. Entertaining? Yeah-as long as you are not prone to nod off. I nodded off twice.In this installment, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) enlists the help of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) to fight the bad guy of the week, Gorr. Why? Because Gorr, God Butcher, intends to make the gods extinct. And, apparently, only Thor really cares and he comes out of retirement. Frankly, it's time to retire the Thor franchise.Chris Hemsworth reprises as Thor who continues the whole I am dumb but strong vibe. Natalie Portman's portrayal was lackluster although the stylist gets points for those beautiful curls. Honestly, I did not know who played the bad guy until I saw the credits. The character had hints of Christian Bale and then I realized it was him. Wasted performance for sure.Other than that surprise, there's really nothing of interest here. It's enjoyable; but, so empty. My only joy was trying out the D-Box seating. It was slightly gimmicky at first; but, I soon started enjoying it in flight scenes. That was a nice change. There really wasn't anything nice about Thor: Love and Thunder.I rate this movie a solid C.TW: Language, Violence, Partial Nudity#MariosMovieReviews.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Everything from What We Do in the Shadows to Thor: Ragnarok. But let me warn you, this film is quite awful. I don't mean to be harsh. But it is quite quite bad. The story line is incredibly weak. The pacing of the film is horrendous. The one-liner jokes hardly ever land. There is little to no character development, the movie provides nothing to add to the MCU. I will say, however, Christian Bale's performance was amazing. He really went above and beyond to achieve such a gracious role for a horrible villain. But that being said, his role was wasted in a joke of a film. Natalie Portman didn't deliver. Chris Hemsworth was, well, just Thor. And everything else just didn't add up. It kind of reminded me of a Robert Rodriguez Kid Flick. Next.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

If you enjoyed the comedy of Ragnarock, my review may not be relevant to you.Love and Thunder amplifies the comedy 100-fold. It is non-stop, utterly cringey and completely stupid. I can hardly remember the plot because it felt like that was the last consideration and it was more like a way to string comedy set pieces together. It was like Saturday Night Live as a superhero film.Natalie Portman and Christian Bale were pretty decent in their roles, for what it's worth. Chris Hemsworth was horrendous but it felt like that was due to the director's vision of Thor being an obnoxious idiot.If you like listening to goats scream every 5 minutes, this has at least one thing for you, otherwise I'd avoid it.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I always expect these marvel movies to get better and better to the point that they put the movie before it to shame. Still, this sequel to the Thor branch of the Marvel cinematic universe franchise did not exceed expectations. It had action, adventure, and humor, which I was expecting from Taika Waititi, who also directed Ragnarok, and that was great. Still, in Love and Thunder, the humor outshined the action-adventure. Not necessarily entirely a bad thing because the humor was so on point. Never did I feel a joke was dropped that did not deliver the laughs it expected, but I do feel these laughs came at the price of the action-adventure, which was lacking. The visuals in the movie were epic. Waititi knows how to film a sci-fi Fantasy, especially one that pays homage to the 1980s (although the constant use of Gun and Roses songs was not as spectacular as using Immrgant song by Led Zepplin twice in Ragnarok). As the movie progressed, the visuals got better and better to the point where a complete introduction of a marvel comics character making his first full appearance in the cinematic universe was breathtaking. Waititi was working that camera. The performances from the whole cast were good. I could go on about how great Chris Hemsworth is as Thor and his fantastic chemistry with Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie but what impressed me was Natalie Portman's return as Jane Foster (AKA Thor). I was not expecting much from the actress who seemed bitterly glad to end her ties with the franchise, but from the moment she appeared on the screen, she was dynamite in my book. I love every minute of her. Also, Russel Crowe's run as Zeus was enjoyable. It solidified everything this movie was about, and you can tell he enjoyed his role. Well done! Overall, Thor: love & Thunder was laid out like a comic book. As easily as I sat in the theatre watching, was easy as if I had sat in my living room reading it. I don't think any of these movies ever did a comic book story arch as great as Love and Thunder did, and that's what it got going for it! Worth taking a look at!--","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

The rest of the cast was amazing and the story line itself was great but the immature humor and childishness pulled everyone down and ruined what could have been a great movie. Christian Bale was brilliant as was Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. Tessa Thompson was a standout for me, she has brilliant screen presence.

Most of the time it's a painfully unfunny screwball comedy where Thor's role as the village idiot is amped up to eleven, while a running joke involving screaming goats and Lady Thor's search for a suitable catchphrase make up the rest of the movie's many, many moments of levity. This is juxtaposed with serious moments involving terminal illness of a character the producers thought needed some sort of undercooked closure. The budget, which could eradicate hunger in a small eastern European country, is mostly wasted on achingly blinding CGI that gives the film the sheen of a Saturday morning cartoon. Most of the supporting cast is utterly wasted, including Russel Crowe's buffoonery as Zeus and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, who the writers couldn't find anything noteworthy to do but is in the move anyway. Christian Bale turns in a stellar performance as the movie's villain, and his backstory would've made for a more interesting movie than the one he's in. Taika Waititi is clearly having a blast but others should steer clear of this over-indulgent mess.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

His performance was ""all in"" and he didn't phone it in like a lot of actors do in the big pay day comic book films.

You know when you watch a B movie and an actor is over acting so bad that you feel embarrassed for them? This is what it felt like watching this film. It brings quite a bit of shame to Thor and the Marvel universe. The jokes are forced and often childish, the CGI is poor and the emotional parts are empty and ineffective. I mean, God of dumplings? This was obviously made as a comedy and not a serious film, but they failed hard at that too. I feel bad for everyone whobare real fans and had to watch this. I don't know if it's because disney unfortunately owns the rights to Marvel but if it is, they should be ashamed. They've taken a Marvel movie and turned it into Space Jam. Stan must be rolling in his grave.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

...as many other reviews have said there were just too many jokes. There were too many moments that weren't written seriously - when it would have worked much better if they were. ...unlike many of the user reviews tho - the movie was still quite good despite all that! ...it really makes you wonder why (Writer/Director) Taika Waititi always goes a bit further than what actually works?! ...like for instance - the MCU Thor doesn't get Earth references and such and he can be a hot-head but Waititi makes him a flat-out idiot (which he isn't in the comics) and isn't like that in the first Thor movie and the first Avengers movie. I guess - maybe - they figure the comic Thor would be too bland/boring (and maybe that's true) but does he have to be a complete idiot?!Anyway, the story was actually good... Christian Bale (as the main villain, ""Gorr"") was excellent - both his acting performance and his written role, same with Natalie Portman (as Jane Foster), Tessa Thompson (as Valkyrie) and brief appearance by the main cast of Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike some posts on here I VERY much liked Russell Crowe's interpretation of Zeus. It was a surprising and I thought very interesting - almost - Wizard of Oz/Man Behind the Curtain portrayal of Zeus.The special effects were very good (altho not great)... the music was very good altho a bit too much Guns N' Roses songs (i think 4 songs!)
Without spoiling there was a great use of Thor's unspoken of abilities (that he does with the children of New Asgard) that was pretty awesome!! ...as well as what he does (unknowingly) with Mjolnir.The ending was actually quite moving (seriously made me misty) and the 2 post-credit scenes were pretty awesome as well.This movie was a 3 out of 5... a 7.5 out of 10... and a 75 out of 100.If they cut out some of the jokes and make it a little more serious it could have been been MUCH better. ...still a good/fun movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Everything was there for it to be great. I think it could even be easily edited into greatness with a directors cut. Too much humor, unfunny cheesy humor. Hamfisted woke messaging shoved down the viewers throat. Korg has two dads, Heimdall's daughter is a boy now... Changed his name from Astrid which is a traditional female name that means divinely beautiful to Axl. If that wasn't intentional, that's certainly what it came across as. Also Valkyrie made several loud hints to her attraction to the ladies. None of this would matter or be a problem if it felt organic and not like the producers forced it all into the movie at gunpoint. Dint get me started on poor Christian Bale. He gave this movie his all and they sharted in his face. I'm about done with the MCU. On a scale from 1 to 10. NO WAY HOME being a 10, this would be a 4 at best. I'd give it a 2 if not for Christian Bale. He gets a 10. I doubt he will ever work with Disney again after this.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Using Zeus for the issue of inclusion and progressivism was funny, not forced at all; and the thing about Korg makes sense because he's just rocks. The Jane Fonda arc... I mean, Jodie Foster... I mean, Jane Foster and what she did at the end was fine, and the scene with Thor was very emotional and deep.

I came back later to try and finish and gave up a second time out of boredom, and DNF gets an automatic 1 star.The film itself deserved maybe 2 or 3 from what I saw.Thor is finding himself for the third time in 3 movies. He's millennia old and has to 'find himself' 3 times in 8 years. What a loser.Then boredom happens, the screaming goats are funny for 2 minutes but it drags on for ages and is so repetitive the gag gets really old really fast.It has no time to breathe, the themes are love and loss and death and terminal cancer and inevitable loss, but there is a cheap gag every 30 seconds so we're not supposed to care at all about any of that.This is a film which seems to be aimed at, and written by, a 7 year old with ADHD.","62 out of 147 found this helpful.

Not to mention their impeccable comedic timing. 🤣This and Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness are slowly introducing the concept of multiple universes/realms and the sheer craziness that unfolds out those setups.

The costumes are dumb. I'm still trying to figure out what the story was about. Why would a bad guy who wants to kill gods go and kidnap children? Exactly. He wouldn't. They replace Thor with Jane Foster, who makes a mockery of the hammer and the ""Power of Thor"". It's sad.The writers at Marvel/Disney have gone 100% Woke. Seriously. It's so bad I just can't even take it anymore. From this point forward, if I watch a trailer and read reviews that say a Marvel movie is this bad, I am skipping it.Putting the tickets and food together, I spent $102 taking my wife and 2 kids to see this. ALL FOUR of us thought it sucked. - and it takes a LOT to make my kids say a movie sucked.

Despite its star-studded cast and promising premise, this film fails to deliver a captivating storyline, leaving audiences wanting more.One of the most glaring issues with Thor: Love and Thunder is the apparent lack of depth in the writing. The plot feels rushed, as if the writers hastily threw ideas together without much consideration. This rush to create a cohesive narrative results in a disappointingly shallow experience that fails to engage viewers on a meaningful level.The movie is plagued with numerous plot holes, leaving the audience scratching their heads and questioning the logic behind certain character motivations and actions. These inconsistencies disrupt the immersion and make it difficult to fully invest in the story. Additionally, the film seems to rely heavily on unnecessary downgrades compared to other Marvel movies, failing to live up to the standard set by its predecessors.While Thor: Love and Thunder attempts to charm viewers, it often falls flat, coming across as forced and ultimately lacking in genuine wit and humor. The attempts at comedy feel contrived, missing the mark and contributing to the overall feeling of disappointment.It is unfortunate that the film fails to live up to the quality expected from the Marvel franchise.In conclusion, Thor: Love and Thunder fails to deliver on its promising premise. With a rushed plot, numerous plot holes, and a forced attempt at charm, the movie falls short of its potential. While some may find elements to enjoy, it ultimately falls below the mediocre mark.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Their gods and cultural beliefs have always intrigued me. Thor is one of my favorite Norse gods so these movies about Thor have always resonated with me. Everything about the trilogy and now this one. I was always at the edge of my seat in this movie. I like Taika Waititi's vision of Thor. He's interpretation of the character is a breath of fresh air in the MCU. This makes the god of thunder very relatable. Truly an enjoyable film, in some ways it felt different from most MCU films, and while it didn't turn out to be as groundbreaking to critics as it's predecessor, it proves to be the perfect superhero movie for the summer. Many others before me say that it didn't have enough story, but let me tell you what it lacks in a ""stellar"" story it more than makes up for in action, humor, outstanding visuals, pop culture references, cameos, and overall creativity. While I was a little surprised not seeing Gorr do as much god butchering on screen, Christian Bale makes up for the character's limited screen time through a powerful and albeit creepy performance, one scene in particular reminiscent of Pennywise from It, and his powers are unbelievably awesome. My only real complaints is are there is too much focus on the love story between Thor and Jane Foster, the first part of the film feels somewhat rushed (though I did enjoy the action packed '80s style fight), and of course without Loki, it just didn't feel the same. Best of all, the mid and post credits scenes make me optimistic for the future of both Thor's story and the MCU overall. My complaints are few and my thumbs are all the way up to the heavens to join the gods themselves 😇. Highly recommend this film, and please, don't worry about what others think, go see it and make you're own opinion ;). Also, Russell Crowe as Zeus was both powerful and hysterical, respect for holding the Greek accent 👍I loved every second of the movie and I hope the MCU will rivit us with more amazing works.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Korg is sometimes too much and needs to be toned down.Chris Hemsworth still knows how to play thor but i missed the broship between him and loki (Tom Hiddleston), it felt empty without him.Nathalie Portman also did a great job playing thor, maybe she had the greatest character development in the movie.Tessa Thompson as king valkyrie was great but felt like a rushed story, she could be more in the movie. Less korg and more valkyrie...","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I like the other Thor movies, but since this is a PG-13, you would assume that the dialogue and interactions would appeal to a broad audience instead of just kindergarten kids! The humor in this is just so lame. Sure it had a few laughs in-between, but that's about it. Also, the movie is 2 hours.. it could've told the story in 1 hour, and it wouldn't have been so unbearable and boring to watch. My wife and I always stick around for the scenes in the end credits, but in this case I told her: If we had seen this in the cinema, I would've waited for you in the car when the credits started.

The only thing that makes GOTG interesting is that it gives a background story about Thanos, but I think it's too much Disney like, the talking animals, songs and poor jokes. I used to like Thor so much because the story is darker and mysterious. Now this attempt to make Thor a funny character is the opposite of what makes him a interesting character, I usually like the Marvel movies, they often have a great plot and the best thing is the special effects but they definitely can improve on Thor.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also a ridiculous a-list cameo is painfully hard to watch.For me, the makers have tried to dial everything up to 11 from Thor Ragnarok and it doesn't work.

The best Marvel movie this year was Wakanda Forever and this does not beat it by a long shot. It was trying to appeal to old Thor fans but it failed horribly, I mean I wanted to close the screen and watch a burning log of fire instead.

The more I think about this film the more I hate it. I can't believe they butchered my favorite character and really made an awful movie. I wish I never saw this film. It's not funny, the plot is not good. The villain is not fleshed out, the characters don't work. It sucks. It just makes me sad. Original rating was a 6 but now it's a 3. Which means I hate it. It has even made me like Ragnarok less somehow. Wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.Original:
Weird review for me to write. MCU fanboy and Thor is my favorite. But I'm starting to think the M in MCU stands for 'mid'. Nothing has been able to recapture the life and raw emotions that I got from Ragnarok and Infinity War. I didn't come in with Ragnarok level expectations, and I didn't hate the film, but it was just alright. And I can't help but compare.Thor 3 had moments of laugh out loud hilarity coupled with plenty of iconic badass Thor moments that made me want to jump out of my seat. It also exposed the viewer to plenty of plot while maintaining super high stakes and tension the entire time. Close to a 10/10 for me.This movie had a couple good jokes and a few badass moments but nothing that gave me that shiver up your spine, jump out of your seat feeling. This would've been fine if there was high tension, but it just wasn't there for me.That being said, I enjoyed the romance plot (which I didn't expect) and the ending was satisfying. The scenes where they played with color were pretty cool. Bale was a pretty good villain.If this is what the MCU is going to look like from here on out, I'll still watch, but it hurts me a little to see potential not realized.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first two, are a lot darker, and the humor is peppered here and there. With Ragnarok, they cranked up the humor, and in my opinion made one of the best movies in the MCU. All the elements really worked in that instance. The balance of comedy and seriousness was perfect. With ""Love and Thunder"" I feel like the film makers said ""People loved the humor in Ragnarok, let's do that all movie long!"" Unfortunately this just made for a silly movie. This is a two and a half hour comedy, that just comes across as cheesy and silly. Some really intense events happen to the characters and the universe as a whole, but none of these events feel like they have any weight because of the onslaught of silly jokes before, after, and occasionally, during them. This is really unfortunate because you have an absolutely amazing cast (Christian freaking Bale as the antagonist!) that is pretty much wasted on a goofy movie. My wife thought this was one of the worst movies in the MCU (and one of the worst we have seen this this year) and she has previously loved the Thor movies (mostly because of Chris Hemsworth being shirtless and Idris Elba). Not even a super jacked Hemsworth made this enjoyable for her. I enjoy comedy, and think the MCU typically does a great job of finding the right balance. There were some elements of this film that I really enjoyed however, that balance is totally absent in this film. I had been really looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the first trailer, with Guns N Roses blasting in it, and I was really disappointed in the final product. The film makers just went too hard with the humor and it made for a silly, weightless movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would just watch it for yourself and make your own mind up rather than listening to 1 star reviews of people hating on it.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

Contrast between colorful and grayscale. CG looks great, amazing costume(very satisfied) and fun story(maybe pace too fast but acceptable)Chris Hemsworth still charming as Thor(and I love this ""try not too serious Thor""). Natalie Portman is very talented in Mighty Thor character and Gorr - the villain that make me feel sympathy more than hate.The biggest weakness of this film is each characters' appeared time that I feel not enough such as Gorr and Mighty Thor. Maybe if These characters have more time to show their own story before into climax scene, audience will more pleased.Worth to watch it with family! Thank you Taika and all crew for this fun experience!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's good entertainment.I truly enjoyed it, liked the humor and the fighting scenes but it felt rushed, it needed a bit longer, my humble opinion but the pace is good and never a dull moment. Music is a nice throwback to my younger years.Christian Bale give an ace performance portraying Gorr the Godbutcher. Didn't mind him having the human face, he's just that good! Only wish he had more screen time, hence the movie feeling rushedNatalie Portman does a superb job as the mighty Thor, she nails it. I really like her in this role. Fighting together gave just that little extra.And I just love Chris Hemsworth as Thor, together with Valkyrie Thompson, gives us a nice duo.I also was suprised how well Russel Crow did his role as Zeus, you could really see he's enjoying this part.Cameo was a nice see in the end credit scene, don't miss them! (There are two)I really can recommend this movie, just don't expect Infinity War/EndGame kind of movie, that was the finale of the three fases that came before, so you kind a have that in mind before you go. It's all building up to something, you can see that in this movie, tying the series (animated as well) and latest moviesGo see and enjoy!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

They took beloved characters from the comics and made decent films about them and their adventures. These films became anticipated and dominated the box office, making the characters household names. Now, we have this...A strong, well developed character made to look like an idiot! In his first three films, Thor went from overly serious and arrogant to humble and humerous. Now, he is an absolute bafoon, completely at the mercy of those around him, particularly the female characters. Thor is no longer a heroic leader that earns the respect of other heros. His power as a god, isn't even his anymore! It's free to anyone who's open to recieving it, you don't even need to be worthy!The story attempts to pull on the heart strings but fails as there is a unfunny joke or sarcastic comment being blurred out every 5 minutes. It gets old really fast.The only part of the story that starts well and holds your attention, is that of the villain, played by Christian Bale. His performance and initial stages of his path in the film, are interesting and handled well. Sadly, this doesn't last long as he goes onto to randomly appear, causing a little bit of carnage, before things wrap up for him! A real waste of a great actor doing his best with what could have been a great villain.Anything pleasing about this film, appears in the trailer... In fact, I'd goes as far as to say, the trailer is better than the film!Another nails in the Marvel coffin.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

But this movie, unlike every other phase 4 film, was actually engaging and enjoyable the whole way through. Unlike Dr Strange 2 it doesn't rely on the audience coming with fresh knowledge of crossover content from Disney+ shows. Instead, we get cleverly narrated recaps of previous events through one of Thor's side kicks telling tales to children.I was pretty much smiling the whole way through, even if some of the ""jokes"" Were repeated a bit too much, I still laughed. There were also plenty of sad moments and the romance between Jane and Thor really felt much more powerful this film than the first two, were they behaved like awkward teenagers.I viewed it in Dolby Cinema btw, but I feel like this film is probably better on IMAX as the sound quality was not that noticeable.Not the best MCU movie, but the best since Engame.

We really wanted to like this movie and the previous first two Thors (Thor and Thor the Dark World). My family and I have been watching them in order so we didn't miss any plot points and story lines but this Thor Love and Thunder and Ragnarok were just simply hard to watch. I don't get why these movies were comedies and then had serious parts, even my kids were like ummm this is stupid. I didn't even watch till the end of Thor Love and Thunder because it was that ridiculous. It had funny parts but I wish they would of did different/separate spoof movies and kept the regular Thor movies like the first two, which were very good and was looking forward to the other being like those. My kids thought ""It's my birthday"" line in Ragnarok was hilarious but other than that it was really hard to watch, I hoped that the movie Thor, Ragnarok was just the ""comedy one"" but no they ruined it with continuing with that theme unfortunately. I really don't want to watch them as a comedy because the Superhero movies all had funny lines without making the superhero look like buffoons. Its kinda sad because the of what it could of been but now the Thor movies and Thor just look like ridiculous, silly buffoon characters and takes away their strong, upstanding, fighting the bad guy quality and really makes him look weak. May as well have him just walking around talking and acting like a monkey the whole time since you want a superhero that has muscles but has no character and basically a walking Buffoon. What a flop.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

From the get go Mr. Bale does amazing and as the movie progressed it is obvious that he is the one carrying this chaotic mess. Some CGI was bad, most dialogue corny and predictable and some scenes were totally unnecessary. What the heck happened to Chriss Pratt being hilarious? Why bother having them as cameos? The goats...what the heck was that about it just annoyed the hell out of everyone who was watching it not them per se, but the noise....i shudder to think of it. The ending was cute but it took so many u turns to get there if it hadn't been for C. B. i would of left and gone to my room. It should of been a stand alone movie woth him and Thor as a cameo or something because one is left longing for more of Mr. Bales' storyline. These Thor movies used to be good and now it seems like they are going for cheap shots such as stooping so low and using a age old tactic of undressing Thor and exposing him...would they of done that with Jane or Valkyrie? No they didn't as it showed that they wouldn't do it so why did they do it to the man? It was unnecessary and cheap. Watch this only to keep the praise of Mr. Bale going.","7 out of 28 found this helpful.

We even get an Assembly of the Gods (a bit like the SW Galactic Senate) in Omnipotence City where Zeus (Russell Crowe) rules the roost, The dark stuff come from Gor (Christian Bale) The God Butcher who is determined to off as many Gods as possible, he has some justification though. Also on the gloomy side is Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), she has terminal cancer but then is attracted by Mjolni which reconstructs itself and transforms her into a female Mighty Thor. We also get the Guardians of the Galaxy who help Thor (Helmswoth) deal with some fall out from Gor's activities. Great battles and skirmishes, Thor even gets a pair of giant goats to help him along with Korg (Taika Waititi) as his sidekick. A wonderfully imagined New Asgard on Earth (which has become a visitor attraction) comes under attack from Gor and his Shadow Realm monsters. This film is a fun epic adventure and doesn't over stay it's welcome with a 119 minute running time. Directed by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the script with Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. 8/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Profit is profit, even if the planet will burn down because of it, right?Then somehow this Genderswapped Thor sparkled my interrest. I looked at the poriginal story, and it looked magnificient. Ethan Hawk's character looked excellent in the promo. I didn't mind Cartoon Thor. I was ok with Natalie Thor (Nhor?).But Nhor joking all through the film, even in hooman form, not even a shadow of cancer, and suffering, and everything this story is about?

In JoJo Rabbit the elements of of racism were broken down into their component parts to reveal how stupid, and funny, they appear. However, these elements are no longer funny if they are given power: even worse if it is state power.Anyways, in this movie we have male ego, cancer, broken relationships, loss of religion and kidnapping to deal with, far more serious than any Marvel movie to date, yet this movie was also somehow refreshingly more funny as well. The homage to 80s hair bands was perfect. Russle Crow was perfect. I wish that Tessa Thompson had had a bigger part, but it was nice to see Natalie Portman back. It's also nice to see Chris Hemsworth showing more range in his acting. Christian Bale is always great.I suspect that the swarm of 2,3,4 star reviews is due to the fact that there is greater representation given to same sex relationships in this film. Also there is a question put forth about the usefulness of wardshipung a god, while reminding us that all cultures have gods. I love these swarms of obvious down-votes; they always indicate an interesting movie.I give this movie an honest 8.

On the other hand, Dr. Strange Multiverse of Madness that had one of the worst chemistry between actors I've ever seen, horrible script, two of the most powerful characters in the MCU act like teenagers who can't fully control their powers, and it gets better reviews? The story was completely senseless and honestly the only redeeming part was the cameos we got to see, yet people rate it higher than Thor. This is an enigma to me.Thor Love and Thunder was GREAT. Yes, it had cheesy moments, but it was all made with a great sense of humor. The soundtrack was wonderful, it was the first time I ever enjoyed Natalie Portman on the big screen besides Black Swan, Christian Bale was as expected - phenomenal, the rest of the characters Thor interacts with throughout the film are colorful and full of character, and the goats. My god the goats. Everyone keeps mentioning how great the cast, the music and basically everything else is, but because the plot is a little weak, they just immediately give it a 6 or even a 4. As if Dr. Strange's plot was good? Are you joking?I went into this movie expecting a colorful, lighthearted well crafted comics-action movie and it is EXACTLY what I got. Great actors and performances all across the board, great music, great humor, great production.So yeah, this isn't a surprising Thor Ragnarök, but that's only because you knew what to expect this time. This movie is easily a 8.0+, even if the story wasn't that amazing, it was a great cinematic experience for what it was aiming for. It almost feels as if people would rate this movie much higher if it was another cliché Dr. Strange / Captain America movie because it's just another junk MCU summer hit to consume, instead of something that has a little (a lot actually) bit of its own style and attitude.Give it a chance without trying to be a fabled movie critic, go to the cinema expecting a fun ride and you'll love it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Love & Thunder however, was joke after joke, and each joke was beaten into the ground until you couldn't even tell it was once a dead horse anymore. Even the actors didn't seem to take any of their roles seriously (either because it was part of the script and they weren't thrilled, or they just wanted to goof around), aside from the two serious moments in the movie that lasted all but two seconds before they rolled in another gag. I don't know what the director of this movie was doing, but directing this movie was not one of them. It would've been a decent stand alone movie with different characters/franchise, some weird multiverse bit, an exaggeration by Krog considering he narrates bits of the movie, but this movie is a step in the wrong direction if this is canon to Earth 616 of the MCU. I haven't been this disappointed in a movie since the live action Avatar the Last Airbender.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Like Ragnarök before it, the fourth installment has the same energy and pizazz that Waititi brought us in the past and that makes for an energetic pace. It does not take long to get into the adventure element and he keeps things moving as fast as he can to keep you the viewer into the madness this particular film has to bring. He has brought other elements into the mix to help bring others in, but the pace is certain to be perfect for those with flash in the pan likes of the cinematic world.The Balance of Characters: Marvel has become accustomed to putting a lot into their phase 4 movies, with the last three films juggling a lot of characters and fan service into one installment. Thor's fourth installment has a lot of characters to play with and keep on the screen at one time and it does it surprisingly well, and perhaps the second best of the Phase 4 stuff to date in terms of this element. The Guardians have their fair share of time without being too stuck on the movie, while Thor's merry band of godly misfits each get their own time to shine on the screen and feel significant in some way. Our leading bad guy Gorr has meaningful moments in this film and feels like a well-developed character, while the other plot elements of the film get their own time and good use. It's a fantastic surprise to see how many people had their shining moments and a nod to Waititi for finding a way to juggle it.The Sound Track: Like Guardians, this movie may have one of my favorite track lists to watch a movie too. All the classic songs and epic energy is waiting to swallow you whole with the crazy vibes and perfect timing for inclusion in this movie. Odd love ballads are there during the calmer and more intimate moments, while the action packed moments once more pull from the legendary decades of rock and roll. It feels just like Ragnarök's execution on many levels, and for me was better at times with dropping the right song at the right time and kicking major butt with it. Even the orchestral work finds a place to shine, and the unique tracks for it, and unique spins, show that Waititi is just as ridiculously fun as he always has been.The Visual Direction/Sound Editing: With the budge and resources of Disney, big visuals are the expected norm at this point. While I can't say this is the most mind blowing use of their technology, I do have to clap my hands and nod at the worlds they created for this film. Thor's adventure takes a lot of new styles to heart in their quest, starting technicolor and trippy from the get go that we have seen in Guardians and then moving into something much deeper. The group managed to do so much with the use of lighting in this film, most of the time using it perfectly to really give the aura of the worlds they were trying to create. As seen in the trailer, there is an homage to the black and white film technique that I loved, and heading to the divine city of the Gods really felt like something out of a Percy Jackson chapter in the books. It's beautiful and the sound editing that goes with most of these scenes fully brings that extra emotional punch with it, be it robbing the scene of sound, or adding the sheen and heavenly shine of the kingdom of the gods.The Emotional Moments Of The Movie: Many of the Marvel movies have not really hit me with the emotional punch like other fans have. Spiderman has come the closest, and there are a scant few times of a few other things to get me to nearly form tears. This one though has the most emotional moments for me in a very, very long time. I can't say much, but the character development of Thor is really good in this film, and addresses a few things that movies like this tend to shy away from for the fantasy elements. You'll find yourself potentially in a relevant case for Gorr, Thor, Jane, and Valkyrie's trials and really feel the connection they were going for in their representation on screen. Again, I want to say more, but I can't for spoilers so let's keep going.The Comedy at times: Waititi proved you can have a lot of comedic fun with Thor and still have the Marvel element. For this film, he did that very well on many levels again, bringing with it some brilliant dialogue and timing that I absolutely laughed at in the film. As Korg, his delivery is just spot on and well narrated, sort of like the Barney Fife of Thor's band, that provides that kick you need to relieve the tension. Thor himself feels like the Asgardian we have known and loved for so long, and it really flows well in this movie to not be a drastic twist.DISLIKES:The Rushed Pace In The Opening: Like Rogue One, Thor's fourth installment has an opening that seems a bit rushed, choppy, and a montage more than anything else. It does the job and gives you enough of the story foundation to enjoy, but yet still seems a bit choppy and montage like that I did not quite enjoy. Much of it had to do with the Guardians inclusion and the Gorr's opening moves, alongside jane's story for why she is coming back to the universe. It's not the worst thing given the amazing acts to follow, but you can't help but wonder how good this film could have been with a little more time in the opening.A Story Element: I can't say much about this element without ruining the story, but another small quip, is why the solution to the problem could not have been used again for the final number. Probably to help out with the emotional punch mentioned earlier, probably another rule that I missed or don't know from the comic book. Regardless, the last part seemed to have a fix we could have used, but again I'll let it mostly slide.The Emotional Moments Can Be Tough: If you have a nightmare or sensitivity to some deeper story elements found in Dramatic movies, this film can be tough for you to watch. A warning more than anything, Thor's fourth tale hits some hard topics that do hit the emotional scale, but may be too realistic or hard to watch in the way they present it. It's realistic and makes sense, but it's also a grounding element that you may not want to see in a super hero movie.Some of The Political Push: Yep, we should not be surprised that Disney is still doing the checkbox checking in their Phase 4 installments. The Love and Thunder has a few moments of showing the political agenda off, some of which are naturally baked in, and others a little more of a push than needed for me. It's not the content more so the timing and placement, and though Waititi accomplishes the taste balance better than others, sometimes it gets away and seems to be a diversion not needed.The Visuals Sometimes Get In the Way Of the Action: If you are a fan like me, you like to get the full scope of the action playing out, like in Avengers or Winter Soldier. Waititi and his crew do this decently well, but there are times where the visual style or camera work gets in the way and feels like a cost saving step. The dark tones, how they are zoomed in and the CGI cramming sometimes don't come out as well as they had hoped for me, as they block the people doing the action. Again, it seems trivial, but with a little more post editing and lighting, I think the action scenes in some parts of the movie would have been awesome.A Little More Action: Yep, the action junkie wants more action, surprised right? It's a trivial moment given the other movies I've seen, but Thor's fight scenes in the middle and the end could have used about five to ten minutes more for me to finish those moments strong. The pillar is again the middle moment on the platform, all I can say again, which felt like it held almost the right amount of involvement and finish. The end scenes came close and still end well, but just a little more time with the music, the style, and the twist involvement would have really made this element perfect for me.The Comedy Gets A Little Excessive: By far my biggest dislike of the movie, was the excessive comedy that this part of the Marvel franchise goes too far for me in. If you want your comedy stuffed into every line, with running gags that keep going, Waititi made this movie for you. For others, there are times where the comedy is in your face, forced, and excessive to the point of losing the funny and going to the annoying part that you hope the element will stop. Sometimes it's the banter and the dialogue trying to shoehorn in, and other times it's some political comedy that just does not need to be in there when there seemed to be other options. My biggest irk of the comedy though was the famous goat yell, and just how excessive it became, only making me laugh a few times when he timed it well. Overall, this was the part that seemed a little too much for me, but for those who like comedy, you'll love it.The VERDICT
Thor's mighty adventure turned out to be better on many levels than I thought and really was the fun adventure the trailers promised. It's a movie with style, pizazz, and that Waititi magic many have fallen in love with, balancing a lot of elements to fantastic amounts in who they recruited for the ordeal. With a great soundtrack, awesome visuals, action that feels early Marvel, and character development, this film really has a lot for the fanbase to revel in and enjoy in the shorter runtime than you would expect. Though it does still have some elements I did not enjoy like a rushed paced story element, a little political moments that could have been tapered down, and excessive comedy at times, the movie really is a fun and good installment for me. This is a film worth the investment to going to the theaters and may be worth the full blown theater experience (Imax etc.) if you got the resources or access to it. Overall, this movie for me gets:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Does is deserve Best movie of the year? Of course not. Will the actors/actresses be receiving an Oscar for their performances? I highly doubt it. But does that mean it's a bad movie and that Taiki Waititi should be receiving all this hate? If you ask me Waititi did exactly what he was trying to set out to do. This is an Action-Comedy very much like the previous installment Thor Ragnarok which received very much praise. It had its amazing action sequences, maybe one to many corny one liners, a familiar but good story, and a great villian (Christian Bale can't fail). Chris Hemsworth did a phenomenal job as always. There isn't anyone out there who could take this role from him. Tessa Thompson was great even though she didn't have as much screen time but that was to expect with the return of a very special someone. When I saw Natalie Portman was taking on the role as the Mighty Thor I was very quick to jump to conclusions. I thought it was a horrible idea but Marvel once again proved me wrong. It was great seeing her back in action and glad she reprised her role once again as Thors one love Jane Foster. At the end of the day we got another follow up with the characters we have grown to love over the years with a lot of action, laughs and heartfelt moments. Now I am no critic myself and I haven't liked the recent movies Marvel has put out including Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness but this one just doesn't deserve all the hate. Just because a movie isn't original and takes itself serious the entire time doesn't make it a bad movie. This is a movie about superheroes... Let's say that one more time.. SUPERHEROES!!!!! So if you are looking for something to pick apart for realism you should probably go watch a biography or documentary. Love and Thunder isn't a perfect 10 but a solid 7.5 in my opinion.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

His screen time was negligible.After the opening scene, I thought this movie might actually go to cool places, but I was severely disappointed.Phase 4 features six movies thus far.(Black Widow, Shang-Chi, Eternals, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Thor).Four of them are either awful or mediocre.Shang-Chi is somewhere between ok and meh.Spider-Man was the only movie I actually enjoyed, and only because it is nostalgia porn.I may really quit watching Marvel movies entirely if this trend continues.I have already skipped most of their Disney+ shows, because they are not worthy of my time,","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

MCU is the antithesis to DC's realism and intense Dark Knight trilogy. The franchise was a huge success using this formula. But the audience's response to this movie is an absolute rejection to what the studio has churned out for over a decade. The lack of respect to the Thor character is blatant and fans even casual moviegoers can see through it. This latest iteration of Thor is not even a theme park movie. It's comical and an abomination to what true cinema should be about.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

Wow, this Marvel phase of films has really sucked... please avoid this garbage at all costs!How do you make Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, Russell Crowe, Tessa Thompson and others look really bad on the silver screen? Simple, just employ Taika Waititi to direct another Thor movie. He really must have lucked out on Thor: Ragnarok, as this time around, his direction gives us a movie that falls flat from the opening scene and then manages to just about limp along, right till the very end, embarrassing all involved along the way.As the credits rolled, my wife asked ""did a five year old write this one?"" I understood where she was coming from, but I believe five year olds have far superior imaginations to the creative team involved here. Bottom line, Thor: L&T is just a really bad movie, period! As the curtains close, it states, ""Thor will return""... let's hope if that's the case, that Marvel has the good sense next time to go with another director.George Clooney, finally I can forgive you for Batman and Robin.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Waititi executed most of his comedy very well, many jokes and situations had me and the audience laughing. Some were a little too much but not to take anything away. A problem some Marvel movies have, is placing comedic moments in the serious moments, I can assure you, this movie did not do that. Which highlights and makes Christian Bale as Gorr the god butcher feel so menacing. His performances, in anything he is part of are amazing and once again he is great in this film. Everyone was great, but for me, he was the scene stealer. Chris Hemsworth is amazing as Thor, but we done known that. It's safe to say, if you're not into rom-coms you won't enjoy this one. Marvel's deepest cut into romance so far and probably one of the most comedic movies of the MCU. If you weren't a fan of Thor:Ragnarok, you probably won't find this one that amusing either but if you enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this one as well.Enjoyment Rating: 9.25/10

When i realised this is the Thor movie, i said, this is going to be bad. The first 30 minutes is the worst Marvel has ever been. The dialogues between the GOTG and Thor felt like so strained. Also their jokes was just a bunch of cliches and mostly I didn't laugh. But as the movie continues, the stupid jokes somehow got better, the rythm of the movie went better and i started to get into the movie. And then, once again; goats. Whose idea was the put those stupid goats into the movie? They were really so annoying, every 3 seconds, they were just screaming. It was never funny and it was overused. They used goat screams like 10 times and all were bad. It made funny scenes cringe, it made serious scenes a foolishness. I never thought we won't see a worse Thor after the Endgame but writers made him so bad. Even if i want to i can't give you any spoilers because this movie don't have a story. It was just a compilation of unfunny jokes and Gorr was just a dissapointment. I really want my money back, this movie is far worst of Phase 4. I don't think i will be watching next movies of Phase 4.

Like someone was a huge fan of ""what we do in the shadows"" (brilliant show) and decided to make a marvel movie. Idk what happened. The other Thor Waika did was great. To be fair the whole plot of his literal prop girlfriend (Portman) taking over the franchise, is hilariously bad. Hemsworth has become a iconic Thor. I'm sorry but you're replacing him with a a girl who looks like she's straight out of a romcom or period drama with CGI arms designed by an artist who doesn't understand proportions. Wonder woman was buff.. no need to enhance her physique to look more masculine. It's not like the hammer works on muscles lol.. it is magic that allows them to wield the hammer.Literally 99% jokes except the goats fall super flat. Or are downright cringy. The plot is boring and uninteresting and also basically kills the franchise. I imagine that even if there were people who wanted to see a Natalie Thorman, have lost interest after seeing this poor imitation of a Thor movie. Waika seems to have misunderstood what made the first movie good. Even the villain, supposed to be very intimidating. Just comes across as comical (in a bad way).Again this looks like a troll made a bad imitation. Don't bother watching. Thankfully I didn't pay for this lol. Not that I care about the money. I just don't want to encourage the buffoons at Marvel and Disney. At this point they seem to be switching to making ""hate watch movies"" and antagonizing their fanbase. Like netflix does with certain really bad movies / shows that they pump out sequels too because youtubers will make countless hate videos and the movies will get lots of hate watchers. It's really sad to see the industry like this. It's never been great. But I don't hink it's ever been worse than this. Every bit of creativity is being sucked out to check boxes.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Assembly-line filmmaking at it again","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310265/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2022","A lot of people expected the fourth and supposedly final Thor movie to be a passing of the hammer, and I don't blame them for detecting a pattern within the latest Marvel Universe titles -- at least the ones that concern the original Avengers:So far, Steve Rogers has handed his shield over to Sam ""The Falcon"" Wilson, we've seen a new Black Widow in the form of Yelena, and I'm pretty sure we got a new, younger Hawkeye in the Hawkeye TV show (I'm not gonna watch that), which is to say nothing of She-Hulk. And yes, the trailers for Taika Waititi's Thor: Love and Thunder made it seem as if Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth), who now seems kind of a joke, was going to surrender Mjölnir to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), his bland love interest from the first two movies. Why her? Because it was in the comics, shush.Hell, pretty much all of these changes mirror the comic books. Passing a superhero mantle from one character to the next -- sometimes of a different race or gender -- is one of the medium's oldest traditions, so I could certainly see why people expected us to get a ""new"" Thor with this film (because apparently, first names are now mantles to be passed forth once a magical hammer abruptly repairs itself).However, after the latest Doctor Strange movie ventured into the Multiverse and changed very little in the process (despite adding such supposed game-changers as America Chavez and other stuff that likely won't be mentioned outside of the Doctor Strange or Scarlet Witch properties), I was genuinely thinking that the trailers were showing us an alternate reality; one that will only feature in this flick as a throwaway adventure and then never be acknowledged again. I won't reveal whether Mighty Thor is a permanent mainstay, but will report that I'm nevertheless troubled by the general directionlessness of Phase Four. What's this all for? What's the next Endgame? And why is the plot point ""Jane was snapped by Thanos and, due to a side effect of it, she now has cancer"" not an Onion headline?As the film begins, Thor is out adventuring with the Guardians of the Galaxy but is forced to reunite with Foster, Korg (Waititi's character from Ragnarok), and other older friends when Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale, who gets the best scenes of the film) starts exacting revenge on all ""gods"". That is, of course, the aliens that inspired the gods and goddesses of Earth mythologies (now including the likes of Zeus, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, who has the power to flick away Original Thor's robes and give us a good look at that regained ""god bod"" of his). He's not going around slaughtering deities willy-nilly.But in terms of more truly god-like (omnipotent) figures, the film also follows in the footsteps of Eternals by bringing in some more of Marvel Comics' more ""cosmic"" characters, specifically Eternity, who is a personification of the entire Universe and the source of Gorr's power -- so there's a decent explanation for why he would become something so impressive as a ""god"" butcher. Whether Eternity is still at the mercy of the Time Variance Authority or an angry witch who can ""destroy the Multiverse"" is anyone's guess. Could Konshu and Moon Knight rearrange the stars that comprise him at their own leisure? Who knows? It's useless to think too hard about Phase Four media.We also reunite with Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), who is the ""king"" of New Asgard while Thor is off with the Guardians. Much fuss has been made about the fact that the film calls a female ruler a king, to which more smart-alecky viewers will explain that Asgard is a made-up fantasy world and so it's not our place to question how the word ""king"" is used in their pretend space-Viking culture. Funny that ""king"" is apparently the only Anglic linguistic unit that's used differently whereas the rest of their language mirrors ours pretty straightforwardly, but whatever. Go off, kween. I mean, qing!Another notable ""character"", I guess, is Mjölnir itself -- which, like I said, makes a very sudden return and seems more interested in Jane than Thor. Its relationship with Thor supplies many supposed laughs. Is it an old ex? Old roommate? Estranged kid? Pet? Simple: It's whatever joke Waititi felt for at the time.Thor: Love and Thunder is very much another Marvel movie. Like many of the post-Phase Three additions, however, it does mostly allow the director to keep his voice. Waititi isn't as unrestrained as Rami was with Multiverse of Madness -- which strayed a little too far from the MCU mold for some fanboys -- but he's possibly even wackier here than with Ragnarok, and we're treated to some wild, interesting-looking worlds (particularly the nightmarish pocket realm of Gorr).The film has enough zaniness to go around and I do like Bale's ""Come to Daddy""-inspired performance, but the VFX will often look incomplete, the dreaded Marvel comedy is worse than ever (capping many nice scenes with a cheeky wisecrack or silly character moment and so deflating them -- when it doesn't outright take older dramatic moments and treat them with all the dignity of a Seltzerberg parody), and some scenes are shot like some McDonald's tie-in commercial that managed to get the actors from the real movie involved. Much like fast food, however, you're not wrong for liking it; I'm not here to stop you. Having just seen the Tollywood epic RRR (which was both crazier and yet treated its characters with more dignity than this), my own patience with Hollywood is the lowest it's ever been, though I guess there's little to be done (even as the spread of RRR does re-ignite my faith).I just hope that you're watching this because you feel it genuinely enriches your incomprehensibly short time on this cosmic spec we so briefly inhabit -- the fact of which bolsters just how astronomically lucky you are to be alive to experience this age of art -- and not because you're too lazy and complacent to seek out whatever isn't Hollywood-approved product. And yes, that includes if you're watching it just for Buff Mommy Portman; I'm all for that.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

This movie is on the shorter side when you compare it to the other Marvel movies and in my opinion, it works to a certain extent. The pacing goes at just the right speed throughout the entire movie, except at a few spots where the movie does come to a halt, and makes sure to keep the audience entertained from start to finish.Even if the pacing for this movie wasn't the greatest, the story for this movie is still interesting enough to hook you along for this wild ride. From the very opening scene to the last I was hooked wanting to know more and see what happens next. I will say though the story for this movie does feel like it tried to take on too much for this story. Like I said the pacing works to a certain extent and I feel like if this movie was just a tad bit longer some things could've been explored more. With that being said, with the two main story points in this movie, the movie does a good enough job of exploring those points and keeping the audience invested.This can also be attested to the actor's work in this movie which was marvellous. Whether an actor in this movie had five minutes of screen time to being a main character everybody was bringing their everything to this movie. Due to this, the audience grows to care for these characters and wants to see them succeed. The standout performances in this movie for me were Christian Bale and Natalie Portman, who plays Dr. Jane Foster/The Mighty Thor. Christian Bale originally didn't want to play Gorr and I'm so thankful his kids talked him into it because I can't imagine anybody else playing this role. He was able to switch between so many different emotions that made the audience both scared and sympathetic towards this character. The same can be said for Natalie Portman's performance in this movie where she shows how much of a badass Jane Foster is as both a regular human and as the mighty Thor. I do wish though that some characters got some more screen time such as King Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson.One thing that Marvel movies are really known for is their hit-or-miss special effects, especially their CGI, and the special effects in this movie definitely were a hit. Sometimes the special effects can start out either way and then slowly get worse or better but here they remain the same throughout the movie. I especially loved the CGI on the screaming goats who stole the movie.The special effects in this movie really do help out with the cinematography which also was great. The cinematography for this movie was gorgeous and helped the audience visually understand where exactly they are by helping create these grand worlds.Now, I know it's become a common thing to hate on the comedy in Marvel movies and I will admit that the comedy in this movie might not work for most, especially this one recurring joke, but for me, it worked. I really enjoyed the comedy in this movie as it still didn't overpower some of the more serious moments and would come at the right time. It also helps that this movie wasn't afraid to actually have serious moments in this movie and let them be just that serious moments.The final thing I want to mention is the soundtrack for this movie and how much of a banger it is. From the musical score, composed by Michael Giacchino and Nami Melumad, to the songs they added into the background everything worked for this movie. Please Marvel do more soundtracks with retro music.In the end, Thor: Love and Thunder isn't going to work for some but if you enjoyed Ragnarok you'll probably enjoy this one as well.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

That was followed by a flat, dull, and corny ""action"" scene with the Guardians and I was done. Waititi shouldn't be behind the camera, in front of it, or in the writer's room...apparently I need to fill this out a bit so I'll just point out that also in my era Marvel retold the Volsung Saga (Wagner's Ring Trilogy) with Thor as Siegfried. It was excellent. I wish they had gone there instead of going with the god slayer story line.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was always great to see some humour, and to see Thor's portentousness undermined and put in its place, but now Thor is a complete figure of fun.Needs a change of Director or that's the end of this series for me, and as for Taika Waititi, he needs to go work somewhere less glitzy with smaller budgets on niche films.A major disappointment.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

For contrast when he moved on to Men in Black, Will Smith's comedic role against Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan straight-man was a smash hit.In this movie you had 2 obvious characters who should have been the straight-man: Jane Foster and Gor.

The 4th Thor movie is centered around Love and death . Taika takes us on a journey beginning with how cruel it may seem when love and death can be intertwined. Throughout the movie we are shown that these concepts may seem cruel, but interwoven, they create a beautiful tapestry that isn't defined by time. Of course with such a serious undertone, the story needed something to contrast it with. Taika used the same comedic formula he used in Thor Ragnarok which I absolutely love. The comedy with the cruel/serious undertone blended really well. During all of this we still learn more about the Marvel Universe, more characters are introduced as well as locations we haven't been to before. The cast did an awesome job in their performances. Christian Bale did well with his character as many people predicted he would. In my opinion only of course, I don't think a such a high profile actor was necessary based on the amount of on screen time and actual dialogue for that character.Overall I thought the movie was amazing. I would give it 4.5/5 Stars. The only thing I would recommend is changing the comic relief. I love Gorg and Miek and I know Taika loves being in his own movies. If he wants to keep using that style of comedic relief, I recommend bringing in someone like Awkwafina and maybe taking a backseat in that roll.Would love to write more but I'm tired...","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It is bad in all departments, be it love story, drama, distress, action or special effects. One of the main reasons is the fact, that there is zero chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. There is chemistry between Tessa Thompson and both of them alone, but we are not talking about a Jane Foster-Valkyrie love story. So basically the ""Love"" foundation of the movie doesn't work at all.Also the humor is also terribly childish. Thor Ragnarak had some smart humor, but here it is just bad and comes with a sledgehammer.Thor Ragnarok paid tribute to Jack Kirbys art and the comic history. But Love and Thunder made Zeus to a B-Movie character joke. And what about the visual department? Zeus thunderbolt weapon was atrocious. How could they release it without working on some special effects here? It just looks like a cheap wooden mockup.And the fighting scenes. Yes, the fight on the rainbow bridge in Thor Ragnarok with Led Zeppelin music starting to play is one of the best fighting scenes in the whole MCU universe. Close to the Captain America elevator fight. But here they just reuse the ""jumping"" act of Thor over and over again. Just plain boring.Overall, sadly I can not find any aspect of this movie that may rectify a rewatch. It is just a bad forgettable movie.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

If you are astute and realize that right after the opening scene Korg says gather round and let me tell you a story, you realize that this is a story which is remembered and not taking place in the moment. Thus there are embellishments and silly moments which I thought were fantastic. If you're into goofy and campy this is the superhero film for you. If you want another Ragnarok then look elsewhere. I feel this movie and the second suicide squad are two of the campiest and ""not to take seriously"" superhero films ever made and they are so entertaining because of that. Take a break from the serious films to giggle like a kid at the silly ones.

Some of the heavy splaining backstory scenes recapping the Jane storyline were a little tedious but I understood why they did it (Thor 1 came out years ago, but w/ the recaps you didn't ""have"" to see it to follow the plot).

Hell, he was way too lenient with his opinion. These movies are all extremely predictable, mainly made of cgi, and contain the simplest of dialogues. Yet, they are always so hyped up in media and have mass grown-up followings. How? What am I missing?This movie in particular was worse than your average Disney film for children in terms of simplicity. As if it was written by a 12-year old kid, meant for an audience of up to 10. And why are these films sooo long? Make it 90 minutes, more than enough. This was such a waste of my time. Forced comedy, overused, cgi-filled fight scenes, a toiletpaper script, and a story that had so many plotholes and made no sense whatsoever. I will never understand how grown up people are treating Marvel films as cinematic gems. They CAN be entertaining but nothing more than that.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

This is Thor for adult MCU fans, or even middle-aged ones. It's themes are heavier, it lightly lampoons cliches while pressing heavily into its ongoing narrative, and it's fun without being an out-and-out romp- there's actual dramaThis is a fun movie, there's a lot to love, to chew on, and there are actual stakes. The performances are great, and if they weren't, the side plots and auxiliary characters wouldn't be as compelling.The only character that is somewhat less compelling by design is Korg, who is simple comic relief serving as Thor's literally brainless sidekick, the Watson to his idiotic Sherlock HolmesThis film is special to the MCU for a number of reasons, but one of the more significant ones is Jane Foster's battle with Cancer, which is handled carefully and respectfully- her story is fascinating and might have succeeded more without its title character throttling the spotlight with his chiseled, handsome physique and charmGorr was a powerful and frightening villain, despite not fully receiving the development and screen-time he deserved, and Christian Bale's performance was incredibleI love rating the MCU, and in the wake of the amazing Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness, I would say this rates close to the topFavorite line, ""They mate for life... in packs of six.""My off the cuff list:Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness

Thor is an adolescent when the movie begins and grows up through heartbreak and tribulation, plus lessons on how to be a better God of thunder. Gorr might not be the same God butcher as the comics, but he is masterfully demented in his drive to achieve his end.Stop being gatekeepers of what a comic book movie should be...remember Luke Cage and Thor had a dance competition (complete with a Dirty Dancing lift) the comic books. Comics and comic movies don't need to be DC-level dark to be good. I think Thor: The Dark World proved that dark story lines don't work in Marvel films very well. RDJ played Tony Stark as a stand up comedian in a robot suit and no one batted an eyelash.

A cast of mostly A-list actors can't even save this pathetic script. In the real MCU, we at least have drama. We get the feeling that the characters might, at times, be in danger - even if they are simply comic superheros. This film, however, is so silly, weak and Disney-esque that it's impossible to suspend disbelief for a second. With the cheap-looking sets and poor CGI, it actually looks like a cartoon at times.Plus, who thought it was a good idea to give a character Stage 4 cancer? Really? That's the reality you decided to inject into a comic universe? It was horrific.I gave it two stars for the actors. Russell Crowe went out on a limb even if his character, as written, was ridiculous. Christian Bale is always good, but he was so filled with pathos that it felt like he was making a different film. Chris Hemsworth is a great Thor. I never thought we could see too much of him. This time we, quite literally, do. When you have a character who's that hot, we really don't need to see his butt.It seems that the creators, those who really know the MCU, just put their names on it without giving it their vision.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

That's interesting because usually most Marvel movies like this have everything good except for the villain, as a rule. The film looks like it was made by a 12-year-old child, a lot (too many) of bad and forced jokes, I was embarrassed and cringed at some scenes that are supposedly funny, and I haven't heard this much Guns and Roses since I was probably twelve year.

The CGI is technically impressive but artistically unimaginative (an exception being the B/W sequence), the story is dull and derivative, the A-list cast is stuck delivering a D-list script that would have been at home in a 1970's Saturday morning cartoon, the climatic fight is cretinous (but not unexpected from a production company that once gave the world the Mickey Mouse Club) and the maudlin ending risible. I forced myself to finish the film (mostly watching with one eye and 1/10 of my brain (which was still more than needed)).

I don't want a ""fun"" Thor movie. I need Jon Favreau Iron Man realness. This movie had me rolling my eyes at how utterly dumb, silly and ridiculous it was from start to terrible finish. Disney is ruining Marvel movies by making them childish. This film is wonderful if you're 6 years old. For an adult Marvel fan it's a train wreck. Films like this will kill the superhero genre which people are already getting tired of as it is. I'll bet Hemsworth and Waititi are dying laughing when they think about how much money they were given to make such a stupid movie. Where's Christopher Nolan when you need him? I've seen less silliness in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Bring back serious Marvel movies. Stop catering to little kids.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The whole movie is a huge disappointment, spending way too much time on the jokes and not enough on the story. It was like they fired out every idea they had hoping something would land. This movie had so much potential but instead made every character look like an idiot and Thor was stripped of any depth from his previous films. All serious points of the movie were laughed off and rushed past. As many have said it was genuinely like watching a piss take of the movie itself. I love marvel but I've never wanted to leave the cinema more. Christian Bale was great with what he was given but it was a huge blunder for Marvel - he could have been a main villain for phase 4 giving it a purpose which seems to be lacking in a lot of movies in this phase. I can't believe this came out the way it did!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

While being a visual spectacle, Thor: Love and Thunder has lots of thought provoking scenes that are veiled behind humor and are washed away quickly, leaving it up to the viewer to make of what they see.This film is an excellent addition to the Thor series, and I recommend watching it if you are a fan of the man.Also his big ol' butt makes the big screen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Overall #ThorLoveAndThunder gives Guardians of the Galaxy - meets the Shadow man - meets Coming 2 America - meets Shrek 2 - meets All Might - meets The BatmanThis was a slow growth of enjoyment for me, and I have to say it again (as I did with the last Disney-Marvel release)... you can REEEAAAALLLY tell the Disney touch on Marvel, and it's not always good. I don't think I particularly liked this film, but I also didn't dislike it. There were definitely some engaging and entertaining moments, the fight scenes delivered, and it was ""fun"" overall... but it just felt too outlandish and silly at times vs how it normally feels in the Thor universe (to me), and I didn't like that.Furthermore, and maybe it was just me, but it felt like Thor was treated like a prop vs a lead.SN: Make sure you stay for the 2 post credit scenes if you happen to check it out.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, the fight scenes, the cinematography in the Shadow Realm, the goats, the thematic followthrough via Christian Bale's character, and the contrasting imagery and symbolism of the opening scene with Christian Bale and the ending scene in Act Three with Christian Bale.Could've Been Better: More intentionality with Thor's character with the theme from the beginning, a better balance of the humor with the heroism, and the majority of Act One.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In previous movies comedy was used to break tension, in this one, there's just no tension at all.If I have watched this movie in cinema, I would've left 30 minutes on it, it's really painful to watch.

Played almost entirely for laughs that just aren't funny, no emotion or drama and a waste of everyone's time, money and talent. I can't understand how the decision makers at Disney signed off on this, maybe they've put too much faith in Taika after the success of Ragnarok but he needed reigning in this time.

So here we are, staring into the abyss and watching what will be regarded in the future as an MCU catastrophic mistake.For the first quarter of the move I first thought I was watching a comedy spoof of a Thor movie. The scripting was cringingly bad and Chris Hemsworth' s acting was well below par. In fact, most of the cast's acting was terrible and I joked halfway through the film that the fake Asgardian thespians performed better than the key cast.Christian Bale's performance was outstanding though but he could not save this film, because a diamond dropped into a pit of tar can't shine. It had been speculated earlier that Christian Bale had no interests in doing more superhero or comic book characters and he should have listed to that inner voice before accepting this role. Then countering that rumour, earlier this year he said in an interview ""...a good story is a good story. A good film is a good film. And a good director is a good director. And I'm open to any of those ideas."". Well, here we are and I think it's safe to say that none of three criteria listed above apply to this film (sorry Taika). Having said that, Gorr is a fascinatingly multi-layered character and Bale's portrayal is as good as it can possibly get, given the circumstances.I think that's why I manage to award this film 3 stars which without Bale would have been a solid 1 in my book.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was fun, action-packed, with some cool Easter eggs and cameos, great visuals, and a fantastic villain. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Tessa Thompson did a great job in their characters as they always have. Taika Waititi did a great job over the whole film and in his role as the hilarious Korg. And last but certainly not least, Christian Bale was excellent as Gorr!The movie was chalk full of awesome action scenes, hilarious moments, neat Easter eggs, and a superb soundtrack that was perfect for each scene.I recommend going into watching this movie looking for a getaway from some of the chaos and stress in our world. This movie does a great job of having dramatic moments with some humorous touches to lighten the mood. This is a bright, fun, colorful action movie.All that said, I have to emphasize - don't expect to see an intellectual mind-bender or dark action-thriller, though it has some deep/dark moments. Expect to see a a fun, hilarious, fantasy-action film that will have you laughing and pumped to head to the gym!","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

I personally think this is one of the stronger phase 4 films compared to Black Widow and Eternals. It was meant to be a light hearted *jokey* kind of movie. Bale and Portman gave an outstanding performance, however the amounts of jokes in the film could have been less. The CGI was decent, and the overall pace didn't feel as rushed as the Multiverse of Madness. It showed a continuation from endgame (as Thor is with the Guardians of the Galaxy), which some of the Marvel Shows are lacking. The ending was very emotional, and the after credit leaves you excited for what's to come in Thor 5. This isn't a top tier marvel film however it definitely should be getting more love.","4 out of 19 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Good Character Arcs for Thor and Jane","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8314451/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2022","Under the Writing and Direction of Taika Waititi, the THOR franchise portion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gone in a more comedic, rather than Shakespearean, direction and THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER proves that this direction is a smart one both for THOR and for the overall health and diversity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well.Starring Chris Hemsworth, of course, as the titular THOR, Love and Thunder shows our demi-god hero at a crossroads in his life and career. Into this world walks his ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and chaos ensues as both are chasing the god-killer, Gorr (Christian Bale).This sort of premise set-up (and the fact that Hemsworth is playing THOR for the 8th time), could have fallen victim to banality and dullness, but under the watchful eye of Waititi (Writer/Director of the severely under-rated JOJO RABBIT), this THOR soars with the best of them and develops the overall arc and (eventual) pay-off of both Thor's and Jane's arcs precisely and (upon retrospection) in the only satisfying way that they could have ended. So, kudos needs to be given to Waititi for walking this tightrope and sticking the landing.Hemsworth, of course, is charming and buff as Thor and balances the action, romantic drama and comedic portions of this story well. Waititi brings more than just comic relief (though he has plenty of that as well) as the voice of Thor's buddy KORG, while Christian Bale is more than just one-dimensional (how can this actor be anything but interesting) as the main villain of this piece..What surprised me the most in this film is the portrayal of Jane Foster by Portman and how her character becomes the ""female Thor"" (that's not a spoiler, it's in the trailers) and does NOT become just ""Thor's girlfriend"". Portman has made no secret of her distaste of how her character became the femme fatale in THOR: THE DARK WORLD and refused to return to this character previously. Obviously, Waititi has been able to come up with a storyline - and an arc - that would interest an actress like Portman to return and Natalie nails it. She looked bright-eyed and energized by this part and by where her character goes in this film.And then there is Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. This character is a strong part of Thor's story - and the story of the survivors of Asgaard (their destroyed homeworld). Thompson owns this part and is engaging and interesting to watch on-screen. Out of necessity, her character and story play a supporting role to the main Thor/Jane story, so her character didn't get quite enough to do for my tastes. But it did whet my appetite for a stand-alone Valkyrie film (make that happen Marvel).There are cameos and extended-cameos galore in this film - as well as TWO end credits scenes - so to mention them would be to spoil them, except to say that the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY play a pivotal role, but for those who came to see a GUARDIANS film, you'll have to wait for GUARDIANS 3 to come out next year - this is a THOR film.A very satisfying entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and while not a perfect film (it does try too hard, at times, to mine the same, surprise comic gold of THOR: RAGNAROK), THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER delivers a stand-alone Thor story that drives both the characters of Thor and Jane forward in a smart, intelligent way...and when is the last time the words ""smart and intelligent"" were used with a comic book film)?Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

So many cringe jokes, over and over again. There was some potential with the Mighty Thor scenes and other Gorr scenes, but those were quickly forgotten due to the overindulgence in silly quips, forgettable lines, and some really bad CGI (computer generated images/scenes). The first half to two thirds of the movie are some of the worst I've seen in a superhero movie, while the last third was better. Overall, I just didn't appreciate how low Thor has been brought down.

With such great performances from Bale and Portman, it is hard to believe that this movie was not a huge success. It was extremely frustrating to see these actors give it there all, with some fun Guns N' Roses songs and references thrown in, just for the movie to fall flat.The tone was all over the place, going from lame jokes to dark and serious concepts in the matter of seconds. Hemsworth is fine but again the jokes became insufferable to the point where you just roll your eyes constantly. They go on and on with the result being a film that somewhat feels like a parody at times. The middle portion is complete filler just to get the naked Thor scene from the trailers in. This completely screws up the pacing of the movie and results in a rushed climax. The humor is okay in doses, but overtime it becomes annoying and takes away from the serious ideas that are put forth in the films main plot. Without spoiling much, I can say the ending of the film was also questionable and ruined by bad pacing. Honestly I can't see where they go from here but hopefully Marvel builds out an actual plot next time around rather than focusing on jokes first and worrying about the story later. Bale deserved to live long enough to become the villain in a better movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Stan Lee would have died if he were still with us, to see such a travesty on such a beloved character made to be a joke, a Very Bad Joke. Chris.... get out while you can.... this will make Marvel fans really label you as a pun to be associated with what NOT to be and with such talent outside of this and in the past roles as Thor as well of yesterday, please don't do this anymore if this is all someone is making it out to be. I am so disappointed in Disney (happens all the time now) and what Marvel has become... I'd hate to see you in such things anymore and would even rather them kill Thor than do this to him. Kat D. Is wonderful, but they gave her no parts, yet in the couple minutes I was still glad to see her and hear her. Christian B. Did wonderfully amidst such a travesty. Natalie... it was good to see her back, but they did her no justice. Great to see the GoftheG cast. Russel's role was a joke (bad). Melissa (Nope) Luke Peter Matt ... always good to see them... so many with great talent reduced to a bad script bad directing and producing and lack of respect and insight into the Marvel Stan Lee and company created and we all loved. Seems DC is switching roles and starting to take it all more serious while Disney's Marvel (Daredevil hopefully still excluded and remainin,g great with the team who made it all and with Jessica, Luke, Frank Danny and the great support cast of each Shades, Claire. John, Rev (R. I. P.) Malcolm.The Marvel I always loved slowly dies with each new instalment. I will always remember the Marvel while Stan Lee lived and became so awesome as to make the comics of my youth even better.

He turned the movie into a live cartoon. All the plots of the film are full of very childish lines and actionsUse the way of telling bedtime fairy tales to read out the film's synopsis, background, ending and development directly. It is very simple and easy to understand, and it is also very fooling. Watching the protagonist talking and telling jokes that they think are funny is kinda suffering. The Guardians of the galaxy have no influence on the main plot of the movie. Most of the time, there is even no science or story logic to explore.Thor and Zeus, these two men were portrayed without any divine temperament and completely turned into funny clowns. Doesn't Waititi really know that they are NOBLE GODS, not mortals? I don't see this man shows any respect for Norse mythology and original comic book.Even children who don't have any combat experience can fight and don't get hurt, which is enough to see how ridiculous the movie is. Every detail of the film emphasizes how perfunctory it is, but thanks to Christian Bale's outstanding performances, he became the only non-boring characteristic in this film.Nowadays, the balance of MCU between commerciality and artistry has been seriously unbalanced. There is no basic sincerity and innovation from creation to production. The quality problem is very serious, and the cost is highly compressed. Every work has been completely reduced to a product used to extract surplus value.If they go on like this, even the Green Lantern movie could be a masterpiece to them.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie has the death and war needed for seriousness mixed with comedy and jokes to keep your attention all the way through! This movie has all the stars and is nothing but fun!! Mighty Thor is awesome and has you cheering for her FINALLY, because she was a throw away character before. I loved it! Christian Bale is in a different role than ever seen, and Matt Damon didn't steal the movie! Russell Crowe was hilarious as Zeus. I don't know how anyone didn't love this movie... Tons of inside jokes and pure entertainment from beginning to end! Also the soundtrack is a greatest hits album!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The jokes are good individually and aren't bad per se but in the context of a 2 hour movie it comes across as frustrating and derailing.They try to bring it back to being serious in the last action sequence but by that time the audience has been lost.Movie is 2 hours but it simultaneously feels like it needed to be longer and shorter. Some parts just dragged while the interesting bits needed more time to breath.Went with 5 people (including myself), 4/5 did not like it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

But this film is far, far too jokey, and not in a good way. There's nothing wrong with injecting humour into comic book films and indeed the first Thor film did so quite well, but L&T doesn't know when to stop. Even scenes that demand a sombre tone are undercut with more pointless jokes.Worse still, the characters are essentially made to take a back seat to the humour and this is unfortunate when most of it *just isn't that funny*. Thor is made to look like a dribbling idiot for much of the film, but that's ok as long as Waititi is able to cram more of his Fast Show Colin Hunt-style personality into the film. A character tearfully declaring their fear about their fate is diluted with dad jokes and karaoke.Basically this film should have been a cartoon, because it's already most of the way there.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thor is one of them and the most iconic god with a hard backstory.For me is this movie something special. They take a lot from the comics and mixes it perfectly with real tales about the god, this makes it funnier.For example, he is said to have a sleigh with two big goats. So perfect!He's character in the old tales is mainly muscles, self-centred and the main man. This is perfectly shown by Taika and Chris Hemsworth.Thank you for making me and many others happy.I gladly laugh about Thor with you guys!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

At any moment, a drop of drama or suspense would disrupted by some try hard remark that made no sense to the scene.The Marvel community has attempted to adapt its characters to modern times, but this can have its downfalls. Thor's personality in Ragnarok was witty and new, but that movie knew when to tone down the corny parts to make it feel like a superhero film.Unfortunately, a lot of the important parts were lost under odd scenes that would build up and abruptly crash down after some stupid comment was made by one of the characters. Lacking consistency is one of my biggest pet peeves in a movie, but giving Love and Thunder a chance is not a bad idea.Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have a natural chemistry you have to see on screen.

It's a shame - he's done some great work in the past but this is certainly not it.Can we please have the Taiki that delivered magic like What We Do In The Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Eagle vs Shark - the very KIND Taiki that the world needs now!This is not that Taiki. This is a Taiki that has gone full unleashed Ego and this is not a good thing. His humour, which has always straddled the line falls largely misplaced this time, as it has none of the kindness and support of outcasts that go with it.There's huge bits where it needs acknowledgement of the irony... but none is given, and therefore we must take that the so called Good Guys are in fact just as much a bunch of murdering scum bags as the Bad Guys.Christian Bale's Gorr is a massively missed opportunity, from the opening scene - which has huge potential, the whole concept does.It's played by Christian Bale - one of the great actors of our age who make things shine, but here... well... it's all over the shop.""Cram in another joke!""

Chris Pratt looked like he'd been flown in for the day without any training or prep for the part and the rest of the team with very little to do bar flex their characters painted chops before waving to the audience and exiting stage left like some Christmas special.I honestly can't quite remember what happened beyond that aside from Waititi phoning in all the same tropes from the previous latter-Thor parady character skit. Naive, clumsy, arrogant, jolly Thor with his silly lines and childlike (childish?) wittering comedy skit. It's more SNL than Marvel. Awkward and unfunny. And once that comedy rock bloke starts chipping in the background, you realise you're just getting the comedy greatest hits from Ragnarok with none of the heart, peril or action desperately needed to bolster it up.Waititi clearly slid into first base with this one thinking he's hit a home run. Very arrogantly suggesting his quirky doesn't-take-anything-seriously is all we want to lap up. That's why he scored big with Ragnarok, right? That quirky cocktail of cheeky characters and awkward moments. You know that bit where two characters verbally tussle in an awkward comedy way? Thor thinks he's tougher than Hulk. Thor and Quinn's ego battle. These moments were funny as much as a joke is funny, but you don't get up on stage and tell the same joke over and over because it raised a smile once before. This injection of 'humour' is no more than an amateur comedian dying on stage to a room of groans. It completely misses the mark and I couldn't help feel that Waititi naively danced pied-piper-like into this movie believing his giddy audience would once again march to his one-note comedy tune like the dumb simpletons we are. Forget the typical Marvel formula or any real attention to bringing a worthy, original spectacle to the franchise. I doubt there was even a second's thought into giving fans the action blockbuster they expect. We're all just here to bow to Waititi: God of Quirky. The funniest guy in the room is here and you will laugh. Sorry, but no.The film reeks of poor planning and half-hearted production due to the sheer cockiness of the director's quirky (cheap, tired, clumsy, awkward) comedy routine hammering it past the finish line. It has all the impact of Bruce Banner diving confidently from the air expecting to land heroically as the Hulk, but all we get is the 'thunk' as he crunches head-first into the floor. No laugh, no pay off. Arrogant, ignorant and completely off-key, and rather than 'saving' the franchise, sadly cracks, if not shatters, the Marvel legacy.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Oh and the story was interesting too. However, there is no story here, and no one should expect one. I understand that children are also part of the target audience, but serious topics were also replaced by a joke. Because the joke is good, it should be, right? But is it necessary in all cases? Do all characters have to be set up as silly and the seriousness is cheesy?Well, I definitely didn't get the sequel that it deserved and because of that I had a hard time watching the movie(cabaret).

Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Natalie Portman all did a serviceable job with their performances and with the material given. The thing that sets this film back from joining the ranks of Thor: Ragnarok or other great MCU properties is in it's tone.This film conveys two opposing tones during it's runtime. On the lighter side of the tonal coin, we have the typical tropes we've come to expect. Quippy writing, glossy CGI visuals, and jokes galore. A lot of reviews on this film have talked about the jokes in Love and Thunder, and I watched it with that in mind. I found the main issue to be the frequency, not so much the quality. An average movie goer will enjoy most parts of this film.The deeper and darker tone is spearheaded in Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher. He really chews the scenery in any scene he's in and is sorely underutilized.While there is just enough connective tissue to hold the two halves of this film together, the dissonant and tug-of-war like nature of Love and Thunder really holds it back from being an MCU property I'd like to revisit soon.5/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is the kind of movie where experience could be destroyed by the hype, so please give it a chance and go open minded.I see why the movie could be read as empty. There are so many jokes and a great chunk of them explore the movie's main theme. The message can get lost amidst the nonsense, but this movie is definitely NOT empty. It talks about loss and love in a fable-like set, bringing bold, heavy subjects through a wholesome but quick paced set. It doesn't give you time to suffer where you could, to a level that you even forget the drama because of a combo of silly jokes. But It feels GOOD! Life is not only about ups and downs, but also still manage to take the best out of it -This is something Taika is great at translating on his movie and with Thor, it just feels RIGHT. Maybe not the MCU movie fans wished for, but that's the Taika Waititi movie I wanted. Some of the acting feels almost theatrical sometimes but it fits well with direction and Hemsworth is having fun with exploring the sillyness. Christian Bale puts on a show with a believable and strong motivated villain, which balances the tone really well. Beautiful and well thought art direction, especially when the ""MCU""greyness strikes. He translated everything to his own universe. Haven't laughed to the level of spitting out of ridiculous jokes for a while. They are nonsense at times, but most make sense and leads you to the movie's message. So if you liked Ragnarok's sillyness and childish humour, and want to have a great time, give it a chance and come to the theaters open minded.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

Truly appalling predominance of attempted humour that always failed to raise the corner of a mouth. It's been a betrayal of all who invested in the previous offerings. Only a few truly demonic scenes worked but 90% was made up of hackneyed dad jokes. Perhaps all involved didn't want to make another so chose to make such dross. Great fantasy is supposed to enthral and suspend disbelief. This latest offering just makes us cringe and have a sense of annoyance that we can't get the lost 2 hours back. From the first Thor which was magnificent, each subsequent film has offered increasing attempts at lame humour, until Love & Thunder which is achingly bad. Why oh why. The premise of the story had such great potential, with the agonised menace of Bale's character, to the tragedy of Portman's character. Instead someone thought let's make a comedy, where none should have been. 2/10 reflected the effects, which as usual where superb.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I even like to see the less successful ones again, but here... Honestly, this is the worst of all Marvel!It is even much worse than ""Thor: The Dark World"" which was the one that held this sad place in the ranking of Marvel films. At least he had the merit of respecting the basic material.Outside in Love & Thunder, the God of Thunder has become a crass betise, bordering on eating hay.Worse: the so-called ""humor"" of the film is at the level of what you can expect from a bad (and more) abominable spuff movie.And it's a shame because there are good ideas and exciting characters: (Gorr in the lead) has a really very interesting development potential. Same for Russel Crow's paunchy and decadent Zeus, but... This city of Gods? What the hell is this f.... idea? Has Olympus, like Asgard, also been completely destroyed?And then, wanting to stick his clumsy and sticky humor everywhere, Taïka Waïkiki manages to scuttle his entire film with heaps of easter eggs of a subtlety equivalent to that of an incontinent one-legged Mammoth and even the immense talent of Christian Bayle like that of Russel Crow (who, however, we see, do everything they can) like that of most other actors, moreover, are not enough to save a film scuttled by a director who manages to do everything miss, scene after scene...And Marvel would like to entrust him with the sequel (and end?) of Thor? I hope they will change their minds soon because the God of Thunder does not deserve such an inglorious end!To say, it's the very first time, in a Marvel film, that I would have liked to be able to skip certain passages of the film.After a Dr Strange 2 that I really liked, it's a bad slap in the face that I took with this movie which is nothing more than a huge disappointment!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The screaming goats in this movie looked like they were bad special effects from the 80s. And really! Screaming goats...wow. There were also some hairy birds that Thor was fighting in a silly way - and those hair birds looked like something from the Muppets. I have to admit I didn't finish watching this because it was silly. Just a silly waste of time. The new Ant Man was also bad.

The Zeus scenes added a different joy to the movie. And the news that Hercules will be involved in the new thor episode, which has been eagerly awaited. But the efforts to show all the heroes of marvel as a whole series do not find their place. Each movie caused a discontinuity with the other movie. For example, Thor's ax is smaller in other series, and it has a series of negativities such as being big in this production. But when you try to watch every series like a new movie, this is the most enjoyable episode among Thor's series. Another issue that I will look forward to in the new thor series is walhala.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The attempt at humor was poor and done way too often. The action was frequently lifeless. After 2 hours, you are left perplexed at what you just watched and why you bothered.I think the problem comes from the Writer and Director being the same person and not wanting to admit any mistakes. Or maybe not being able to step back and see that what was written was not working. Producer Kevin Feige gave Waititi way too much leeway and not enough supervision even though financially this movie will be seen as a success.Christian Bale was excellent but the rest of the cast seemed lifeless and uncomfortable with the characters they had to portray. As silly as Ragnarok was at times, it shined compared to this piece of drivel.They should leave the comedy to the Guardians of the Galaxy who are much better equipped for it.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

For Love and Thunder, it's as if Thor doesn't know what serious means. He seems to be joking around at all times even whilst the lives of people around him seem to be in imminent danger. So upsetting at how marvel movies have become now. I miss the Thor in the earlier movies. The Thor that argued with his father about wanting to go fight in Jotunheim. This Thor is a child in a man's body. Wasted 2 hours of my time. Should've honestly just watched Minions.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

There isn't a shred of seriousness taken in any part of this movie save for the first few minutes. It's actually impressive how little care was taken with this property. It's like Marvel gave Taika Waititi free reign and Marvel clearly didn't care what the end result would be. And it's hard to actually critique any one element of this movie because it's all so stupid. Acting, action, plot...it's all very meaningless in a movie such as this. Even the actors deliver their lines like they could give two sheets. I'm writing this as I'm watching it-and it just gets dumber as it goes-it really is shocking how silly and bad this movie is.This second iteration of the Marvel Universe is troubling. Its a Universe where characters are nothing but titles, easily transferred from one person to another. A universe where all the male characters...are now female...somehow...and all at the same time even. A Universe where you care little what happens ....or who it happens to. And, if this Thor movie is any indication, Marvel fans are going to be in for a bumpy ride. There used to be a time where it was unthinkable to miss a Marvel movie. I haven't gone to see a Marvel movie since Iron Man died....and as near as I can tell, I won't be for a couple of years at best.I just can't believe how bad this movie is......","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The main reason I liked the movie so much was because of the symbolism and the accuracy to the comics with the main villain having a similar backstory to the comic version. It seems as though since it's a stage 4 mcu movie people immediately think it's bad without even watching it even though in my opinion it's one of the top 10 marvel movies out at this time. People should stop hating on a movie because of too much comedy even though the movie in question got more action focused when the action started and maybe people should actually pay attention to symbolism in movies Instead of always thinking like a brick wall.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unlike Ragnarok, there isn't really that much of a story and the genuine excitement comes in dribs and drabs. In short, the good is great, the not so good is pretty average. And here's why...If - and I guess it's really 'when' - there's another Thor movie, we need to wrestle the reins away from Taika Waititi. Great though he is, his comedic take on Thor has now run its course. We need a more serious approach to the god of thunder from this point onwards. Ragnarok had that balance perfectly, Love and Thunder leans too heavily on the humour. This obviously suits Chris Hemsworth but its to the detriment of the story here. Full marks to Christain Bale, whose Gorr the god butcher is an excellent villain, but we needed more of the drama his character brought to the story.So, good not great.

It's certainly very colourful,bordering on psychedelic,and while this has upset many fans I enjoyed this. Mighty Thor? Beyond annoying a few teenage fans I dont see the problem with this character and thought she fitted in well. I also didnt think the ""jokiness"" was at all intrusive. Sure enough they dont always work but for me worked more often that not.Personally I would put this just after Ragnarok as the best of the Thor stand alone films.

Even if the quality of the movie was not so bad, I still could not be satisfied. Bcz Personally, I don't think you can have a Thor movie without Loki
You can't remove Thor's best feature, his brotherly relationship with Loki, and expect to not lose the audience that often loves Loki.I wish at least when they removed Loki, they didn't replace him with a Loki-like clown .I mean I wouldn't die if Loki wasn't in the movies, but Loki tends to be a lot of people's favorite part of the movies (especially Thor 1 + 2, and even in Thor 3), so I don't think it'd be a smart move to not include him.I think it's sad, but I think it might be better not having him in. If they just want to make a joke-Loki or a Loki everyone hates which is what they did with Thor himself. Thor love and thunder was all joke.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Trailer I've seen totally misses the point of the movie. I missed the movie also because of the Thompson's tweet.But the movie is nothing like that. It has some stupid agenda moments, but they're not main idea (good for Marvel). I decided to give this movie a try after I watched The Marvels and liked Danvers which is woman who acts like woman, feminine woman, strong real WOMAN. Not the masculine woman type. Not sure what's the Marvel's plan with this woman though, but if too much agenda will appear, I will dump Marvel movies. They made a huge mistake with Eternals main character, I don't care about race or skin color (except for Snow White, her name tells why 😄), but choosing an actress that don't know to act just because of the race is what I call posing. Few other actors were the ones saving movie. But let's see how it goes.Now, back to Love and Thunder. It is so much better than The Marvels. It's still not old good Marvel movie, but screenplay is not crooked. Also how movie is directed is much better also. Acting is better. Humor is in place like in good old Marvel movies. I now regret I missed it in the cinema. Not sure though that I would watch it for the second time. But it's definitely worth at least the first time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ragnarok was a great movie, one of the best MCU movies, it balanced comedy and drama very well, this movie, does not. It's all over the place.The editing is choppy and scenes feel very rushed. The story is bland and uninteresting. It isn't bad, there are some good moments here and there, like some of the Jane stuff is pretty good and the flashbacks with her and Thor add much needed layers to their relationship. But that is all this movie has going for it. There was potential for an emotional movie here, with scenes that could have been real tear jerkers, but each of these scenes were ruined by some stupid, non funny joke. Taika is a pretty funny writer, but here his jokes fall flat 80% of the time. Chris is good with his line delivery, as always, but everyone else? Nope.Then there is the CGI... What has happened to the MCU movies after endgame? Aside from No way Home, every Marvel movie has had awful CGI, but the effects here are about the same as the recent MS Marvel show. Yes, they look that bad at times.The good thing about this entry in the Thor series, is Christian Bale. He is really good here, and he looks like he is having the time of his life. But his scenes are far few in-between. He doesn't show up much, but when he does his scenes are good. The villain itself is bad, maybe slightly better than that pathetic excuse for a villain in Dark World, but Gorr, is a disappointing villain.Overall, I think this movie is boring, it tries to hard to be funny, and in the process, ruins scenes that could have been great. It feels rushed, and the editing is choppy, poor visuals and an underwhelming villain. It's the weakest entry in the Thor movies, even worse than Dark World - don't hate me for that lol.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Story, character, and everything else get NO effort here! It's all sacrificed in attempt to get laugh! I'll admit that Ragnarok has some good comedy, but here it doesn't land nearly as much, AND Ragnarok's story so much better than the nonsense that is Love and Thunder.

The story is contrived, disney is scraping the barrel and seem to be making it up as they go along. A 10 year old could come up with that story, it extremely basic and simple, not something you would want to waste time and money to watch in the cinema. I rate the story -3/10. Yes negative 3 because you could summarise it in 5 sentences its that basic.To make up for the extremely basic story, the director makes use of meaningless scenes with the most awful frankly dumb dialogue to fill the time required to make up the typical length of a movie. The dialogue is neither funny, natural, inspiring or memorable. Its basically filler so utterly contrived and unnatural, as if an 8 year old wrote it or it was meant for a cartoon targeted at 3 year olds. A third or longer of the movie is basically this mind boggling bad filler dialogue which i also rate -3 and this is being extremely generous (i guess it is in English and in comprehensible sentences)Thus averaging the excellent visuals with the awful plot and hopeless poor dialogue (9 -3 -3)/3 we get 1/10. DIsney seems to be busy destroying its brand and intellectual property. First Starwars and now Thor, just utterly pathetic and disgraceful !","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

According to Chris Hemsworth, this movie was written by a 7 year old child but I had no idea that 7 year old children were allowed to be under the influence while writing scripts. Phase 4 has definitely been a stinking pile and this movie is the equivalent of throwing a thunder bomb to explode that pile and cover the audience with ""fun"", ""humor"" and ""entertainment"".The film is about... well its literaly just a bunch of excessive CGI mess, unbearable toddler humor and a plot that makes you want to scream like those goats. The only good part is the prologue with Christian Bale and after the MCU title begins to roll, everything feels like an incoherent parody where literally everything is poorly made whether its effects, choreography, dialogue, editing or pacing. Thor has definitely hit a new low as he has been degraded to a clown at a kids birthday party who is there to dress up in a cheap costume, talk to hammers, act like a bambling fool and get paid at the end of it all.You were excited for Guardians? How about 5 minutes. You wanted to see God Butcher in action? Forget about it. Instead, enjoy 2 hours of a talking rock. How did Mjolnir get restored? Who cares. How did Jane all of a sudden become a Woman Thor? Doesn't matter. Just stick your head inside a meat grinder and have fun because this is ""Entertainment"" from the comedic genius Taika. The plot actually invents new gimmicks that contradict themselves and the previous movies. I was hoping that at least the climax would pay off but instead, its kids fighting the villain with shiny plastic weapons and in the end, love is the answer.What's bewildering is how actors like Christian Bale, Matt Damon and Russel Crowe agreed to be in this garbagio; I guess the writing and CGI budgets were spent on their paychecks. People who watched this in the cinema should have been reimbursed and given money to see a therapist after experiencing this abomination. Next day after watching, I sat and wondered if this film had any redeeming qualities and unfortunately, I couldn't find any.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

You can see on IMDb that comedies get bad ratings despite people laughing through them. And worse, people hate mixed genres. But I love it that way.So decide for yourself instead of listening to the haters who won't admit that laughter is a good thing.My only negative criticism is that one of Thor's costumes was too comic book looking with pure red blue and yellow.

I guess due to all the wokeness in the film industry right now that they have tried to please all the people but failed miserably. Christian Bale plays a blinding role, too good and serious for this film. Thor looks like something from a fancy dress parade, more colours than a pride flag, or perhaps that was the idea.

MCU films would make you anxious for what would happen in the next battle or adversity but you couldn't care less in this because it's trying to be a comedy but with stale jokes. Thor is portrayed as a meat head which has always been a part of him but that was always balanced out by being the strongest avenger and a force to be reckoned with on the battle field. He was always highly respected among his peers but in this he's mocked, made to be dumb, incompetent, having poor leadership and 2nd to ""Mighty Thor"" Jane Foster. This is worse than the supposedly bad Dark World. Was really keen for this movie and seeing the comic Jane Foster come to the screen but instead very disappointed.

I expected this one to be basically more of that, and in some ways it is, but it hits different. For a while, it's just goofy, and not always in a good way. The jokes largely don't land as well, and it takes a while before it really starts to get going. But when it does, boy it REALLY goes. It's a lot more serious than I expected it to be, and the vast majority of the comedy ends after the first 1/3 or so, after which it's just one fantastic scene after another. There's one part about halfway through where we are treated to probably the most visually unique scene in the entire series, and it blew me away. From that scene on, the movie just didn't stop for me and I loved everything from then on out. Christian Bale absolutely dominates and really shows Chris Hemsworth up in his own movie, which is saying a lot because Hemsworth is as good as always. But we've seen him before about a dozen times, while Bale brings a whole new energy to it. Speaking of energy, there's Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor. I'm so glad she decided to come back, because she was fantastic and in no way did she phone anything in, in the least. She absolutely sold every line and action, and same goes for Tessa Thompson. I loved her in Ragnarok, and I love her here too.My only complaints about the movie:
1. It takes a bit to really pick up.2. Overall, it strangely feels about 20 minutes too short.3. Probably a result of complaint #2, but I thought I could've used just a bit more time with Valkyrie and Jane's Mighty Thor.I'd give the movie an overall 8.5, but since IMDb doesn't do half-stars, I'll round that up to 9.","2 out of 12 found this helpful.

They would double down on the jokes, never giving the plot or character moments time to breathe and turn it into a tiktok video style clipshow for the ADS generation.What I didn't expect was for them to mess up the plot this badly.The setup of this was actually interesting. This could have been good, if not excellent.Take the opening scene (not a spoiler): Christian Bale's people are left to die by an uncaring god. He watches his daughter waste away and die. When he meets his god, the god is a fat jolly guy laughing and pointing at a fallen guy with the ""godkiller"" sword. How convenient. He then mocks Christian Bale who promptly kills him. It starts serious, but ends up as a joke.There are several issues with this. One, it is said gods derive their power from people worshipping them. Why then is this god strong and jolly? It would have been far more efficient for him to be a decrepit loser without any power, and Bale to renounce him then as worthless.Similarly, (again not a spoiler, because it's revealed in promotional material and in the comics) Jane Foster is dying of cancer. Expositionary dialogue reveals Mjolnir chose her to protect her. But it's also draining her life when she transforms and kills her faster. Umm, what? Is anyone proofreading this garbage before they film it? This fully contradicts itself.Not only is Mjolnir functioning again after being destroyed before, rendering that entire scene moot, but it's now better because its shards work like a projectile weapon. Nothing in this has consequences.A better setup: Have Thor bring the ruined hammer to Jane so she can study it. Maybe the hammer actually gives her cancer. And then the appearance of the villain sets in motion that she must sacrifice her own life expectancy to save the day and her love. Now suddenly it has gravitas. Self-preservation vs being a hero. Characters that make hard choices are interesting. Characters who just goof around are not.The entire movie is played for laughs. Every potentially serious moment is turned into a joke (except cancer, they don't joke about that). Worse, the jokes are terrible attempts at noisy slapstick. Screaming goats, remember that internet meme from 2005? It's back. Several times.Most newer Marvel movies since GotG tend to be tonally messy, but this is Ghostbusters 2016 level. Constant talking and bickering about nonsense, endless wink wink humor, references to pop culture, and again with an annoying Melissa McCarthy.As usual, the movie suffers from Marvel bloat as well. Too many characters with too little to do. This could have worked nicely as a small, somewhat thoughtful little character drama with Thor and Jane mending their relationship as she makes the ultimate sacrifice and learns to appreciate what it means to be a hero, and why Thor wasn't there for her because he was... saving the universe. But no, we get the Guardians, Valkyrie who does nothing except the director and Lady Sif, who is treated as a joke as well (the one joke that actually made me chuckle).For once, the critics got it right. This movie is a tonal mess, the acting talent is wasted on a subpar slapstick comedy, and the Marvel downtrend continues.Side note: The CGI looks atrocious. Every scene looks like a bad LSD trip with mismatching colors all over the place. My eyes were thankful for a particularly desaturated scene later in the movie during which I found myself rooting for the villain. Christian Bale wastes a good performance and seems to be the only one not in on the joke, that this movie is essentially a Naked Gun style farce. They did him dirty.Now in fairness, it's been said the original cut was 4 hours. Maybe it was more coherent. Maybe they excised some interesting character moments and ruined the pacing. Justice League showed what studio interference can do to a film, and Taika Waiti has proven that he can balance comedy and serious with his fantastic Jojo Rabbit. Or maybe he simply lucked out with that one.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

This movie I thought was more refreshing, yes there was comedy scenes which some may criticise and maybe they should have curbed back a little - but for me I thought the characters and a roving was great. More importantly the kids as well as adults were glued instead of being semi focused on our phones!The music goes well with the scenes and i thought Russell Crowe's character initially over the top but actually it worked well.It does not look like the Thor franchise will end soon and it does look like during credits another is planned and it seems it will follow the same line of direction.

Acting, 10/10, script, 10/10, graphics and surprise theatrics 10/10, sympathy for the villain, 10/10, big-name guest actors, 10/10, conclusion, 10/10. The only complaint I really have (which is not much of a complaint) was that I typically enjoy a bit more variation on my flick's soundtracks. Don't get me wrong, it was a great soundtrack, it just lacked the variation I was looking for. I cannot see myself taking away too many points for lack of variation in a soundtrack when the film was entirely almost picture-perfect otherwise; for a purposely manufactured, summer blockbuster. So, without further delay, I will give Thor: Love & Thunder (2022) it's just reward of 9.9/10. You definitely want to see this one at your local movie house on the big screen, so that you can soak up all the thrills and action the way it was intended to be seen; as a mainstream summer adventure film with a bucket of popcorn. Try to keep that in mind and don't be so judgmental.

He is without a doubt the best villain in any of Thor's movies and arguably one of the better ones in the MCU. A bit more screen time would have solidified that, but what we get from Christian Bale is fantastic. He is genuinely creepy and far more frightening than the average comic book movie villain. Despite being simple, his motivations are clear and relatable to the average viewer.However, the biggest area where this entry doesn't always hit the mark is its comedy. Love and thunder replaces a lot of subtle situational comedy in Ragnarok with more overt silly humor. While this isn't an issue for me, it is certainly not for everyone. This is the one area where I can see fans with high expectations coming out a bit disappointed. There is still some good comedy, but without Tom Hiddleston, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchette, and the rest of the supporting cast of Ragnarok, Love and thunder feels like Chris Hemsworth working a bit too hard to carry the comedic weight. A bit less comedy and a bit more of a serious tone in some scenes would have went a long way.The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job, but ultimately don't add or subtract much from the movie. Jane Foster has some touching moments with Thor and a very cool intro as The Mighty Thor, but doesn't always hit the comedic vibe the film was going for. Valkarie and Korg are kind of just there for the ride and don't bring much to the table aside from the occasional laugh. Russel Crowe as Zeus is the exception and helps to keep the second act entertaining.The third act is where things really get good. We get good action and a lot of engagement with Gorr. There is an entertaining final battle and finale of the movie, which ends the film on a high note.Overall, after two viewings, I find Thor: Love and Thunder to be a well paced film with some good action and comedy, as well as some heart warming moments. It is an above average MCU movie in my opinion and is worthy of a watch for fans of MCU movies and light hearted action flicks alike.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Minor spoilers
Pros:
Christian Bale. I mean everyone knew Bale is a great actor so this wasn't a shock to me at all. I thought he was great and I couldn't wait for him to come on screen every time. He has actually a very touching story. He was a lot like Vecna from Stranger Things. I only wish that he was a little bit more bigger and scarier and more animal-like like how he is in the comic book version. Only that part was a little bit of a letdown.The romance and story of Thor & Jane. I love the progress of their story, it was so sweet. The one thing that bugged me about the MCU was how they dropped off the character Jane Foster who was so important to Thor's life so I was so glad that they brought her back and finished that story. Their love feels very genuine, I thought they were going to make it silly and stupid but they did not it was actually very sweet.Not boring at all, includes characters. The movie is only two hours and so it is always action packed, there is no room for a long drawn out stupid scenes except for maybe one. I liked Valkyrie more in this one actually and loved the moments the Guardians of the Galaxy were in. Darcy and Dr. Selvig are in it as well as random cameos of Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth, Melissa McCarthy, Russell Crowe and Chris Hemsworth's kids.Cons:
Completely forced moments of political correctness. It seems that Marvel is really trying to put LGBT characters in so bad they are giving it out to some of the dumbest characters. Korg, who is literally made of rocks is the gay one... Everything about it feels so forced it almost feels like Marvel has a team of employees with clipboards that look at every script and say "" OK add a random LGBT character, even if it's a rock I don't care"" and Marvel has to do it. Even Valkyrie kisses some woman's hand and it doesn't even feel romantic it looks like she's kissing her aunt's hand or something. Forced and super weird. Jane also makes a reference to how she doesn't like being called Lady Thor. Whether you are on the political spectrum of left or right I think we can all agree that the characters can be embarrassing for those moments.Too short. Really annoying how short the movie is. Christian Bale said there were a lot of scenes of his that were cut out and I would've liked to of seen those at least. The movie is barely two hours long and the time really flies by fast because the movie is very entertaining so it's disappointing how short it is, especially for an original character like Thor.The scene with Zeus. That was the scene they could've probably done without it was really weird, very long and kind of pointless other than to steal the thunderbolt. For some reason it feels like Marvel is cutting back on the amount of money they're spending on movies. In a way it feels like a Disney+ movie. They must be doing pretty badly. There are rumors that the visual effects team at Marvel Studios hated their jobs and a lot of them quit. Not sure if this is the beginning of the fizzling out of the original Marvel MCU characters.Still I had a great time though, I loved it. 8/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

No one is taking anything seriously, and everyone is laughing like chimpanzees. They keep making this same movie over and over again every 3 months. What a scam.Acting is awful, volunteer actors would perform better. It's as if they're already so rich that they don't care anymore because they know the zombie hordes would just eat up the movie anyway.

I, like everyone else in my relatively crowded cinema, thoroughly enjoyed and laughed throughout the entire film. I think perhaps a lot of viewers haven't seen many of Waititi's previous works, or don't get his sense of humour, which I think is very irreverent New Zealand/Australian. If anything I'd say Thor forgets to be a completely self-involved, arrogant spoilt god in parts of this movie and that's always provided good value for me.I found the early Thor movies to be some of the weakest of the Marvel movies so when Waititi took the helm, he brought life to the Thor series by not taking it too seriously. I mean, he's a space viking. Taking that seriously is boring. For those upset by the 'adult humour', maybe try reading about the ancient gods (whether Greek, Norse or Old Testament) and you might just find them a little more salacious and violent than a throwaway reference to orgies.I found Thor: Love and Thunder visually creative, well-directed with excellent comic timing, and it had fantastic performances from its actors. It's not another Iron Man, but neither is Venom or Spiderman. It's a Marvel universe. It should contain multitudes!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Granted, he's spent the past however-long running around the cosmos with his new friends in the Guardians of the Galaxy, righting wrongs and soaking up the adulation, so it's not like he's completely listless. He just wonders if, maybe, there mightn't be more to life as a living thunder god than cheap thrills and easy wins. That's where the villainous ""God Butcher"" Gorr comes into play. Having violently ended a great number of minor deities already, his vengeful blade now points squarely at New Asgard. Where, coincidentally, Thor's old flame Jane Foster has just taken up a form of godhood.Following hot on the heels of 2017's Ragnarok, the '22 model brings the whole band back together again with a few additional boons. Stunning visual effects, epic fantasy landscapes, belly-quaking rock'n'roll tracks, an irreverent sense of humor (trademark of returning writer/director Taika Waititi) and a decidedly loose connection to the greater MCU... yeah, this wants to be a successor to Ragnarok, all right. Shame, then, that it's just a high-profile case study for the law of diminishing returns.Without exception, every single component that so felt effortless and precise in the previous film is weaker and broader in Love and Thunder. Where the last entry was delightfully quirky and witty, this one feels forced and excessive. Where I was ready to stand up and cheer at the opening chords of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song,"" the similarly climactic placement of ""November Rain,"" either the third or fourth Guns n' Roses tune on the soundtrack, made my eyes roll. The ambitious visuals have taken a step down, the cast has lost its edge, and the story, though excessively simple, still under-delivers. Christian Bale is completely wasted as Gorr, acting his heart out in portrayal of yet another villainous afterthought whose sporadic barks are far worse than his bite. Natalie Portman is awkward and flavorless as an ex-lover turned rival; Thor seems more upset about being ditched by his semi-sentient war hammer. Even MCU heavyweights Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth have had far better showings, mutually saddled by a bland script.Love and Thunder has bits and pieces that work - a handful of laughs, a few visual nods to the source material - but those are light and fleeting enough to have fit into an ambitious short film. Everything else is either a well-intentioned whiff or a confirmed misfire. What in the world happened here?","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's hard to follow why any of the key plot points are happening and many of them have no consequence.

But it is chocked by all the cringe and bad comedy. This is the most schizophrenic movie I have ever seen, as every meaningful dramatic scene is instantly nullified by a worthless, pointless comedy scene.If this was made by a competent writer and director as a proper Marvel movie, like they used to make them, it could have been great. It contains all the right pieces scattered and broken, but unfortunately they are never put together like Mjolnir.Lack of talent really becomes obvious when you have all the right ingredients and you still can't make anything of worth. Because this is worthless both as comedy and as drama.Much of the criticism is dismissed with ""Oh it's just a fantasy why do you take it so seriously?"" or worse ""Why can't you enjoy it for what it is?"" I don't know, why can't you enjoy a bad meal for what it is? Why should a bad movie be enjoyed?Story/writing: 3/10 - a weak comedy containing hints of a good movie
visuals: 3/10 - muscle suits and mediocre CGI
acting: 4/10 - If the director doesn't take it seriously why should the actors? It's all a big joke
direction / editing: 3/10 - thank Zeus he is not coming back, but the audience might not either, the damage is doneOverall impression: 3/10I can't even recommend it as guilty pleasure. This is not so bad it's good, it's just bad enough to make you angry and gnaw at your senses. And give you that tickling feeling in the back of your head: What if it was made by people who respected the material and the audience?P. S: Natalie Portman had the opportunity to join the greatest female action stars, and be mentioned on one page with Linda Hamilton in T2, or Jessica Biel in Blade Trinity., Instead she will be forever known as the actress who wore a rubber muscle suit.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

If they scaled back the quips and projected a slightly stronger serious tone, then maybe the stakes of the story would've carried weight.Christian Bale was a perfect villain to Thor's playful hero. But Thor was a little too cavalier at certain instances, and he lacked empathy when it was needed. All of the actors were spot on in their roles, even Zeus. But again, that much joking kept taking me out from having a vested invested with the outcome.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is very light, in your face, and ridiculous, so I can see many people not enjoying it. It is essentially a Saturday morning cartoon turned live action, which I myself enjoyed quite a bit.Taika Waititi sometimes goes overboard with his ideas, and it seems there has to be a joke every 10 seconds (those damn goats). But at least he has Chris Hemsworth to provide many of these jokes, who is just naturally gifted in comedy and once again just embraces the role of Thor. Natalie Portman stands out in her return to Jane Foster, as she now possesses Mjolnir and is now The Mighty Thor, however I couldn't help but feel her arc was rushed and we as an audience were supposed to just accept her as Thor very quickly. Christian Bale is AWESOME as Gorr the God Butcher, but I feel we could've spent more time with him.My main criticism with this movie is its pacing. Everything comes and goes SO quickly, that you feel you barely have anytime to breathe. With this being the shortest MCU movie in years, none of these new inclusions have any time to breathe, and the plot FLYS by. Not that this plot is complicated at all, it's actually one of the most simple plots the MCU has had, and will only have any bearing in Thors arc, and not the MCU as a whole.Regardless, this movie is a very fun time, if you are able to withstand the campiness and comedy that this movie throws in your face 24/7. It won't be for everyone, but I personally enjoyed it for what it was.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He's faced so much trauma and has learned to accept it. But he's goofy, doesn't know how to fit in, what to say or how to feel. It's uncomfortable to watch until the very end where he finally says something meaningful, because his life found new meaning.None of the 'woke' implications ever felt forced. Just the new norms, so get over it. It's a film for the next-gen of marvel fans. For all the new mums, dads and their kids.Infinity saga is over. Time to move on.

The difficulty is that the comedy bounces around familiar ideas about the hammer vs the axe, Thor being a klutz, Korg being dry and witty etc but nothing new and indeed there are long scenes of plain waffle. The renewed romance between Thor and Jane is dull and not remotely touching and Portman's character including her rather odd reason for returning seems poorly written. There are a couple of good action set pieces and Russell Crowe as Zeus is fun, but overall this is just nonsensical, silly and a big disappointment after Ragnarok.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Menacing. Jane's story was tasteful. Disappointed with how they handled certain characters without going into spoilers.

Welcome back to the exciting world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe! In this new addition, Thor enlists the help of Valkyrie, Korg, and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster to fight Gorr the God Butcher, who intends to make the gods extinct.This hilarious and fun movie was directed by the creative and playful Taika Waititi, as well as written by him with writing help by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. Stan Lee gets writing credits for his visionary Marvel comics. Man, I miss seeing his cameos in Marvel movies.THINGS I LIKED:
Chris Hemsworth was made for this role. He's bigger and badder than ever. His trainer, Luke Zocchi stated, ""He is in phenomenal nick. He's the biggest he has ever been. He's the heaviest he's ever been. This extent of musculature required Hemsworth to eat at least 8 times a day during the entire duration of filming just to maintain all the muscle mass he had acquired."" There's a scene when we see Hemsworth completely naked from behind and shirtless from the front. Speaking about his physique, admiring Chris Pratt called Hemsworth a man-God. Ha ha Chris Hemsworth's son Tristan is seen in the movie as the young Thor.Who doesn't love Thor? He has more stand-alone films than any other MCU character.The cast features five Oscar winners - Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, Taika Waititi, and Russell Crowe - and two Oscar nominees - Bradley Cooper and Melissa McCarthy.To catch everyone up to speed, an entertaining summary features video clips from Thor's past movies, plus a few new ones to fill in the blanks.Wow, I didn't even recognize Christian Bale until he started to speak! Initially, he turned down the role but his kids begged him to do it. His performance is exceptional and what takes the parody style of the movie into an Avenger battle.It's so great to see the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman again. She looks amazing.I adore the Guardians of the Galaxy, so I loved their inclusion in this story.So much humor, both visual and spoken.Fun, rocking soundtrack.So many fun cameos like Matt Damon, Melissa McCarthy, and...no more spoilers.Lots of flashbacks and fun Easter Eggs for true MCU fans.As with all MCU films, keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene and sneak peek at what's to come.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Not all of the humor lands. In fact, some of the cheap and quirky jokes get in the way of developing a powerful movie. Overall, the movie feels like a goof-fest and even a little embarrassing.What the heck was that accent supposed to be for Zeus? Russell Crowe's portrayal was way too silly and even disrespectful for the all-powerful Zeus.Christian Bale's character was interesting and completely underutilized. Korg had more screen time and lines than the villain in the film. Bad move.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity
Lesbian references
Superhero violence.Various kinds of weapons were used.People die.THEMES:
Love and loss
Purpose in life
Self-discovery
Friendship
Loyalty","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thor was always one of my favorite characters in the comics, but in these movies, he's becoming little more than a punchline. I can appreciate the occasional joke here and there, but the last two Thor movies have disappointed on almost every level. Mixing Thor in with the Guardians (and their *mostly* well done slapstick) has had a very negative effect on his character. Not even Christian Bale's excellent villain could save this movie. So much time was wasted with the extremely poor jokes that his (Bale's) character was more a side story than the main story. Even Russell Crowe's Zeus was made out to be a bumbling clod for the sake of a few 'jokes'. The actual super hero scenes that were in the movie were great, but they were too far and few to save this joke of a movie.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But wow, shocked at the childish dialogue, forced acting by incredible actors and no break away from what felt like a pure parody of thor. I atcually had to press back to double check I was genuinely watching the new thor film. All the ingredients were here, great actor's including the addition of Bail and Crowe, great effects even guardians of the galaxy....but it was baked essentially into a parody of a film. I felt nothing, even in the scenes where I absolutely should have, yes thor films typically have a few moments of humour but through the entire thing? Most of which wasn't that funny, in fact some moments made me cringy uncomfortable. Crowe did make me laugh however as Zeus, although Crowes impeccable talent was wasted, making him a comedian god rather than the legend and myth we've all come to know...this film could have been amazing and I'm truly shocked at how much talent and opportunity they wasted on jokes and forced comedy value...so much so the film was turned off for over three hours whilst I cooked and ate dinner.. That shows how little invested I was.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It feels forced way too many times and most often falls right on it's face. Thor was not funny in the comic books. Nor was Tony Stark.

The villain isn't interesting, the humor isn't funny, the action is boring, and pretty much everything good in the first thor was undone here. It's like smearing poop over what was once a brick of gold.This movie is like a cheesy hollywood movie with the good parts removed, so you can't even enjoy it in stupid fun.

The ending being its only saving grace. Forced humor and overbearing politics yet again. Marvel and Disney are on a losing streak here. With this and she hulk, we see what really matters to these ""artists"" now. Sacrificing artistic vision and story and atmosphere in the name of ""inclusion"". Of course they're calling Valkyrie 'king'. Of course she had a girlfriend. Of course korg has a boyfriend. Of COURSE. It's all just so forced and entirely unsubtle. This is not even bad compared to she hulk. So I'd still say watch this instead of that, but the major question here is this;HOW did we go from Thor: Ragnarok, to THIS trash? How? We are currently watching the fall of what was once a really well done take on a universe many have loved for decades. We're watching the MCU die by their own glider. As it were. No way home is the ONLY good thing to come out of this pile of politics ridden rubble in recent memory. May we cherish that sole venture as long as possible. Because from now on, it appears we have THIS trash to look forward to.If this, captain marvel, end game and she hulk are anything go by, this is the new norm for this ""franchise"".

It must be a parody. There is no other way to slice it. It's like the Director, if there was one for real? Decided I will just take all of the past Thor, Guardian and Avengers films and make unfunny parody's about that do not hold true to any semblance of comic or film. It's a joke, but in the worst sense of the word.Fluffy and woke, no substance and to top it off, across the board by far the worst CGI to date.I guess with the success of the avengers franchise, it means the powers that be can ride that wave for a long time and not continue to put out solid content.It should be the golden age of bringing marvel characters to life.

Cartoonish and poorly written soundings, not even the direction of Taika Waititi saves, the good director has some glimpses of originality, especially at the beginning of the third act, otherwise it seems that the feature was made in 30 days. The soundtrack is very good, but its sound design in the use of scenes is also poorly used. Grade 5/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The catch here is that the movie is very comedy oriented, giving it a cartoonish tone and it feels like a parody of Thor. Russell Crowe's Zeus character is too cartoonish and ends up contributing very little. Chris Hemsworth is still the best as Thor and Natalie Portman now has more participation. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster brings this movie to life more than the first 2 installments and there is more chemistry between them. Christian Bale in the role of Gorr is an extraordinary villain, quite dark and with a good story that justifies his actions. Another exciting thing about the movie is the soundtrack, which includes Guns N' Roses songs that offer a really exciting moment. As much as this movie ends up being a parody, it manages to fulfill its objective of entertaining like any Marvel movie. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

D. (with concept spoiler, but can be see in the trailer): I like Thor's powers being more about god of thunder and not god of hammers or axes, like in Ragnarok.

The writing has been horrible, and while I put no blame on the actors, I feel the producers and directors should be ashamed to have their names attached to these productions.

He hams it up a lot, but it feels purposeful. It's also fun to see him play the role of megalomaniacal villain and his motivations are very understandable, even if sorta under baked. Even the segment that takes place in Gorr's homeworld (dimension?) is easily the most visually interesting aspect of the film.Hemsworth is always good as Thor. He has great leading man charisma, but the way the character is treated as a joke for a large portion of the movie feels very strange and quite the departure even from Ragnarok, where ""goofy Thor"" made his debut. It's as if between that film and the two Avengers, he went down a couple of IQ points. Russell Crowe as Zeus was pretty fun, and I like how he was the sort of antagonist we don't typically see in these movies: a self indulgent, lazy narcissist.I also like the general comedic tone - to an extent - for the sole reason that it represents a change for the MCU. Just like Multiverse of Madness, this movie is really the product of an auteur, mixed with the MCU's requisite standards. While that might not sound good, it does mean the film feels refreshing and tonally distinct from other instalments, even if not always for the best.The Bad: As you're probably aware, Love and Thunder is basically a comedy. It's a funny movie, but it's almost trying so hard to be funny that it comes off as somewhat exhausting. Humour is obviously subjective, so what's funny to me isn't funny to you. I get it. But I think the humour here actively impacts the narrative.Bale's Gorr the God Butcher isn't a very threatening villain and despite some heavy stuff happening, Waititi seems intent on undercutting EVERYTHING with a joke. Jane has cancer? Gorr kidnaps children? The Gods are selfish jerks and maybe should get comeuppance? Difficult ideas are just watered down to the point where you can't take the movie very seriously.It's also hard to explain, but the type of jokes this movie engages in just...feels stale even by the end of the movie. I know in the depths of my soul that this movie will not stand the test of time. There are some jokes that are already dated that confusingly made it into this movie.As for the story, it's very basic and straightforward. Thor needs to stop Gorr and Jane is helping him. That's essentially it. Whereas Ragnarok was pretty clearly a commentary on colonialism and how societies will always, inevitably, have to reckon with it, Love and Thunder doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't even have a premise; it's trying to be a romantic comedy, but has to also be a generic comic book action film as well. So what we get are both genres messily mashed together and the film never excels in either genre. I do have to say Portman and Hemsworth have pretty natural chemistry, but it's just not enough to carry the film.Tessa Thompson as Valkryie is just really bad. She seems completely checked out of the movie and her character has nothing to do. Watiti as Korg REALLY overstays his welcome and oh my god, those screaming goats. When I say that this movie has some jokes that are just run into the ground, it's these - three? - characters who are the worst culprits.I was shocked by how bad the visual effects were as well. Rumours about the toxic environment that Disney fosters for VFX artists are vindicate with this one. The movie has some very uneven CG, with several moments - some of which have already become infamous on the internet - when my jaw dropped at how bad certain characters and set pieces looked. It's not a good look for such an effects heavy movie.The Ugly: Waititi's distinctive style and sense of humour is all over this thing, and generally, if you find him and his stuff funny, I think you'll like this movie. But, whereas Ragnarok felt like a refreshing and necessary direction for the character to take, Love and Thunder feels like going in the direction for a bit too long and missing the destination. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a particularly memorable one and I can't imagine it gets better with repeat viewings.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Just watched it. A solid runner-up to Ragnarok.There was some heavy exposition in spots, but balanced by appropriate casting and momentum.I would have liked to see more of Jane Foster's arc on screen - as opposed to exposition, but it was still enjoyable. Taiwan directs action and music with seamless skill. Michael Giacciono's scores are also fast making him one of today's most versatile movie composers - he will be up there with the best in another decade. Great visuals. Less exposition and another 15 minutes of actually witnessing internal conflicts (Gorr) and Jane's journey are my only gripes. Better than the 6 out of 10 it is getting; definitely a 7.5 to 8.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I may be in the minority of those that didn't like Taika's take on Ragnarok. It was too silly and all the jokes felt like they were forced in there. Now Love and Thunder did have humor and it was silly in some spots but they were better laid out. It didn't feel like that annoying kid in class blurting out dumb jokes trying to get attention. It was surprising. At one point it pulled on some threads that Jojo Rabbit pulled on. The title itself you think it is referencing one thing but once you finish the film you'll realize it's true meaning. I really enjoyed this entry in the Thor series. 1 mid and post credit scene topped off the film and both were actually very meaningful. Great Flick!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't know what did they smoke but this movie is ridiculous... not in the good way. Total waste of time. Feel bad for people, paying to see this in the TheatersThis movie looks like parody of MCU movies. The whole vibe is a total joke. It started soooo good with decent scene , and that opening scene was the only good thing here. Everything after looks like cheap parody. The Van Dam split (with Kung Pow vibes, tho Kung Pow is quite good for parody!) was so out of place. The movie was filled with ton of references , some of which were not even related to MCU and had no place there.And it's COLORFUL .... if you thought that Ethernals was with depressed colors, come here, here the saturation is +1000. CGI and visuals aren't bad technically, but kinda childish at times.The plot story itself wouldn't be bad, if it wasn't filled with so much random stuff. Dialogues were as stupid as they can be.Bale's performance is good, too bad it was wasted on such movie. The other casts' performance wasn't even good, just typical disney stuff...Sound was good.. but only good. You had decent surround sound and some bass... But nothing impressive. You'd expect amazing surround for such movie but no, not at all. Atmos sound was there just to say there is Atmos, but besides that you wouldn't notice if your height speakers don't work at all. The bass wasn't that low and impressive either.If you like Guns'n'Roses you'd give it 1 point more.. if you ignore the fact that all of the songs troughout the movie doesn't even fit the scenes and they are put there probably because someone on the team loves Guns :D.P.

I'll even go further to say that Feige is a crook whom lately has been rushing out these movies with CGI that looks like it was done in 2005 and approves scripts so cheesy and lazy that I'm shocked only the VFX artists have whistleblown about their treatment on set. Surely, this puts a strain on every crew member, including the actors. They must be getting paid handsomely enough to still be able to smile during their interviews. Terrible movie and shame on Marvel for their efforts as of late. It's 2022 and a company as HUGE as Disney is releasing this kind of stuff.

My friend, her extended family, myself and my family absolutely loved it. The first Marvel film in a while where I teared up at certain moments, got excited at others, and left the theatre feeling actual JOY.Context: I'm a hardcore MCU fan, love all the movies (some more than others), a comic reader, and I'm not even a huge fan of Thor. But I genuinely enjoyed this movie and haven't left the theatre that elated in a very long while.This is definitely a fun movie, how Thor acts (considered more comedic) is understandable as he grew up in the land of seriousness where they told great stories about great warriors, and now considers Earth a second home where he's learning to take life less seriously and be more humorous. Then, of course, his time with the Guardians.I LOVED BALE. Honestly love everything he does. I specifically loved how he portrayed Gorr's voice. Such a nice change to have a different style from traditional villains. Yes, it would've been nice to see him ""butcher"" more gods, but at the same time, adding that in might've messed up pacing - where would they have fit in this rampage?I was pretty happy with the ending, it's nice they didn't go with the traditional (expected) happily ever after route. After credits, like always, opened a couple of doors. I wasn't the biggest fan of the scene Thor gets stripped (as seen in trailer), but it's not really one of the memorable parts of the film so it's fine.","2 out of 16 found this helpful.

If this movie is a legit part of phase 4, then the Thor character was totally destroyed and useless going forward. I would have rather Taiki kill off Thor in this movie and use Natalie Portman going forward (who was still awful, but at least it would be a new character) than for this version of Thor to be the version going forward.Completely ruined the Thor character and from what I've read about Taiki, that may have been his whole point.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Thor: Love and Thunder was everything but boring. The jokes are shot off at every chance given, and the majority land well. In my opinion, it did the one thing Marvel fans are scared of: became a comedy. It was a fresh take on superhero movies in the sense that it didn't just have comedy, but can be classified under the comedy genre. Waititi has a brilliant, zany mind, and this movie really showed that. Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher was excellent, and truly a scary villain. Every character had good development as the movie progressed, and Chris Hemsworth was clearly putting a lot of effort into Thor's personality, which payed off. Plus, Natalie Portman's Jane Foster made an epic return, something anyone can get excited for. The movie also gave us a lot of new, exciting characters and things to look forward to in the future - something every Marvel fan loves. While the plot itself was a bit fast paced, and it kind of felt hard to keep up with the different scenes and settings at times, it still carried itself well. So while it may not be the best of the Thor franchise, it was still a blast, and definitely something I can't wait to see again.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The movie had a engaging storyline with some great humour and action scenes with some great CGI. I think this Thor had the best character development for everyone and we got introduced to some new characters and saw some old. Thor is still badass as ever.I do have to say that some of the humour was forced.The main villain has a very sad backstory which really makes you connect with him.Chris Hemsworth is still badass as Thor but is also trying to find love now after pushing everyone away. Christian Bale plays the main villain Gorr the god butcher and he is terrifying every scene I saw him in he gave me chills running down my spine. Natalie Portman comes back as Jane Foster and is now Thor and she was surprisingly really likeable in this movie. She also had the best character development as well. Tessa Thompson is still Badass and had some pretty funny scenes but she did not get lot to do and she did not appear a lot in this movie. Taika Waititi is hilarious as Korg. And Russell Crowe as Zeus was the biggest jerk but funny.Overall Thor was good I enjoyed it and I think others will too but I think this movie had way to much Comedy in it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Story, script, direction was below average. But The Humor! Was too much difficult for me to swallow. There was no necessity to present Thor like this form, more like a comedian. I still remember the 'infinity war' version of him, those presence give me goosebumps! But Taika Waititi just successfully ruined the character. Only positive thing is Christian Bale. He nailed as Gorr! Outstanding performance as always. But his screentime was so little that audience must feel craving for more of him.The transformation of Jane was good, praiseworthy. But due to poor direction and script, these two characters weren't able to pull up the movie along.

It plays like a Saturday morning cartoon not an epic movie. Outside of one maybe two scenes, there isn't any excessive wokeness which is a redeeming quality. However, the lack of character development and depth makes this definitely a lower end MCU movie. The Guardians of the Galaxy are cameos at best and what they did to Zeus and the other gods is absolutely criminal. This is the weakest Thor movie.

I've seen most of the marvel movies and definitely prefer the more light hearted entertaining movies like guardians of the galaxy, so if you like those then you will enjoy this one. A lot of the more serious movies I don't bother rewatching and just watch them to continue the story. The adult jokes in this are not understood by children at all, so that doesn't worry me.

The quality was much better when he was involved with the production of Marvel movies. The Marvel movies after 2019 just keep getting farther and farther away from his vision. In Thor, Love and Thunder, there just is not an adult in the room. It focuses too much on children ages 4 to 9 years old. What made all the other Thor movies enjoyable was that they targeted the generation that grew up reading the 1960 and 1970 comics. An adult has trouble understanding the theoretical physics of the time space continuum and quantum mechanics, so how is a child going to relate to these complex theories? Yet the movie is targeting young children as the demographic with these themes. At times I was waiting for the Muppets to dance across the screen and a romper room sing-along. The dialog lacked considerably and the acting for the most part was one bad liner after another. Christian Bale put in a great performance, only to be surrounded by characters that had no substance. What a waste of talent. Is this what we can expect from Marvel in the future; Marvel movies with the look and feel of Saturday morning Power Rangers? What was Taika Waititi thinking.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

For such a star filled movie it failed on every level. I feel that I have less respect for some of the stars in this film after watching what they did here. I think that if I were Chris Hemsworth I would've turned this role down. This is by far the worst Thor movie out there and quite possibly the worst marvel movie yet. I am a huge marvel fan And I was extremely disappointed! I literally had to force myself to make it to the end of this film. I kept telling myself it has to get better... it just has too, Yet it never did. The only actor that did an even a halfway decent job was Christian Bale and I'm not even a huge Christian Bale fan. If this is where Marvel is heading I'm just at a loss and don't know what to do except find a new hobby I guess. All I can say is that it looks like Disney is just trying to destroy the franchise. I haven't seen a decent Disney film come out this year. As a fan, I don't know what's going on but I hope whatever it is gets fixed. I wouldn't even give this one a decent rating as a B rated flick. Please Disney get your act together.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I guess right from the start when it felt like I am watching a compilations of some random amateur YouTube parody videos, and NOT even a good one. Too much forced comedy for the sack of comedy. It's like Mr. Taika really wanted to stay true to those three words, Marvel Comedic Universe. Unfortunately, that's what majority of MCU movies have been for many years.I would like to think even kids are probably tired of forced lame cheap kiddy humor, like ""story telling"" and Zeus Court scene, but Box Office numbers tell a different story. Apparently kids, and probably their parents to some extent as well, are actually into this sort of cheap, lazy, lame and nonsense stuff. So, who am I to argue when they are making hundreds of millions, right?Enjoy if this is your cup of tea but if you already had it enough with what Marvel has been offering for last few years, then give this one a miss and in reality you won't miss much at all.The ONLY saving part of this otherwise crappy movie is Christian Bale's performance. Who probably just wanted to have his name on the list of Actors who worked in a Marvel movie, or maybe he was offered a ton of money to participate in this pile of crap. Bale, as usual, gives a great performance despite generic lame dialogues even for his character and tries his best to make sure audience get some of their money's worth.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It confused me and I thought it was gonna be a Harry Potter movie because I thought that the whispering was parseltounge.Overall, great movie. 9/10.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

I cried at the end, which I haven't done at any other Marvel movie.I will admit that the pacing in the first half is uneven, but the second half makes up for it.What this movie does, philosophically, is refute nihilism. What this movie does, artistically, is amazing color work and effective acting. What this movie does, emotionally, is show genuine human connection in the midst of chaos and loss.People are mad about the humor. I'm not. The older I get, the more clearly I know that in life, there is never any time or occasion that is so grim that nothing can be funny. Sometimes that humor can be heightened and made precious by the pain surrounding it. Sometimes it can be infuriating that the world is moving on and making jokes at your expense. Thor, Jane, and Valkyrie experience it all just in trying to survive loss and sickness. So does Gorr, whose heartbreakingly efficient origin story sets him on a path to try to undo the gods' mockery of his heartbreak.Try watching this movie without looking for things to sneer at.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's too fast to take in ANY scene at all. Some moments that could have been great too watch felt like an unfunny family guy cutaway.The dialogue is terrible. I'm not sure whether Tommy Wiseau advised on the script, but I definitely see his influence when the characters announce their emotions out loud, or say something unnecessary and obvious.Jokes that had a potential to be funny are so oversaturated they are tiresome. Honestly, I lowered my expectations to expect a simple dumb comedy, but even those expectations were let down.Shots in terms of depth and conposition are bland as hell.

It also had some deeper bits, which I thought could've been better, but Taika Waititi gets a 10 from me for his humour. THE GOATS WERE THE FUNNIEST THING EVER!!!!I liked Christian Bale's look, really spooky, looked like the Grim Reaper x Voldemort, but I would've liked to know more about him, his backstory etc. I couldn't really connect to the pain that drove him to be the villain.I also didn't like how children were presented as the meaning of life and the most important thing ever. Thor replaced his love interest with the responsibility of a child. So predictable. Is there nothing else worth living for? And those kids being abducted and then poof! Becoming superheroes with no training, because they're precious Asgardians, the new generation bla bla - that also felt empty, although I appreciate the message that kids can sometimes be smarter than adults and change something for the better. I just feel like there's a lot of movies where having a child is used as a trope and it's a bit boring.Anyway, I digress. I also didn't like the fact that Zeus spoke with a Greek accent. He's an asshole and I feel like this is again an overused trope - to give the asshole an accent and to sort of link his foreigness to his bad morals. Easy joke to make as well.Also didn't like the joke about Thor losing his clothes and all the women sighing - I felt like I was in fifth grade again, when all the little boys thought that would be the most hilarious thing ever.I also believe they could've saved the mighty Thor, but it must have to do with Natalie Portman's contact or something.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie understands absolutely nothing about the character or his world. Taika Waititi wants to do something different, something entertaining, something that breaks with the schemes and fails miserably in everything he sets out to do. The final product is somewhat sloppy, there is mistreatment of many characters, such as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and there are even ridiculous technical flaws, such as glaring continuity errors. The soundtrack is repetitive, the script is absolutely poor, simple, empty, full of inconsistencies, conveniences and jokes that don't land well. It's a disaster.Perhaps it's a lucky movie to be part of the MCU, because at least it's guaranteed high-quality visual effects, and it can afford to have a good cast that saves certain situations, but other than that, it's an irritating movie.I hope Feige never calls Waititi again.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Battle scenes are great and Bale's as the god butcher is brought to the screen in masterfully way.Some people my find that for a marvel movie it lacks some part of the ""formula"", but everything it does it does well. The comedy is great.

Not to mention the the endless plot conveniences, plot holes and borderline obnoxious depiction of Zeus and other deities.The only highlight for me was perhaps Christian Bale as Gorr who was an absolute delight to watch and milked every single scene he was in.Overall if you like films of substance I would not recommend this film. If you are out for fun and are looking for a light-hearted comedy, love and thunder may just be for you.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It definitely wasn't marvel quality. The comedy reminded me of a show on Cartoon Network. I think they tried to give Thor his own kind of Tony stark funny. Which really didn't work, because he already had his own kind of comedy. I think marvel is trying to make their movies be relatable. Something already happening, when we see the hero's struggle. Almost like a died down show so it can be fit for kids. The plot was not focused enough on the villain, or the main message the movie was supposed to tell. The focus for at least 1hr 30min was Jane and Thor's relationship. More should have have been done rather then said.In summary it wasn't up to marvel standards, it was like power rangers. They had an amazing story line, but didn't go about it right.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Okey maybe the jokes are over the place and feels more silly than Ragnarok but the overall movie just better, better villain, story, and action. It has great moment and nice editing that it didnt feel boring. If you didnt like it as much as Ragnarok, at least you didnt say it the worst mcu movie, if you say this is the worst then other rubbish mcu movies didnt exist.If you love Thor 1/2 and hate this movie, you have dry taste and more prefer 'text book' movie. This movie is about creative possibilites and it works most of the time. This is exactly how Taika want to potray and i am with Taika, i really understand this movie. I like other viking movie like the Northman, but a good movie does not has to look groomy and dark all the time, in the light tone like this it can still deliver a good story and moment.Thor Love and Thunder definitely my top 5 mcu movies.","1 out of 15 found this helpful.

This is an adaptation of a few comic book storylines that I don't think anyone but Taika could pull off. Thor was never a really serious character, and they got a good adaptation of the Mighty Thor story arch, if somewhat reduced (and ""reduction-ed"") to fit a movie.But the real pleasure of this movie was Bale's performance. This is not Thor's movie, this is a Gorr's movie, and Bale stole every scene he was in.This movie was never meant to be serious, and the end product is exactly what it was intended (and what we were promised).","1 out of 16 found this helpful.

This is what you wanted, you loved Thor: Ragnarok and now Marvel Studios and Waititi gave you more of the same, a lot more.The truth is Ragnarok wasn't really that good, it was coming off of the terrible Dark World, not a very high bar to clear, so the fans and the critics showered it with unwarranted praise.The humour boils down to referencing screaming goat YouTube videos that were popular years ago and Korg saying ""funny"" things, also featuring Russell Crowe embarrassing himself as Zeus.Gorr the God Butcher, such a badass name! Shame we don't actually get to see him do any God butchering. Oh, well, I guess the movie already fulfilled the PG-13 quota with the Omnipotence City scene.There is a certain other superhero movie that tried to combine outrageous humour with serious things like life-threatening illness. Wanna guess which one? Batman & Robin. It didn't work then and it's not working now. When you're reminded of one if not the worst in the genre, maybe it's time for a few or more rewrites.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But her arc didn't feel important enough and comedy and jokes came in the way for the drama that in my opinion is equally as important as action and funny stuff.As said there was a lot of jokes. To many for my taste. They felt forced and were not well timed. But if you already know or like the style of Waititi it should not come as a surprise.You will have some laughs, the effects are good and will probably come home feeling like you got entertained. But I think we can ask for more. The pacing, directional choices and character motivations just don't make this into a good film. It's definitely not a movie that I'll be rewatching.","30 out of 98 found this helpful.

And that the MCU series are just bad because there is not enough budget to combine visual quality and meaningful content.But thor love & thunder showed that marvel films should only bring in money with minimal effort. The whole film is just a collection of stereotypical pointlessness. It's as if Taika Waititi didn't trust anyone to be halfway sane. Yes, I know, they still make a lot of money with that crap. But with a budget of 250 million dollars you can expect at least a little bit of effort with the script.I would not even recommend this film for children because I am sure that it is of a degenerative nature for the mind. I'm done with marvel. MCU only exists for me until endgame and the new spider-boy. I just hope they put blade in completely different hands and maybe start taking the audience seriously again. And not only the money from the simply knitted.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Zeus is a forgettable character in the movie. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel.Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's 2022 and I can't believe we're still doing the ""Yes you will - No I won't - Yes you will - No I won't"" kind of joke, and expecting people to laugh at it.The villain is ok but could have been better if properly developed, and the divinity theme with him.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Phase Four has not been an impressive side of the MCU, particularly the movies that have made their way into theaters worldwide. Black Widow was a disappointment. Shang-Chi was fun, but Eternals was pretty forgettable. No Way Home kept nostalgia alive while Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was terrible. But these are just the opinions of one guy who feels like Disney was starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel.Then in walks Thor: Love and Thunder.Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth installment of the Thor franchise for the MCU and finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey of self-discovery. But Thor's retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat this new threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). To Thor's surprise, Jane inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher's vengeance and stop him before it's too late.Directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok, Jojo Rabbit), Thor: Love and Thunder is one part Marvel popcorn picture, one part romantic comedy, with a sprinkling of death and destruction. From the beginning, when Waititi's Korg introduces us to everyone's favorite Space Viking through narration, the God of Thunder transforms from ""dad bod to god bod"" with comedy abound. Thor is busy helping the Guardians of the Galaxy save a planet to the tune of the Guns N' Roses hit ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" while New Asgard has become a cruise port full of Disney cruise ships. By the time Gorr's presence is felt, Waititi provides fans with a whimsical look at Thor's life, creating a crowd pleaser of a movie that strikes a perfect balance of terror and humor.There is an abundance of cameos. There are surprises and deaths galore. There are running gags that generally would get tiring after a while, but they end up perfectly spaced out like a synchronized piece of music. The soundtrack boasts fan favorites like ""Sweet Child of Mine"" and ""Paradise City."" Bale's portrayal of Gorr the God Butcher is menacing and simultaneously heart-wrenching, a stunning villain that deserves attention just as Thanos did in the Avengers films. An incredible black-and-white sequence takes the principal cast into a quasi-reverse Wizard of Oz, adding to the moment's suspense. With the impressive Thor: Ragnarok and now Thor: Love and Thunder, it's easy to make the comparison that Taika Waititi is what Mel Brooks would be if the latter had a $250 million Marvel budget at his disposal.Taking the character of Thor and making him comedically entertaining is a feat that many storytellers have tried to do for other characters in superhero movies. But Waititi seems to do it with ease. Sometimes, these types of films can feel draining trying to keep up with every nuanced character that might come back in later films, but the newer Thor films have created a world where absurdity is focused on just as prominently as the tension on the screen.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The comedic elements of those films are an understanding that a universe that includes the unbelievable possibilities of space and the multiverse can't be taken so seriously as to ignore the ridiculousness of a talking raccoon and tree or a realm of space Gods on a floating disc with a rainbow bridge. It does the magnificent. Retaining the much loved elements of the comics and original idea of their writers and figured out a way for them to make sense together with out forcing us to pretend it works. Instead it coaxes us to attachment with the tree that can say one phrase using comedy and heart felt connection.Thor Love and Thunder assumes that people loved Thor and the space world of Marvel's IP because of the slap stick ridiculousness and retains only the on the nose qualities of the heroes and this particular part of the world. Some reviewer said that this was a good job at Marvel's first attempt at a romantic comedy and hey, that would have been great if they had pulled that off, or in anyway made it clear that was genre. Instead they had to teach me a new story they invented about some off screen romance that occurred between Jane and Thor. I'm all for implied story and life happening beyond the camera. Clearly things were left hanging with them, but make the movie about that. Show us the continuation of something made so complicated by the weight of having worlds and people rely on you to save them. Gor could have been more compelling and like most things in the movie the shadow realm and how mythical Gods can exist alongside Celestials goes without the slightest explanation. What exposition we are given is done so obviously as an aside it is painful. I get the attempted style but it was taken to level 18 as opposed to 10 and it didn't work. It seems like they asked Taika Waititi to take the breaks off from Ragnarok and give it the good old What we do in the Shadows treatment. I'm not really sure what I watched, but it was ridiculous and unless they ignore it when producing future films I'm not quite sure how it will fit.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Hopes were high on Thor, as Taika made in my opinion the best marvel movie last time around, Thor 3 ragnarok.(For me, closely followed by the first iron man and infinity war)There's again something fresh to Thor, a different style, something very important to keep the interest. Jokes land well and action is very empowering. Well almost all jokes, the theatre parody fell a bit flat this time around.Bringing the love aspect to the story gives a wonderful twist to the movie, engages you again in a different way. The chemistry between Chris's and Natalie's characters can be felt from the movie theatre seat.Guardians of the galaxy team is used as side characters, and likeably so, not going into too much of their story.Some cons, Russell Crowe's accent was maybe a tad too much, and I feel that casting of Christian Bale was maybe not the best for the role of Gorr, I felt he could been played a bit more pompous, instead of the more typical Bale way. Hela was a stronger villain last time around.One GnR song didn't also quite match a scene, but otherwise music was spot on.Left the theatre feeling the movie magic again, and I do hope they get to do Thor 5.

In starting Fighting was not serious, it was a joke and was there a need of this stupid stuff.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Thank you, Thor for the grand return and mayhem. The storyline was not perfectly crafted. Yet! It held my interest; the deep soul searching for Thor and him meeting Jan after so many years after the Thor II film. The film is fast past- and Zeus could have worked out a little for this movie but oh well!! It's all in contemplating for Thor but tragic for Bale as the God killer. So may plots to this film. They could have trimmed it a bit and tightened the storylines.Yet!! The movie came out with the fans loving Thor. I highly suggest it. And. I bet later on on. I expect a fan directors cut to come out. 😉","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It also raises serious theological questions to ponder , but the goofiness and lightheartedness of the majority of the movie allows you to avoid a dreaded car ride home debating the merits of religious beliefs.Perhaps some of the comedic relief is a little over the top, but in my opinion still preferable to overly dragged out battle scenes that make some of the MCU films 2.5-3 hours. There are also some nice Easter eggs and references to past films if you've kept up with everything.Most important of all Bale really excels in the villain role as Gorr and displays his malleability as an actor that few possess. For me, the villains are what truly drive superhero movies and here Bale by no means ""butchers"" the role; certainly one of the MCU's better villains. Only knock might be that it would have been nice having a little more screen time with him considering how effective he was in the part.Lastly the soundtrack was fantastic, highly recommend viewing in a theatre with upgraded speakers.Admittedly , Taika Waititi is a bit of an acquired taste as a director and took me a while to come around to, but I've arrived and am now quite a fan.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Was he high or something? Absolutely nothing worked here, not a single pay-off or joke. It's literally an SNL skit or something. I would've written a better script - in a freaking day. Thor is just a clown here and when in Ragnarok, there was built a beautiful balance between dumb fun and epic fantasy comic-book movie, here? Here are those obnoxiously unfunny goats.

The lighthearted attitude worked fine with the serious attitude Thor has to the world and to himself. I said it a few times before - humor is probably the best cure for pompousness.

With Natalie Portman and Christian Bale both giving two of the best performances I've seen in superhero movies ever. And the rest of the leading roles didn't fall too far behind.But some of the jokes were so pathetic and pointless I felt like Taika Waititi got carried away by the idea of making Thor funny and pushed so far it almost ruined the movie. I get the point - most of the gods as depicted in our own myths are petty and even ridiculous, that would have been better pointed out in my humble opinion if they didn't play their roles as cartoons. Cartoons that look ridiculous and petty are almost commonplace. So - what's the point here did they feel the viewers wouldn't understand how pathetic the gods were if the roles were played straightforwardly? That means they wrote these roles all wrong. Did they feel there were too few jokes there - I don't know but if they did they were mistaken. There were already enough jokes as is, and still they kept piling more and more jokes - maybe they felt like the other part of the movie was too morbid so they wanted to counter it with an extra dose of jokes. That's the most likely explanation but in my book they were wrong to think so and that's mainly on Taika who lost a lot of points in my personal book for his poor sense of balance. I had to make a big conscience effort to ignore parts of this movie that practically made me cringe because the other parts were so good I didn't want anything to spoil them.Once again kudos to Natalie Portman and Christian Bale - they created real depth of character where only hints were written.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The performances are all excellent and the design and cinematography are incredible, much like Ragnarok.If I have one criticism it would be the need for more visual evidence of Gorr, the protagonist's, deeds as he travels the cosmos murdering gods. Bale was brilliant though and his menacing, corrupted performance was chilling at times.The jokes were plentiful and I understand some people don't dig that but I loved 90% of them and I would say the whole experience made me like Thor even more. It's for the lovers. Choose Love (and Thunder).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But it was often a form of humor, not a form of comedy. This movie seems like there has to be a joke in each and every scene, cringe jokes, the movie was rushed in too many areas and Christian Bale's performance was absolutely masked by the fact that the writers required it necessary to sprint through the entire movie.

A hundred years ago, monopoly laws prevented the concentration of media in corporate hands. Beach movies in the 1960s always included at least one lonely millionaire wandering around in the cast -- lonely because he owned a TV station or radio station or newspaper and could only sell it to another lone millionaire. The Clinton era changed that. Four conglomerates today own 99% of the western media. Disney buying Marvel was arguably the coup de grace. You now have companies creating markets for content rather than content for markets. Sometimes it works (WANDAVISION). Sometimes it does not. (THOR LOVE & THUNDER). But it is now their game.

Sadly, this pushed the self mockery too far, and became an embarrassment, instead of comedy, along with good storytelling.The story failed, or at least, was overpowered by the flat acting, poor comedic timing and too much dependence on disappointing humor.My eyes were tired, from constant eye-rolling at the embarrassingly dumb humor.Disney/Marvel has really dropped the ball, since Phase 3 ended, with about only about a third of its content being of any reasonable quality.The result being completely rudderless and more intent on wokeness than good storytelling and character development.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Just as the title suggests - we get to experience an amazing film which presents us a story with both romance and action thus making this masterpiece one of my top 10 favorite movies I had ever watched.Thor: Love and Thunder is a film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film is directed by Taika Waititi and stars Chris Hemsworth as the main character.The story of the film finds Thor on a journey to combat the threat which was made by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher who seeks the extinction of the gods. With the help of King Valkyrie, Korg, and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster, Thor embarks upon a cosmic adventure to stop the God Butcher before it's too late.One of the things I enjoyed the most while watching the film, was that the action and the romance that were presented were showed in a fun way thus making the film a comedy mixed with emotions and also some good action. In addition, I really enjoyed the interesting plot and the acting is really well executed. My only complaint is that there is too much focus on the love story between Thor and Jane and the first part of the film feels somewhat rushed.Overall, this was a fantastic film and a must see for any Marvel fans or just any movie fans in general. It will appeal to a range of people and I promise it will not disappoint.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having Taika Waititi, clearly, isn't enough to make a sweet film. But, then again, the Jane love story was never compelling enough to begin with for me. This film is beyond campy and the flow is awful. The jokes are forced and not nearly as well crafted as Ragnorak. Russell Crowe acts way below his ability and is no where near the star power Cate Blanchett brings to Ragnorak. If there is another Thor movie, I hope if Russell Crowe returns, he works on his comedic timing. Overall, I just didn't feel the acting is as nuanced as Ragnorak, which is surprising given the caliber of the primary actors.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

With an opening scene having a Van Damn Split in it? Why didn't that alone get nominated for 6 NODs? I have no idea, but amazing job! Really.. You got the nominations, in my heart.If any other films are being shot with Italian American portrayals in it? Like Tom Hanks in Pinocchio?

I think I can say that we had a type of universal connection? An Army Connection, & he would've loved how you included the children. From what I know about him? That was all he ever wanted, was to put a wholesome smile on kid's faces. Which every time I'm out & see his toys or anything like that?

Not just for this but for all the other amazing portrayals you've given us as entertainment to distract us from the major problems we are facing, or to remind us of tragic events that happened of the past so we never forget how far we've come.Chris (Pratt), still love you & they say never meet your hero's.. That's why I never sought you out... Star Lord..It was a great job on a mediocre film that was stretched to great lengths because of the amazing talent.I see you Tiki..

It fixed Ragnarok's two biggest issues by introducing a far more compelling villain in Gorr, played with a truly frightening performance by Bale, and it didn't undercut the dramatic moments with humour like Ragnarok did. Love and Thunder isn't as funny as Ragnarok, because it focuses more on the romantic/dramatic elements, which were electric. But, the action is a lot better and the score is one of my favourites in the MCU. I also love that there's a lot of moments when we see the characters just being themselves, and it having nothing to do with the script. The action was surprisingly creative, the visuals were either very vibrant or very washed to juxtapose between Thor and Jane's lives (I liked that), and my favourite aspect was the score. Best score in the MCU. I just wish it was longer so we could flesh out the Thor and Jane's relationship a little bit more!","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This is not good. The plot is weak, the humor is forced and the visuals are awfull.So far the marvel movies looked OK for the most part and I sort of tolerated the greenscreen third act. This movie is greenscreen pretty much 80% of the time and I couldn´t care about anything that was happening because none of it felt remotely realistic.Some of the jokes were fun, but there were simply too many with not a lot of breathing time. In market mechanism if you have an abundand supply of something while the demand remains similar, the price of said item goes down. That model works very well here because the more jokes you have, the cheaper they seem and hence the laughs are not there.The plot? Basically nonconsequential filler with just a few events that have any kind of meaning. I am bothered a bit that there is a deus ex son of Heimdall out of nowhere with no previous mention whatsoever. I mean, the kid was fine and likeble in the movie but he comes out of nowhere, like pretty much any other plotpoint.There were a couple of things I did like in the movie but that would be getting into spoilers. The main characters work well with each other (except of Corg, get rid of that guy ASAP please) and the Villain was good. Overall I wanted to give 3/10 but bumped it up because of Christian Bale. If you are stuck on a long flight with nothing much else to watch, this is fine but I wouldn´t go out of my way to recomend this movie to anyone.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Watching Guardians of the Galaxy is still fun, but that's about it. These are the only positives.It's a shame, because I had hope for this film. I really liked Thor in Ragnarok, infinity war and in Endgame. He had finally become a charismatic character, very well iconized, who had a good evolution. He was the character who had lost the most in the MCU. He was questioning his life and where did this Thor go?? I say it, this phase 4 of the MCU is the WORST!

Gorr is the main villain who wants to kill all gods and Thor wants to stop that from happening. Gorr doesn't need a lot of movie time to be creepy and threatening to gods. We hear about his destruction and see the aftermath. Thor looks for other gods to help fight Gorr because he is has a sword that makes him as strong or more than the gods he's killed. Jane is back and has the same comic story but she isn't taking over for Thor believe that or not. Valkyrie is back and ruling Asgard but it's not a big part of the movie. Thor gets Jane and Valkyrie to help fight this powerful enemy. The Guardians of the Galaxy have a small part at the beginning and Peter gives Thor some advice Thor really tries to use. Korg the rock alien is part of this. If you like him you should like the movie. If not then it will probably make you think it's worse than Hitler. I don't know why some people really hate this. There is a good mix of serious and funny. The funny stuff doesn't overwhelm anything dramatic. This is a great and entertaining movie without ""too many jokes"" although if you are a very serious person you will probably not think so.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Christian Bale wasn't really given a chance to shine as he could of. Seems like Taika has been given a little bit too much free range and ran with it.After this Marvel really needs to start grounding the films again and bring something out more in line with the tone of The First Avenger, Winter soldier or Civil War as this is just getting a bit silly now and after this and Ms Marvel I'm starting to worry about the franchise I've loved for so long.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Haven't read them and I don't care to do so.Now, I have always preferred the Marvel franchise over the DC franchise because the latter tends to take itself way to seriously for me. Marvel movies have that humorous, campy vibe from the very first Iron Man movie onward. Because of that, the Thor movies always felt out of place as they were the only ones always being so dramatic (some might even say melodramatic... I know I would).Thor: Love and Thunder finally got out of that pattern. I enjoyed it very much and felt the pure joy I feel watching other Marvel movies.People giving excruciatingly low ratings are probably bothered by the clear queer culture influences emanating from it, or they are bothered that it is not canon (IDGAF about that). They might also be too young to be affected by the 80's/90's nostalgia the whole aesthetic brings about. I would go as far as to say it clearly has serious Stranger Things vibes.The special effects might not be exactly seamless, but the cinematography is beautiful all around with some parts being really close to straight up genius, the acting is great and the soundtrack kicks ass.It's a very good movie and, according to my personal taste, it's the best Thor. Sue me. ;)","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

It would seem however Taika Waititi got the wrong message from Ragnarok's positive reception believing the comedy and fun visuals to be the sole reason why people liked it. So he decided to double down on those elements for this film.Thor: Love and Thunder is a huge step-back from Ragnarok where serious moments are always undercut by a lame joke and no characters are given breathing room or development. Thor as a character has regressed and is now a complete idiot. The badass, kind and thoughtful character who lost everything is now the bumbling, destructive idiot who lost everything. Jane Foster is back and her character arc has the potential to be really moving but unfortunately not enough time is given to her character and what she's going through. The most disappointing aspect is Gorr The God Butcher, played excellently by Christian Bale, but is never seen Butchering any Gods and is not in the movie enough. The scenes where he is present are probably my favourite since he never tries to crack some lame joke every five seconds. But his character is not given enough time to be fleshed out and so he feels pretty forgettable as a villain which is a shame because Christian Bale really gives it his all.Performances are solid across the board despite the crappy script. While Bale is the standout, Hemsworth is clearly still having a blast as Thor. Although I could've gone without his new multi-coloured and over-designed armour. This movie is probably one of the most colourful MCU entries but not for the right reasons. It's more of the zany style of Ragnarok but to a much higher degree often being unpleasant to look at. The CGI ranges from decent to downright laughable, but occasionally the film provides an aesthetically pleasing shot.Overall, Love and Thunder toys with great ideas such as the characters of Jane and Gorr, but it never gives their characters time to breath, constantly moving from one joke, sacrificing the characters and plot for the sake of it. This film is too ridiculous, it almost feels like parody. Strong performance from Bale aside, this is one of the weakest MCU entries to date.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is put there with no actual script just scenes in random order and the battle scenes are neither epic nether first guardian of the galaxy funny but only a B movie or probably the worst kind of it. After watching that monstrosity of Doctor Strange 2 I say no more marvel but when this one came to Disney+ I said to myself: ""Ragnarok was fun so maybe thor is a good choice to watch""... never do it again. Sorry Disney but I still don't understand how you decide to create movies like this and people that are older than 10 enjoy it....till Endgame, not everything was perfect but the movies were all at least watchable....no its impossible to finish them and if unfortunately, you buy a ticket to watch in the cinema you gonna spend the most awkward hours of your life asking why am I watching this?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even the best soundtrack in three decades could not with me over with this movie. It is so much worse than ""The dark world"". The campiness that marvel is treating Thor with is a disservice to Chris Hemsworth. This character in this context, could easily be played by a young Tom Hanks. They were aspects of the film that were fulfilling and rewarding. I kept hoping that they would continue to drag that film up by its bootstraps, but each time it turned back into Barney's Playhouse. The treatment of ""King Valkyrie ""was ludicrous... I was under the impression that the Valkyrie identified as, It?, Shim? Or whatever name those people call themselves. Shouldn't there be an appropriate title for those folks of a different gender? Sex, Or whatever?King, would be an XY chromosome, queen would be an XX chromosome... Perhaps ""enlightened ruler"", ""ambiguous human ruler"", You know, something for the HIJKLMNOP++ chromosome. And why is she...im called ""Valkyrie"" throughout the movie. I mean what's Valkyrie's name? Even in the comics Valkyrie's name was Brunhild. Valkyrie was her title, her job description.Thor goes from being a total badass, to having more trouble with some old dude with a sword that he had with Thanos. And there may have been a rumor of some boy band/hipster Hercules??If you go to see the movie for the goats, You might like it...the goats were probably the best thing throughout the picture. Oh yeah, and there may or may not be a fight scene toward the end between ""a bunch of the Worthey"" and a bunch of ugly punks. That may be really worth watching.The character Russell Crowe plays?? All I can do is shake my head.Honestly folks if you took every interesting snippet and linked them together you might have a really cohesive 25 minutes worth of footage.You'd have a single episode of a sitcom. I'm really glad I waited for it to come to Disney+.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie doesn't really sit well within the MCU and it doesn't work well as a movie.The first problem with this is is that the tone of the movie is simply off. While a few MCU movies have humour as part of the overall story this is almost 90% humour, but its not really that funny.The music doesn't hit well either, there is an overuse of Guns n Roses which don't really fit well with the scenes they are used. Unlike Led Zeppelin tracks in the other Thor Movies.Even the look of the movie is off, while most of the CGI is ok what is striking is just how bad the other Guardians of the Galaxy look. I would go so far as to say they look unkempt and out of shape.There is a narrator throughout in a New Zealand accent, which was a novelty in the past but now feels tired and its quite an annoying voice.However the biggest disappointment is the emotional payoff at the end. The whole movie is set up for this and I really didn't care. This is the fatal flaw of the movie, particularly since Endgame etc handled this aspect so well. The ending is simply meh and you don't really care.The strangest part about this movie is that it looks like its had a huge budget but some of it looks really bad and it has to be one of the least satisfying movies out there. Antman did a much better job of being an engaging and satisfying movie without half of the effects and flashes this throws at the screen. I am beginning to think this director is getting worse and he is basically over hyped at this point.Even the post credit scene is a severe case of the who actually cares...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There's no denying the MCU has been struggling to keep raising the stakes since the epic finale of the Infinity Saga with End Game. With Disney plus throwing hours upon hours of content at viewers with half baked concepts and lacklustre origin stories. I put my faith into Thors latest adventure being a return to form for the MCU and a continuation of the fun-filled adventures of Thor and his new compadres from Ragnarok.Its with great disappointment I have to confess this truly missed the mark for me. It might have been the childish jokes that seemed to be written by children, for children. It might have been the shoddy VFX. It might have been the goats. It might have been the fact this film just seemed to not have a second act all together. Just an introduction, nothingness and then something which attempts to tie together that introduction.This movie did have many of the things that made Ragnarok great, but whilst Ragnarok lent into more comical themes to juxtapose a really quite dark story, this film tried to make everything into one liner quips that serve no real purpose, other than to mildly entertain children.I do have to say I really did enjoy Christian Bales adaptation of the God Butcher and he was one of the very few things that worked for me in this story. Chris Hemsworth as well works as a lead character, his portrayal of Thor (although somewhat overly played for laughs) is enough to carry the movie with mild entertainment. On the contrary, characters I was excited to see such as Valkyrie and Korg were pushed to the background and really served no purpose to the narrative. You could have removed them completely and the film would have stayed the same. Natalie Portmans portrayal of Jane Foster did nothing for me either, she didn't seem like she really wanted to be there whatsoever.On the whole, Thor Love and Thunder definitely felt more like a Blunder than the thunderous heights I thought it would spring the MCU back towards. This film has done nothing to alleviate my fears that the Marvel Universe is continuing to fall from grace and this could be the beginning of the end for the Hollywood powerhouse. With stakes seemingly becoming smaller and smaller and the projects leaning more and more towards short lasting comical impact as opposed to narrative driven impactful stories, I worry that Marvels time in the spotlight is approaching the end.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It can be 'stupid and ridiculous' but also funny JUST because the actors seems to be enjoying themselves. Ragnarok (Gagnarok) is also 'stupid but funny.' These pair of movies don't do any of the characters justice. They just make Gods into clowns (akin to the 'Woki-Joki-Loki' show). The villain could have been MUCH cooler and Hela was WAY underused unfortunately. The villains for the next Thor are Zeus and Hercules who are PATHETIC!! 😂 Pathetic just like Kang Kong the Clown in 'Loki!' 😆 Gor isn't the 'God Butcher,' Disney is! Hopefully Thor 5 will give both Thor AND Loki some MUCH needed justice with less silliness. The writing in these movies and the 'Loki' show was just pathetic and inept. They HARDLY explained ANYTHING that was going on from the sudden shifts of character motivation and emotions to bringing in MASSIVE figures like Eternity and not explaining them AT ALL and make ULTRA STUPID scenes like all the 'kid Thor's' and making 'everyone worthy.' It used to be a title that was EARNED!!! Now anyone, even mortals can be 'worthy of the Power of Thor' and enter Valhalla such as Jane who is a uncharacteristically hot-headed 'girl boss' who just brazenly 'takes over' as the 'superior Thor' as Sylvie took over as the 'superior Loki.' But luckily at the VERY end of that stupid show they made the REAL(ish) Loki into a REAL God. Still. Both of these characters deserve better! Maybe in Thor 5 or Avengers The Kang Dynasty or Secret Wars hey?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Taika has seemingly gone into this movie without a lot of planning or preparation. The script is awful, boring, weak, with tone all over the place. This new chapter in the Thor series also throws all the past character development and lore out the window. I was so bored. While the movie was running, I was thinking of leaving, on my phone, and also wondering if I should ever return to the cinema ever again. Honestly one of the worst movies I've seen in recent times, and that's saying something because I've had to suffer through some real garbage. I suspect the crew think they made something wonderful.

The characters were wooden, it seems as though Thor has gone backwards in his views and demeanor (was he regressing because of the loss he felt🤔), almost to the point where he was, when he was first introduced.There was no real development of the villain or Valkyrie, and Korg was in there way too much. And for as serious as the issue with Jane is, everyone seemed to 'accepting' and there was little emotional upheaval with the main characters. And I thought the Asguardians were supposed to be so advanced as to be able to deal with something of this sort. It might even have been better if it had been caused by the Red Liquid from Dark World. But every issue just seemed to 'be there' to have a something to do.The City of the Gods was a big disappointment because all we really get to see is Zeus. Where were the Watchers (they would undoubtedly be there, if only to observe)?And the dialogue, especially at the beginning was painful. It was like the writers got bored, but wanted to give the actors more lines, and often it wasn't funny and made little-to-no sense.Guardians didn't even need to be there. That whole scene could have been cut down to 1-2 minutes and would have made as much sense.It really just seemed unfocused and random, to the point that the story was uninteresting and even boring. I kept waiting for it to pick up some seriousness and be engrossing, but, alas, 'twas not to be.My suggestion: wait for video/Disney+","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Love & Thunder clearly takes that position. This really makes me sad because I've always loved Thor as a character and all three of his previous films. This fourth one is a mess though. It tried so hard to be funny, but ended up just being silly. It honestly felt like a parody of itself at times. I couldn't take anything seriously because it didn't take itself seriously. The whole Zeus scene is just dumb. I miss the Thor we got in the first two films, and while Ragnarok was a big shift away from those, at least it was successfully funny.This film just went the wrong direction. Korg was not only unfunny this time around, he was completely unnecessary. I kept wondering why he was even there. He added nothing to the film. Valkyrie is fine, though also not super important. Thor, Jane, and Gorr seem to be the only characters that matter in this story. These three are easily the best parts of the film. While I wasn't a fan of Gorr as a villain for this film, Christian Bale gives one heck of performance. This is also the first Thor movie where I liked Jane Foster. I never felt like the romance between her and Thor had any chemistry, but at least her storyline is interesting this time.And it's almost impossible not to love Chris Hemsworth as Thor, even when he's starring in a bad movie. But I am ready, and it sounds like Chris Hemsworth is ready, for a serious, darker Thor experience. A Thor who is more viking warrior than goofball. Story wise, Thor 4 should have ditched this weak storyline and instead kept the Guardians of the Galaxy as part of the story throughout the movie. The tone of the film would have worked much better with this team than with the team we ended up with. Also, Thor needs Loki. The two of them together create magic. Sadly, Love and Thunder is a rare MCU film that has almost no rewatch factor. Hopefully a lot of important lessons were learned here and we'll get another Thor film that's done right.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I imagine Waititi felt that movie performed so well, critically and financially, that it was an open invitation for him to make the fourth entry in the Thor series even more zany. It's true that he has his own aesthetic, but it's an aesthetic that feels calculated rather than one that has naturally manifested itself as his career has progressed. Love and Thunder was overloaded with hit-or-miss jokes, while the dialogue felt obnoxiously simplistic, as though it had been dumbed down to a level appropriate for a children's book. Still, there were certain scenes that worked to perfection, like the cinematically blissful battle in the shadow realm. And although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, Russell Crowe emanated pure likeability as Waititi's rendition of Zues. There is no doubt it would get my attention should they decide to pursue a Zues spinoff movie. As for another Thor movie, I'm indifferent.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Taika Waititi let us down by not replicating his previous successes with Thor. It's the story of the missing creative spark that my Polynesian brother lacks. General rule: Don't lose your charm when you're in a hurry to meet the deadline. It's true! A lot of great storylines go unnoticed, which is a shame because they're some of the most interesting parts of the MCU. Thor is a likable character, but the sequels didn't do him justice. He has a good arc of growing arrogance to humility and humor. I think Loki is better in Thor because his motivations are stronger, his relationship with Odin is better developed, and we get to see his point of view, unlike Hela in Ragnarok. Simply put, he has more to do, and in my opinion, it's the best sentence.The plot is powerful and character driven. I think the problem with the franchise is that they lacked a clear vision for the franchise, so they decided to make it a safe and profitable business decision by making it a movie series focused on commercial success rather than artistic expression. Natalie Portman, was perfectly fine and the romance is cliched like an old 60's comic book but I think the problem with the franchise is that they had no direction on taking over the franchise, so they said lets play it safe profitable business decision. The use of visual effects and CGI is a little too excessive to mask the lack of comedy and drive the action scene with some humor. Despite its efforts, the work fell short because it didn't give the story any depth.Poumare Sio,","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Should be Renamed as Thor: The Fault In our Stars","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8339283/?ref_=tt_urv","jaysanchu07","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57103146/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2022","As the first MCU film to feature a successful marriage of real comedy, visually striking action, energetic soundtrack and seriousness through its wicked antagonist, Ragnarok deserves the praise & reverence it has received over the years. The attempt to re-hash the same elements in Love & Thunder however, backfired as the film has been deemed a disastrous blunder.Taika Waititi's brand of comedy blew out of proportion in Thor 4, with jokes coming up dry and REALLY overused. Multiple scenes were delegated to Thor's love triangle with Mjollnir and Stormbreaker, which failed to sell in the hundred times it was pushed down the audience's throats. Thor also, has been unfortunately relegated as the film's annoying clown, throwing more cringy punchlines than actual punches. His love story with Jane Foster was non appealing as well, due to the absence of chemistry and on screen fatigue. Between the uninspired comedy and cloying romance, airtime was wasted, airtime that could've been spent to further the limited positives the film had, such as more of Christian Bale's Gorr or Tessa Thompson's King Valkyrie. Shameful!Apart from the glaring mistake to turn Thor into the next The Fault In Our Stars, there remains a long list of mishaps. There is Russell Crowe's sheepish portrayal of Zeus, those UGLY costumes and a clichéd storyline to bring the film in deeper depths. The soundtrack, which put to good use some Guns N Roses songs, were good but feels EXACTLY like Ragnarok, diminishing the actual experience.Overall, Love and Thunder feels like its own parody. The film ultimately massacred Thor, its franchise's characters and the goodwill garnered by Ragnarok, by letting silliness take over to the point of annoyance. It wastes a terrific performance by Christian Bale and its relevance in the MCU is a serious question mark. This is easily Taika's worst film to date, and could be a mark that the MCU, is nearing its expiration date. 5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's no masterpiece, obviously. But for what it's worth, it wasn't too bad.There were moments of character and story development that I liked, but most were outshined by the excessive comedy. It completely detracted from the moments that were supposed to be important and meaningful.The progression of the story was also pretty linear. Not much was going on. I will, however, give a thumbs up for trying to create emotional connections, although most did fall flat. There just wasn't enough good build-up in certain cases/characters.And wow, I saw this most towards the end - the dialogue felt so forced sometimes. Some of those one-liners... absolutely jarring. It really did pull me out of the story.Overall, enjoyable. Not the worst thing I've seen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If this wasn't Thor, and a movie with different characters billed as a comedy, I'd rate it much higher.

I do like the trailers that got made for the film. The people that make trailers for films by Marvel Studios do a good job. The film itself, however, turned out to be easily the worst Marvel film so far. I didn't expect Marvel to release a film this bad, but it happened. This is the first Marvel film that I don't want to see again. I'd rather be apprehended by Elon Musk's private right-wing militia than to see Thor: Love And Thunder again. Well, fine, the film is not that bad. But I definitely don't look forward to seeing it again. What makes it bad is the fact that almost everything in it is played for laughs. Nothing can be taken seriously. There are too many jokes and too much silly stuff. I'd say that about a third, or at most half, of the comedy in the film is effective, but the rest is mostly cringeworthy. Christian Bale, as usual, attempted to deliver a good performance, but his performance got wasted on a film where it doesn't belong. Since this is a Marvel film, the costumes and the special effects that got made for it are good as usual. But, again, they're wasted on a misguided film. I don't know if it was Taika Waititi's intention to make the film this bad. It probably wasn't. He was probably given too much freedom to do whatever he wanted and this has resulted in something farcical. I like every Thor film by Marvel that came before this one. Thor: Love And Thunder has a 64% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It doesn't deserve this rating. The rating should be rotten, quite rotten. I've never trusted Rotten Tomatoes because of one simple reason. Most professional film critics in the West are not reliable. They are bought and paid for, they are politically motivated, or they simply don't know what they're talking about. Hollywood films have been getting worse for several decades already, but the professional film critics either don't realize this or they don't want to talk about this issue. Therefore, they award high scores to films that don't deserve praise, they clobber films that don't deserve to be clobbered, and they go about their jobs as if nothing has changed. This is why I almost never check what they have to say on Rotten Tomatoes. If Thor: Love And Thunder hadn't had some propaganda in it, I think that its rating on Rotten Tomatoes would have been much lower. Unfortunately, many people simply repeat what they read on a website like Rotten Tomatoes. If a film is certified rotten on this website, they think that it's a bad film. This is not how I think. But, anyway, since Thor: Love And Thunder is a film by Marvel Studios, I still went to see it in a theater. Not everything about it is bad. Some of the comedy works, especially at the beginning. The direction is misguided but fine. The performances by the actors are fine. But, overall, the film is a disaster because nothing in it can be taken seriously. In addition, the action is disappointing and almost non-existent. Of course, there is one thing that could have saved Thor: Love And Thunder in its present state, or at least partially redeemed it. This would have been an inclusion of Zeus's planned orgy in the end credits scene. Or we could have at least been shown how Rich Evans defeats Thanos singlehandedly in an alternate universe. But instead what we got was Zeus talking to his son Hercules about killing Thor. How disappointing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There were so many scenes that were cringe, the humour was so forced, the characters were dull and one dimensional that made it so senseless, stupid and unwatchable. How can Jane Foster get even more unbearable after being the love interest and ""new hero"".They didn't bother really working on the characters' story arc and just threw them around with fancy vfx and terrible jokes. All noise, but no substance. I love action packed flicks but this feels like watching a parody of a Thor movie. I wish I was exaggerating. Disney has taken all the general elements of a well funded but poorly written blockbuster movie riddled with clichés and churned out just another money machine. Not a real Marvel film. I kinda regret not watching the new Minions movie instead.

The first movie reimagined Thor as a fish-out-of-water buffoon. Later, he reinvented himself as a romantic figure, and he became a full-fledged comedic figure in ""Thor: Ragnarok."" But after putting Thor through the wringer in the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and the subsequent ""Avengers: Endgame"" film, he finally found his footing. That said, Thor has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for more than half a decade, and each of his iterations has been unmoored.Unlike the first two Thor movies, Love and Thunder was hyped to be more of a romantic comedy than an action film. But this movie as a whole is neither a romantic one nor can be considered as a comedy film. It honors Thor's long journey toward self-actualization while playing with the romantic comedy tropes. Love and Thunder does suffer from an uneven pace and a few clunkers.After the triumphant Ragnarok, Thor: Love and Thunder was expected to be an even better movie from director Taika Waititi, but unfortunately, the film fails to live up to its high hopes, missing the mark on balance and settling for a shallow tone that lacks any dramatic power.Yes Thor love and thunder is a disappointing disappointment for Marvel fans. What went wrong this time is that this so called comedic mashup fails high time to make you laugh. In fact some comedy scenes along with a tickle wont make you laugh.If we look into the flaws, the film is overstuffed with violence and weak comedy. Most of the jokes revolve around how dumb and oblivious Thor is. There are also too many telegraphed lines and jokes about Thor's obsession with his hammer. Not only this makes the movie a lackluster but there is no goosebump scene in this superhero genre movieThe film lays claim to being the best superhero movie in over a decade, but it fails to live up to expectations in several ways. The prologue has a strong emotional hook, and Christian Bale gives a believable scare. Then, the film wastes a wildly promising prologue and a tepid ending.The Marvel universe as we all know is very much inconsistent with the power its superheroes posses, In some movies they may have great power but in some other films it seems that the same superheroes suffers from Amnesia. They don't know about their powers or they don't use their powers when needed. Thor is a biggest example for this, Thor love and thunder movie has an interesting concept but is ultimately disappointing. Thor is the God of Thunder. But ultimately he is capable of doing nothing. We can only say that Thor Love and Thunder plot doesn't live up to the comic book's expectations.The entire movie looks so artificial by forced adding of ingredients, above all this the entire plot looks so loose. Character depth was rather stale, Gorr the main villain came off as both menacing but weak, and his whole characters story was rather shallow, Thor's character change by the end of the movie was awful. Overall Chris Hemsworth as Thor with his extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.Last but not the least the ending part of this movie is terrible.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I felt that except for the end, the movie didn't really add something to the storyline of Marvel. It was nice that you got the feeling that the movie was mostly made with and for fun, but sometimes it felt like they didn't take it seriously enough. There were a few moments where I laughed, but in general, it wasn't my type of humor.There were a few scenes, mostly towards the end, where it was unclear for me if the movie was made for teenagers/adults or little kids. A great part of the movie was certainly not made for little kids, but it seemed like they wanted to make it more attractive to kids with some scenes.The acting and special effects were excellent, as can be expected of Marvel ;)
Especially the acting of the antagonist (played by Christian Bale) was a 10/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now, we'll watch their shows just to stay in tune with the MCU storyline but we won't enjoy it and left puzzled, wondering how they could release the rubbish (which seemed rushed, unfinished).Once again, they should seperate Disney Kids from the MCU timeline, yes by all means let those two timelines intertwine and crossover but don't make the Disney Kids shows the MCU timeline.

It seems like Marvel's conveyor clearly lost and doesn't know which direction and side to go, after they failed everything with multiverse, after they released the worst TV series, that i've ever seenz with the worst dialogues, lore and plot called Loki, and failed amazing sitcom parts of WandaVision mixing it with ungodly MCU lore... Gosh. Latest SM movie was also disgusting. New DS just average. What was the last the can be even called not bad? Black Widow? Eternals? Well, MAY BE! The last good were i'd say Avengers? MCU never had lots of good movies. I'd say Iron Man and Homecoming are the best, solid, last 2 Avengers movies are good(well, i suppose Age of Ultron and Civil War are not that far, but the first Avengers if you look and them now(personally i was in cinema on premiere in 2012, being 13y.o, Avengers entered theatres 1 day before my birthday) have bad dialogues, like they were written by some young schooler and spoils it all) and probably i'd say that i like most of all other Thor 3, though it failed in the end, and couldn't decide either it wants to be an epic action or entertainment. What's about this movie? It just sums it up what we already saw before: whole thing turns into a toothless child cringe ""comedy"". Remember when we had that epic feeling before, like in Avengers, that something big is happening, that heroes are cool? Forget it! All main cast just turned into clown and ""celebrities"" of the show. And you could miss it but, it started back at the Iron Man 3, that idiotic direction and vision. I'm tired of all this feigned fun, pathetic wink to the viewer and circus, yeah this movie feels kinda average but this is just over the top. Oh, wait, what do we have here? The most sickening and infantile ending in history of the cinema? Thor does superstupid thing in the most important moment? And then uses his TALKING SKILLS ? Thor? Yeah, this guy is know for his speeches... And how... Just no comments. Movie ends with a note like ""next time you'll finally get what you wished for"" and you know people, i never dreamed of gachi fight in MCU(sure it will be, after seeing how this movie looks like), it is such a shame. Go to hell, Marvel Studios!P. S. Ah, and be ready, here she is, really bad actress, with creaking voice from Wanda Vision. I gonna ask again, who's daughter she is? Ah, my review to WandaVision, that i tried to publish several times still isn't there? Ok, lets suppose, that i ask about this woman for the first time. Lol, just looked at her page on imdb, she was in Thor 1 and 2, but i noticed her only in WV series. Well, maybe sometimes it is better not to draw attention to oneself...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even my LGBT friends weren't wowed by the movie. People are saying that it contains forced humour and they're right. At times, the humour was nonsense. I love me some humour and really loved Ragnarok but definitely Taika wanted to trigger some people instead of inclusivity. He wasn't making this movie for artistic and story purposes but to fulfill his agenda. Taika made Nebula scream and turned her character into someone who's just one scream away from getting slapped. The movie is only making money because it already has a huge fan base (people like us). Also Valkyrie calling herself king sounded stupid. Korg was extremely boring. Thor was annoying. Bale was so so good but overshadowed by forced humour and making Thor look well like Thor who could take anyone down but he couldn't even kill him himself alone. Natalie was actually really good too. I was impressed. Her actions were spectacular to watch. It was refreshing to see her wield mijolnir and she acted good. I enjoyed her Thor scenes more than Chri's Thor scenes. The children couldn't act besides the kid who plays Heimdal's son. It was a bit cring worthy to see them act. Valkyrie doesn't go to the final showdown with Gorr because she gets stabbed and says to Thor ""well I think I lost my kidney so you'd have to go alone"". Imagine saying this when a god butcher is hell bent on killing every god. This made absolutely no sense at all. A Wasted opportunity.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness was terribly flawed yet Marvel managed to make an even worse film with Love and Thunder. Long gone are Marvel films like Ironman, The Winter Soldier, or The Avengers movies. Every single Marvel movie does not need a joke every 5 minutes or a bunch of goofy humor sprinkled throughout. Love and Thunder had some great visual effects and Christian Bale played a fantastic villain. Beyond that this is a film devoid of heart and is a overly campy and cheesy to the max.

They are now raising statues to the ""real"" Thor. Why? Oh, why? I don't think Russel Crowe got paid as I think he'd refuse to admit to taking money for the ass impersonation he was forced to do. Christian Bale was acting in a completely different movie; one which was serious, full of murder and revenge and sadness. The editing department took scenes from that movie and spliced them into this slapstick.It adds nothing to the MCU timeline.I wanted to say more, but just can't words to describe how bad it was.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Throughout the movie I laughed, it was entertaining. There were no cringe moments. The stellar performances of the whole cast and their chemistry on screen and of course Chris Hemsworth's charisma keeps us hooked to our seats.The demerits:
However, the script does not do justice to Hemsworth's character. Ragnarok made us aware of Thor as a great superhero even without his hammer and Infinity war made him an indispensable part (second only to Iron Man) of the avengers for his courage and rage to fight against the evil supervillians. Sadly LOVE AND THUNDER portrays him as a charismatic dude who gives inspirational talks like the ones on TED talks.He somehow overshadowed by the weapons - Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, Zeus' thunderbolt and his own electricity. It is a missed opportunity to take forward his arc from Endgame. Thor did not reinvent himself and has a long way to go.The movie seems to be made for kids below 12.I sincerely hope the makers comeback with a solid script that deserves Chris Hemsworth as Thor and rest of the characters next time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

L&T came across as overly self knowing; trying too hard to be amusing and laying on the un-funnies in quick succession falling flat.Bale for me was not dark enough and like many ""baddies"" just doesn't work.Some of the better bits were the ""lovey dovey"" bits between Thor and Jane/Mighty Thor.Throughout the whole film I felt as though I was watching an ok made for TV series.We know these characters of old but I didn't really empathise nor was I particularly interested in them.Thankfully I only rented this.

My excitement got doubled when Christian bale was announced as the antagonist marking his comeback in comic book genre after a decade.Coming to positives, the biggest plus point was Christian bale as gorr the god butcher but he got very less screentime. Natalie portman who was absent in ragnarok returns in love and thunder as jane foster and her comeback was meaningful. Some visuals were good.Now the biggest issue i have is that despite having so many jokes and gags none of them made me laugh. Ragnarok had several laugh out loud moments but i didn't even chuckle once at the jokes. Thor character is being made a joke film by film underestimating his might. Taika watiti fails to balance comedy and emotions, hence the final product turns into a mockery instead of parody.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After eagerly awaiting this movie, it didn't take long at all to realize that it would not be able to reach those expectations.I won't rehash many of the disappointments (plenty of others have already done a better job) but the writing & storyline were very weak, the jokes were stale and climax was utterly emotionless.Why Disney and the current phase movie directors & producers feel the need to emasculate the characters is mystifying. They are ruining Thor and have done their best to erase Hulk while replacing every strong male character with female teenagers. It's just sad and shows Disney's disdain for traditional Marvel character that built the franchise.Thor Ragnarok was full of humor and even though I personally found it to be excessive, overall it worked. This is basically a worse reiteration with no compelling storyline. The overarching gay themes are overkill.Thor is such a cool character but he's been relagated to a buffoon lately - although not Hemsworth's fault here. I place this blame squarely on the writers and ""creative"" side which is at this point, more aptly just cringeworthy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ever since they started really getting into connecting the entire marvel cinematic universe, the quality of their individual movies has gone down. It's disappointing because I know they can produce a good movie. They are looking at a complete puzzle and they've stopped focusing on the details of the puzzle pieces. You should be able to watch any marvel movie/ tv show on its own, and it should be enjoyable. But that's not the case anymore. You almost have to watch every single thing they release, and that's less entertaining and more like a full time job.Thor is one of my favorite superheroes in their universe, but this movie was a flop. I was excited when they released the title and commercial because I thought it would be more 70s/80s themed. There was hardly any reference to that theme at all. The humor was geared towards children, yet some of the scenes boarded on too in appropriate for kids. The best part of the movie was the stupid goats and that's not saying much because they were annoying.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Natalie portman too tries to make her part interesting with two type of performances but fails to impress. Coming to visuals, the golden temple sequence, black-white sequence are the only things to cherish.The whole movie suffers from usage of some b grade vfx and cgi effects which are evident in most scenes. The botched up pointless storyline, bad screenplay and much more leads to the downfall of the movie. None of the jokes land, all felt miserable. A lot of potential talented actors have been wasted due to such a lame idea.Whatever, the mid credits looks promising in the MCU future but this one is by far the worst disappointing movie from MCU.Rating:43/100.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I had heard/read reviews about the poor attempts at humor, but overlooked them because I always make up my own mind, and rarely agree with bad reviews from critics, especially about humor. However, I found this movie completely un-funny and I kept waiting for the barely-there plot to develop. I was interested to see how the Jane-as-Thor happened, and I'm not mad at that because although I am not a comic book fan, I do know that it was taken from the comic books as were the goats. I will say that the one thing I enjoyed was when the children got the power of Thor ""for a limited time only.""

This is just my opinion however and I would advise that you should only watch this if you liked JoJo Rabbit.

(Perhaps only Namor (Sub-Mariner) came close in nobility.) Thor was, after all, a literal god, and the son of Odin.Yet this movie insists on playing him as a simple stooge. In fact, the writers aren't satisfied with making us Thor a laughingstock, it paints the entire Marvel pantheon of gods as cruel, bellicose egomaniacs, worthy only of scorn.Marvel has always had humor, it's one of the things it makes Marvel superhero movies fun and make their characters (relatively) believable. But in the past, Marvel has always known how to balance drama, adventure, and occasional humor.This mess is a flat-out comedy, complete with screaming goats.The movie plays more like a parody or send up of a Thor movie, reminiscent of Leslie Nielsen farces such as ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun"".That might be OK for a 30-minute Marvel TV series such as ""She-Hulk"", but when the customer pays full-price for a movie ticket to see a major, $250 million superhero epic, they shouldn't have to put up with some imbecile making fun of the very characters they have come to see.And wacko humor is particularly ill-fitting for Thor, who, as mentioned earlier, was always one of the most sober and dignified of the Marvel superheroes.Will it ever be possible for audiences to take the character seriously again?While a few of the movie's moments are indeed funny (I must admit, the screaming goats were rather hilarious), it was far too often burdened with silly, repetitious gags, such as Thor constantly talking to his new weapon as if it were a jealous woman.And when the movie was forced to resort to the usual dramatic/adventure ending, it flubbed those rare serious moments as well, which mostly came across as illogical and unjustified.They should never let this writer/director get within a hundred yards of another Marvel film. He just doesn't understand the genre.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

emotional weight and end up being just irrelevant. There's no story development to make, theoretically, important scenes feel important.

I'm glad so many people enjoy these films, but I've always had a hard time getting into them. However, I really enjoyed the first Thor and thought the others were meh. But I went to go see this with my girlfriend opening weekend and couldn't believe how terrible it was.First off, in general Marvel has zero idea how to effectively do humor. For example, in all the Avengers movies, nearly every character is written as witty comedians who can bust out a one-liner at the drop of a hat. For Tony Stark, it's believable due to the character and RDJ's natural charisma and cockiness (meant in a good way). However, if everyone is witty - nobody is witty. There are so many scenes in those films where the bulk of the dialogue between various superheroes is nothing but sarcasm and quips. They even do it in scenes that call for a more dramatic approach, which is wildly annoying.I got off track, my apologies. So Love & Thunder continues this trend from the very start, and doesn't let up for the. Entire. Freakin'. Film. Again, moments that should be dramatic are ruined, because Marvel apparently has a quota on how many jokes or quips must be made per minute. The dialogue, in general, is no better.The lone saving grace (but not enough to ever make me watch it again) is, of course, Christian Bale. I found his scenes compelling and emotional, as they should be. However, the constant tonal shifts completely take you out of the movie.I'm genuinely surprised by the rating Love & Thunder has, most likely due to MCU stans.

Where the jokes landed well in Ragnarok which had a nice balance, this time the occasional silliness is relentless for the sake of cheap laughs rather than in the furtherance of the plot or story. And it feels more like the Director having a party and inviting all his friends than a serious attempt to respect the character of Thor and what's gone before parody similar to the ""play within the play"" which also lands flat this time as it is recycled for cheap laughs And in the end, the viewer is left lost at sea as a spectator to all the party guests in an orgy of lame jokes wondering how the whole is so much less than the sum of its parts. Even Korg's narrative can't put all the pieces together in any coherent way. And what's with all those kids (and I don't mean those screaming goats)???

I actually was a bit bored and we saw it on a Sunday afternoon, which may account for only 6 people in the whole theater, though we chose the 3 D version.

Christian Bale is looking like Hellraiser and Matt Damon is in it, but barely and I don't know why he is even there. I couldn't take this movie in one shot, but it gets better focus after the hour and fifteen minute mark. Until then, even Thor's lines are just absolutely ridiculous attempts at humor. I've seen other productions with Taika Waititi's name on it and they were not bad...just maybe don't let him touch another Marvel movie.

Thor was turned into a buffoon, I guess the new formula is to take the manly Thor, turn him into a joke, an insecure moron, and thus elevate Jane Foster as the female Thor. I am all for woman power, but not by making men like idiots.The story was very weak and most jokes where not funny. What a waste. I think comedy should be done tastefully and balanced. This film was done as a parody of itself. Save money and watch it when it streams.. it is a one-time watch film.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I was really excited back when I first heard the news of Christian Bale joining the movie, but just as I expected, he had little screen time and the script focused more on the comedy and throwing jokes at us every second than give us a good story.Like I'm sorry, but did I miss something, or did Gorr only have 3 or 4 brief scenes before his first actual encounter and conversation with Thor? Like it felt like he had even less screen time than Hela. He had only 3 minutes of ""origin story"" and ""characterization"" in the beginning and that's it, he doesn't come back until nearly 40 or 50 minutes into the film. Really really hate it and am disappointed in how they did not give the minimum characterization to this villain, or even to Jane for that matter. It felt like they deleted at least 10 minutes of Gorr origin from the beginning. The whole movie felt like it was a recap of a 3 hour or at least a 2:30-hour movie. Like it doesn't feel like a movie at all, and it's all because of the mediocre script.It's the same with the Jane situation; we're just thrown into her story and it doesn't get the development it deserves because of the short runtime and there's just a tiny little bit of emotional attachment to this character and not the amount of attachment the movie wants you to have. And it's because of the mediocrely written scrip, it's because of the short runtime that has lots of times for Thor goofing around with the Guardians and joking, and not establishing its villain and giving him proper screen time and giving him and Jane good characterization.The whole script is written so weirdly that it feels like it's only included the plot points but not the establishing scenes and the essential ""let the scene breathe"" scenes. The whole events of the movie happen so fast and they are joined together in a way that doesn't feel natural or like an actual movie, it doesn't feel like this movie has 3 acts, it feels like 1 or maybe 2 acts. And I keep saying ""feel"" because it's my opinion after all and I don't want to present them as objective facts.I guess some of the scenes and jokes are funny, but it's so overdone that looks like the movie was written by a teenager for 5-year-olds. Of course, I knew that the movie was gonna have lots of comedy because Ragnarok made Thor popular again and they found their golden formula with Thor, but I didn't expect them to turn Thor into a goofball. What is it with their obsession to turn every character into a Star-Lord and a Guardians of the Galaxy character? Thor was perfect in Infinity War, the Russo brothers knew what they were doing and they knew how to balance comedy and serious, and that's why all of their movies are 8/10 or more for me and that's the reason their movies are the top fan favorites among all the MCU movies.When you think about it, the story and plot structure of this movie is not too dissimilar from Ragnarok, but for some reason, that movie that was also 2 hours, felt like an actual movie, but this one doesn't. So maybe they should've kept the writers?It's funny that Taika said they have the best villain in the MCU, while I feel like even Malekith that I don't remember anything about, had better characterization and origin?! Like after watching the movie, all I can say about the character of Gorr, is that ""he had a daughter and now he doesn't"" and that's it. And this was supposed to be ""the best villain ever""?! Even the most forgettable villain from MCU, Ghost from Ant-Man 2 had better characterization time and origin. Like I actually don't understand how they thought showing Gorr for 2 minutes at the beginning, without even showing what actually happened to him and his daughter and giving us a proper characterization, and then making him show up again after 40 minutes is good writing and good characterization and is gonna make the audience care. Baffling. I don't understand why they are deleting so much from the movies and making them only 2 hours that feel rushed and that they need more time for characterization and developing the plots and the characters, when they literally made the best-selling movie of all time with Endgame that was 3 hours? Even Spider-Man No Way Home had more than 2 hours of run time. So why not give Doctor Strange and Thor more time so they don't feel rushed!? At least Doctor Strange 2 still felt like an actual movie with a three-act structure and knew not everything has to be a joke. (Although arguably some of the most cringiest jokes of MCU were from that movie)Another thing I'm disappointed in is Michael Giacchino's music for this movie. I may have not expected much from this movie, but I had really high hopes for the music. And don't get me wrong, the piece is an absolute banger of a theme, but I expected at least 2 or 3 more themes? They uploaded the theme before the movie came out and I thought it was good and that there was also gonna be more in the movie, but it wasn't? It's just 2 or 3 other variations of the same theme? Really? That's it? Just one theme for the whole movie which occasionally is played as a sad and somber variation? I know that Doctor Strange 2016's themes were also mostly variations of the main theme, but they sounded different enough and had more themes. But this one only has one theme and that's disappointing to me. I wasn't really a fan of his Batman theme too, felt too repetitive and nothing iconic or memorable. Even his No Way Home had like some good different themes. I still wish he composed for every one of these movies (not Black Panther of course) andSo pretty much every aspect of this movie is a disappointment.What these movies need is more time spent in pre-production and I'm talking about pre-vis for the action scenes, I'm talking about more time spent in the writing room improving the scripts. How can this multi-billion dollar company not find good writers? Maybe bring back Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely? Because they seem to actually know how to write competent scripts that might have cringey jokes in them too, but have serious moments too and don't turn everything into a joke and rush things by cramming everything into 2 hours.Also, have we not gotten tired of villains summoning minions and demon creatures to fight for them and they just sit far behind and watch?! Even Hela had a decent fight scene with the Asgardian army in Ragnarok and that me feel like at least they will do a good fight scene with Gorr, but they didn't?! Like do they not realize how boring it is to introduce an already underdeveloped villain with bad characterization and laughably bad origin scene, only to have him sit somewhere and just summon demons to fight for him? Like imagine if instead of Captain America jumping into the battle with his shield and fighting the bad guys, he just stood there and sent some random guys to fight for him. Or instead of Thor going around with his hammer and defeating enemies, he just summoned some kids to fight for him... oh! That was actually one of the coolest scenes though, but you get what I mean.My disappointment with Gorr is immeasurable and my day is ruined.In conclusion, Gorr had a horrible origin story (his origin is ok, but not presented well. Might as well just write his origin on a black screen and not show anything) and worse characterization. He made decisions so quickly and changed his motivation and his mind so quickly and so many times like a teenager who doesn't know what he wants. Jane had a bad characterization too because the short run time didn't allow her story to become more developed and they could've presented her story in a better way. The action scenes are nice but what is action good for when you have a really bad script? Thor is turned into a more goofball and an idiot than he was before. The music is nice but only has one theme. Gorr has really awful screen time. The movie doesn't feel like an actual film. There are not 3 acts here, it feels like one act. Too short and rushed and nothing gets developed in this short run time. They have time for jokes but not actual character and plot development and decent characterization.Thoroughly disappointed in the villain and everything else, and I would've ignored some of the other problems if Gorr was actually well-written, had a good origin story of more than 5 minutes, actual good characterization and development, and much, much more screen time than this.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Don't subject yourself to it...","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

They had style, great story telling, Marvel cinematic magic, awesome humor and soundtracks, and believable round characters.Thor: Ragnarok was an awesome movie.... although a far cry from Scandinavian myth - still.... Taika Waititi did a great job of telling the story - with a lot of awesome humor.Still...... Thor: Love and Thunder was a bust. Very little cinematic greatness at all. This movie was a black mark on every 'A' actor in the movie. The story was corny, cheesy, sacrilegious, disgusting, and worst of all....... not remotely entertaining. Very poor quality in every way.This movie does whatever it can to promote Disney's newfound socio-sexual politics - and to foist them on every child that is subjected to this wanton drivel. Clearly, the only purpose of this movie is to make Disney money - while destroying ancient myth, basic human values, the very concept of faith and trust, any type of traditional societal norms, and sadly....... classic storytelling. Thankfully, I didn't pay one red cent to watch this movie, and Disney made zero money from my viewing.May this movie be the beginning of the end for all new Disney/Marvel ventures - since they have willfully divorced themselves from the values and beliefs of their core audience (and everything their core audience stands for).","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's devoid of any actual depth. So many bad scenes, it's like some child with zero focus wrote this movie, it's really that bad. The movie is another vehicle to push forth the eventual team up that Marvel loves to do, but lately, they've been firing blanks with their movies.Shang-Chi felt forced and had so many awful scenes, but because it's the first Asian lead super-hero movie out right now, it's hard for people to actually call it a bad movie, out of fear they'll be called racist. I'm a POC and I will tell you straight up, that movie is awful too.So is Eternals, Dr Strange 2, and even Spider-Man's last outing is less about Spider-Man and again, about him being the big sad about Stark and later, another loved one. Marvel just can't help themselves with their movies lately, it's become very little about actual character development and more about the jokes and just churning these movies out. They started quite well, but near the end of the whole End Game saga, you could see that they were running out of good ideas. I can see why James Gunn is also leaving after the last GOTG movie, at least with DC he has options, Marvel really only wants the same cookie cutter crap to push the next Avengers style of movie.I can't help but laugh at the Marvel's Suicide Squad type of team up that was just announced...Marvel, do better.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The director (and the writers) should take as example the humour from guardian galaxy that can be appreciated at every age.

Either that, or this is a case of 'too many cooks' as this film was a weird mess.In terms of visuals, it was quite a stunning film. I didn't find it particularly cohesive in terms of visuals. There was a touch of bitter irony in the hyper-saturated nature of it all. It felt like a tired fever dream.There was too much Korg. Enough said there.Probably a little heavy on the humour too in order to mask the deficiencies in plot, substance, character development, etc.There was something about this film that was too cynical for my liking.

Look, I do appreciate what you guys have done with Thor or Dr. Jane Foster, or even with Valkyrie, but what you have done to Gorr is inexcusable, I will not forgive.Moreover, I saw many others had conveyed their disapproval regarding the tonality of the film which did lean more towards a lighter, less gritty route and I too happen to have the same complaint.

It does have some good gags and the budget is high enough so that it largely looks big and flashy. I did laugh a few times and no scene was lazily made. But this is a waste of time.I think the scene where they put in 2 gay relationships via the dialogue kinda says it all. It's where I knew the movie wasn't going anywhere. You can usually spot a bad movie by what it tries to be. Modern Marvel movies can be great if they focus on the comic universe and a clear story. But today most of them are just given to a director or producer. So you may get someone who wants to recreate a proper and great old story in the universe like Thor: Ragnarok that was a remake of a great cartoon. The first Thor movie was a start of the story overall. A small story set among real people. This instead if a mess. The director of Thor: Ragnarok now tried to make it into a full on progressive comedy so a lot of the powerful relationships and deep story turn into gags. Some gags do work, but it's just scene after scene being a gag. A ton of flashbacks and small scenes. With the story itself becoming a gag. It reminds me of the Ghostbusters reboot where they took the universe and made it into a giant joke focused on progressive values and feminism. I didn't hate the reboot, but I can see why fans of that universe hated it. So as I'm a fan of the Marvel universe I really dislike what they are doing to it here. This movie focused on female Thor and overall progressive values instead of trying to expand the Thor universe. It's catering to the ignorant masses who buy movie tickets because the movie is progressive. The female Thor even calls herself Thor for some reason. What a mess. At least give her another uniform and another name. Thor is the name of a male god in the Norse mythology. There are PLENTY of female names you could use here. Just have the same character with another name. They do next to nothing with her anyhow so what's the point? It's like the last James Bond movie where they made agent 007 into a Black woman. Why? Call her 008 and that's just fine. Don't lazily reuse an old character to score some cheap points.The movie also fails as much here is created from ground up. There are new gods, a new significant secret key, even the old characters are now comedic so their old personalities are gone. A lot of the story is now gags and progressive scenes with the old universe taking a backseat. Thor: The Dark World (2013) being much better than this movie says it all as it was universally disliked. Even though I didn't hate everything about this movie there are so many pointless cringe scenes that it definitely takes away from the universe. I have no need to watch more Thor movies and I regret watching this one.By the way. Some of the kid actors are horrible. There is a Black kid who is given a female name for some gag reason. He was horrible. Absolutely a mess in every scene. Which is weird as the director made the fairly fun Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) with a kid actor and has many other movies with boy actors. So what went wrong? I think everyone was just being lazy here.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The mcu has some big holes to fill because they have butchered Thor,but still can't wait for Thor 5. O yeah,and the only good thing about this movie was Christian Bale. It was a total waist of his talent as an actor. I could say the same about Chris Hemsworth and Nately Portman. Director,Taiki watiti(Sorry if I spelled that wrong) is great but this movie is a hit and miss.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Weak story, weak characters, bad acting by mouth breather Christian Bale as usual. I gave it two stars because twice it made me chuckle. The rest the time I thought I was watching a children's movie. It's like Marvel ran out of stuff to make movies about so they just decided to make this one on the fly, figuring out the plot as it went along. It was ridiculously dumb and I would not recommend it unless you're under the age of 12 years old. This movie will go on the list of movies not to be seen ever again.

This film has craped itself off everything that made the previous movies great.The storyline is incoherent with childish introduction of characters(aside the introduction of Gorr - somewhat decent), amateur turn of events and incredibly boring comedy scenes, achieving nothing more than silent movie theaters, repleted with awkwardness.The degeneracy of the film is more noticeable when you realize the potential it had. Thor has just redeemed for his loved ones and has came back in his full glory, whilst a lone creature somewhere in the galaxy has no one. Gorr was a great villain to whirl the movie around, yet destroyed by a silly and goofy plot, that reminds me of a 10-minute-long cartoon.The only think keeping this move from a total disaster is the CGI(even though at some parts it looked like a home made movie), the make-up, the costumes, and the performance of our beloved actors. (Primary because of the 200 million dollar budget).This movie is worth watching only if you want to feel the disappointment and the melancholy of the wasted potential in your spleen.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They made all characters goofy as if they were written by kids, I wanna be specific but I'm trying to avoid spoilers, so I'll just cover the first layer.Jane has a touching story but it wasn't enough. I mean come on, we just have to believe that she's worthy without any solid backstory?Christian Bale was terrific as Gorr but his transformation was super fast and his purpose was pretty much meh. Such a waste, unfortunately, given that Gorr was scary and could be a much better villain if handed a well written script.Watching this feels like watching a 2 hour comedy skit, not a good one, but more of a forced comedy, because they tried so hard to be funny. I get that you want this movie to be acceptable for everyone, but don't embarrass Zeus as if he's a silly gullible man-child like that.Thor himself was also a joke. Granted, his skills in battlefield are second to none, I mean he could easily defeated an entire army if he wanted, but they made this character a bit too dumb and once again, silly.But then again, maybe this movie is just not for me. It's not my cup of tea. What do I know about movies? I'm just a random dude on the internet who has zero knowledges in cinema.

Thor was reduced to a hero without a braincell a far cry from the Thor was saw in Thor 1,2 and Infinity War. 80% of the jokes were cringe and what's worse, they were repeated over and over so you couldn't get away from them. Screaming goats? A love triangle between weapons? Yep!Christian Bale and The Mighty Thor (Lady) were wasted and could have been used much better as were all the other characters who came across as jokes. There is no point going into the story.The slippery slope that led to the demise of Thor started with Thor Ragnarock (The best rated and best selling Thor), it was elevated in Endgame but we could just about deal with it, but now they've come full circle and taken off all the restraints with Thor Love and Thunder.A complete character assassination and another Phase 4 Flop!","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ragnarok was a nice change to a character that was serious all the time but in this movie the character was ruined for me. Crucial moments in the movie with people on the verge of death are turned into a laugh and characters from older movies act in ways they never would have. For the beginning of the film it felt like watching a Shakespeare play with everyone just over acting every scene trying to make a laugh. Most of the time Thor is the biggest idiot with even children pointing it out. Christian Bale was the best part of the movie but his amount of screen time was not that much.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Expected much more from this movie. Thanks to this director, Thor's character has remained a buffoon, he constantly tries to make jokes out of context and the image of an epic superhero has faded. The script doesn't make much sense and it seems like it was written by a child. At times when it should be serious, they put some comedy out of place to force you to laugh. It's good to laugh from time to time but when dramatic scenes come they don't captivate you as they should be and you even hope they're going to throw another silly comedy at you. I hope that in the next movie it will be another writer, this character deserves a better story.So much talent on the set is wasted. Actors like Christian Bale for example, the dark and gloomy of the character of Gorr you do not finish knowing him thanks to more silly scenes of laughter from Thor. Jane Foster never really got deep into her character. The love encounter between Thor and Jane Foster is extremely ephemeral, they could not delve deeper into these characters because the director preferred to shoot more silly comedy scenes.Visually is stunning, but definitely not the best Marvel movie.Oh and I forgot if the goofy comedy wasn't enough the goats steal the show.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Everything looks mailed in with this effort. The gags often go on too long and overused, even scenes that are supposed to be emotional are not. I never thought the tone was right, it never feels like a MCU film. Yeah, they have some of the actors and the costumes, but something isn't right. Some of the CGI doesn't look right either. Several actors look miscast or just putting on a terrible performance.At 2 hours (short for MCU), I felt like I was bored often and not really interested in what happens. The climax is ridiculous in a movie full of ridiculousness. Christian Bale was just okay as the God butcher, but I feel like he could have been much better in a movie that wasn't set as a comedy. Natalie Portman is alright and adds some humor. Hemsworth is the bright spot, but it's just too hard to steer this vessel.There are also plenty of opportunities for Disney and Marvel to make characters gay and allow them to reproduce with two dads. There are also discussions of orgies and Hemsworth's rear. I understand it's PG13, but you've gotta screen these before bringing the kids (they should just stick with everything pre-phase 4 anyway)The end credits are not satisfying. The movie on the surface doesn't set up much for the future either or carry the story along in the MCU. Overall, this is another disappointing movie in Phase 4 of the MCU. I think we are getting to the point where it might be best to wait for Disney Plus to see these mediocre efforts, if you watch them at all.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have read some negative reviews about it but we have seen almost all the Marvel movies and usually love them so I caved and said yes. First of all, this movie is not any good. The parts that should be serious are not taken seriously at all, which makes the movie feel very odd. There are so many random parts in the movie that just don't seem to make sense or go together. The negative reviews that you read below pretty much spell it out for you. On top of all of that there are multiple mentions of things that are probably not best for kids, some of which are sexual (orientation, orgies, references to making babies, describing love as a ""sh-tty feeling"" multiple times, etc...). The whole film is bad and laughable except for the dark parts which were really disturbing for my daughter. I also felt like the movie is pretty anti-god in several of the scenes- yes, it is supposed to be in the context of Greek mythology, but it felt like more than that. There are also mentions of serious sickness, that I don't feel like the took seriously enough, making light of it in some key moments. I understand that they wanted to infuse some humor, which I'm normally totally on board for, but this just wasn't done well and I wish we hadn't gone to see it. Even if my kids (who are older) wouldn't have been with me, I wouldn't have enjoyed it. Sad, because it could have been much better with the actors they had.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

He's an immature child trapped in an adult body who likes to break great things that others made and/or love, then point, mock, and laugh. Some would call that a bully. Taika thinks his audience is a giant joke, and when given full control of a franchise that millions of folks love, he actually didn't know what to do, got frightened at the responsibility, so he turned it into a giant parody to hide his own insecurity.Christian Bale was wasted on this film, the Gore the God-Butcher arc was supplanted by other characters' stories that HAD TO be cast in this film because Disney has an agenda to force on the public (plus, Taika saw it as an opportunity to *cough* ""get involved"" with a certain cast member in his film-much like Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles did during the production of Don't Worry, Darling), and the jokes grew old very fast, destroying the consistency of tone with Gore's arc.

I am a huge huge marvel fan, to the extent that I actually enjoyed Multiverse of madness. But then this movie follows the same trend like Ms Marvel, She Hulk etc where there is no proper background on why a hero is a hero.To give a perspective, we have all seen Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk etc where we saw all heros got power, struggled to control their acts and finally overcame it thereby becoming the heros as we know them.Now apparently all these ladies (Kamala in Ms Marvel, she Hulk and now Jane foster) are getting super powers left right and centre and rocking it without any efforts as if all predecessors were idiots. Maybe MCU are trying to be very inclusive or HR department is working a lot on idea department I don't know. I am thoroughly disappointed with the movie.I loved Ragnarok and had a similar expectations but man what a joyless ride this was, no reason why Jane is thor, no reasons how Gorr got powers, no reason why Mjolnir wont come to thor and Christian bale is so wasted. Things were happening for no reasons.Ahh, so disappointed by everyone.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was so excited that Natalie Portman was going to play Thor in this too and they did her dirty with the writing. Also her blonde wig was bad. All in all I don't know who is giving this film ten out of ten. The dialogue felt like it was for 6 year olds but then there were scenes I felt would be a little frightening for such young kids. Don't know who the target audience was but it wasn't me. The goats were funny and Korg is a good character but other than that huge waste of time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And yet i hardly remember when was the last time i actually enjoyed Marvel movie. And ""Love and Thunder"" did not change that unfortunately - this is simply a bad movie.First, its simply boring, uninvolving and doesn't make any sense. Like humor for example is so dumb that ""Dumb & Dumber"" feels like ""Godfather"" in comparison. And yet at the same time there are running themes about death of children and cancer of last stage. I mean what? The villain played by Christian Bale was boring as well - its not the fault of the great actor and besides of interesting make up it was nothing to see there. And for the story - i mean what story?Overall, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is a highly dissapointing and just plaid bad movie. Its highly all over the place and one of those movies were watching it you just feel that no one in from of the camera did not care. This goes as well for the director.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The most it does is Thor's costume and some soundtrack. Other than that, ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is just another empty movie. No matter how epic and colorful it tries to be, nothing will cover up its empty core.Taika Waititi is a great director, most of his movies are entertaining and touching. However, the humor in this movie is simply too immature and dry. The movie doesn't seem to take itself seriously. The plot is rather loose, but the main problem is still the humor. There are seemingly serious moments in the movie that are interrupted by humor right in the middle. The movie would be hogging for a dark tone for a second then immediately switch to an unfunny joke. The actors are trying too hard to be funny rather than in-character. Some visual effect shots look ugly because of the color palette. Thor and Janes's reunion is rather light-hearted and lacks any impact. All characters lose their complexity and they just turn into plot devices. As mentioned, it feels like the movie just doesn't care about anything.The only positive thing is Christian Bale's Gorr. Sometimes, Bale is trying to hard to be silly and funny, but his performance is mostly menacing. The opening is one of the best scenes in the entire movie. Bale certainly cares about his role and actually tries to be the menacing God Butcher. Unfortunately, that character is another victim of bad humor. But Bale always does his best with the material he's been given. Other than that, nothing worked in the movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie unfortunately just got so much wrong that the previous Thor film got right. Everything in this film is a joke and an over the top joke at that. They have made a total fool of the character and wasted his arc. There is no character development here which has always been the greatest strength of Marvel movies the way they make us care. Bale is absolutely fantastic yet absolutely wasted along with the Guardians and Valkyrie. Due to the overly comedic side of things the serious moments don't hit at all. People talk of The Dark World as the low point of Thor but this is the film where they have lost the character. I just hope that they realise this and get someone else behind the wheel before the next instalment and we actually get a hero we can care about and get behind again. I'm giving it five because it isn't a bad film and I did enjoy it but it was such a wasted opportunity. Phase four is hitting serious problems...maybe the wheels are starting to fall off. The absolute smugness of Love and Thunder is the sort of thing that can almost signpost the beginning of the end, arrogant and incredibly self indulgent and the quietest applause of a full opening night Marvel movie yet. Eternals doesn't count because due to Covid the place was still pretty empty. Please Marvel don't make the same mistake twice!!!","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

Korg does a lot of narrating in this movie and is pretty much never serious, even when narrating things that should have weight and seriousness to them.Christian Bale does a great job acting in this. However he doesn't get enough screen time to really do his thing. Everytime he's on the screen he is mesmerizing. The problem is, they don't use him enough, which is an absolute shame. And he actually brings some seriousness and weight to the film, which the film really needs to balance it out. And finding out that many of his scenes got cut in favor of keeping this movie a comedy, is an absolute shame. Because his presence is definitely needed more in the film.Thor is treated like a dumb character. He's bumbling and totally unaware of many things. I will say this though, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman actually have good chemistry in this film and Natalie does a great job playing Mighty Thor.The goats are a little much, funny the first or second time they scream, and then just obnoxious after that.There is a good actually serious scene that was moving later on in the film but I won't get into it cause spoilers. But let's just say, the movie needed more moments like that.I give it a 5 because of Natalie Portman and Christian Bale's performances actually are good and add points to the rating. The movie loses a lot of points because I never felt the good guys were in danger at any point, because they themselves never took anything serious at all. Even though the villain had the potential to be menacing and make them feel terror.Jane's arc was good in this. They really should have just made two movies. One centered on Jane's arc and one centered on Gorr's arc. They chose Jane's arc over Gorr's arc and both stories deserve to be told properly. Just felt like two different movies squished together and it didn't really work. The film isn't too long either, so I would have been happier to see 10-15 minutes of more Gorr scenes and development to really flesh him out.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Thor: Love and Thunder is a bad joke of a movie. The movie is good when it takes i itself seriously and unfortunately those moments are rare as hell!The few action sequents it has are great but are not so many, the jokes are utterly terrible and for 2 years old kids, at some point i was ashamed for their jokes to be honest. They also presented Russel Crowe as Mighty Zeus, the very king and most powerful of them gods.. and how was presented? In a very, very terrible way, terrible accent and terrible jokes along with it. Korg screen time is way to long and becomes annoying really fast.The best thing about the movie was Christian Bale and the post credit scene and that's pretty much it. I think this is the worst MCU movie and the lowest i rated so far.Please Taika stay away from Marvel and Thor!

This is because the movie feels like a collection of scenes glued in some way one with each other, without a proper structure behind and so the plot is non-existent. Indeed when the halftime break occurred I controlled the time because very few events happened and I couldn't believe it was already half of the movie. Also the jokes are bad and the entire audience had like 8-10 laugh over the whole duration. Indeed the peak of the entertainment of the night was one guy who fell asleep snorling. Also the character development, which was a big part of Ragnarok, is nowhere to be found here. Thor: Love and Thunder is not a putrid movie at all and someone will surely enjoy it, but to me it felt like throwing two hours of life in the vacuum because of how empty it feels.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I've no problem with the use of humour, and the effortless charm of Ragnarok was one of its strengths.I think that per budget, this may be one of the worst written films I've ever seen. It tries so hard to recapture the humour of Ragnarok and instead just makes it ridiculous and worst of all, boring.I've no idea how they managed to waste so many good actors. The MCU has been so good over the years and I guess complacency has set in, big style. I wish I could unsee this but heyho.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Love and Thunder, however, felt like a children's movie with some decent Marvel crowbarred in. The decent is Christian Bale as Gorr, who, as ever, puts in an outstanding and convincing performance. But his dark brilliance screen time is limited, with unfunny screaming mammals and cringeworthy improvised comedy from the other cast favoured instead it seems. Also needless silly references to internet memes that won't stand the test of time. The movie also features many child actors and sadly I didn't find any put in a convincing performance, they rather 'broke' the magic of the movie - it all felt very amateur. Overall, half the movie is trash, half is great. I'd love to see a Director cut of this - remove all the silliness, keep the good humour and add more Bale (give him some more backstory!). Marvel movies have generally been losing their way since End Game and sadly this Thor is another example.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its an insult and a slap in the face to all the fans that stuck to them for so many years.I were rich, like Bezos or Elon rich, i'd buy this garbage Marvel turned into and turn it into a R rated festival for the fans where there's no Holywood cinematic prostitution, a place where heroes are true to their identity and the way they were created to be.Sad.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had my doubts early on but by the midway point it was full eye-rolls and willing it to end. The humour rarely works and just ends up feeling awkward, while conversely the serious themes are horribly misplaced. Christian Bale's villain was all over the place and by far the weakest in any Marvel film, with his motivations feeling glib from the worryingly poor prologue - honestly, what on earth was going on with that rubbish god-guy and the effects? Glib is a good word for the whole thing, really, with an end product that looks like zero rigour or care was applied to any aspect; a that'll do because it made Taika laugh approach.I was originally glad to see a blockbuster coming in at 2 hours but this felt longer than The Batman. Basically a piece of trash cobbled together with nothing working at all. It feels like Marvel is in decline since Endgame. Maybe they should change tack, and definitely go back to fewer films per year. Please.The 3 stars are for a couple of chuckles and Natalie Portman looking devastating in a blonde wig.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I love Christian Bale but I hate the terrible Directing & writing, plus the main character arcs make no sense & devalue them all.Disney for some reason give people with really ""no proof of the talent required"" the power to write & direct a Marvel movie, in this case the power was given to Taika Waititi who ultimately does a dreadful job writing & also directing this film. With the big budget & a great cast of actors this film had real Marvel potential to be a great film but Taika Waititi was a poor choice.If Taika Waititi had wrote for a proper Marvel comic & came up with this exact story Stan Lee would have told him this was simply not good enough for Marvel, as the script does not make sense & in parts becomes too ""silly"".Now I'm all for a little bit of surprising ""humour"" in Marvel films as you would get in comics, but at it's core this is still supposed to be a serious universe that has serious consequences if the heroes fail & you have to feel that.By the end of the film the script & directing by Taika Waititi feels more like a parody of real quality Marvel films ( & comics ) which I find disrespectful.Now the film still gets 5 stars from me because parts of the film are really good & this is because of the acting ability of many of the excellent cast, for example Christian Bale is a truly magnificent actor whose overall performance in this film really is top notch ( I really feel sorry for him as a lot of the film script by Taika Waititi really ruined the film ) as Gorr is a great character.Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good though the script seems to try to make him look more & more of an idiot ( as his character arc is declining here ).Some of the scenes Chris Hemsworth has to do are so poorly conceived & become so ridiculous I really feel sorry for him as we know he is a great Thor.Natalie Portman & Tessa Thompson both do OK however I feel the script they had to work with really did not help them to really show off their acting talent.Russell Crowe was not very good ( seems he does not understand that Super Hero films are meant to be taken serious ) as he acted in it like it was some kind of parody ( like he was supposed to be a parody or in a bad ""panto"" ).This was a very bad casting choice & when he arrives in the film it really does start to go more & more downhill from there ( Taika Waititi to blame mostly ).By the end of the film it starts to insult everyone's intelligence & becomes unbelievably farcical, as I certainly won't be adding this film to my Marvel collection as the appearance of the guardians of the galaxy at the start of the film actually gave the film a decent start but the script of Taika Waititi killed it.Disney have killed the Marvel movie franchise from being the juggernaut it was as simply they don't respect the Marvel universe enough to ensure it's image is protected instead they give directors with no previous big action super hero movie total control & just sit back as they destroy years of hard work that previous actors & quality writers & directors put in to build the Marvel Universe ( films such as Iron Man, Captain America & yes Thor ).The original film Thor (2011) with Director Kenneth Branagh & Writers
Ashley Miller(screenplay), Zack Stentz(screenplay), Don Payne(screenplay) must all watch this film & say to themselves what has Taika Waititi done & you have to ask what has co-script writer Jennifer Kaytin Robinson done?Jennifer Kaytin Robinson must take at least 30% of the blame though again if you look at her resume clearly she like Taika Waititi ( 70% to blame ) was no way qualified to write the script for this film, however their only defence is that if so,done offered you a boat load of money to do something such as write a film script why would you turn that down as the really idiots here are Disney.The Marvel films could have made billions for many many years but with these dreadful films killing off fans of the Marvel film series how much has Disney cost them themselves long term. Most likely they have lost Billions.So ultimately I can't really blame Taika Waititi & Jennifer Kaytin Robinson for taking Disney's money but if I see either of those 2 names attached to any future film or TV series I most likely will choose to give that film/show a miss.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Trying so hard to be funny and desperatly pushing for memes and running jokes which are a nuisance even before the repition. And all I could hear in that noise is ""Hello fellow kids...""There's a little storytelling device that's called 'Show don't tell', perhaps Disney/Marvel should use it sometimes on one of their villains. It became a cliche even in the phase one that their villains are cartoonishly underdeveloped. That they still haven't figured this out after Thanos is truly baffling.The soundtrack is as try-hard as the comedy, so there's no silver lining here unfortunately.At this point it would be more interesting to list the drugs that has been consumed by the director and producers, because they must have clearly been very satisfied with the salad of a story.m they delivered.It's a shame because the last Marvel movie by Raimi (Doctor Strange 2) had hints of actual good storytelling, if they just didn't have so many cooks in the kitchen to mess it all up.This feels like ten steps backwards compared to their last effort.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

How we have gone from Winter soldier, End Game, Civil War etc to this is a sheer embarrassment.The ""comedy"" is all forced, misplaced and desperate. Taika's constant narration is narcissistic and they spent so much time on poor comedy, even squeezing in 6 year screaming goat vines as a repetitive joke, over any real substance the entire film feels empty.I have no idea who this film is aimed at, because it misses every mark, neither funny enough to be an outright comedy, not exciting or riveting enough to be an action film, and so far removed from the source material it definitely can't be a comic book adaption, so what is it? If you like Guns and Roses, you might like the over use of their music for weight, but other than that, I take nothing from this shambles other than the mild annoyance of wasting 2 hours of my life.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Here the villain looks menacing in terms of make-up and/or prosthetics but in terms of acting like a villain, the character is a joke.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However it feels somewhat flat.There are decent moments of action and good chemistry but it feels a little too comical and trying too hard to be funny. Whereas Ragnarok was naturally funny and engaging all the way through. The tone of this film should have been a little more serious, where it seems like it was a copy of Ragnarok.Christian Bale delivers a great villain but feels a little wasted. The other leads are still great but considering this is the fourth film, the freshness is gone. The brief scenes of the Guardians of the Galaxy was a welcome sight but it was very brief that by the end of the film, we completely forget about it and it felt almost pointless.Thor Ragnarok isn't terrible but it isn't groundbreaking and somewhat of a letdown considering the hype it had.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth is really talented and can be very funny, but there should be a line somewhere for when all your superhero movies are infested with jokes. Marvel made this mistake years ago and they wanted to make each main character into a comedian.That could work with a few characters, but it gets exhausting when everyone is. Thor has the potential few other Marvel characters have to tell stories away from earth. Kenneth Brannagh had a really good approach to it, despite the movie having multiple shortcomings.What Taika has done with this is not only showing that comedy will only take you so far, but also the exhaustion and overproduction that Disney and Marvel are doing.Let your franchises breath. Let us miss it. Spend some time writing something worth the characters. Cause even having a performance as good as Bale, or Portman did and having as many cameos as this movie had can't save the tremendously boring and childish humor this train wreck had.Do better Marvel. I blame you, not them.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Two stars because it made me chuckle a few times, but the constant set up from one joke to another got tiresome. The whole thing was like a run-on sentence with sloppy scene shifts and jarring changes in pace and tone. I imagine I missed half the jokes just because I am not into the MCU. The climax made me wonder why that wasn't the go to answer in the first place and a lot of the lead up to it was premised on constantly shifting rules that made no sense outside the scene they were in and were changed for a joke or on a whim in the next scene. It could be argued that it was meant to be more of an ""emotional"" journey, but even then smacks you in the face with inconsistency and unbelievable character reactions.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

For the first time in however long i actually couldn't finish it. I got about 1hr 13mins into the movie (and this is whilst i skipped a scene or two).The story seemed fine in terms of the God Butcher character that Bale played, but the rest was crap.The comedy was not at all comedic and the acting in general was fine but not enough to save the movie. You know a movie isn't great when even Christian Bale's acting isn't very good in particular.Overall this movie is a perfect example of how Marvel have fallen in terms of movie quality over the past few years. The one and only reason i am not giving it a 1/10 is because the CGI was good and the design of certain characters was fine.Before i end this i must stress how poor the characters are developed in this movie. The Butcher character in his first scene seems slightly interesting but quickly becomes boring. Zeus (a character that should be awesome to see in Marvel) is utterly abysmal. His character is boring and not serious at all. One of the worst (if not the worst) MCU characters to date.I personally believe that Taika Waititi is the most overrated director in all of cinema. None of the movies i have seen from this to Jojo Rabbit have been even average and he gets praised to the high heavens. He was a better actor in Free Guy than director and even in that movie he isn't particularly great. I'm gobsmacked.This movie is poor in 90% of the categories you can rank a movie in, 2/10.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Well, wow. Since early 90's cartoons. I've enjoyed their comics and works for a long time now.This is by far one of the weaker, bottom-of-the-barrel offerings movie-wise.Everything about this feels like tasteless pulp that's been mashed together. So far Thor 2 was, by comparison, the most weakest offering from the Thor chain specifically but oof, this one makes it look like a brilliant entry by comparison.I wanted to love the notion of the female representation in this film, and some of the concepts weren't terrible but everything else pressed in-between was just sad.It was just barely cohesive that it somehow functioned as a movie but failed in every other aspect. It was neither exciting, nor interesting enough to work for the title it was granted.It felt more like an attempt to materialize a steamy fanfic than actually pull together good story, character development and universal consistency for the final product to seem sane.What has happened to Marvel in phase 4? You started to derail before this point but... Boy, this is bewildering.I hope you guys bounce back, but, I worry you somehow will continue to make some questionable decisions that will impede in this effort.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I enjoyed this one...much less thoroughly. This movie tried even harder to be funny than its predecessor, but trying is not the same as succeeding. It felt like a movie made mostly of tongue in cheek montages that occasionally remembered to add plot and stakes. Very occasionally. Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy necessary? Why did we need whole sub-plots about Asgard theatre troops? Why did Russell Crowe have to go THAT far with his whole schtick? Almost everyone other than Thor, Jane, and Gorr seemed like ironic cardboard cutout scenery. I appreciate the sense of humor, but it's not enough on its own.

Like Lucifer, the Thor movies started with a more serious tone and adopted comedy in favor of suspense and drama over time. I can only guess why this happened in Thor: Love and Thunder. My guess is that the performers and crew had way too much fun making the film and forgot about the audience.My suspicions with Lucifer were that the cast and crew got very familiar with one another, and the show was more of an expression of their camaraderie rather than a show produced to entertain an audience. I suspect the same with Thor: Love and Thunder. Further evidence of this is the underdevelopment of Christian Bale's Gorr. He's the only serious tone in the entire movie. Bale is playing a serious role in a comedic movie. It's really out of place.Moreover, the film is flooded with childish comedy. The Marvel movies cleverly introduced selective comedy at its peak, but this movie's comedy is diluted and excessive.

It has potential to expand (and it did) independently of the other movies. Thus, I decided to give a try for the 4th installment.Jane Foster entry into in the movie felt stretched, but otherwise fine. Christian Bale did a good job, but his presence in the movie is quite short. Thor was just the usual. The ending is a dumb cliche.Pros:
1. Decent cinematic.2. Music selection is good.Cons:
1. Poor humor.2. Use of children as child-soldiers by supposedly good guy.3. When not poor, the humor is just dumb.4. Uncreative story and plot armor all around.5. The sexist scene with Thor was completely unnecessary.I think the current rating of almost 7 is way too much. The movie is not good, but okay-ish at best. Graphics and acting can't do much to a horrible script. It's also disappointing to see the low moral level displayed by the director that's just spitting on the cultural progress of last decades.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Seriously, it's like a half-hearted first draft. Lacking the charm, wit, wonder and chaotic energy of Taika Waititi's previous foray into the MCU, the film chugs along at its own meandering pace as it tells a simple story as straightforwardly as it can. Some of it has a lot of potential and some of it is even fairly good, but all of it is undercut by the almost oppressively unfunny screenplay that has no idea how to balance its tone. I could probably sue for neck injuries thanks to a couple of these instances of total tonal whiplash. The movie just isn't fun, either. It certainly isn't the sort of devil-may-care comedy you may expect from those involved. Despite a handful of jokes that I recall making me think ""that's quite funny"" (but, crucially, never making me laugh), the experience of watching this is a maddeningly straight-faced affair. I mean, it's like the easiest 'you laugh, you lose' challenge in the world, so much so that most of the humour doesn't even seem like it's trying to make you laugh even though it obviously is. The whole thing is actually kind of embarrassing, the equivalent of watching a screening of someone's University work that they clearly scraped together mere moments before they were due to present it. I'll highlight the few things that I feel work about the picture. Firstly, Jane's storyline has a lot of potential and comes close to being affecting on a couple of occasions. It unfortunately isn't capitalised on fully, but it's undeniably the heart of the story and brings the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth back into the fray. Secondly, Gorr's motivation is believable and his presentation is often fairly unsettling (thanks, in no small part, to the stellar work from an out-of-place Christian Bale). His introductory sequence is mostly stellar, until it eventually gets too silly for its own good, and the payoff to his arc is as mature as it is satisfying (despite the denouement's somewhat clumsy handling of its consequences). Finally, there are a couple of action sequences that are presented with distinct aesthetics that bring to mind the best work of Zack Snyder. The golden shower skirmish is probably the movie's most entertaining set-piece, whereas the gang's extended stint in the shadow realm builds on the flick's most disquieting scene to present a relatively eerie battle that's genuinely aesthetically interesting. Despite these limited successes, the picture is easily one of the worst in the entire MCU. Much like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' before it, it simply doesn't feel like an actual film. It has all the elements that ought to make for a strong superhero story, but it squanders each and every one to emerge as nothing more than an absolute mess.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

L&T on the other hand is a train wreck. I gave it 3 stars as I did actually get to the end. Thor is a complete joke now and I'd suggest that it'll be hard to get another movie green lit after this disaster.It's all just silly and I can't quite point the finger at the worst culprit, maybe Russell Crowes Zeus (was Zeus's thunderbolt was intentionally portrayed as a lump of unimpressive plastic, or was it work-experience day at the SFX office?), the anthropomorphic Storm Bringer's jealousy fell flat, terrible costume design, those goats, King Valkerie (yawn), the completely superfluous GOTG or the Thorification of the children. I guess I'm just not the target audience, but the 12+ rating it got feels at odds with the juvenile slapstick writing, however the swearing and violence do for me take it beyond what I'd let my 8 &10 year old boys watch.The only surprise here was the lack of straw man misogynistic takes on Portmans ""The Mighty Thor"" for the film to neatly takedown. Unsurprisingly in the end Thor's contribution is downplayed in favour of Jane Fosters, undoubtably to placate Hollywoods obsession with ""The Message"".I read elsewhere that Ragnarok was only directed by Waititi, but L&T was also co-written by him as well and that for me says he's not the right man for this type of movie. After initially being quite excited for Waititi's take on Star Wars, this movie just makes me think we'll get the same garbage we've had to endure over the past decade.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

ANNOYING!!!Thirdly, the decision to make every scene into a mocking contest of Thor Universe! Who decided that was a good idea? Every scene is a joke. And if you watch the ""Making of Thor"" you can see Taika saying ""we didn't want to make a film that was joke joke joke"" well thats what you ended up with all jokes and no laughs!The only good thing in this film was the Moon Fight between Gorr & Thor...Dont even want to talk about Russel Crowe!This film made the 2nd Thor movie looked really good in comparison.Im very glad I chose not to watch this film in cinema.3/10 just for the visual during the Moon Fight.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

If this continues they will be losing ticket sales. We are also getting tired of the of how every movie seems to have to hit social agendas, but this seems to be a Disney direction as of late. It's unfortunate, but we will spend our money somewhere else and we recommend you do the exact same. Maybe DC can step it up.Terrible movie. Terrible script.

Also, the Entertainment Industry has severely lost touch with REAL PEOPLE. Instead of the fools on social media who (those of us with more than two brain cells to rub together know) will do or say anything - from the safety of their Moms basements of course - to seem relevant because that is the only attention they get, affording them a false sense of power. Since Hollywood is full of Wall to Wall narcissists we can all see who are really cowards because NO ONE has the nerve to make substantive shows - too controversial and they don't want to be ""canceled"". Which rolls back to this movie. The only nice thing I can say is that at least it isn't a remake/remastered older movie. This is the new phase the rest of Entertainment is taking - going back looking at shows that majority of people liked and literally film it again without changing anything but the actors. COWARDS and NO TALENT HACKS.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

1 for Chris Hemsworth
1 for Natalie PortmanNone for everything else.This is an appalling movie. There is no real storyline to speak of. The antagonist (the amazing Christian Bale) doesn't have a story arc. The protagonist has no story arc. In fact, there is no story at all.I can only wonder why this ever became a movie and the only thing I can think of is that the producers wanted a comedy/action movie. A movie that has plenty of action but is really funny and cool.Unfortunately, the action isn't all that great the people made this movie seem to have a definition of comedy that isn't shared by the rest of the world.At the heart of this movie, there's actually enough story. The protagonist has a good origin story and that's pretty rare these days.The movie makers could have taken a good script and elevated it to the next level. They could have made something really good. Instead, they seem to have ""simplified"" everything. The parts of the story that need fleshing out have been left bare and emphasis has been placed on comedy.And this is the worst part of the movie -- the comedy. It doesn't really exist. It's like watching someone who's learnt who hold a violin yesterday trying to play in an orchestra. It's painful, jarring, and frankly just plain bad.This is a good script turned bad by the executives. And in turning it bad, they've outdone themselves.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I did have expectations after coming from the other 3 Thor movies which were decreasingly good, but still good enough for me to enjoy them. Sadly, this movie feels like it was made for 3-11 year olds, which is probably why it does have a high rating even if it is painful to watch for most people.Even my mother cringed when watching it as she was expecting something more epic instead of this. The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and the plot is so weird. Just throw a thousand ideas into one movie and tie it together. The part with the kids feels so incredibly cheap, like something taken strange from Disney channel.I think the biggest flop is that they tried to make it family friendly, but in doing that, they successfully made a movie for younger kids while totally forgetting about older fans (I'm thinking 14 and up).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, I view movies as a whole, and having two thirds of the endeavour a trek of excruciating proportions probably chocks this up as a big loss.I have lost faith with the MCU after being a massive fan following the early successes of the franchise, and still cling to the hope that Marvel will one day realize their audience have become adults in the real world who are capable of enjoying movies at a more mature level.Almost a 3-4/10, but the strong third act helped bump it to a 5.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead Taika makes EVERYTHING into a joke which really insults those who spent all that time invested in this character and hoping to be thrilled into something deep, dangerous thrilling and fun.There was real meat and bones for a good story here, but it was all played for the silliness and goofiness that is a slip on a banana peel corny weeeehooo joke.

Laugh now, wasnt that funny!That is pretty much Thor and the nail in the coffin for me for my interest in Marvel Disneys mediocre 4th phase.Nothing was as interesting as Netflixes Daredevil or Punisher, and the only movies of note are Spiderman, with Dr Strange having such a messy story that didn't make much sense, that I left the theatre thinking, that movie felt kinda dumb.

Unfortunately, that seemed to be a focus for this film and it fails at that. For instance, the movie opens with some backstory for the villain who lost his in his devoutness to the gods. He meets his god to whom he worships, who ends up being callous and to the needs of his followers. The tension of the scene and weight of this revelation is undercut by the poor CG used to composite the god's face as well as the goofy acting in what should be a serious scene. Jane's illness is explored in little detail and seems like a plot device for her to end up with the hammer. The character was not redeemed from Thor 1 &2 as I hoped she would, and I really wished the relationship between the characters was developed for longer.Much of this would be okay if the comedy hit as consistently as the previous film (which is the funniest movie in the MCU imo) but unfortunately it didn't. Waititi's brand of NZ humour feels completely absent here resulting in a movie that's roughly as hit-or-miss as MCU's other offerings. Returning characters, like Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie or Korg, had less to do than in Ragnarok and felt like filler. What's missing were the strong character dynamics that fuelled much of the comedy from before, like Thor & Loki's distrust of eachother and Thor & Hulk's rivalry. They should have kept one of the Gurdians around or picked some other superhero from the MCU for Thor to partner up with.The action scenes were also less consistent in this one. I didn't find the climax as enjoyable as the rainbow bridge setpiece from the previous film, nor any as fun as the escape from the Goldblum planet.I also found the villain to be very agreeable since most of the gods that we see in the film are not worth saving, which is a significant flaw in the screenplay. They needed to balance this with some gods which exhibit some positive qualities.Some stuff I did enjoy was Christian Bale's performance as Gorr and the fight scene on the black and white planet. Russell Crowe's performance was unexpectedly funny but not quite as memorable as Goldblum's Gamemaster.I'm writing this review the day after and am struggling to recall much of it already. I expected much more from Taika Waititi and this is unfortunately the weakest film in his filmography.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Natalie Portman is fed an awful script, genuinely appearing uninterested in her role, and looks ridiculous as a female Thor - I literally pity her for having to appear in this filth, along with poor Christian Bale. If these producers had any actual brains, which clearly almost nobody working for streaming companies that make feature films does these days (Netflix is equally guilty of producing tripe features), when they read the proposed script and saw the name ""Zeus"" it would have been very clever for them to think to engage Liam Neeson in reprising his unforgettable performance as Zeus from Clash of the Titans, to the point that I might have given them one more crucial star towards a barely passing grade. Don't tell me Disney doesn't have the cash that this couldn't have been arranged, since Liam Neeson will seemingly work for loose change these days (not to detract from his work, he's excellent, but he appears quite easy to engage, similar to Nick Cage, who I also enjoy). Russell Crowe is utterly miscast as Zeus - his worn-leather face, stringy hair and obesity simply DO NOT CONJURE VISUALS WORTHY OF A GOD OF ZEUS' STATURE, PERIOD, to the GREAT detriment of that entire sequence. I'm surprised to see Christian Bale in such garbage, but none of the fault lies with him. The film has typically strong visuals (LITERALLY THE ONLY THING GOING FOR EITHER NETFLIX OR DISNEY THESE DAYS) but even the visuals are squandered, as mid-way through the film converts to black and white as they enter some sort of ""shadow realm"" thingy, and honestly, I feel they could have been more inventive making the visuals look good without using color. More routine, boring action sequences and bland storytelling ensue. Whatever, it's garbage, why am I making any effort going any further about it since Disney/Marvel didn't? Basically there isn't a Marvel film since Avengers: End Game, Deadpool 2 and Logan worth anybody's time. Looking forward to another actually GOOD Marvel superhero film ONE day, but at this rate I've accepted that IT'S VERY UNLIKELY...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

An appropriate amount of comedy and great scripting made it one of the better in the MCU.Love and Thunder's comedic attempts grow tiresome early on. Instead of a strong script, we get silly antics and one liners that do nothing for the movie. It does what most of the MCU movies have done recently: rely on heavy special effects and fail to really connect us to the characters. The Marvel movies in recent past were an event that people looked forward to, the crowds cheered, and we left the theater asking when the next movie was coming out. I waited for this to come out on Disney+ and was not disappointed. It was definitely worth waiting to see it at home (read this as sarcasm).

Nevermind.As for the main villain, I've seen claims in both the positive and the negative reviews that Christian Bale was ""the best part of the movie, he was just underused."" We must've watched a different movie. His screen time is the least of the problems, Bale is embarrassing as Gorr, he can't strike a balance between subtle and hammy, and as a result he overacts to Nicolas Cage levels, even Elizabeth Olsen had more nuance in MoM. We are constantly told Gorr is The God Butcher but the movie doesn't show us his deeds, so he never feels like a real threat.Giant screaming goats and Korg overstayed their welcome really quickly, small doses, Taika, small doses.If you didn't like Ragnarok (like me), you probably won't like LaT either.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is probably one of those films best seen in a theater so you can listen to the audience laugh track, but it starts to look really bad and the imperfections crack open under close inspection with no help.The acting on the majority of the crew is so bad that it feels like they shot this with only a few tries because the director has low standards on acting. I face palmed at the starting scenes of the child looking at the necklace looking 'ok'-ish and then suddenly at death's door a few frames later. That and the first god encounter was so bad and that was the beginning of the movie.Christian Bales' Gorr is probably the only saving grace of this film, plus the music. He did a good job but .. unfortunately he only had a few mins of screen time while the shoehorn crew Korg and diversity token Valkyrie had majority of the screen time next to thor, and these side characters don't even add to anything at all in the story.Lastly the CGI ... omg the floating head, what happened there? I loved the small-ish moon/asteroid where they fought though despite the problems with micro gravity. Bale is wasted, the cgi creatures was actually interesting(but unfortunately dies in 1-hit and easily pummelled by little children) , the final scene cgi is ok as well(the water scene, not the kids ... omg don't remind me, what is with Taika Waititi and kids).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

While Christian Bale is very much in this movie for a solid 20 minutes, his performance is undercut by very poor dialogue, poor acting from his co-stars, subpar CGI, and a story that is very low on innovation, surprise, inspiration, and stakes as a whole. Gorr the God Butcher is a much weaker knock off of Kratos in God of War, and Thor should have maybe stepped aside and let Jane Foster permanently take the mantle he so unmotivatingly holds. If you enjoy watching the God of Thunder have relationship-problems with his hammer, axe, and a plastic lightning bolt, then this movie is for you. If, instead, you wanted an intimidating villain and a film with any stakes, this film misses the mark and seems aware it does so.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I went into this movie knowing that people found it disappointing and sort of underwhelming for a MCU movie just because i'm a completionist and I have to watch EVERY MCU movie, else I don't feel complete. I mean for Christ's sake, I endured Morbius (which was bloody atrocious. The only half-decent thing about that movie was the damned after-credits). Anyways, this was everything that the people said. Disappointing, trying too hard at comedy which just didn't hit with me (Ragnarok was much much funnier), just didn't live up to any standards. Very sad, and hope that they'll save this mess with their next Thor movie (or series). It just kind of seemed like the director gave up on this from the start.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film itself seems to be struggling with the same thing as it has transitioned to an all-out comedy vehicle with just two dramatic notes - love is good and religion is dumb. Taika Waititi's work here is like religious satire of Voltaire coupled with the schmaltzy humanistic ethic of Oprah filtered through the cinematic comedy lens of Tarantino & Shrek. The film isn't helped by a plot that is as engrossing and ad hoc as the obvious and non-stop CGI locations they travel to. Nor is it helped by action sequences as the film seems completely uninterested in taking the action seriously by giving it stakes or a respite from the non-stop comedy or unique/creative beats. I laughed at some of the jokes, but I found myself growing less and less interested in Thor and the gang that surrounds him. At the rate this universe invents ad hoc items (God killing swords and wish granting altars) that should have been mentioned in the Infinity War, brings back dead people, or retcons the tone/plot of past films - why should anyone care about anything. I hope this is as low as the MCU gets, but I fear it won't be.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first Thor movie was an okay introduction and the second one was quite bland. In came Taika Waititi with Thor Ragnarok (2017), who made Thor a charismatic and fun character. Thor Ragnarok was no doubt one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies in the Thor franchise so far. It was no wonder that I was looking forward to Thor Love and Thunder when it was revealed Taika was returning as director. So did Thor: Love and Thunder deliver more fun or was this a big thundering step backwards?Firstly, Christian Bale was phenomenal as Gorr, the antagonist, in this film. He delivered an amazingly unsettling performance that made him incredibly creepy. He also delivers on the sorrowful moments as well that make him very sympathetic. Amazingly, he can be both frightening and yet kind of root for him. Natalie Portman finally returns to the Thor franchise as Jane Foster after being absent in Ragnarok. Her return is very ""mighty"" as she isn't just a doctor that is around but now a hero in her own right. It was great seeing her return and it's great to see that the chemistry between her and Thor (Chris) is still there. She has her struggles to deal with it and Natalie does an outstanding job of conveying the pain that she is going through. Chris and Tessa return as Thor and Valkyrie respectively and they are still great. Taika is still fun as the rock person Korg. Russell Crowe is pretty enjoyable to watch as Zeus as well. The whole cast did a great job in their performance.I also like the themes that are explored in the film. The exploration of love is a running arc for Thor throughout and I liked seeing him try to find ""himself"". There is also the theme of death in both Gorr and Jane's arc. It is handled wonderfully in both and I liked the resolution to it all as well. Legendary composer, Michael Giacchino, gives a colourful and bombastic score that works well for the movie. He also incorporates some great use of songs, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, such as ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" by Guns N' Roses that just mesh well in the film. There are some pretty enjoyable action sequences but the most memorable is in the second act. There is a fight scene in the shadow realm that is just visually oozing with style.Unfortunately, the comedy in this movie does not work. I just found the comedy in this movie to not be that funny. Ragnarok had some laugh-out-loud moments but Love and Thunder just never get those types of moments. Additionally, a lot of the humour comes from Thor being an idiot. In Ragnarok, he was a lot more comedic but he had an arc and an important decision near the end. Here he is just a comedic idiot throughout and he never gets that sort of big decision as he did in Ragnarok. He does have an arc but it's very weak. It's genuinely a shame that the titular character has been reduced to a joke in his film. On that note, the comedy isn't as prevalent as it was in Ragnarok. Ragnarok was a comedy throughout with some strong serious moments sprinkled in. Love and Thunder mesh half a comedy and half serious and this tonal clash hurt the movie. The serious moments are when the movie is at its best but then a dumb gag happens and damages the moment.Christian Bale is the standout in this film but his character Gorr is barely even in the film. There is a whole middle act where he just isn't even there. He is also called the God butcherer but we don't even see him on screen actually butchering a god which is such a shame. Gorr needed more screen time to flesh out his character and show why he is a threat to the gods. They also don't show why Gorr killing gods is bad. There is one scene implying negative consequences but we don't see it either. This creates a problem where it feels like there isn't much at stake in the film even though there is supposed to be. The film just doesn't have much weight to it. In Ragnarok, Odin's death was meaningful, the brother's conversation was meaningful, Valkyrie's decision to help was meaningful, Thor embracing the God of Thunder was meaningful, and Thor letting Asgard blow up was meaningful. Love and Thunder just lacks a lot of these apart from one thing at the end that isn't even Thor.Overall, Love and Thunder is pretty disappointing. I expected something that was like Ragnarok but instead got something that felt like an attempt at Ragnarok. The comedy wasn't as funny this time and there are a lot more serious moments this time that is great but makes the comedy feel more jarring as it interrupts the moment. However, it is not downright terrible as there is enjoyment to be had here. It's just not a great Thor movie and definitely not as good as its predecessor. It's just okay and after over 20 MCU movies, okay just isn't good enough.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

At least, not much positive to say.In 'Thor: Love and Thunder,' Taika Waititi once again tries to push the envelope on how silly a movie he can make at the expense of Chris Hemsworth's once-beloved Avenger. Despite the addition of an extra-creepy villain (Christian Bale), the tone of this film is woefully dull.The combination of a nonsensical script, lack of even an ounce of originality and tired tropes results in what is perhaps the weakest entry from the MCU to date. And it's hard to see any other film giving it a run for this title anytime soon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But just like the myth of Ikarus, they lost their humility, they flew too high, the sun melted their wings and they crashed and burned.It's shocking that the people behind one of the best superhero movies ever made is directly responsible for one of the worst as well. But if you watch closely, you can tell why.They thought they are so funny the rest of the movie doesn't really matter. However, it was the other way round. The rest of the movie was what made Ragnarok great. The plot, the twists and the excellent cast. The humor was the enabler, which turned a great movie to fantastic.But without a decent plot, smart dialogue and decent roles, the humor becomes unfunny, comedy turns to farce. It's the same mistake they do with all these spoof parody movies like Scary Movie, Superhero Movie and so on. If it's just jokes, it ends up being one big fat nothing.They did exactly the same mistake, and Love and Thunder crashed and burned. It's a real shame, because this movie had potential. Now it's just a farce that back in the 90s would qualify as straight to VHS.A true lesson in humility for Mr Waititi and the Marvel Studios. People say go woke, go broke. But this one didn't fail because of ""female Thor"" or same sex couples etc. This one failed because instead of working on a hero movie, they worked on a spoof. If you don't respect the source material, the source material doesn't respect you.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Irritating rather than captivating. Could not wait for it to reach its conclusion. I very much enjoy ""Ragnarök"" (and LOVE Taika's ""What We Do In The Shadows"") and the bulk of the earlier Marvel flicks but this comes off as a weak children's movie. Thunder a-plenty in terms of decibels cannot smother the fact that this is celluloid gossamer.The all Guns & Roses soundtrack (save a Dio tune during the credits) is a sign of desperation. Let's try to artificially generate viewer passion by injecting the so egregiously overplayed songs of one of the biggest rock bands ever. Sigh... Solid writing would have organically engendered viewer passion; like the scene in ""Infinity War"" where The Guardians rescue Thor. Very clever, captivating and amusing.I fear that the Disney overlords meddled throughout the production and that said film production zeitgeist will be the template for all forthcoming Marvel flicks. Obviously this would be tragic for each future Marvel production would end up Ewokified (MF loathsome Ewoks!!!). Reduced to cheap, generalized, lowest common denominator storytelling in an effort to maximize profits by being palatable to all 7.5+ billion inhabitants of the planet. I wish that this cynicism was not warranted but all the signs seem to signal this grim future.

I understand the 'leave your brain at the door' argument but ultimately the mediocrity of this film is hard to ignore.Foremost complaint is they've turned Thor as a character into a total douchebag. He's right back where he was at the start of Thor 1, completely arrogant and behaving like a child, only now he's wacky and 'funny' to make it more annoying. Any development his character has gone through is completely undone. Thor has always been my favourite MCU character, but he's quickly becoming one of the worst.The comedy in this film is awful, and I doubt it was rewatched by anyone on the crew or they would've realised gags like the screaming goats got old very quick. It's also a bit from Rick and Morty on the planet with the screaming sun more or less, so it's unfunny, grating and unoriginal to boot. Everything is a joke which removes any sense of weight from everything shown, which only serves to lower the stakes and your subsequent interest and investment. The Palace of the Gods featuring Crowe as Zeus could've been spectacular as a bit of cinema but it was horrible from start to end. Every scene has a gag forced into it, it's irritating because you sit and wait for it to come then because it's expected it falls incredibly flat.Bale was excellent however so all the three stars go to him. I don't want to pointlessly review bomb so a 3 is fair. There wasn't much of him in it unfortunately, but what was there counted and it really captures you.After the mess that was Doctor Strange 2 and now this, I won't be going to any more Marvel films. I imagine a lot of the revenue for these films comes from people like myself who started with Iron Man 1 in their late teens and early 20s who now have babies or toddlers, making going to see these films way harder. I'm going to be much more selective with where my money and time goes.In conclusion, I would absolutely recommend this film if you are physically or mentally under the age of 12. Otherwise, just no.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie is filled with so many jokes that really weigh the film down for me. The plot of the movie warrants a more serious tone but what we got was much different. The performances are mostly good with Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Christian Bale as standouts. Christian Bale really carried this movie for me, and if it were not for Gorr and his scenes being as good as they were, this would have a lower score. Other than the Gorr scenes, this movie feels like some sort of parody of the MCU. The jokes aren't funny, there is an overload of colors filling the screen, and the writing is, at some points, laughably bad. This movie is, in my opinion, a huge dissapointment coming from he same guy who did Ragnarok.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ragnarok gave us a refreshing new look at Thor in a comedic yet thoughtfully appointed way. So naturally my excitement for Taika Waititi's second installment in the Thor series was immense to say the least. However, after watching the film its hard to say that the movie was anything but a misguided sci-fi comedy filled with corny jokes and a wayward plot that felt like it was written by Lennie from of Mice and Men. The plot jumped from scene to scene with little to no explanation of what's actually going on. The movie felt crammed and void of any sort of depth what so ever. I legitimately think you could have made four different movies from this one film and they all would have been infinitely better. Not to mention the absolute waste of an incredible villain. The character Gorr the God butcher had so much potential, but lack of character development and childish plot destroyed all hope for this villain. Even with all the stupid jokes flying around this ridiculous movie Christian Bale still managed to give a good performance as Gorr, and is the only reason this movie is remotely enjoyable. Thor Ragnarok drew the perfect line between comedy and a meaningful plot filled with beautiful character arcs that actually contributed to the overall story. Thor Love and Thunder spit on that line while crossing it. This movie felt like Talladega Nights set in space, but with worse jokes. Overall, surprised I managed to watch this entire movie with majority of my brain cells still intact.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not always an easy balance, but this movie veers far too into comic book tactics that don't work in a movie that has serious themes or even a dramedy. It's like they just wanted to throw in some cool stuff from the comics without worrying about if it fit with the overall story or served any real purpose. They needed to either go with a less serious storyline and villain or dial back the goofiness about 30%.The VFX are really bad as well. I'm not sure if they used different lighting because of the new VFX they used but the makeup/actors didn't look great in a lot of scenes either. Many of the costumes look wrong and I'm sorry, but those thick shoulder-pad style capes reminded me of Rainbow Bright's outfit from the 80's... not in a good way.The character of Thor in this movie was more like the character Chris' real life brother plays: the Asgardian act""thor"" (see what I did there? Better pun than half that are in the movie, you are welcome.). I enjoyed Thor in Ragnorak, but they went too far will him just being a silly oaf at times in Love and Thunder.Christian Bale probably gave one of the strongest performances in the movie but his character still felt hollow and lackluster due to lack of development and screen time.It feels Korg becoming such a big character and so important to Thor is just taking up screen time so Waititi can feed his ego and make himself more important to the franchise. It feels cheap and time could have been better spent on the main characters. Not enough Valkyrie at all.I'm especially disappointed because Ragnarok was actually my favorite Thor movie and this was just a let down. Like others have said, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the set up for a children's series and/or even possibly to launch the career of Chris' daughter.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Up until the late 90s, I had every edition of FF, Cap, Thor, Rom, Moon Knight, Batman, Green Lantern, Hour Man, Justice Society, Marvel Team-Up, Daredevil, X-Men. . . ALL Characters. Every month I would have 40 titles waiting for me at the comic store.After the ridiculous Howard The Duck, and the two terrible Hulk movies, two lousy Fantastic Fours, four lousy X-Men, and 5 medium temperature Spider-man movies, something magical happened; somebody got the the thing in order and went after actors who had a commitment to giving up a huge chunk of their lives to tell the story of these characters. Boy, did it work. Even the ones that were not the favorites (i.e. Thor's Dark World, and Iron Man III) were compelling enough to watch just to see what was going to develop and be featured in the upcoming films.Chris Evans, Robert Downy, Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman- these guys gave it all they had, and were VERY believable as Cap, Iron-Man, Black Widow and Black Panther. By the time Marvel released the first Avengers movie, and ""The Winter Soldier"" the way was paved. Everything that followed lined up more or less with a great arc, and they made reasonable sense. 'Guardians' knocked it out of the park, and so did 'Civil War,' which was more of Avengers III than Cap III. There were still some weaker moments, like 'Age of Ultron' but in all fairness, when you go back through the movies in order, that film suddenly (with the deleted scenes restored) makes a HECK of a lot more sense.Infinity Wars may be the greatest action film, superhero film, war movie ever made. In what reality would you expect to see 20 lead characters , all relevant to the story, all with good development and and such stellar acting? It doesn't happen. But Marvel did it.""Endgame' gets a lot of fanfare, but between Guardians II, Captain Marvel, and the final film of the Phase three project, I could tell that the writing was on the wall. They systematically went about sabotaging the characters. The ridiculous Nick Fury eye incident, the terrible rug on Sam Jackson and the casting of the underwhelming Brie Larson as Carol Danvers instead of Teyonah Parris (or anyone else) as Monica Rambeau a.k.a. Captain Marvel was a crime, and a gigantic signal flare. The sappy waste of time that was Guardians II was meaningless, excluding the introduction of the character Mantis. The rest of it was just destroying Yondu and Star Lord, reducing Drax to base-level fart humor. Endgame Confused itself with time travel mixups, lots of dead time and the complete destruction of Hulk and Thor as super-beings with any kind of power or conviction. Pepper Potts whooped more A$$ than Hulk did.Now we find ourselves with a dreadful ""Eternals,"" a very lowered-bar ""Shang Chi,"" which might not have been so painful sans Awkwafina, pointless and forgettable ""Black Widow,"" terrible Moon Knight series, terrible ""Hawkeye"" series, and a very mediocre ""Falcon & Winter Soldier.""The end is near for our heroes. I thought that the cheapening and humiliation of Chris Hemsworth's ""Thor"" had reached the bottom with Endgame, but was I ever wrong. Chris should have hung it up two movies back. He's truly no longer worthy to carry Mjolnir, having agreed to this rubbish.The terrible directing, the terrible acting, the terrible humor, the terrible screenplay all converge to form a pile of junk so half-haked it can't even be a hot mess.This is dreadful. It's disgusting.It makes me angry that I spent so much of my money throughout my life to keep these comic books going for decades, just to have these idiots destroying them as fast as they can.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I've seen every MCU film and while none of them are what I would consider masterpieces, they are entertaining and I do enjoy them. All that being said, this was by far the worst of all of them. The jokes are so over the top and stupid it takes you out of the movie. I was glad to see Natalie Portman again but I feel that she was wasted in this movie along with Christian Bales great performance. Taika Waititi Should have stopped at Ragnerok as that had a much better balance of a good story, acting, and jokes. This was just too many jokes, bad CGI and bad over the top acting. After the first 15 minutes I wanted to turn it off. Don't waste your time with this film, much like with She-Hulk the MCU is really going down hill fast.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The frustrating thing is that it contains glimpses of what we loved about Ragnorok, but, unfortunately, the writing partnership shows its inexperience and this movie is one hot mess. It has no idea what it wants to be. But it is sure of one thing. It wants to reinforce all the wokey stereotypes of the day. Well, well done. You succeeded in that, but along the way it makes for some really bad story telling and third rate scripting. Remove your brain and watch it like a 6 year old and you'll be fine. And BTW who signed up GnR for the sound track. Can't these directors get any original music to use rather than 30 year old dad rock. The closing track by DIO is 40 years old for Gods sake. Don't get me wrong. I love classic rock but it really comes to show a lack of creativity and imagination when you are a director in 2022 and you have to rely on 40 year old music for 90% of your sound track.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'd call it a ""feel good"" and just that because unlike 90% of Marvel, it doesn't exceed good. The entirety of Marvel has made movies that encourage and allow a broad range of emotions and an escape from reality all while limelighting the super hero's and action. Lol Thor Love and Thunder got lost and then strayed far far away. My emotions were not brought out, but in, as I cowered over cringing at the script that had Academy award winner, Natalie Portman, delivering lines that belong in DC. Don't get me wrong some of it was humorous but the balance wasn't there. The dad jokes and dead humor every five seconds made it difficult to hear anything else.

Nice comedy moments but still taken seriously. From the first 5 minutes you would think this is the wrong movie, low budget parody ( It was intentional). It's too silly, too comedic to be taken seriously. In an attempt to close some unfinished stories from previous movies, this movie left a lot of plot holes and contradictions which makes you scratch your head ( if you can't see any, it's enough to see goof on this site and much more).You see some new characters and it give a nice introduction to next Thor movies but IMHO Taikiki went too far with the comedy bits. Ragnarok was one thing, a refreshment, this is exaggeration and I'm not even talking about that absurd intro scene.TL:DR
exaggeration in ""comedy bits"" that aren't funny at all, it's in top 3 worst MCU movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There were even times when all the VFX pulled me out of the movie and just became noise.I'm also a big fan of Taika Waititi's humour and style, but the jokes had very little room to land in this film and most of the time just boring puns.Worst of all, the movie is super predictable and where Ragnarock worked because if character interactions which brought the humour, this has very little interaction between characters which might be why I didn't find this film that good.If you are a Marvel fan you don't need my recommendation, you probably would like this review, but if you are a woman like one of my ex's that just love to watch hunky dudes in movies where the plot kinda dosen't matter for you, then I would recommend it.

His performance as Gorr was terrifying, and his mission makes sense in the grand scheme of it all and I found myself rooting for him. The overuse of humor felt like a cop out for poor storyline and poorer script, but the most the humor brought was a dry chuckle or snicker. It was not actually funny, if you understand. Many of the ""funny"" elements got old fast.And Jane's character above all was unnecessary to the story. She's been missing from the overarching story for years, and she added nothing to this movie, other than some small character development for Thor. Beyond that, the character development from Endgame to this movie, it feels almost like Thor has regressed in all respects, going from a noble Viking to a babbling, love-obsessed buffoon. He is an absolute joke and insult to the character and the hero.The cgi was done half-ass, with some areas of the movie appearing more vivid than others, like the monsters and fight scenes. However, I recognize that the costumes and set design was nicely done, with a total revamp to Thors armor.I feel like bale was wasted on this movie. I would not have paid for this in theaters. The movie felt like one big joke.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Much. Usually they're done in an offhand way to lighten the severity of a situation and it's really refreshing. However. There were some plots crucial to the overall storyline that was rendered moot by the importance placed on everything having to be funny.While Waititi's cinematic style is undisputedly visually stunning, everything just felt superficial and even the characters (actors) feel like they're not invested bc of poor directing, which is a shame for such a massively talented cast. It just doesn't carry like the magnitude of a Marvel movie usually does.Bale is an exemplary actor, portraying an intricate character, and you def got the ""the God Butcher"" every scene he's in. Then again, Portman and Thompson aren't no slouches either but there was just no way to connect to this movie.

It was hard to feel very little or any emotion for any of the characters and the trials that they were going through as there was no build up or chemistry.Thor:Ragnarok had a perfect blend of comedy, tragedy, seriousness, and darkness.Thor: Love and Thunder was a ballet of comics quickly strewn together for a quick buck.I think over all, the director caught lightning in a bottle for his first major film and then tried to piggyback off that but tried too hard.

I know that it might be just Taika Waititis but he is also a director that I love. He is very good but I might believe that he is not the right one for Marvel and Marvels future. Since Ragnarok, the funny parts has been the more important parts wich I believe is a shame. I believe that previous Marvel movies has been very thougthful and not ending the plot in the movies but instead keep the story until the next movie which i think have been their strength. Thor: Love and Thunder though was just so stressed plotwise. Although my thoughts was the movie pretty good and entertaining but far from the previous ones.That the most hated Marvel movie Thor: The Dark World has a better rating is concerning...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

These are superheroes/aliens-- why do they need human sexuality?!The verdict: More character-driven than the dumb-fest that was ""Thor: Ragnarok"", but less spectacular with a boring Guns 'n' Roses soundtrack. This film suffers the same problems as ""Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness"" (great 1st act, but disintegrates fast into boredom). If you liked the latter two MCU references, then you'll probably enjoy this. If you didn't-- you won't. I didn't but I kinda did-- probably the best in MCU Phase 4 since ""Shang-Chi"", so far, but I'm kinda over the whole CBM thing now.

This movie however has very little going for it, particularly on account of bad writing, politics aside, though there are some clear efforts to exclaim certain ideologies, which pull you out of the movie, but generally speaking they didn't have very much to work with.Thor, it would seem, doesn't do very well in so far as even numbered sequels are concerned, though this one is sat in the middle of a Disney period of output that isn't doing well at all on all fronts. They're in cash cow mode, and seem to care very little about the quality of their output at this time. This is also evident here with regards the visual effects. In fact this film feels rather like a fan edit, as if taken from a lower budget series.It has a couple of good moments - I particularly liked the goats, and some of it's more sentimental moments were reasonably effective. In fact it had some nice ideas in most areas, however none of them were particularly well executed at all.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The sad thing for me is that I really like everyone in this film, but I am not going to just give a positive review due to the personalities, instead of the performances. To me it seems like they were more interested in an agenda than entertainment, or doing the job the public expects them to do. This is my second submission I have made for this movie. Several of my reviews have been ignored entirely by IMDB. I cant help but think that any mention of wokeness, PC, and how the entertainment industry pushes an agenda automatically gets censored. After all we cannot have anything said that the PC crowd disagrees with. It will be interesting to see if this gets by the censorship.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Whomever started calling the shots at Marvel after the 2nd Thor film should be given a severance check and sent back to comedy central for their next big gig.These characters have been developed over many years and there appears to be no respect for their legacies. All that seems to matter now is having quick catch phrases that keep a certain audience type chuckling and sharing these jokes with there friends on Instagram while in the movie theater.

The music in this film takes me back and I love it! Then comes the plot, the overreaching for comedic value. It just falls so short of what Marvel has been and what they could be. I'm a huge Thor fan, I will watch those films over and over. Not this one though, once was already too much.The plot is not to standard, the character acting is not really good, Chris is great as always. It's just thin and always looking for a laugh. In the other films you always had a laugh, you didn't need the actors always seeking one. More Hemsworth, more Thor less tugging on people's patience.#shame, #disappointing.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Crowe, Hemsworth, Portman, Thompson, etc... have all proven mastery of their art on multiple occasions.No, the culprit here is Taika Waititi, and while Ragnarok was palatable, but only just, what he did to Love and Thunder borders on criminal negligence for the damage it will do to the reputation of said cast. I will avoid everything he does from now on and speak of him no more.The ONLY noteworthy character in Love and Thunder is that of the villain, Gorr. Christian Bale's monumental performance stands out even more because virtually every other character is depicted as a one-dimensional, frustrated neurotic on the verge of throwing a toddler tantrum, it is that bad.The only times this thing has any sort of superhero movie feel to it are the scarce occasions when Bale is in the picture, and on those occasions, it feels like the Gorr scenes were inserted from a completely different movie altogether. Gorr is also the only one I ever felt any sympathy for, as he's the only one who resembles an actual person one can build some kind of rapport with.I was a toddler in the early 1970's, and I grew up with the original DC and Marvel comics, reading and re-reading about the gods that were my heroes. Watching Love and Thunder, I halfway expected to hear the complete cast join in for the Oompa Loompa song. (Which would have been funnier than all the 'jokes' in the film combined.)There are no gods in this monstrosity. So sad,... and so bad that I have to wonder if this was done deliberately...","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

But then again, this comic books based CGI action theme was always destined to go the way of all the other 'popular' themes like musicals, westerns, 3D, etc etc. What we started to see during Covid and are seeing more now, especially with Spider Man, Thor and Jurassic World is the declining end-game of the CGI based action hero movies. I guess Iron Man saw it coming and got out in time with his dignity intact - end game indeed. I wonder what will become popular next. I hope it involves mainly adults and intelligent dialogue (mostly) and rational plots that are well directed and produced, with quality actors giving their all for their art - you know, like it used to be.

Generally a well written show has a comedic relief character, but none of the characters displayed any gravitas, leaving nothing but a hollow waste of what could have been a great story. The cast had some great actors and I'm very surprised that after reading the script (that put Zeus in a mini skirt) that it passed the first read.

Ragnarog was a pleasently surprise and a great movie. This is not that.There is a HUGE waste potential from Christian Bale, who is usually one of the best actors in Hollywood, there are moments where he looks and really feels ""evil and twisted"", and then others where.. Its just bland and meh. And screentime-wise, he doesnt get enough to hammer in the character and too much for him to be really mysterious.There is an, and this is hard for me to say, overuse of Guns N' Roses, like they bought the greatest hits album and only use that.Overall its a decent movie, but it tries too hard to be funny and quircky, and for me, that was more facepalming and cringey. And at the same time it tries to be serious with battling some serious questions, but again fall flat here. If you know you comic material, you won't be surprised,what I am talking about.It starts out good, but by the end I was abit bored.Not a movie I nessarily am gonna watch again.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The original and Ragnarok were pretty outstanding, though being rather different in the ways they presented themselves - one more serious, the other more comedic. Never the less, both delivered an outstanding cinematic experience with depth of storyline and characters. This particular film fails on all fronts. It seems like an excuse to get together an all star cast and milk the franchise with millions of dollars without delivering anything new. The jokes in this film are simply not funny and rather childish to be perfectly honest.

They treat the audience lime dumbos.Stakes are too high to value it, and the use of children who have insanely high plot armor also devalues it.It's like there is always something more powerful and more better than what we saw in the Infinity Saga in every recent MCU outing, but nothing is coherent or seeming to lead up together soon.I had hopes for this movie and that was because of two people mainly, Christian Bale and Taika Waititi.

Most of anything in the movie was just made up in the movie, which is horrible to have. It makes a movie seem like they just made a sequel with no plan just for the money, which I'm very sure is what happened. It had no relation to anything else in marvel, it didn't build up on anything, the movie itself was just pointless and random. A wasted opportunity to build on Jane and Thors relationship, which wasn't that good in the first place. This could've gave a Jane a personality, but instead changed what little she had completely. Definitely the worst marvel movie I've seen, tied with multiverse of madness.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Empty. Silly. There are too many jokes, too much stupidity (screaming goats getting annoying after the 30th scream), not enough character development except for thor and jane
2) Christian Bale's character was not developed enough. I feel like we didn't see enough of him. Same for Lady Sif (who disappeared for years). Same for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Same for Russel Crowe
3) Seriously.....Natalie Hershlag (Portman) as Thor? Be realistic! She's a meter and a spit, and she's supposed to be so powerful. I get the hammer is powerful. But her....no. Not believable>
4) TOO MANY REFERENCES TO SAME-SEX COUPLES (I. E: ""MY DADS..."", ""MY MOMS...."", FEMALE HAS A CRUSH ON ANOTHER FEMALE!) WTF...DISNEY TRYING TO BE SO PRO GAY-LESBIAN THAT NOW, AN ACTION MOVIE IS A POLITICAL STATEMENT.... I HATE MOVIES THAT HAVE TO PROMOTE THIS KIND OF STUFF...ONCE IS ENOUGH...TWICE IS TOO MUCH.5) ZEUS!

It's a joke.Conclusion: The movie isn't in any way serious, even the dark parts feel ""meh"", the acting was mediocre, such a waste on an incredible cast.

Feels more like a parody of Thor: Ragnarok more than a continuation to that movie. Waititi's style works incredibly well for his other films but here it's just too much. The comedy undercuts almost every emotional moment and deflates almost any tension in every scene. The character development here for anyone who isn't Thor is underwhelming. Natalie Portman returns as Jane Foster and she feels more like a mandate from Disney to include her rather than Taika wanted to. I also don't think Portman is doing a great job here but the script she is given doesn't help her at all. Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor. It's clear Hemsworth is having a blast and his charisma kept me somewhat invested. Christian Bale's Gorr is a very mixed bag. On one hand you have a really fun, engaging, and great performance from Bale but that character of Gorr just isn't great. His origin is rushed and confusing before the film bizarrely chooses not to show him kill any gods besides one. A character called The God Killer only gets to kill one god on screen. Great job Marvel! The other actors like Tessa Thompson and Russell Crowe are doing a good job but their characters feel like an afterthought. The filmmaking here in general honestly feels a little bland. Taika's style is there but it feels awkward this time. The visual effects don't look great most of the time either however with the recent news about how Marvel treats it's VFX workers and how little time they have then it's understandable why they look incomplete. The film wasn't completely devoid of anything fun though. There were some fun sequences and fun jokes though. The black and white fight is very creative and fun to watch and The Rock at the end was pretty great. The rest of the jokes in this film really aren't that funny though. The screaming goats weren't funny the first time and they weren't funny the 15th time they made the joke. With the lackluster output that Phase 4 has given us, Marvel is in trouble right now if they don't course correct soon. If you enjoy Ragnarok then maybe you'll enjoy this but at the end of the day you can skip it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately I left the cinema feeling thoroughly disappointed with what I saw and that I had once again been tricked into watching another extremely formulaic and tonally misguided piece of modern Disney film/television.The whole film is just memes and jokes throughout with almost no breathing room whatsoever, all the characters are now moronic quip machines and poor Christian Bale, who gives a pretty good performance as the antagonist, is given very little screen time with which to develop his more seriously toned character. At no point did I feel like he was an actual threat, due to the happy-go-lucky way the characters were treating their mission at times and as such the whole story fell flat for me. Taika has over-injected his humour throughout the whole movie but also over-injected himself as Korg, which failed to get many laughs out of the cinema I was in, a packed New Zealand cinema nonetheless which by contrast was roaring with laughter when I went to see Thor Ragarok.The movie relies heavily on its licensed tracks for music, one of which gets very old by the end (Sweet Child O' Mine). The dialogue is outright cringe-inducing at times, which Taika has balanced well in the past but it really seemed like things were given a pass on the first take or went unchallenged. The action is decent, but felt like it was spread thin between the many often inconsequential ""comedic"" and occasional ""dramatic"" character/dialogue driven scenes and there wasn't anything as awesome or goosebumb inducing as some of the scenes in Ragnarok (when Thor gets his thunder back and obliterates a bunch of goons on the bridge). There were actually some nice dramatic moments and conversations, but they were always immediately undercut by some comedic quip or gag, sometimes in the middle of the moment.I dont know, I'm still coming to grips with what I saw but I cant deny my first impression, which was that the movie was trying way too hard to lean into the comedic success of Ragnarok, which came at the cost of other more important aspects (story, character, tone and arguably action), and ultimately failed at even being particularly funny. It doesn't help that I went to see this coming off the back of being immensely disappointed by Disney's ""Kenobi"" series which felt like a saturday morning cartoon/kids show like Power Rangers, but if it werent for the good cgi in parts I would say that Thor Love and Thunder felt something like that also. To be clear, I thought Doctor Strange 2, despite some pretty shaky dialogue, acting performances and narrative choices, was a really fresh and tonally consistent movie which I enjoyed thoroughly and that despite relying extremely heavily on shoehorned memes and character cameos, Spider Man NWH was a competent but mayb slightly overrated blockbuster. I just think I'm done with Disney shows and movies for a while after seeing Thor Love and Thunder, I get that they are probably being more geared towards children at this point but they had managed to appease everyone in the past successfully so maybe each of their projects is suffering due to issues with over-production (spreading good staff/teams too thin across MCU/Lucasfilm projects).","4 out of 37 found this helpful.

Yes, I'd like this film to be remade please, without all of the nonsense and with Chris Hemsworth's real bottom. I mean who tuned in to see a CGI version? Surely it's a thing of beauty in its own right?Lose the stupid goat noises and the odd ""quirky"" jokes that were just for the sake of it and really focus on the fantastic story that this could have been.It even started daft. They took his recklessness too far and it certainly didn't seem like the comic book version of Thor that I was used to from his appearances in the X-Men collection.I liked the use of Korg narrating things throughout, but that was enough humour.The jokes in 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017) worked because they weren't every two seconds and were appropriate to the storyline, but they seemed to have saturated this script or probably ad-libbed the dialogue in some sort of attempt to outdo the laughs of that previous instalment, which has ultimately ruined the whole thing and put me right off of Thor as a character. I realised recently that actually Liam Hemsworth is probably the better of the brothers having seen him in 'The Dressmaker' (2015), but watching this film definitely put me off his brother Chris, because he obviously agreed to take his greatest character in this ridiculous direction.I think that Chris and Taika Waititi need to part ways now before they ruin the franchise completely. The 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' (2014) part at the beginning was quite clearly to explain away the fact that the ""Asgardians Of The Galaxy' film was never made and they had to show how Thor had moved on since leaving with them in 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019).Unfortunately it got too stupid and was far too busy with new and existing characters.And I am really very angry about this, because, as I've said, the story was such a great concept. Bringing back the gorgeous and talented Natalie Portman as Jane Foster+ and facing them off against 'Gorr The God Butcher', played superbly by Christian Bale, were class ideas.If this had been produced and directed in the same way that the other Marvel films had been, then I believe that it could have been one of the best stories in the series, but what they actually achieved (If you can call it an achievement) was a conglomeration of a kids adventure film, a bittersweet romance and a comedic farce all rolled into one. It really lost its way.I feel as I did with 'The Eternals' (2021) and 'Shang Chi' (2021), that this film was rushed out to keep the Marvel momentum going, but didn't have the thought or consideration put in to ensure it was worthy of the franchise. It was missing that final proof read and edit and it showed.I'm actually glad that my mother fell over and I had to take her to hospital on the night that I was supposed to see this film, because I'd be furious if I'd paid to see it.460.72/1000.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The only good thing in this movie, I'm just amazed they are using the music i listened to in my youth to the new kids who listen to crap tunes those s days...I read they cut out the big part to be accepted by the biz when netflix does much better series with horror n terrible stuff... it must be better with those important evil parts...A movie to play once on tv.. waste of money really.We miss u Stan!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Because if yes, then it failed at that. It is full of unfunny jokes, but whatever, i can just ignore those. But what i can't ignore is the bad writing. We get our typical dose of woke cringe that comes with most of these Hollywood movies lately, nothing surprising here, (do they really hate making money this much?) with the two main female characters, although luckily it's not as bad as in different movies.It never feels like there are any real stakes. (Constant fakeouts ""Oh no they are dying."" And they they are fine a minute later, just removes any sort of tension. You never worry about anything bad happening to anyone here. ) Plot and any serious buildup often gets sidelined to make a space for an unfunny comedic moment. (And I'm not trying to be jaded here, I love me some funny jokes, but I think most of the jokes in this movie were objectively bad). And in the end you just end up with a very generic watery sauce of a movie. Marvel used to be good at this superhero thing.

What a letdown! I can't imagine anyone paying to see the movie, and the disappointment most will inevitably come out with feeling! I've been saddened that the movie is now part of Chris Hemsworth's legacy, and It saddens me more to have seen the first-ever Marvel Studios film that has disappointed me so.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Also what happened to the special effects team? The VFX was so poor in this movie; looked cartoonish and cheap, with un-laughable humor...

Thor has become a funny sidekick and some of the cameo's, for example Korgg and Zeus, are downgraded to clowns who add little to the story.The same joke can only be funny for a few times and Marvel/Waikiki/Thor obviously didn't get that memo, and so they ruined a movie that had the potential to be dark and compelling.

To reiterate, this franchise has released nearly thirty films in about fourteen years, starting with 2008's Iron Man. After all of this time, with films so frequently released, one would think audiences know these characters intimately and those in charge wouldn't have to spoon feed expositions into our gullets like mother birds. One would be wrong.The film follows Thor Odinson and Jane Foster on their quest to bring down Gorr the God Butcher, a man cursed by the Necroblade who seeks to...butcher gods. Thor must also reconcile his feelings for Foster, who wields Mjolnir now as The Mighty Thor, as they traverse a couple of worlds on their journey to take down Gorr. The pair are also joined by characters introduced in Thor: Ragnarök, Valkyrie and Korg, who are also in the film, accompanied by some extremely irritating giant screaming goats.The overarching problem with the film is its tone, which careens bombastically from glibly farcical, to sappy and overwrought, all the way down to solemn and sentimental. There's hardly a mood the film doesn't attempt to evoke, resulting in a messy, unfocused, and tensionless product. The blame for this confused tone lays at the feet of the film's writer/director Taika Waititi, returning from Thor: Ragnarök and audience favorite Jojo Rabbit.Where the latter's dramatic pretensions work because of the intrinsic weight of its Nazi Germany setting, the Thor entries flounder because they're not grounded or purposeful in their world or atmosphere. Keeping dramatic focus in a film about Nazis, even a comedic film, is simple; keeping dramatic focus in a film about odd alien worlds, lovesick musclebound gods, and characters who quip about their own cancer diagnosis isn't so easy. When every character, in every moment, has a glib, grating retort to the present danger, tension is erased, and stakes are annihilated.In addition to tonal problems, Thor 4's story is nonsensical and half-baked. Gorr's plan to butcher the gods of the universe makes no sense after three seconds of thought; his motivations are conveniently set up within a single scene and much of the needed character work for a satisfactory arc is nonexistent. Much of the film feels simply like wheel spinning, as we follow Thor and Foster from one world to the next without much forethought or context. The plot is there, but it's flimsy, and many connective threads exist as little more than action cliches.Much like The Rise of Skywalker, there never seems to be a structure or plan on the end of the writers, who substitute quick movement, hyper-paced dialogue, and heavy-handed, frequent exposition for any semblance of a story. The exposition in particular is grating because it washes away any awe or mystery for the audience, and because it's incredibly clunky and transparent. All of these problems make Thor 4 play less like a story within a fleshed-out world, and more like a hastily assembled collection of cheap, impersonal scenes. The whole thing feels so disposable.Continuing the theme of poor writing, let's take a second to discuss the Thor Odinson. For much of the MCU's run, Thor has been a powerful, stoic, and plain-spoken deity, with a likeable charm displayed charismatically by Chris Hemsworth. These qualities were seriously disrupted in Thor: Ragnarök, to my chagrin, and evaporated entirely during Infinity War and Endgame. The Thor presented in Love and Thunder is, to be blunt, a bumbling, childish, aloof buffoon, totally bereft of the qualities which made him an intimidating and forceful presence in previous entries. This brand of character assassination seems to be a trend, as it was featured prominently in Buzz Lightyear's characterization in Toy Story 4, and throughout the Despicable Me franchise for the minions, who as recently as last week descended further into idiotic caricature.It's frustratingly difficult to root for the Thor of Ragnarök and Love and Thunder because he never seems in tune with the danger or circumstances around him. It does make sense though, in a way. The old Thor films were semi-serious actioners, which require a likeable, dependable, capable, and resourceful hero. Thor 3 and 4 are essentially screwball farces, which in contemporary comedy terms require a man-child incapable of change or introspection until seconds before the credits roll.This rationale is made even more frustrating by the real-world limitations of Hemsworth and comedy in general; being a macho, musclebound, unstoppable badass and a self-deprecating, nonchalant jester is obviously disingenuous. These are diametrically opposed archetypes which shouldn't generally exist in the same body; it's not Hemsworth's fault that he can't convincingly play both at once, but he can't.Hemsworth isn't the only actor flailing around in the vain hope of making the script work. Every performance is glib and listless. Waititi as Korg keeps the zingers flying hot and fast, Tessa Thompson is rather unconvincing as an apathetic yet committed town leader and warrior, and Natalie Portman is particularly adrift in her role.Portman's performance is fluttery and cutesy, not helped by her lack of established or developed character. She acts as if she's been cast opposite the jock in a film about high school melodrama, working hard to keep any and all emotion from crossing her face. She's played stoic and broken before in actioners, but this is a far cry from her performance in V for Vendetta. It's hard to put too much fault on the cast; Waititi uses heavy improv in his films, which is an increasingly bizarre choice for a film which shouldn't be a farce and isn't inhabited by those skilled at improvisation.Thor 4 keeps within the marvel tradition of looking incredibly expensive yet visually bland and flat. Like most MCU films, and most new films in general, there is absolutely no attempt to block scenes in a manner that establishes context, continuity, or basic immersion. Actors mostly stand around and talk and nearly every action scene is filmed without flair or personality. It's just baffling to watch a piece of art, made in a medium specifically capable of drawing in the eye and mind, look so flaccid and so stock. The world is clearly uninhabited by anyone not standing on a small set in front of a greenscreen.For such ballooning budgets nowadays, one would think film studios could afford to higher more than fifteen extras at a time. Bresson and Eisenstein are rolling in their graves as filmmakers explicitly shoot scenes with no sense of place and editors cut with no sense of rhythm, meaning, or purpose. It's all so random and thoughtless; no number of assembly line productions will make me shrug my shoulders and mutter, ""eh, that's just the way movies look I guess."" To be fair, the non-CGI props and locations don't look convincing either - every piece of armor looks like low-grade Chinese plastic.Yes, most of Thor 4 is annoying, ugly, and pointless, but there is a silver lining of quality, and his name is Gorr. Most everything about the film's villain is aesthetically impressive and dramatically interesting, if not wholly satisfying. While his plan makes little sense and his motivations desperately need deeper exploration, Christian Bale's portrayal is, in turns, both sympathetic and humane.Unlike most MCU villains, Bale doesn't shoot for plainly stoic; he and his delightful British accent play up the intensity when needed and simmer down when the situation demands solemnity. His color palette and design are intriguing and he's genuinely intimidating, a nice departure from the recent crop of bland baddies. Many of the fight sequences involving Gorr, while clumsily cut and hard to keep track of, are at least conceptually interesting and imaginative. Gorr's scenes are the only times when Waititi even attempts to create cinematic images.Overall, it's whatever. Thor 4 is more of the same; if you subscribe to the Marvel formula and feel like you know the characters inside and out, you'll probably like the film well enough. If you've been alienated by the sheer volume of output or any of the tonal shifts of the last few years, the film is hardly likely to win you back. Thor 4 keeps on the same tract as most entertainment, likely assembled by a random number generator with data scraped from a sampling of social media status updates and trending hashtags, designed to stimulate our decimated dopamine systems and distract from our dismal reality for a couple of brief hours. Have fun.4/10.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it much more than Multiverse of Madness which isn't a very hard accomplishment to achieve in all honesty. The film was very funny and Christian Bale's performance is the main strong point of the film. He definitely carries the film on his shoulders, his presence is so dominating and steals the spotlight from the protagonists Hemsworth and Portman. That is where my praise ends. Although comedic that's all it has going for it as the action scenes and plot are sub par, predictable and frankly don't have much depth to them. This film continues the trend of tearing down Thor from being an incredibly strong hero both physically and writing wise, completely turning him into a clown who's only purpose is to entertain the spectator through his comic relief. This change in attitude to characters is a trend I've noticed with the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the moment. They take a once serious and 3 dimensional character and create this weird amalgamation of complete goofy and ridiculous nature with just enough of a serious edge to care about them slightly. Some audiences may actually prefer this style of Thor but I certainly do not share that view. To conclude I only recommend watching this film if you enjoy the current MCU releases.","1 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's difficult to even begin, but let's do this.I returned home from the theater (july 2022), trying to make sense of what I had just seen. Right out of the gate, I will say this is not the worst MCU movie to date. Dark World and even the atrocious Antman movies are below. I'd say it's a tie with Black Window. Another unnecessary movie that lost its way. It's 4 out of 10, and I'm being generous.To be fair, the visuals and the soundtrack are actually very good. The production value is the one good thing that didn't make this journey unbearable. The general idea of the plot is also nothing to sneeze at. But my summary is: Taika Waititi is a genius. He can make gold with whatever garbage they throw at him. He proved himself by reviving Thor after the disastrous Dark World into the cool Ragnarok.They asked him to perform the same miracle, unrestrained. And I think this happens if you leave Taika unchecked: he tries everything and cuts nothing. And the thing this movie needed the most was better editing, especially cutting a lot of things off.Korg was great in Ragnarok. Because it was a very minor part. The comical relief was used very sparingly, and it worked. Now they turned the notch up to 11, and it's too much Korg. The joke of Asgardians of the Galaxy at the epilogue of Endgame was great. But again, Love and Thunder take too damn long lingering on this Guardians joke.The first section of the movie, closing up the Endgame joke, took too damn long. It could be dealt with in a very fast 5 minutes montage. But Taika liked the joke so much that he overdid it. And then you have the conflict between the tone the director wanted and the tone that the plot required. The director clearly wanted a light-hearted Ragnarok 2-like style. The plot of Gorr is a very tragic, dark, and serious storyline. If the Guardians section took too damn long, the Gorr introduction was too damn short.He's a great villain, but we see a short montage of him losing his daughter and just making an exposition dump with God Rapu. Show, don't tell. He gets the necrosword out of nowhere and from there becomes the so-called God Butcher. But it's too short. I would have cut most of the Guardians scenes down to 5 minutes and increased the Gorr introduction by at least 10 minutes because it seems much more interesting and relevant to this movie.Another carried over consequence from the other movie: the New Asgard city turned tourism attraction and the Matt Damon theater that was a short joke in Ragnarok. It had a context before because it was another Loki shenanigan. But here, it was just a very long exposition section for the broken Mjolnir arc. But it breaks the meme. It was fun back then because if you didn't pay attention, you'd miss that the actors were Matt Damon and Hemsworth's brother. But here, they made their roles take more time with close-ups. And this breaks the meme aspect and incorporates them as actual scenes for this movie. And it doesn't work. This is the classic taking the joke too seriously.You could've made a more dramatic flashback montage with Hella herself breaking Mjolnir, taking far less time. And on the note of New Asgard. The Valkyrie was a great addition to Ragnarok, and she had a role to play there. But since then, they have no idea what to do with her. And here again, she did absolutely nothing. They could have just cut her, and the story wouldn't have unfolded differently. We already have Korg for comic relief; now they added Valkyrie as another comic relief. There's too much comic relief in this movie.Then there's Jane Foster's arc inspired by the cancer thing from the comics. And that's fine. But there's a big MCU problem here. My girlfriend pointed it out in the theater: what about Wakanda? What about the other gods? The world post-Thanos has Wakanda. Shuri was able to make surgery and take a bullet off the spine of that Shield's agent (I forgot his character name, but it's the Hobbit guy) like it's nothing. They imply that the Vibranium-based technology is unmatched to the point of nano brain surgery on Vision. And you want me to believe they don't have the cure or even much better treatment for cancer?Not only that, both Valkyrie and Thor seem to have this vast networking with several other Gods, several realms, and several different species in far more advanced technology states than us. Think of Nova. Thor has Stormbreaker, which is basically space Uber. He can teleport to any part of the Universe in the blink of an eye. And you want me to believe there's no cure for cancer anywhere in the known Universe at this point?The writer could forcefully patch this if he incorporated the whole Dark World's Aether, making her condition particularly unique because she had the Aether in her body. But again, they wasted too much time on jokes and not so much on the movie's stakes. Gorr didn't have much of an introduction. Jane's cancer didn't have enough development for anyone to care. Actually, they treat it like it's nothing. This movie has too little stake and too much flashiness.And when I say that they wasted too much time on jokes. The goats. It was completely unnecessary and annoying, and they insisted on it for far too long. I hate the goats. And the costumes. Thor's new uniform feels more like a cheap Aliexpress cosplay than a warrior garment. And they used the whole Power Rangers transformation joke too much, again. Thor is basically a Power Ranger at this point.We have two characters that were supposed to have tragic arcs, Jane and Gorr. But because there were far too many jokes all the time, their stories got diluted to the point that we don't care. The ending makes no sense. The whole ""worthiness"" thing means nothing at this point. Mjolnir and Stormbreaker were reduced to anime tsundere characters. Korg and Valkyrie didn't have to be here. The whole Korg narration works at first, but repeated too many times becomes very boring.Again, visually the movie is stunning. Great visuals. Hemsworth is in his prime. Battle scenes, taken in isolation, were very well built. Too many great scenes are poorly mixed with too many jokes, and very sloppy editing kills the pace and the tragic storyline. I would go as far as to say that if a better editor took the realm and re-edited this movie without Taika in the room, we would have a movie that I could add 1 or 2 points more, bringing it to at least a respectable 6 out of 10. But the way this movie is right now, it's a 4, at most.Seems like Taika can't be left unchecked. I would say that maybe it was the opposite, Disney demanding too much of him. But the parts that I feel are extra are exactly the Taika-like jokes. This is easily his most unbalanced work. It's a shame because the overall plot has a lot of potentials, and the production value is still very good, but the pieces were glued all wrong. That's my take. Not worth going to the theater to watch this. Wait for the Disney+ release.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Worst of all, however, are the terrible jokes assigned to Thor that are definitely different from those with subtle humor found in previous films. 5 is a too high score, given because of the love for the original character.In hindsight I wouldn't see this movie.

He gave Thor a new breath of personality. Some of the humor was cringy, but it only made Thor feel more real.Unfortunately there is such thing as overdose. And Thor Love and Thunder is exactly that.While TR was full of jokes and humor it also kept some moments of seriousness. Thor Love and Thunder just went full comedy using main character as the butt of the joke for most of the jabs.Some of the jokes were AMAZING (goats, axe, ""moon landing"", olymp, flick).. But for every good joke, there was that one that came at the expense of Thors identity. The kind that left a tiny crack on how we see his persona.Personally: i was not happy with TLT. It had alot of the best jokes and a handful of the very bad, hurtful instead of funny, ones.Also the idea of the title being explained in last minute of the movie... Yeah. Not the best idea.Overall: while i did love some of the scenes I rather disliked it as a whole.

The opposite is true with Love and Thunder. Not a single joke landed, not due to poor chemistry or delivery, but a feeling of forcefulness ruins each joke. It feels like Waititi heard the praises of his last movie and decided to run with that and that only. It doesn't work with this story. Balancing screaming goats with a lead who is dying of cancer is not a good idea. The greatest compliment to this movie I can give is Bale's performance as Gorr. Bale is terrifying, entrancing, and unhinged all at the same time. This greatness from Bale almost is a detriment to the rest of the film, as the tonal clash between the different plots is genuinely distracting. Nothing was more disappointing than Russel Crowe's character Zeus. I was stoked to see what angle they'd take with Zeus. Instead he's just a minor inconvenience on the way to Thor's inevitable victory. Hemsworth and Portman's chemistry is better than it was in any other Thor film, but that isn't saying much. The actors are giving it their all, and I don't blame them in the slightest for the outcome of the film. Instead I blame the 'comedy' writers who overkilled their roll in the writing process.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

-Good/Decent CGI
-Decent ActingSome of the things I thought were wrong with this movie are the same things I think are wrong with the current track of Phase 4:-Too many one-liner jokes/quips at once. Comic relief has always been a hallmark of MCU films, especially the newer ones, but it seems that there are too many jokes at once that you don't have a chance to laugh or even chuckle. It's also not comic relief if you add the same kind of jokes in almost every sequence of every scene. Not many of them landed because they kept trying to be funny with the script instead of putting jokes in at natural cues. It takes away from the actual story or drama that is seriously needed in this movie by adding quips or jokes in every minute.-No Direction to the Overall Plot or Overarching Saga. I didn't have a chance to see the mid or after-credits scenes so I can't even spoil anything here, but from what I heard the mid and after-credits scenes don't add to an overarching plot, which is what they are usually meant for (unless it was a reference to a joke mentioned during the movie). The story itself seems to be stand alone and most conflicts are resolved at the end of the movie. That seems to be the case with the previous movies as well (Multiverse of Madness and Spiderman: No Way Home) and by extension the entirety of Phase 4. There's nothing to look forward to or keep the audience engaged in these stories. Shang-Chi did a stand-alone story, but did it right because we got introduced to new characters that need a stand-alone story, and it connected it to the post-Infinity War Avengers in a mid-credits scene, meaning that there was still something to look forward to. The thrill of crossover characters and the multiverse is gone now; the audience got all of that during the Infinity Saga and are now looking for a new engaging story or plot in which characters from several different movies meet up and fight the big bad. There doesn't seem to be a big-bad yet and there seems to be this awkwardness where Kevin Feige is still experimenting with plot lines while he focuses on ""expanding the multiverse"" without a direction in mind. I hope we get more direction in future films; otherwise more and more people won't be motivated to see more of these films. It just seems like there's more cash-grabbing than actually setting up a real story with passion like the Infinity Saga did.-Christian Bale plays another crappy forgettable villain who has a sword that can ""kill gods"" (a lazy plot device)-Thor's appeal continues to wane. I've loved Thor as a character for a long time now. He's generally regarded to be one of the most powerful characters. But like the state of Phase 4, his character seems to have lost direction as well (that part was even mentioned by Star-Lord earlier on during the movie). The writers also seem to want to make him into a walking punchline in every scene. They got him to lose weight, but all of the other vulnerabilities such as the romantic/physical insecurity of a 13 year old or the constant jokes that don't land are still there. I don't like seeing Thor in this constant insecure state. I hope Chris Hemsworth's contract doesn't expire, or else this would've been a disappointing conclusion to Thor's character.-Jane Foster was reintroduced just because. I was actually looking for some re-introduction to Thor and Jane's relationship. Many of us were wondering why we haven't seen Jane in theaters for almost 10 years (since Thor: The Dark World). I now know why. Her character is boring, pointless, & why the 1st two Thor films didn't excite me. I felt for her in this movie only because of why she becomes she-Thor for a little bit, but that's about it. I could watch another 30 MCU films without Jane Foster in them and be completely content.Overall, it's about what standard MCU fare is these days. Pay money to see it in theaters or don't. You'll get the same result when it's available to stream.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To complicate matters, Mjølner is no swinging by our old BRILLIANT scientist Jane Foster (Nat Portman with big abs), who NOW is The Might Thor. Why, you say? Well, sadly she has 4th stage termal cancer, but visiting Tønsberg, were Åsgård now is run by King (WHY not Queen??) Valkyrie, she spots the pieces of ol' Mjølner, and gets to be Thor. We will never know why. And Thor still loves the NEW Mighty Thor. So this is a love...triangle? Or something.Over to storytime? It's about a godkiller, cause a guy was upset with his God for destroying his family, so he found a sword called Kronos (That's actually the name of the God of War, which is pretty ironic), and starts killing Gods. All soon to the jam of several old hits from Guns N'Roses.In my ""review"" of Thor I mocked the story, talking about how stupid it would be if they got Greek mythology into MCU. BUT look no forther, cause, Thor, Mighty Thor Jane Foster, Korg AND Valkyrie travells to...someplace, and meets the mighty Zeus (fat Russell Crowe)....who is kind of a dick. But that part I liked, cause it's pure comedy. Specially the nice ladies around Zeus fainting when they see Thor's mighty....penis. That's F-U-N. Zeus lightning thingy looked btw incredible stupid, but hey, it's a cartoon movie.So, what did I think of Thor: Blood and Thunder? Oh, not Blood, but Love. It was ok'ish. Compared to the multiverse mess in other movies in stage 5 or whatever, it's a little funride, although director Taika Waititi really has to be hold in strains to keep from comedy which isnt so funny. Oh, we are going for a Guns N'Roses theme, so Heimdall's son wants to be called Axl, the biggest idiot of all vocalists.The movie doesnt do anything really to push the so-called MCU envelope any further. It's action in space, with comedy. I didn't shed a tear when someone ""important"" died, just whatever. BUT the most stupid thing comes in the end credits, when we get exposed to a new ""villain"". Yes, Thor will get hunted by Hercules, Zeus son. And he looked redicilous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

its always more jokes and bad humor than there is serious storyline

bad jokes galore and very little actionCompare this movie to for example the Avengers movies and this

serious about the Thor branch and less make this a ongoing jokefest.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is a difference between being funny and trying to be funny, in Ragnarok they managed to be funny and maintain interest in the story but in Love and Thunder the comedy seems far-fetched and the story loses a lot of prominence.The moments
You can see the use of epic Rock songs to try to compensate but the only thing I perceived was some smear and scenes that sounded epic while the movie made fun of itself, it actually felt like a parody and a generic product.The hero
I also understand that Thor is a good formula for a fun character but they made him a dumb character and also weaker for script convenience.I remember many moments in other Marvel movies but this movie is perfectly forgettable, the only states I was in were laughing, lost and uncomfortable.

Overall, a movie that is poorly executed and cannot be saved with Thor's charm as it tries too hard to be funny with its meta jokes and constant volume of jokes (even when it mostly does not work) as this takes away from actually building a storyline that should really be developed, the relationship between Thor and Jane and how Thor comes to terms with being at the end of his character arc.Bad Direction (Really tries too hard to be funny and really is chaotic with trying to progress the story forward), Acting (Very Good from Chris Hemsworth (Really shows the experience he has with the character and effortlessly is able to command every scene he is in), Very Good from Christian Bale (Really shows the level of dedication he goes through as an actor as he is very captivating even in this villainous role), Pretty Good from Tessa Thompson (A good comedic relief that is menacing this time around and picks up where she left off from the previous film), Decent to Pretty Good from Taika Waititi (Plays the comedic relief character and has his ups and down given the script he wrote), Pretty bad from Russell Crowe (Really was not that convincing as Zeus as his acting was not there and his accent really did not sit right (which is surprising because this role was really written for him)), Decent to Pretty Good from Natalie Portman (Tries a bit too hard in this performance and really falters when it comes to the emotional side of the character (something that is surprising to me given her experience)), Very Good from Matt Damon (It was really funny how he is able to carry on his cameo from the previous movie and have such a small role even though how big he is), Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (though Good from the Guardians of the Galaxy (really just stayed on brand for their characters given how short of screen time they had))), Pretty Bad Story (The overarching story was not that bad as it deals with Thor post Avengers as he is trying to come to terms with unfinished love, it is just not that well structured and the ending really is not that good; plus the general breaks from the narrative were really sloppy and not well executed (given that it was amateur style and it really was not that funny); also, for a movie that is meant to be about Thor and Jane's relationship it does a real bad job in helping develop it (we are kinda just thrown into what happens)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The movie tries way too hard to be funny and because of it only 1/3 jokes really hit in the movie, plus most of the lines are really predictable and bland), Pretty Good Score/Soundtrack (though it is really annoying how much they play Sweet Child o' Mine throughout the movie), Good Cinematography, Decent Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Very Bad Visual Effects (Given the budget for the movie it is really alarming how unfinished and cartoonish it looks, it looks like they did not spend any effort to change this up before the release), Good Costumes (Did a good job in the Asgardian armor), Plot Structure was a real mess as the movie tries to follow a simplistic Marvel structure but tries to be quirky with it with different breaks and changes that it really hurts with the execution; also the rising action in the character arcs was really poorly done and the resolution really is thrown at the audience and the ending really takes away at what it was trying to build, Pacing was incredibly fast (and this is from the short runtime; the movie could have really benefited from 20-30 minutes added to help with developing and building character relationships), Build to climax was fine and pretty typical of Marvel; climax was incredible formulaic and predictable to any Marvel movie, Tone was pretty 80s and i think he did a good job in helping build this (but is too meta at times with how it is like this)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

However the guns n roses soundtrack kick ...all it should :)We then get taken to Jane Foster story which has huge potential and is a main drive of the movie. In fact, it never gets exploited enough due to various pointless subplots, such as the one with Asgard kids...Mad Max 3 anyone? Such a miss from the writers.Now, along with bad cgi and the general feel of a kids movie, we got a very bad looking costumes. At times Thor looks as if in an SNL sketch. The green screens were awful too, so one could conclude that the post production was rushed.Overall started well, with second act being okay and third one being super bad.

I struggled with Thor: Ragnarok and watched it a few times, without feeling much better about it. This is much worse...So, no spoilers, just my opinion:
1. Thor is not a comedian and this film is so stuffed full of one-liners that it becomes a distraction
2. Russell Crowe's accent would be more acceptable at a fruit and veg market, not as Zeus, king of the Gods
3. The script is a mess and it feels like there was no one to pull the writers, producers, and director into line
4. I am now so over Chris Hemsworth and really wish Thor had died in this movie. His muscles keep getting bigger (so boring) and he hams up his role with the same set pieces we've seen in 3 previous movies (even more boring)
5. The constant narration is irritating - talk about a narcissistic piece of film-making! Korg is as welcome as Jar Jar Binks - yeah, I said it!6. Since Stan Lee died it seems Marvel is slowly but surely going downhill. Thor is a parody of himself and it's no surprise that we once again see Matt Damon and a lesser Hemsworth acting out Thor stories. Give me a break!!7. Watch the credits and it looks like the entire Hemsworth clan and their mates were invited to this party... they certainly had more fun than I did watching this crap.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can't say that I'm excited. I also can't say that this will be in another Thor movie, because in the MCU universe it doesn't matter who's name carries the movie, as long as they appeared in any marvel comic everyone's welcome whether it makes sense or not. This leads to a messy storyline and many stars standing in front of a green key. I have to admit, the Omnipotence City looked absolutely stunning, but I would have been much happier watching a good scenario. Every recent MCU movie seems alike. Lots of stars, heroes, CGI, yet another apocalyptic threat, a more interesting mid part before the final fight, credits, a teaser for a future marvel spoof, more credits and a final scene. This has become a total drag. On the plus side : 3 funny scenes and a good villain.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The entire storyline is irrelevant to Thor's character development, Jane is literally just shoehorned in, Gorr's character is wasted, and the side characters are....just irrelevant again. This movie is the answer to the question - What happens when you combine the worst selling series (The Mighty Thor) and the best selling series (Gorr The God Butcher) of a fan favorite character? The answer is that it turns sour. Gorr, who was supposed to be scary, is reduced to a mere kidnapper, and somehow feels way worse than the comic counterpart.

I'm not watching it because I like Thor, god no! I mean he is a fine character I guess. I don't even remember if I liked the previous movie. I think I did. It was the one with Hulk and Jeff Goldblum, or no wasn't there something in between? Did I ever see the Dark World, or was it called the Dark Elf, I won't look it up, that is how much I care. It's possible I saw that movie. Anyway that is all a blurr. Thor is fine, Chris Hemsworth is ok. Don't love him, don't hate him. Again, can't remember if I've seen him in something else? I do remember the all-female Ghostbusters remake but not much else. He is kinda been only Thor. So yeah, I don't know why I'm watching this film.Does anyone care about the MCU anymore? I mean seriously, is it still sold as the mix of multiple different genres and storyline into one big showdown? That sound awfully like a 2010s thing. For the first Avengers movie it was fun I guess, but by the time they are fighting Thanos the amount of footage you have to consume just get up to speed is too much. Feel like you have to do homework to understand who is who and doing what. And the first thing you feel when you watch any of the latest Marvel films is that you're again watching something set up the back story for another upcoming movie which will set up the stage for another movie and so on. The MCU has become the film equivalent of a requiring reading list at the start of the semester, only it never ends. Like a perpetual wheel of sub-par movies.There, the movie is sub-par. There is nothing else to add. The story is generic, the plot is predictable, and the dialogue is atrocious. The film gives the villain a very valid motivation. He is the gods slayer The ""gods"" in this film are horrible. And they're not gods mind you, they're not deities, they're just another type of overpowered super-being. In this ""universe"" a god is not a being that creates life or punishes evil, they're merely beings that seek very basic pleasures. I'm going to stop here; this is already giving it more thought than anybody that worked on this film. That is why this movie is so bad, because it is not interested in what it means (unlike Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 for instance, although it wasn't Nietsche either). It isn't interested in what anything means, it is only interested in rehashing things over and over. Just to keep the wheel spinning while we're waiting for the next one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It feels like Marvel shot their shot in Phase 1 - 3 and is just floundering now. I hope they can find their footing again soon. Just throwing out content isn't going to cut it in the long run. They need to focus rather than trying to give shows to every character, etc.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He looked like a male Wonder Woman. Jane or Ms Thor was a great addition except they played the cancer card so much in the movie. So much I new more about the disease when I left the theatre. It was really off putting.The script was not the great and was really surprised Disney released this. Did they not test screen with the public first?

The film has no personality, it doesn't reach its full potential, it ends up being a victim of itself.The film shows us the journey of Thor after the events of Endgame, in a search for self-knowledge alongside the Guardians, when a threat arises at the level of his death. But don't get involved, what you'll see will be a bland and meaningless comedy. Even though I'm a fan of Ta, I don't recognize her identity in this work, something is made of anyone without any explanation, as if it were a test session.The humor out of time, a rushed and terrible development. Lack of time, because 2 hours of duration doesn't help and ends up ruining the film even more. He's an climax and doesn't convey the emotion he needs, when he has to, he looks robotic and salty.Gorr is a villain and a bad explorer, even though his generic atheism is very well done, Bale delivering much more with his interpretation and his beautiful look, not even the villain is saved.Does Jane become a hero just by being dignified? Does she only get Thor's powers, as it is here by Odin in Thor 1, not her combat and strategic experience, does she learn from nothing? Looks like Mary Sue. Since when did Thor have Odin's enchantment? Why and how do guns have feelings?The soundtrack is good point, it gets boring and ends up becoming bad up to a point. It's all the time. It's a passing experience, if you don't film it and end up being forgettable food court, it doesn't even remember you right.Even though it has one of the best photographs and opening sequence in the MCU, it doesn't save itself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not enough here to love. And definitely lacking any thunder.The first scene in act one showed promise and I actually was excited to see what was to come. Then came Thor. Again made to be a buffoon even though he is 1,000s of years old. As such, he would not be oblivious to the carnage caused as a result of his battles. He would have loved and lost hundreds of times and so Jane would not have been his 'first'. This is one of the points that illustrates that the story writing is weak. The fact that the reassembling of Mjolnir took place off screen just reinforces this point.To me the jokes were not as bad as others make them out to be but they were a distraction. The musical score was complete trash. It was an irritant and did nothing to enhance the mood of a particular scene. The scene which took place in the city of the gods truly does seem as if it were written by a 5 year old.The last scene just further solidified my dissatisfaction with the Marvel formula. A bunch of 'good guys' fights a bunch of generic foot soldiers and somewhere the main hero(es) will defeat the main villain. After so many 'Vanilla' 3rd acts Marvel should give the audience a taste of 'Rocky Road considering these Phase 4 movies have mostly been shyt.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Wouldn't really fit , would it?When we are talking about Batman we also can talk about Christian Bale as ""Gorr"".The character is.. ...lame and his backstory was way to short and unoriginal.

Also everything just looked cheap, bad, and plasticky. For example the 'armour' they wore just looked like the plastic toy viking/roman costume armour that you get from the Dollar Store. While these devices may have worked for Ragnarok, I just feel that they went too far this time, like they thought ""oh, this worked on Ragnarok, let's crank it up to 11!"" I guess the only saving grace is Christian Bale as Gorr, who is sadly and criminally under-used, which might actually be a good thing because the tone of his character really didn't fit in with the whole hokey-jokey tone of the movie.

Can't believe they actually went to space to film this movie. The most immersive experience I've ever had at the teatres. Almost like I was travelling into the space myself.Now, on a serious note, this is a pretty bad movie. To describe it correctly: all of the thor movies have this theatrical bits in them. They are supposed to be a fun parody of the characters. It seems they decided to create the whole movie around this idea which is: thor love & thunder.1) Visuals: the visuals are pretty bad right from the begining. You can tell that they're using green screen in every scene even if you are not deliberately trying to look for it. Can't believe that the movie could look this bad given it's sky-high budget.2) Acting: Christian Bale is descent in the role, but his screentime is too short for being the main villain. Chris hemsworth has portrayed the character of Thor in a much better way in the previous few movies. In this movie, it seems like not too much interested in the role. Right from the beginning of the movie, you can pretty much tell from his face that he probably doesn't want to be there. Credit where it's due, he's in a very good shape. Rest of the cast is just fine.3) Screenplay & tone of the movie: probably the weakest point of the movie. Thor ragnarok was a good 3rd movie in the series, that pretty much saved the thor series & made thor one of the most popular character in the giant MCU family. Part of the reason was the good humor & making thor a badass of a character while still having a serious tone. This movie doubles down on the humor aspect but the quality of the humor has gone down so significantly. The movie seems like a parody of itself. Most of the jokes don't4) Narration of the movie is pretty bad. It's supposed to be over the top I guess. But it turned out to be pretty silly & cringe. I can't understand why they went forward with it.Overall, it not only is a bad movie, but also not entertaining even a little bit, to justify watching it just for fun.

The movie is all over the place. Natalie Portman has always been great actress, but her chemistry with Hemsworth is really bad. The dialogue is silly. The editing is choppy. It's a mess. The worst thing was ""THE TOO MUCH HILARIOS""
It's down there with Captain Marvel, Eternals, Thor 2, Captain America and Black Widow as my least favourite Marvel movies.I really thought it had potential. I didn't mind Jane Foster wielding Mjolnir as much as I thought; it's explained well.But as the Marvel movies are progressing, you begin to question if there are stakes at all. What is there to lose? How do you define 'danger'? Anyone can do anything now and the rules we've been establishing for the past decade are now irrelevant. It's quite annoying.Also, that being said, the movie is still watchable. Marvel's worst movies are still worth watching; they're still fun. It's just they had much more 'refined' movies before.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was excited about it, I was generally really into it all the way through, I was one of those staying every single time until the end of the credits just in case and calling a ""boo"" to those leaving earlier like ""are they new to Marvel? You can't just leave yet, you don't know what's coming!""There was excitement. There was a plan. There was a goal. There was a Thanos slowly bulding himself in the background.I'm not sure where Marvel is going after Endgame. They keep talking about ""we'll start seeing the new plan soon"", but for now I see ""meh"" movies except maybe ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". Then came ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", which was not that multiversal neither that crazy. It was just okay.And now we have Watiti leading a Thor story for the second time... And not as great this time.I don't know where Marvel is going with this, but as a standalone movie, I don't see its potential either. There's no drama even during the dramatic moments because they spent too much dialogue on the jokes, and most of them don't work. The Jane situation, the Mjolnir-Stormbreaker jealous mumbo jumbo... Even the other Gods, ironically specially Zeus, feel like a joke. How come Thor, Jane and Valkirie are the only three people in the entire universe giving a heck about a guy literally killing all the Gods and looking for a way to kill them all at once?The plot felt also... I don't know. Imagine your daughter dies, you go to your beloved god to ask him for mercy and to bring her back and he basically jokes at your face. You know there's an entity you can find that can give you one wish, whatever the heck you want. So what do you do? Instead of looking for It and ask for your daughter back, you decide that all gods in the world are the same, they all deserve to die, you'll kill them all and you'll take that One and Only Wish to ask for them to die at once.That also brings many questions that could shake the foundations of the whole Infinity saga. If there's this known entity that can grant you one wish, whatever in the world you want, why would Thanos spend so many years looking for the Infinity Stones instead of just finding Eternity and ask him to erase half the universe?Or, if the Asgardians know about this entity, why didn't Thor just go for it instead of all those five years of drama, all the time trip mumbo-jumbo, all the sacrifices made? If he was so desperate and self-destroyed about what happened with Thanos in Wakanda it feels a bit weird he didn't even thing about that possibility.I don't know. Bale was amazing as the God Butcher, even when his character ended up being such a generic I-want-my-vengeance-and-you-all-are-gonna-die villain. Thor-Jane was a nice thing to see, even when due to all the jokes and forced lines I wasn't able to feel the drama under her situation.What can I say? Right now I'm not quite sure ""Thor: The Dark World"" is the worst Thor movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Putting aside the tedious narrative that tries to be meaningful, the film simply lacks the level of humour of its predecessor. There's a lot of poor attempts at humour, almost bordering on juvenile. Ultimately, what really bothers me is the sheer budget that went into making this substandard film.

The story clutches at meaning like a thumbless raccoon gathering apples with his tail on fire. The subtext is typical, mindless and utterly predictable. Moo. The costumes were designed by a sideshow barker. The meaning was as clear as a heavy lead curtain and the wit as sharp as a bowling ball: it hurts actually -before- it hits your toe. Cinematog-- oh you mean CGI, yeah we have that. Camera angles? Well, they're kind of boxy with mostly square angles and a round thing at the end.The makeup artist probably needed Harry Potters cloak to get his work past the Peter principle that dominates the rest of the film.There is a difference between character and caricature, unfortunately the director missed it. Like the point, which he missed also. There is a fine line between vision and delusion, but director self-indulgence makes it all a thing of the past. Rejoice numbskulls, a new dawn arises.I gave this film 3 stars. One star entirely for the final after scene with Portman. One star for makeup (Portman and Bale) and one star for the trio (Hemsworth, Portman, and Bale) for the integrity of turning in their usual awesome performance despite riding this donkey cart of destruction strait into a ditch.I offer one additional star if this smoldering stack of stank shows the decency to skulk off to dropped and forgotten story lines where it belongs.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Things I liked: the soundtrack, Christian Bale as the god butcher, the action sequences (particularly on the black and white planet). Things I didn't like: moments that should have emotional weight being undercut by jokes that mostly fall flat, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie has all the charisma of a door knob, killing a potentially significant character with little effort and no regard for consequences in a room full of people with the power to overwhelm our hero who for no explainable reason do nothing.The biggest problem I have with this movie however is less to do with the movie itself and more to do with the journey Thor has taken over the course of the MCU. The first three movies were about Thor learning to be a righteous king and a wise ruler. He learns self-sacrifice and putting the needs of his people first. He learned in Ragnorak that Asgard is a people, not a place, and he had to make the hard decision to sacrifice his home to preserve his people (and even an incredibly emotional moment like that was undercut by jokes). Infinity War provided Thor with a great challenge to the character development he had thus far and ideally his failure to kill Thanos should have made him a more bitter and hardened king, making his people an isolated and battle-hardened nation, prepared to take on another cosmic threat like Thanos, with Thor rediscovering his mantle as righteous king being his character development going forward. But instead, he got lazy, depressed, and fat, making one of the MCU's most tragic characters the brunt of a joke and this movie continues that awful trend. Thor is dumb and constantly outwitted by his counterparts. Everything is a joke and nothing is treated with the seriousness that it ought to be. Characters carry no development from past films and only act in ways that are convenient to carry the script forward. None of the threats carried any weight because the characters never took them seriously. When the movie is so lighthearted, how can the audience be anything but that? Despite some new responsibility late in the film, Thor is just the same as he was when the movie started and it's a shame they didn't use Gorr to his full potential to test Thor and develop his character further.Like I said, I don't hate this movie but it's taking Thor in the wrong direction. Could have been worse but could have been a lot better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But all other things were average or worst.Thor love and thunder... has no clear path and fixed script or story with a goal.Because of many reasons it just cut 2 hours and tried to replicate Ragnarok.

Not much action and all cgi crap and non of fight sequence stands out.Gaurdian of galaxy are in it because of contract I guess.

The plot is razor thin with a very suspect ending, the intro of Zeus et al is a good idea but completely wasted! The thunderbolt looks like toy from Dollarama, and the portrayal of Zeus was pathetic.Why were the Guardians even in here, as towards the end clear opportunities to bring them back in were wasted.MCU seems to have lost the ability to weave stories together, too many movies (and endless Disney+ junk) with no common thread. MCU desperately needs a new villain (Galactus anyone?) to link movies together. Does anyone think it will be Hercules?Only good thing--goats were funny and so was Korg.

Taiki made Thor, Jane most importantly Gorr silly even with Christian Bale great performance. What a waste of talents and time. He even wasted a great talent Russell Crowe. He should never direct a movie ever again in Marvel and I hope never in DC. He had the perfect characters yet he ruined every single one of them. Gorr is strong, powerful and feared. He even enslaved Thor in the comics. I was really hope and expecting to see a great movie but I didn't. I would only recommend seeing it for Christian Bale's performance. Let's hope someone else continue Thor's journey specially with the what happened in the first post-credit scene.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Perhaps that was a good thing.. This time there's not much holding up and here in terms of storyline and script. The acting is mixed and too filled up with comic relief. Though carried with tons of comedy from previous movies, here, it lacks the sharpness and funny spin to it, it's just often too silly.Mr Bale had the opportunity to portray a fantastic villain, still there wasn't much time added to the character that would carry through the film. A good performance but needs more depth in storyline & script to add more to the whole movie.Hemsworth does a solid performance, as always since he's grown to really own this character fully. But it gets too silly and too flat from time to time. What's needed here is the depth and darkness from for example Wolverine, where you truly got a new dimension to the character. If the route would've been more dark and emotional I think there's a chance this could've climbed a few steps. A dark thor and a darker bale could've really smacked it out the park.I hope they dare to darken Thor and give him more sadness, his character needs it and WE need a more emotional story from here one, enough with the silly humor.A mediocre movie at best! 5/10./Rob.","0 out of 12 found this helpful.

But Taika Waititi just couldn't resist and we have more childish humor that just doesn't work, and thats basically the film, normal swimming along then stupid jokes to kill the flow. Its such a long way from how the original Thor films were.Some cameo's that are just annoying and stupid, and a lot of very good actors being totally wasted.I'd be pretty annoyed if I'd payed to see this at the cinema to be honest, at least it was 'free' on disney plus.I'm sure really young kids would find it amusing? Maybe??Its a clear sign that Marvel have totally lost their way, they have nothing to replace Ironman or the Avengers and you just don't really care what happens to the characters in this movie, The story doesn't really make a whole lot of sence especially when you think back to end game etc, hundreds of 'gods' just sitting around and not one of them got involved with taking out Thanos, an ultimate supreme being who anyone could have visited at anytime who would sort out the mess - but no one did etc etc so it really doesn't flow with the rest of the universe.Highs - Bale is excellent

When the joke about the dramatization of Thor and Loki showed up I looked at my wife, wondering why Ragnarok's scene had been recycled. I guess it proves the director ran out of ideas.The film got better after they meet Zeus but still, everything feels too easy and nothing is at stake. Without spoiling it, you know from the first minutes to lives and dies at the end. No mystery here. Finally, wasn't the hammer on one piece at the end of Endgame?

I regularly lamented them for their excellent work bringing all the storylines together in Avengers whilst making entertaining solo movies. Yes there were a few dull movies however overall the stories were excellent with some great plots and character arcs.Thor's own arc was great. They took fun of his god like arrogance yet made him a serious person. A leader with integrity and a brain. I was interested to see where this would lead however this new movie is like a total spoof and completely destroys his character. The actors who play him on the stage within the movie are actually less of a caricature of Thor than Helmsworth.Straight from the off it feels like we're in a Monty Python movie with the back story to Cristian Bales antagonist. Natalie Portman is also a strange version of Jane that nowhere near matches up with her previous version.The story is just stupid, unexplained, unbelievable and without any feeling or jeopardy due to the farce of a script. The funniest parts were actually the bits we were supposed to feel sad at as it was just so ridiculous.I feel like I'm done with the Marvel movies now. I thought Strange 2 was along a similar vein but still a lot more engaging than this turkey.It feels like they are just taking the mickey now and throwing together whatever rubbish they can in the knowledge that fans will still go to watch it.The only good thing I can say is that whoever edited the trailers deserves a raise as they made me think I'd enjoy this movie.

Thor and his constant one-liners, screaming goats that just annoy and endless puns with no content or grounding.I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a film. This makes a mockery of the Marvel universe and removes all credibility from the character of Thor.I'm shocked that such a sound director,Taika Waititi, would ruin his reputation and make this film. Jojo rabbit was spectacular and yet this falls short in so many ways.I truly wouldn't waste your time watching such a film, it will ruin the Marvel universe for you so you're better off watching paint dry.No diving in this pool. There's no depth. Save this for an unpaid viewing on Disney+ if you're a subscriber. If not, wait to get it on loan from your local library after it comes out, and go see Top Gun: Maverick again.Just got back from seeing this with my 17- and 18-year-olds... and we're just stunned at how underwhelming this movie was. My 17-year-old described it pretty succinctly as, ""really just jokes, and most of them not funny, with punching in between."" She said, ""When I was younger, I used to look forward to every Marvel movie. These are just bad."" My 18-year-old used more expletives.A couple of good things... I have to say Christian Bale played a great, at times creepy villain, Gorr the god butcher. Second, Taika Waititi uses some different and interesting filming techniques while the heroes fight Gorr on a small moon.But while Gorr was probably the most interesting character, he varied little--just slamming his sword in the ground, calling forth shadow creatures, and then striking his sword against good guy weapons. That's pretty much it.Other concerning issues:1. Man, Thor's time with the Guardians of the Galaxy was wasted. I wonder what the storytellers behind Endgame envisioned for that team-up. Their time as a ""team"" fizzles before it starts... and Waititi definitely doesn't bring out the same in the actors that James Gunn does. Just as generic dialog as you can get. One has to ask, ""Why was Thor even with these guys?""2. There's just no depth to these characters. Viewers feel little, if any, connection to any of them. There is a hook to Jane Foster, but Natalie Portman's acting is akin to her Padme Amidala performance. After all he's been through, Thor regresses to the Homer Simpson-like character he was in 2011's Thor.3. I'm not sure if Waititi knows who his intended audience here is. It's like he aims for kids with certain events in the end... but this Thor flick has more swearing, violence, and nudity than what we've seen before. If you're going to give us all that, how can you end with Thor (spoiler) bestowing his powers on whom he does? And, if Thor can do that, then why couldn't he grant his powers in the same way to the Asgardian parents, at the start of the movie, so they could prevent their kids from being taken??? And this leads to points 4 and 5:4. It's a shame... once again we see the common thread in all Disney is putting out over the last couple of years: Lackluster story telling. It's a bunch of random, ""You know what'd be funny/cool"" moments strung together in the hope it will all gel. It doesn't. It. Doesn't. This is inexcusable considering the money and creative ""talent"" behind Disney and Waititi. The actors in this film were paid who knows how much for this sub-par creation. It's another rushed product, and I found myself thinking, ""Now Disney's pushing Waititi to crank out a Star Wars trilogy? This movie shows the danger that could follow."" Marvel Phase 4 continues to mostly disappoint...5. This may be the most irritating to me.This film is used as just another set-up, this time on the big screen, to launch another minor character Disney hopes to make $$$ off of. They've used it to introduce (spoiler) kid Thor for what I'm sure is their upcoming Young Avengers. Isn't anyone else tired of seeing a quality character's time in the spotlight being used to promote another supporting character--Bo Katan, Ahsoka Tano, Kate Bishop's Hawkeye, etc. These add so, so little to the major characters' story arcs we'd rather be watching.But fear not true believer! Very soon you will get your Marvel version of Saved By The Bell!","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story is entertaining, with some exciting moments, but the tone is what makes it not so good, it's very childish, the jokes and the way it approaches some interesting topics like love is very silly, it seems that children wrote those parts, there is no maturity in the story or in the characters, that is the most counterproductive thing about this film. But the rest is everything that we would expect from a Marvel movie, good special effects, entertaining fight scenes, a predictable but enjoyable story, new characters, some cameos and very childish jokes.It's definitely not trying to be something it's not, the director knows what franchise the movie is in and does a good job with the narrative, but the very childish and silly tone of the movie makes it not the best or the most remarkable among the movies of this character.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

Kenneth Brannagh did a very good job.I struggled with Dark World; it was considerably weaker. Then the switch to comedy came with Ragnarok, which seemed very popular but I found it hard to get through once again.Love and Thunder goes back to basics with a decent, simple story but unfortunately just has too much super power tennis. Clashes are just bam, bam, bam, bam, win/lose. Then, the other to serve and I can't get into any of that kind action, which is prevalant in most MCU movies and just lacks effort in the writing.The comedy and serious emotional moments don't mix too well either. The light vibe was just lost.Jane Foster as Thor was fun but why she was called Thor I don't get. Why not just be called The Mighty Dr Foster or something? No harm to the plot but these kind of token hand-me-downs are distracting.Overall, not much to write home about. It was OK watch but less good than Captain Marvel, which was already heading in the direction of generic super power movie.I'm not a big MCU fan but I suspect even those that are will find this a bit forgettable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Reaching the top with extraordinary revenue and strong characters only to stumble down with no sense of direction or balance. It is, quite frankly, hard to watch. This colorful mess of a movie should not be a Marvel entry. The God of Thunder is one of the strongest and most feared deities in ancient Norse Mythology, and Marvel's portrayal of him needs to be closer to the ruthless warrior people he represents. The Thor we see in this movie is a domesticated, apologetic wimp. It makes me wonder who the MCU is catering to. I dare say, the majority of the fandom have little to no knowledge of the source material and won't spend money on seeing this type of movie. The colors were overexposed, the plot was only so-so, the writing was bad and I will not even dive into the extreme sexism in the Zeus-scene. The comedic reliefs were lame, while Christian Bale's Godbutcher was genuinely undervalued and wasted. I don't see the MCU recovering to its former glory after the less-than-mediocre installments post Endgame. Marvel has clearly chosen to focus more on identity politics than actual character building which ultimately is reflected in the box office.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Christian Bale's Gorr is a really great villain, truly scary with some Voldemort vibes (if a little too much at times).As the movie starts you're not sure where Thor's place is and where has the story got to go after everything that has gone before.

However, an aspect of the film I really loved was the storyline involving Jane Foster, and I wish that had been pursued further, but isn't explored to its fullest possibilities. Christian Bale's performances also felt slightly over exaggerated to me also, and the action scenes seemed quite poorly directed to me also.Ultimately, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a stone-cold crowd pleaser, which, if that's what you're looking for, you will love this, but, if you're looking for something more, I'd recommend 'Doctor Strange' 2 instead.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved all the previous movies, including the last one Thor: ragnarok. It was clever, visually stunning and funny. This movie was very weak. Bad acting, really not funny, it felt like a parody and not a real movie. CGI was very poor as well. There were parts of it that made me cringe. Natalie Portman was completely miscast. She's a great actress but she wasn't suitable for this role. First 30 minutes are unwatchable but then it picks up a big. Christian Bale was the only good thing in it. I'm surprise someone greenlit it and produced it. I hope it was an off movie for them. Looking forward to the next better Thor.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He mocked out of this character and by this he mocked out of all the true fans from the entire world, starting from Thor Ragnarok with a lot of brainless scenes, like the one in which Thor is being electrocuted, after he discovers the powers of lightning.

Every Family member of Gorr died, his last SON also died. Gorr got convinced that there is no such thing called God and his ancestors fooled him since childhood. Later he found that Gods actually exist, but they are so busy in themselves that they no longer bother about people's suffering. Thus he killed a God with Necrosword. Then he baptized himself with the blood of the god he killed. Then he started killing other gods in vengeance and became a god butcher (why not named 'god slayer'? Because marvel universe already had one god slayer with name of knull). He kept absorbing powers of gods he killed and kept on becoming more and more powerful, and thus was able to create a living copy of his wife and son ujsing Necrosword. Still he wanted to kill all gods in all universes. As the sword was corrupting his health, he had less time to travel multiverses, find all gods and kill them all. So he started creating a super weapon to do this thing in one go. He started enslaving gods to work for him. In this attempts, he captures multiple Thors from different timelines and universes. As he had captured hundreds of gods and became master of them, his wife calls him a God himself. He angrily kills his wife, his son gets angry due to this. He had finally become what he hated the most - gods. He was now the 'god of hypocrisy'. His son decided to help all Thors, All Thors unite and kill him.Final twist in story - he still does not die, just disappears..Now coming back to Thor Love and Thunder, nothing of that sort happened in this movie. It was a movie purely made for kids. Story was not aligned with any part of marvel comics. Mighty Thor was unnecessarily introduced, stupid jokes ruined the fun. Overall, the move was a big let down as compared to other Thor movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And wasn't hungry for more after.But with Love and Thunder it was like eating a Big Mac at Macdonald's, I did enjoying eating it but it just wasn't the same as that great burger I ate at that great restaurant, and after I finished the Big Mac I still wasn't really satisfied plus I was still hungry.And now actually talking about the movie, the thing that botherer me the most was that the seriousness didn't mix great with the sillyness as it did with Ragnarok, the emotional scenes didn't really hit me and the jokes didn't land. It was also kinda chaotic and inconsistent.Luckily I didn't go into this movie with too much expectations, so I enjoyed it for what it is:

As everyone was exiting the theatre, I was delighted to overhear a group of high schoolers say that they will never sit down and watch a movie ever again. They seem to be a sharp group of kids.The entire movie front to back contained less substance than the vacuum of space itself. During the climactic buildup, I came to IMDB and took the opportunity to remove a star from my beloved Thor: Ragnarok review in order to offset the one star I was required to give this abomination. This gave me just enough time to return my focus to the movie, where I could watch the comically atrocious ending.One person in the theatre clapped as the credits rolled. I believe they should be arrested.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, some were very funny but most were not, I think I sat through this movie with a dumbfounded look on my face. I love most Marvel movies but this one was just bad. I almost stopped it halfway through but kept giving it a chance. Also the story was just bad. This was the best acting I've seen from Portman and Bale did the best he could with the roll given to him. It was extremely hard to take this movie seriously, what a huge disappointment.

What a way to waste some potentially great characters and actors. Natalie Portman really could have delivered well with the jane story-line but they gave her entire role a comedy aspect to it?? I know it ties to old thor films but those films didn't work so this was the chance to really change her character around and they failed majorly. What happens to Jane is still interesting and probably the second most interesting arc in the film but they tone it down horribly. As for Bale? Not only barely in the movie but they also severely watered his storyline down. Although, he actually delivered on the performance. Two of some of the best Thor storylines really just tossed in the trash shoot. Every other character was also horribly utilized and I would have been okay with Thor's repeating character arc and goofiness if everything else in the film was turned up a notch. Or actually given creative and serious thought. I will say the moment they entered the world where Zeus and all the Gods were till the moment where the black and white scene ends, my eyes were glued to the screen. They were good getaway scenes and had the action comedy, romance, and entertainment I was expecting. Thor questioning the Gods himself and Jane's one serious moment, it looked creative specifically the black and white scene and Gorr actually seemed like a Villain I wouldn't want to go against for a minute. The comedy was paced in much better in these moments and in general It was the only effective scenes of the film. I would call it the middle act, whereas it is squished inbetween two other acts that were pointless, lazy, rushed, and all-around ineffective. The new character at the end seems like they could be interesting in the future but made the character that brought that character into the film feel even mire lazy. At least Multiverse of Maddness actually put in effort in the all around story, the comedy was in the back seat, and most sequencers were entertaining; it was just the writing that was weak. I can't even say what it is about Thor that they failed at because it kind of seems like they through anything at the wall to see what lands.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was my first time watching MCU at a cinema and I enjoyed it as fast food but not as great delicious food. So I want to thank my friend who took me to watch it. Otherwise I would write not good thing a lot. It was for watching with friends and having fun.I haven't watched any of phase 4 of MCU but I wasn't confused which is good because phase 3 requires a lot of informations of previous series but not this film.I realised that MCU presents social issues and asks to the audiences but never gives them any of answers. I did liked it but I can accept now somehow.There were so many heavy theme in this film ex. Religions, killing the gods, the way of using rest of the life and so on. However its director Taika Waititi showed us that how light he was going to show those issues in this film in the explanation part at the beginning. And there were too much comedy parts looking like a parody which I laughed a lot.I like the fight in the colourless planet.I generally liked it in some reasons which I watched it with my friend at a cinema and comical parts ex. Stopping two bikes with legs, two nosy goats, a speaker, the god of the dumplings, nude and so on. But I wonder Taika Waititi's intention in this film. 'Thor: Ragnarok' included his origin Kiwi and 'Immigrant Song' by Led Zeppelin fitted so much this concept was quite similar to James Gunn who directed 'Guardians of the Galaxy' series and 'The Suicide Squad'. However, he didn't do it in this film even he could do it. Guns N' Roses sounded cool in this film but there wasn't any deep meanings. Maybe he intentionally didn't put those things. MCU films make so much money anyway even it's not great. What if he makes 'damn' one? It's still able to make big money. It can be his irony for the world.I felt a bit bad about the children's fighting because of the Ukraine situation.Every single actors were good. Specially Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Russel Crowe and Matt Damon.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

So this is a review for MCU in general and not the movie. I think comic book multiverse is different from live action multiverse and after delivering the best Marvel movie ever in ""no way home"" MCU is now headed to a downward spiral due to too many characters (they ended up messing Kingpin of all characters, the most intimidating villain MCU gave us) and not many of them being nearly as charming as the original Avengers of MCU. And the stories will get too convoluted probably. Remains to be seen but I think Spiderman was it, not much to be expected. Look at doctor strange, Ms Marvel, and probably now thor. Only 1 I have hope for is guardians of the galaxy, I have a strong hunch that quantummania is going to bomb despite antman being my favourite character of MCU. Introduction of X-Men won't bide well for MCU spiritually, though they will earn tons.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.
