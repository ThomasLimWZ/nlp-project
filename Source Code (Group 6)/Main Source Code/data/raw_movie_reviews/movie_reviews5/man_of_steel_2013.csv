Watching this again in 2020, I have to say this will go down as a classic in years to come. It's an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the most loyal adaptations and faithful to the Superman lore found in DC comics. One of its greatest achievements was the magnificent depiction of Krypton and giving Zod the gravitas and motivation that he lacked in Superman II. You felt empathy for him. Shannon was outstanding in his portrayal of Zod; up there with Ledger's Joker.I remember people actually complained about the level of destruction in this movie and the excessive use of special effects, but for me this is what makes a Superman movie. Take off your nostalgia tinted glasses and watch this with an open mind. This is the greatest Superman movie bar none.","590 out of 676 found this helpful.

Battle scenes are good, I can feel Zack Snyder ""300"" sensation in here.Henry Cavill succeeded bringing a whole new version of Superman to the big screen.

Admittedly, I went in with high expectations, but I thought the names behind the movie, the actors and the beautiful trailer justified my high hopes.And - at first - I thought it was all going to work out. For the first 40 minutes or so, this movie is awesome. Krypton, an ALIENated Clark Kent doing odd jobs on earth, a confused boy trying to cope with his powers...Some reviewers have bashed the movie for being too serious, but there's nothing wrong with a little seriousness, or a little reverence towards the character. In the first half, I think the tone is perfect. A little dark, sure, but it all feels like we're building up towards something truly awesome. Then, kind of suddenly, the main story with Zod and the action starts. And, as much as I love action movies, I really wished it hadn't.When the serious actions starts, all coherent story telling stops. In the blink of an eye the movie goes from feeling like a sci-fi Batman Begins to Transformers 3 minus the nuanced story telling. Suddenly Superman is here and we get these big sweeping beautiful scenes, and they're just completely boring and out of place. And I don't even want to talk about the totally contrived Lois Lane - Superman romance. (Lots of sighs, and ""WTF?"" comments at the theater I was in).I kept waiting for it to recapture the tone of the first half, but the action just keeps getting bigger and dumber. In the middle of the unending action spectacle of the second half, I actually nodded off.This movie had the creative talent, and the actors to make something really great. And I feel like without a Michael Bay explosion quota maybe they could have done it here... But in the end this is a missed opportunity.","1,056 out of 1,862 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Man of Steel is a action packed yet flawed Superman movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9174442/?ref_=tt_urv","anywaychannel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur164933616/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2023","Man of Steel is a action packed yet flawed Superman movie.Man of Steel centers around Clark Kent who is an alien sent to earth as a baby by his father Jor El after his home planet Krypton explodes.Clark spends most of his time in hiding until General Zod, a prisoned kryptonian criminal comes to earth looking for him as Zod plans to turn earth into Krypton using a world engine.Clark must now stop Zod from terraforming the earth as Superman.When I heard they were doing a reboot of the Superman franchise it didn't really shock me.Mostly because the last few Superman movies weren't exactly a whole lot to write home about with Superman 4 (1987) being a disaster due to its low budget and the underwhelming Superman Returns (2006) which wasn't bad but not exactly really exciting either.Man of Steel however manages to be a more actioned pack but also a little more dreary.The movie starts off on Krypton where we see the typical events of Joe El sending Kal El aka Superman to earth but they add a little more to make it more exciting. Like having there being a war while the planet was getting ready to explode and having Jor El actually fighting General Zod which I liked.I will admit there is a little too much going on in it though because not only is there a war happening but also they have other things happening like them explaining that Kal El is the last natural Kryptonian birth and him having something called the codex embedded into him.Which I guess is also interesting but because you can tell they're trying to rush through the Krypton scenes so we can get to the main earth scenes it feels a little rushed.In fact the whole 1st act where they tried to tell Superman's origin again is kind of all over the place because after the krypton scenes they cut to Kal El (now Clark Kent) as a adult which was kind of weird as I was expecting them to go over all the stuff that happens to him in as a kid/teenager in a cohesive straight forward story but instead they just randomly flashback to his childhood every so often which was really distracting.Thankfully as soon as we get to the 2nd act they stop doing that and the movie straight up just becomes an action movie with Superman fighting the kryptonians which was much better.In fact all the action in this movie is amazing. A huge improvement over Superman Returns (2006), a movie that definitely lacked that.I will admit though the characters and plot fall a little flat at times.I don't know if it's because the 1st act of the movie was kind of all over the place but all the characters in the movie feel a standard.Like they're not bad or anything just okay.Mostly because there's not a whole lot of sense of joy or fun in this movie save for a couple of scenes which I guess makes sense considering the plot but it also makes the movie feel a bit lacking too.The camera work in this movie is also terrible with a lot of shaky cam which I'm not a big fan of. I mean the camera even shakes when there just talking and it's really distracting/annoying.Still though this movie is a lot more entertaining than Superman Returns (2006) due to all the action and I can see why it has its fans.I just wish the movie was better constructed (Especially in the 1st act) and the characters were a little more upbeat.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

We've come a long way since then and special effects/CGI has elevated the film experience to heights we could have only imagined. I put that all into perspective and appreciate each version of Superman according to the time frame in which it was filmed. When ""Man of Steel"" was first released, it didn't really grab me. Why not? It had the most incredible cast so what was it lacking? Looking back at the movie, I compared it to, ""The Avengers"" which was released within a year of ""Man of Steel"". The MCU had humor, humor, humor and in case you didn't catch it the first time ... HUMOR. ""Man of Steel"" did not. The director/producers attempted to insert total gravitas as its driving force and that translates to a cinema experience without punch/pizzazz. ""Man of Steel"" could have been any movie which portrays a struggle between any normal person's struggle to balance his biological parents/humanity/personal strength. And it didn't do it all that well. This makes me sad. As I've said, I'm a Superman fan.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

"4","/10","This movie has no soul","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816589/?ref_=tt_urv","spuzer55","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37897144/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2013","I was really excited to see this movie considering all the creative and successful names that were attached to it. However I came out of it more frustrated than anything else. I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't, and here are some reasons why: Straight from the beginning, I couldn't help but notice that the movie was trying too hard to be similar to recently successful sci fi films rather than trying to find its own style (Avatar, The Avengers, Batman Begins and the Matrix come to mind). Then there were the minor plot holes, inconsistencies and lack of believability or followthrough that would have brought that extra touch of realism. But the real downfall of the film was the matter-of-fact and detached style by which it was presented to the audience. This left the movie emotionally empty and with no one to identify with. As the movie continued it became more of the same going through the motions (ok now this happened, and now this happened, oh and now this is happening) to the point where I didn't really care about the movie or characters any more, I just wanted the monotony to be over. This is the reason it felt rushed and long at the same time, like key elements were underdeveloped and missing. This is a great example of how you can have the most massive, amazing grandiose scale special effects and world altering events on screen but without the proper build up and audience investment I didn't really care about the characters, and continued to grow bored until I just wanted it to end. The trailers were more suspenseful than the actual movie for crying out loud.I'm not sure whose fault it was- the editor, the director, the script, post production but a little more than half way through it started to feel like it was dragging. You can walk out of a really enjoyable film after 3 hours and not realize how much time has gone by. I would not have minded if the movie was 15 minutes longer but had the slightest bit of suspense, emotion or character development in it. It felt like it was cut down to its bare bones- you cant omit that stuff to make room for more special effects, if that is in fact what they were doing. No amount of action can ever replace good story telling. Instead what we got was clichéd one liners and characters going through the motions interacting with themselves so to speak instead of playing off each other, like in a bad video game. Even great acting from Michael Shannon and Russel Crowe wasn't enough to elevate their characters from appearing as one-dimensional cliff notes. It's not being too picky when you want something essential and basic that every movie should have and when many people didn't like the movie for the exact same reasons. I also found the writing to be lazy, and without giving too much away, certain plot elements could have been used to show that Superman was not just all brawn but brains as well. Plus, Lois knows and thats just boring. It seems to be a growing trend in blockbuster movies these days, while trying to make the movie more modern, technologically up to date and fit for a younger audience, story telling takes a back seat to cheap thrills and special effects to get more people into the theater. It's a shame then that this movie feels like an attempt to mash together as many unoriginal blockbuster genres with as much mindless action special effects as humanly possible, most likely in an attempt to compete in the 'how big can we make this' superhero franchise. I like special effects and I know its good for business, but does the movie making process have to suffer to such an extent as a consequence? Even the Avengers with its multitude of characters was able to pull of an engaging thrill ride compared to this. To those trying to undermine the critics I have a few things to say. I like Snyder's previous films and particularly enjoyed Watchmen, so I would have had no problem with a darker of more serious version of Superman, except this movie was none of those things. I feel a lot of people who will defend the movie don't have much to say besides 'superman was a badass compared to other movies' and 'it was visually impressive'. They refuse to see the whole picture and realize that a shiny toy is just a shiny toy. The critics didn't rate this movie poorly because it was serious, dark or they didn't like Snyder's style- it was because the movie didn't have a unique character, or any style Snyder is famous for. While that 'satisfied feeling' you had at the end of the movie instead of the 'wanting more' feeling really shows how mundane it really was. A movie of this magnitude should leave you wanting more, for a sequel or at least for a second viewing. After watching this movie I had no desire for either of those things. Just because a film has amazing special effects does not automatically make it a good movie. What this movie did was ironically give me a new appreciation for Superman Returns. While Bryan Singer's approach to the character and story was somewhat dated, it was a polished work that (while it didn't appeal to everybody) was executed very well in all aspects, especially story telling. The difference is that people didn't like MOS not because it had a unique style, but because it wasn't a complete film, and the difference shows. An ideal Superman movie in my opinion would combine the best aspects of both films. A modern approach with exciting and relatable character development and story telling that Superman deserves. Just felt like I needed to express my disappointment and frustrations at this squandered potential.","159 out of 296 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill is fantastic and I enjoyed the take on Clark choosing to live in obscurity instead of the happy-go-lucky reporter at the Daily Planet. It felt very grounded.I enjoyed Diane Lane's performance alot. Costner and Adams aren't given alot to work with. Whilst Costner kind of stumbled through Adams' performance outshines the limited story and dialogue. But I agree with others who have said that the chemistry between Cavill and Adams is VERY forced. And finally I'm always going to enjoy seeing Chris Meloni and Richard Schiff appear on my screen.Now I pretty much hated everything Krypton related in this movie. Starting with the atrocious aesthetics between the costumes and sets. It's so black and plastic looking. And there were alot of names, references and long winded explanations of what was happening that never really made sense or came together to form a coherent picture. It's like they committed at the beginning to telling ""Krypton's story"" but halfway through realised it was going to be too much work so they did the bare minimum.The actor who played Zod was terrible (a charmless, Cookie cutter bad guy) and who the hell cares who else was tagging along with him.

Watched all its trailers on IMDb itself. And look what they did.Snyder wanted to make his masterpiece. He probably considers himself a genius. But seriously are we so foolish that we consider such a movie with no decent plot and no clever twists or character development not only good but GREAT.Well its not.The first half is basically introducing kal-el and his extraordinary abilities and hiding them from the world. It is slow , uninteresting but however provides decent possibility of a lift up in the second halfNow is when it gets worse.The second half is filled with special effects, CGI and nothing more.The last half hour had me yawning and cursing zack snyder.This could have been a masterpiece. It had all the elements but missed the thread that ties it all together. And i do not think that nolan was associated with the project in any creative way. The first half was nothing special and the second half was just blowing stuff and 'aliens' beating each other,buildings been torn apart and similar BS.Almost all the actors were wasted.Although Kevin Costner was good in the screen time he had. Russel Crowe was completely wasted and so was adams. Henry Cavill didn't have to do much but to make weird sex faces while flying. Nothing special about the others either.I had great expectations from this but they were not met. Rather i left the theater bored, cheated and poorer.So i suggest not to waste your money on this.The 3d was nothing special either. Overall this was a huge disappointment.And please don't compare this to Batman Begins. Its not even in the same class.1/10 and thats because i am a generous fella........and i don't have a choice.","563 out of 1,115 found this helpful.

So how does it compare? Favourably.The original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi 'head in a bottle' character using him to explain Supe's back story in the original, Crowe's character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.Really enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)","91 out of 116 found this helpful.

The first half is beautiful, touching, well-written and goes on an engaging exploration of this iconic figure; but when the action starts it's almost as if a different writer and director took the helm. Shaky cam simultaneously adds to the sense of you being there in the middle of things but also makes it so you actually can't see what the hell is going on. The majority of the second half of MOS is basically a blurry cloud of dust and flames with occasional glimpses of the characters in the middle of it all.The first half though - was a clean 9/10. The destruction of Krypton was a visual feast, the letting go of Cal El by his parents was genuinely touching and I even felt a tear welling. The film smartly jumped straight into adult-superman's life and presented his backstory with Jonathan and Martha as well-done flashbacks. Michael Shannon was incredible and sympathetic as Zod. Kevin Costner was simply brilliant (stole this movie imo). It was all good until - well, I dunno what happened really, I guess the suits up on high decided that they had to meet a quota of destruction or something, so they just abandoned all story, characterization, and theme and went for the big light show.Big, BIG shame.The closing few minutes of the movie, do redeem it a little, but after the hour of shaky cam headache that came before it, it's too little too late to save everything. Two major elements that made the Reeve movie so memorable are missing here. First, Lois knows who Kent is from the outset, so there's none of that tension of his discovery to be explored. Second, there's not even a single bar of homage to the iconic music in the theme of MOS. I understand that Snyder and Nolan were trying for a brave new direction but to remove those two supporting structures without replacing them with something similarly strong is just asking for the roof to come down.All said and done though, I'm glad I saw it, it was mostly enjoyable, and being a superhero movie fanatic I'll probably own it on DVD as soon as the price drops to reasonable levels. But if you think it's going to be as solid or spectacular as The Avengers you'll be sorely disappointed.","16 out of 30 found this helpful.

Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It's easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe's integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill's superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing. It's such a powerful film that never ceases to amaze and inspire awe.","22 out of 35 found this helpful.

The movie marks the return of the DC Comics iconic superhero to the celluloid after a seven- year-long hiatus following the abysmal show of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006).Co-written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill in the role of the eponymous superhero—a part that was immortalized by the late Christopher Reeve. The movie's stellar ensemble cast includes the likes of Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Russell Crowe (as Jor-El), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), and Michael Shannon (as General Zod).Man of Steel takes a departure from the trademark style of the ""Superman"" films starring Christopher Reeve. Make no mistake! Man of Steel's striking contrast to its predecessors is not merely because of its technical supremacy (3D, Special Effects, etc). Even the makers choose to make a statement by opting for a title that doesn't have the word ""Superman"" attached to it (not to mention about Superman's new costume). In fact, it would be safe to look upon this rather drastic transformation as a paradigm shift. Man of Steel serves to be a decent summer flick with truckloads of entertainment value for the casual viewers. But, sadly, for the most part, it remains limited to entertainment. Snyder shows flashes of brilliance but fails to capitalize on those strong moments. Man of Steel offers a lot a promise but falls short of living up to it. At best, it serves to be a run-of-the mill sci-fi adventure that is all style but very little substance. Hopefully, Snyder and team will learn from their mistakes and make a strong comeback with the forthcoming installments. 6.5/10A more detailed review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","18 out of 35 found this helpful.

The entire project is based on computer graphics explosions and destruction. They destroy building after building after building, gas station, supermarket, skyscraper, until you are just bored with the repetitive plot. It is terrible. The fighting is a blur and Superman is just not his super self. Don't waste your money unless you are a young male looking for a movie that looks like a video game. I am so disappointed that they made an awful Superman movie. If you like anything besides violent fights and explosions, you'll be bored to tears.

Unfortunately, the treatment for the plot is as shallow as it can get. I understand the directors perspective, and what he was trying to show, but it just doesn't connect, all the suffering kid Clark has, feels completely unnecessary, we all know Superman's abilities, nobody is worried about what 'they' will do to him, the whole outcast thing doesn't add up. In fact at a particular point in the movie, it becomes enough. The emotions between the father and the child were portrayed in an exuberantly poor and soulless manner. Clark shares a much more convincing relation with his Kryptonian father - Jor-El, and also with Lois Lane. Zod is a very interesting Antagonist whose potential has been completely wasted, Instead all we get is some ridiculously heavy fist fighting. The problem with the treatment to the movie, is that, they tried to over complicate the story, what was supposed to be a simple and enduring story has now turned into a convoluted attempt at 'adapting' it to a modern audience who have seen the story a couple of times already. Do not get me wrong here, as i have already mentioned, the plot holds a lot of promise, but fails to deliver.Liked : The plot line, Jor-El, Superman(Not Clark), Lois ZodDisliked: The tone of the movie (a little unnecessarily grim and sad), Clarks human father, Clark, The lack of intelligence in most of the characters. ( This seems to be something in more then one of Zack Snyder's films )Final verdict : Mindless Blockbuster :: The studios should really stop making these sort of movies, extravagant CGI doesn't really make for a good movie, if a commercially entertaining movie is all that is aimed for, at least do it like the avengers / star trek, where the intention of the movie is to entertain and engage the audience, and not be some pseudo philosophical drama.","22 out of 46 found this helpful.

All I can say is WOW! This movie was all I could ever want from a Superman movie. I've been a superhero and Superman fan my entire life. However, the Superman character in the movies was always so tacky and the movies as a whole were just average. Man of Steel, though, is completely different.I thoroughly enjoyed how they made the character of Superman much more realistic (as realistic as he could be). Henry Cavill was the perfect choice as he made Superman seem like an actual man. To make this easier, I'll list the pros and cons in my opinion:Pros:1. The plot was extremely well done. The movie really took the time and effort to explain everything and made sure it connected. 2. Henry Cavill has the ""look"" of Superman (just look at him without a shirt) and knows how to give him more human qualities. 3. The special effects were stunning. Everything from the explosions to the future technology was believable.The flying especially was jaw-dropping. 4. The acting was superb. I especially enjoyed Crowe and Costner, but everybody did a phenomenal job (Amy Adams bothered me at times but that was just her character, not here). 5. The ending (not going to say what it is) gave me chills. 6. The use of flashbacks was effective in telling the story. 7. It was a believable superhero movie. 8. There are some good one-liners that are memorable.Cons: (Not many)1.It was a little slow at times but only because the background or plot was being explained. Superman fans won't mind this at all, but the casual moviegoer might. 2. Some action scene extended a little too long to the point where it seemed like the fight was dragged out just a tad.Overall, I give it a 9.5/10. One of the best, if not the best, superhero movie ever made.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

Complaints of pacing, and too much action. Clearly these people have never read a comic, this is the definitive comic book movie because it plays out like a comic, how can any TRUE fan not love that?
The cast is Phenomenal, Henry Cavill is the physical embodiment of what the Superman of a modern age should be. He's thoughtful, compassionate and selfless, yet feels wildly out of place and yearns for acceptance and to find his place in the world. And he just looks like he could demolish a skyscraper with one punch. Shannon is fantastic as Zod, the tyrannical general consumed with Kryptons resurrection. Crowe shines as Jor-El, the guiding hand and hopeful father of Kal, I only hope we get to see more of him in future stories. Costner is great as the voice of caution, the worried parent desperately hoping to keep the world from taking his son away for being different. All in all this is a fantastic movie, we even get glimpses of a more self assured and even cocky Superman when he allows the authorities to handcuff him and the scene with the drone at the very end. If only the studios would have stayed out of things and allowed a true sequel to come organically, rather than push to catch up with Marvel.
At least now with the Snyder cut coming, we may get to see that.","47 out of 66 found this helpful.

The success of the previous franchise might give the producers an idea that using the same direction could also transcend this mythology. The film is so ambitious, any silliness from the last edition is abandoned and replaces them with a deeper and more sophisticated storytelling. The plot mostly runs like an almost endless wheel of clashes and explosions. It is overall fun, but it would have been much fun if it also possesses the extraordinary part of the hero's character rather than just his human side. Majority craves for darker blockbusters, but a broody Superman seems too awkward to accept. Still, there are plenty of merits to mention and the film is actually decently crafted. Man of Steel is undeniably big and fun that mainstream audience would be satisfied.Besides, there is still a good reason why Superman should get rebooted. The Donner series didn't actually flesh out much of Clark's relationship to the Kents and his motivation to become a hero is somehow shaky. Man of Steel fills them all with a down to earth sentiment and little sense of allegory. What's amazing is the first act somewhat follows the footsteps of the intro of Batman Begins. It started with the hero as an outcast then it presents various flashbacks of his downfall until he finally finds his true destiny. It seems repetitive for an origin, but it's the cleverest thing the film has ever done. The story itself is shrouded with brood and preach. There is a philosophy and depth attached to the concept. While they are deliberately compelling, the film didn't take enough time to breathe in the midst of the explosions. But really, the film is all about being big and epic. The film is just having a hard time balancing between the gravitas and the epicness.Kal-El is probably too human in trait which is kind of an ironic idea, but theoretically it is meant to be like this: he is inherited by his experience in earth and manifested himself with humanity. It can be a smart speculation, but it could have also shown his alien side when he is less whiny and more slick and curious to his powers. I've already stated Henry Cavill is the most good looking actor to play Superman(no homo). The actor has natural charisma. Here, there is a sense of swagger beneath his performance, but the script didn't allow him to do much of that and aims more to his character's drama. Cavill is still excellently enthusiastic to the role. At least we get to see him punch amazingly. In other cast, Amy Adams' Lois Lane is an improvement. She gets to be smarter than just a damsel for Superman to rescue. Adams tend to make all of that credible. Kevin Costner brings genuine gravity inside the hero's pathos. Michael Shannon has the menace that General Zod needs.Zack Snyder thankfully abandons his slow-mo fetishism and created a new style that works even better. Two hours of the film is all speed and action. The explosions get out of hand sometimes. It's all big and heavy, but real thrills and fortitude are definitely there to overpower what could have been an excess. It's a magnificent surprise from Snyder. However, the vision to Krypton slightly becomes uninspired compared to the original one. The world has a strange generic turn. To be fair, the CGI effects made it look grand and eye candy enough.Man of Steel has improvements and missteps. We see more of Clark's love for his Kent family, Superman finally knows how to wear his underpants, and the damsel in distress is now designed to be more than to be in distress. Although it's unevenly trippy, and it's more preachy than powerful. I understand it is ought to be as serious as Christopher Nolan's Batman because seriousness and darkness made The Dark Knight trilogy a knockout. As much as it tries to be a superior version of the story, the film still lack something. It probably needs more spark of light, or it needs to be more adventurous, or it needs to ease down the use of explosions, or maybe Superman here needs more swag. What I could guarantee is it's a great entertainment pleasure. The craft's and performances' heart to the hero pretty much made the film more than only okay. Man of Steel is just an origin by the way. If it gets it right in the sequel, then everything in this film would be forgivable.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

Reeves was very fatherly, a very wise, dependable superhero; even as Clark Kent, he seemed very dependable.Christopher Reeve is still my favorite Superman, but Henry Cavill looks like a Greek god on screen. He has a faraway look in his eye as if he truly was not-of-this-earth, but he seems essentially gentle, kind and, above all, helpful. When this Superman has to face people who possess all of his powers, he acts, quite realistically, I thought, shocked and stunned. Many scenes strongly sense that this Superman could be defeated by creatures who possess his super powers.Having seen ""Watchman"" and ""300,"" I knew that Zach Snyder's interpretation of the Superman story was going to be very realistic, edgy, dark. The violence in this movie is like watching real violence, man-made or natural; since it is created by creatures who are more-than-man, it seems like a little of both.Amy Adams just can't seem to go wrong. Even in a very uneven story like ""Trouble with the Curve,"" she adds perky, happy, spirited feminine animation; here, too, she is more alive than any other character. Her Lois Lane comes across as a vivacious rainbow alongside the very laid-back, mellow, gentlemanly Superman that Cavill presents.In many scenes, I caught myself wondering whether Cavill had truly studied Christopher Reeve. Under his clothing, Cavill displays much more of a massive body builder physique, layer upon layer of hard, thick, tough muscle. He looks more like Hercules with his shirt off.I was very impressed with Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father; and the technical creation of Kryptonian civilization, spacecraft and so forth is fresh, at times scary. The destruction is frightening at times -connoting in my mind images of Sandyhook, and other sudden, brutal events the world has suffered or witnessed this past year.Laurence Fishburne's Perry White did not seem special to me. He spoke his lines; he is an African American. I sensed no special or unique angle on his dramatization of the character. I still cherish my salient childhood image of the actor with the white hair and the decisive manner who performed along with George Reeves back in the 50s.Despite the cutting back and forth across time, showing Superman as a small child, then as an adult, I was not the least bit confused.I thought that Kevin Costner and Diane Lane held up creditably as Jonathan and Martha Kent.Michael Shannon reveals far more of General Zod's personality, motivation, and mind set. He is on screen and speaking to us in a very direct manner in far more scenes, and we have a chance to see him as more of a multi-faceted character. In previous cinematic interpretations, actors portraying Zod came across very one-dimensionally, very flat: mean, cruel, heartless and ruthless. Shannon suggests that he had hoped that Superman would help him in his mission here on earth.The movie cleverly leaves itself open for a possible sequel, and I sincerely hope that this crew gets that chance. I will be eager to see how they produce a sequel, knowing what worked and what could work better the second time.Several characters need to be more finely and deeply tuned. Cavill's Superman needs to be more assertive next time. Amy Adams has set the bar perfectly for Lois Lane: sure of herself, well-grounded, very capable, dignified, proud and assertive.""Man of Steel"" is a great action thriller, an excellent epic, a could-be-great-saga with great writing. In one scene where Clark Kent is a child and saves lives, he and his adoptive father, Jonathan Kent, have a heart-to-heart discussion about Jonathan's strong suggestion that he keep his super powers strictly secret. The boy asks plaintively whether he should have simply allowed people to die, and his dad replies, ""Maybe."" I thought that line fell totally flat.Not only was there no Jimmy Olson, Mike Kelly obviously portrayed some important Daily Planet employee who was never identified, and he never really did much other than look important.There is much to build on in a sequel or prequel or both. Strengths to augment and weaknesses to renovate. I'm hopeful that Zach Snyder will receive the opportunity to create a follow up opus, and that he will use and listen to test audiences galore.I'd like to see the characters of Superman, Lois, Perry White and others deepened, sharpened, and more clearly defined.I want more humor and more heart in the next one. The many obligatory scenes, characters, conflicts and themes from previous ventures were addressed in this film. The sequel to ""Man of Steel"" needs to seek to accomplish what J.J. Abrams has done recently for ""Star Trek,"" i.e. use the talented newcomers to create a great movie that can stand alone as a work of art.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

And with the usual critics-know-about-everything-nothing-is-good- to-me reviews the chances of be confused about this are increasing. As high as the expectations were raised after trailers, i have to tell you that you will not disappointed with this movie. Is different in many ways to the usual superhero movies but is a solid product that fits in what you expect from this kind of film. Nice references to previous movies are well executed and new plot additions are well received too. As you can expect from a Zack Snyder movie, there are several scenes that try to resemble graphic novel arts and in my opinion are very well made. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The most of them (unfortunately i can't say all of them) look very realistic according laws of physics, the CGI are so well made that you wish that development for many movies you seen before. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality. About the plot, i believe this is the more controversial point of what i see in reviews across the internet. Most moviegoers like it a lot, but are critics the ones ( not all of them) that are giving mixed reviews. What you realize is that critics expect another Dark Knight but this movie is not looking to be a darker one of your beloved Superman. If you are smart enough to understand that this is ANOTHER hero you will be happy with the story. If you are looking for a fourth darker than Batman movie for sure you will agree with critics giving bad reviews. This is a Superman movie and in that scenario this is a very good one.The movie has some flaws to me for sure ( i don't know about a perfect movie) but i will not comment about that as i believe everyone need to discover by themselves what - if any- dislike for their preferences. In summary this is a super hero movie that even Marvel fans will appreciate as is giving a whole new level to a classic story, turning the most beloved hero in an actual hero and mixing a great graphic novel specialist with great digital artists to give you a full action packed movie that make a good foundations for sequels.","1,078 out of 1,799 found this helpful.

Superman (Henry Cavill) was rocketed from Krypton when he was a baby and lands on Earth. Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner) find him and bring him up. He realizes he has strange powers but his parents tell him to control his impulses. Then evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) invades Earth and demands that Superman surrender himself...or else. There's more to the plot but it makes little sense (if you think about it).This IS well-made with great special effects and all but it's not that good. Basically it suffers from overkill. The movie is far too long--there was no reason for this movie to last almost 150 minutes. The opening on Krypton is too long also. The last hour is virtually non-stop destruction and fighting which quickly gets boring instead of exciting. Also TONS of product placement is apparent during it. The script is all over the place. It's constantly trying to tie Clark being an alien and growing up in the USA--and it doesn't work at all. Characters appear (and are given no introduction) and disappear without rhyme or reason. Gaps in the plot too. Acting doesn't help. Cavill is tall, handsome and muscular as Superman--and also sort of a blank. Amy Adams is even worse as Lois Lane. She tries but the material isn't there for her. Even worse her and Cavill have zero sexual chemistry so their romance seems more than a little forced. Shannon spends the whole movie snarling and yelling. And, worst of all, Superman commits an act at the end of the movie that Superman would NEVER do!

He struggles with himself over whether or not he should put his ""talents"" to use but soon he has no choice when General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes to Earth looking for him. Everything from the acting to the sets to the special effects look quite good here but could someone had found a few extra bucks in the budget to allow for some type of story with some character development? Look, I understand the darkness that Christopher Nolan brought to the Batman films worked wonderful but that same dark tone doesn't transform to this film and I think the biggest sin about MAN OF STEEL is the fact that it's just not that fun. I thought Cavill did a good job with what he was given but the screenplay really didn't make Clark Kent or Superman all that interesting. Amy Adams is a fine actress but she's given nothing to do. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner and Lawrence Fishburn are all fine actors and do nice things with their roles but they too are letdown by the screenplay. Shannon is always fun to watch but he's pretty much just given a generic villain role. The special effects for the most part are excellent but at the same time I think they're so overpowering that you can't help but feel that they suck any life away from what little story there is. I'm going to avoid ruining what happens but the major scene with Costner just lacks any emotional connection as does the entire set up of Russell sending his son away from the dying planet. Snyder certainly knows how to put cool images on the screen but at the same time I really see nothing from this film or his previous works that shows he can handle characters. MAN OF STEEL isn't a bad movie but it's just not a good one either and it's a shame they forget to make it fun.","35 out of 69 found this helpful.

Superman keeps getting told that he's conflicted and torn between two worlds, but the plot provides no moral dilemmas for him other than ""bash things."" He is humanity's Jesus of punching.The action is staged beautifully and looks great, and this from someone who hated Watchmen for every reason there is. Zack Snyder came through! If you haven't seen Man of Steel, you've never seen someone throw a person through a skyscraper and believed it. There are some moments that approach awe, such as the austere architecture and landscape of Krypton (where we spend about half an hour but which we never see not blowing up) and the famous shot of Superman breaking the sound barrier. The only problem is that it's followed by 5 more shots of Superman breaking the sound barrier. This applies to every stunt and action set-piece in the movie.Production design is outstanding, my favorite being the Pinscreen-inspired alien computer interface. Sounds silly, but the history of Krypton told in gunmetal and graphite pixels is an inventive and lovely visual.Unfortunately, the things that aren't alien ships, fistfights or explosions aren't interesting or good.The music is standard Zimmerklang: brass and drums. It's monotonous and obnoxious.The writing is... You know how trailers chop in snippets of dialogue between the cool music? ""Welcome to the FBI. - His methods are... a little unconventional. - Bank of Luxembourg - twenty million dollars - stolen. - He hasn't been the same since - killed his wife."" Imagine a whole movie done this way. I can barely think of an actual conversation in this movie - everything is either an order, an instruction or a threat.The plot is easy to follow and hard to get invested in. The Badass General Zod comes to Earth from Krypton because the phantom dimension gate was disrupted by the codex DNA which became unstable when the planet core was mined for energy that was transcribed in the cellular matrix of the genesis probe that the supreme council rejected after the coup attempt which caused the distress beacon to go off in the consciousness hologram - basically, to give Superman something to chew on. Zod has henchpeople, and they all get into loud, massive fights with Superman while Earth soldiers surround them and shoot impotent blanks.That's the common problem to watching godlike aliens fight - humanity comes off as totally useless. Lois Lane is briefly relevant once, when she plugs in an alien flash drive. And in the end, the movie gets humans to deliver a thing to a place, like a mother letting her idiot child carry a bag of chips so he can feel like he's helping.Naturally, aside from crouching victims, the Superman canon has use for earthlings as teachers, parents, colleagues and love interests, none of which comes through in this movie. Clark Kent's entire earthly backstory comes down to: being told how historic he is by Ma and Pa, and saving people from disasters in flashbacks. All this happens in short, out-of-order clips that play like a badly-organized family slideshow. The romance with Lois Lane is non-existent, since about the only time they're on screen together is when he's catching her in mid-air.Positive characters who die do it with such serenity that they almost look bored.A huge battle takes place in Metropolis and results in several dozen 9/11s. Nobody dies on screen, because PG-13.General Zod and his people could probably achieve their goals on Mars or Venus with equal success and don't have to try and kill everybody, but they can't be reasoned with because they're genetically like that.So there it is. See this movie if you want to see Superman and his enemies punch things, punch through things, punch people, punch things through people, punch people through things and punch things through other things. But who punches the punchmen?","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

And I must confess that ""Man of Steel"" is actually the best superhero movie that I have seen.This is not the child-approved adventure that Superman was back in the Christopher Reeve era - during which I grew up with those particular movies - and nor is it anywhere near ""Superman Returns"". ""Man of Steel"" quite simply pushes the entire boundary of what the audience is used to in the previous movies.""Man of Steel"" is a Superman movie for grown ups, and it really does appeal to an adult audience. The story is darker and delivers a harder punch, no pun intended, than any previous Superman movies. And the level of destruction and mayhem present in this movie is just simply off the charts. And for that alone, the movie is well worth watching.These constant reboots of previously established movies is annoying to a great extend, and the same goes for ""Man of Steel"". Was it really necessary to tell the story of Supermans trip to Earth and his upbringing here? No, not really. But still, the movie was entertaining, because it was a more serious and gloomy universe that the audience was introduced to.And while we are on the topic of reboots, then why use General Zod and his henchmen again? These were in a Christopher Reeve Superman movie already and were bested even there. So why reinvent them and use them again? I just don't get that. But thumbs up for the characters, their outfits and their more menacing and brutal demeanor.I wasn't familiar with Henry Cavill at all, and must admit that it is good that they are finally moving away from the Christopher Reeve era and anything that looks like him (hint, hint, the ""Superman Returns"" movie). It was a bold move, sure, but one that will essentially bring about a great new touch and inspiration to the Superman franchise.""Man of Steel"" is action and excitement from start to finish. And even Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner performed quite well in this movie.I can warmly recommend that you sit down and watch ""Man of Steel"", it is a much needed breath of fresh air in the superhero genre.And what is up with the hype about these so-called 'easter eggs' in the movie?

"7","/10","Epic, Ambitious, and Earnest","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6212238/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","28 October 2020","There's something big and ambitious and earnest about Zach Snyder's take on Superman that I find really admirable. Not everything in this movie works, but the mythic scope and embrace of the idea of gods coming to fight it out on Earth is handled with such weight and energy that I get swept up in the spectacle every time.Snyder took the well-worn story of Superman's origins and recast it rather dramatically in a couple of different directions. The first is aesthetics. Krypton looks browner and weirder than we'd seen it in film before. There are giant monsters and an embrace of weird science fiction visuals in how Krypton's technology works. There's also an embrace of a handheld camera that evokes independent filmmaking, especially in smaller moments. I remember when the first trailer dropped and people were saying that it almost looked like a Terrence Malick movie. Sort of (there's too much of an embrace of lens flares), but it certainly provides an interesting contrast with the epic visuals, giving it an inherently grounded feel while dealing with a rather zany story of supermen and terraforming machines.The second different direction largely focuses on John Kent, Superman's adoptive father from Kansas. The movie decides that it wants to explain Clark Kent's hiding of his power out of fear and a question of trust. The closest this movie comes to a strong theme is this idea of building trust in the face of something new. It pops up from time to time and gets mildly explored, but the film is much more of a character driven exercise in its first half and a plot driven one in its second. The first half is about Clark Kent's lifelong quest to find a way to belong while having incredible powers no one else has and protecting himself from what he imagines to be a paranoid and violent reaction to his presence should it become widely known. Still, he can't help but try and make the world better around him, so he saves kids from a bus crash despite his father's insistence that it might have been better to let them die rather than risk revealing himself, and he rescues some oil rig workers despite coming away with nothing and needing to move on to another life again.The irony is, of course, that he's so strong that mankind could probably never hurt him, so the fear is less about his personal safety and more about the unpredictable results of his reveal. What happens after he finally figures out who he is and where he's from when he finds a long lost Kryptonian ship? It's his announcement to the universe that he is there, and Zod shows up. Zod, Krypton's general who tried to lead a coup in the planet's final decadent and collapsing moments and was punished in the Phantom Zone, comes back with the objective of rebuilding Krypton. Superman's actions on Earth bring Zod there. Driven to insanity, he wants to terraform Earth into a new Krypton, no matter the living denizens, and exact his revenge on Superman's father at the same time (with some extra stuff about a genetic codex imbued in Superman's genetics put there by his father). This plot doesn't really develop until the second half of the film, which I have no problem with.The problem is really with Zod himself. I like the idea of Zod more than the execution. Michael Shannon is stilted as the dedicated antagonist, and his dialogue is often the most unnatural sounding of any of the principals. This is probably be design, giving him a different cadence from the rest of the characters to imply a different culture, but it comes off as stilted rather than elegantly natural. Part of that is the dialogue as written, and part of that is Shannon himself who haltingly moves through every line. Still, I love his plan and the epic fight that breaks out.The terraforming of Earth as a threat provides room for some incredible destruction. I know some people have problems with the scale of destruction throughout the movie, but I love it. This is a fight between gods. On the one side are a group of malevolent warriors who think of nothing of the lives they endanger. On the other is a greenhorn hero who is suddenly faced with a fight he can't handle on his own.The fight that erupts in Smallville is a favorite. It starts with Superman attacking Zod directly after they threaten his mother in order to find the craft that Superman came to Earth in. It turns into a two on one beat down as Superman tries to fight off two Kryptonians. The US military gets involved and starts firing at both sides, and Superman ends up gaining the first trust from the official governing bodies on the planet through his actions. It's the fight over the terraforming machines that really stands out, though. The leveling of Metropolis has a scale and terrifying feel to it that I love. The gravity field that pushes down on the buildings, leveling them to dust, while Zod crashes the Kryptonian ship into buildings, toppling them over, is quite a sight. The fist fight that breaks out between Zod and Superman in the sky is less impressive, and the final moment where Zod is going to kill a random little family is poorly set up, though the idea of Superman having to take the solution to an extreme to ensure Earth's safety is an interesting one in general.I love the ambition of the film. It's desire to reach beyond mere spectacle and enter into something of mythic scale is quite well handled. I also like Superman's challenge in finding how to make himself known to the world, and it ultimately comes out of necessity and to make up for his own contribution to the violence being visited upon Earth. It's rough, though. Zod is poorly written and delivered. I think the stuff from Clark Kent's childhood in Smallville might have worked better as a sustained sequence instead of snippets going back and forth. Overall, the movie feels like the product from a promising first draft screenplay that needed another couple of passes, but I still really like what I got.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

That says a lot. While DC comics decided to ""reboot"" Superman, there is still a very specific mythos to Superman as a character which cannot be changed or it's no longer Superman. Essentially, director Zack Snyder with the studio's blessing decided to make him ""cool"" by veering off course and violating very basic principles of who Superman is morally and ethically. To change the signature costume of Superman is one thing but Snyder and company go much further. No spoilers here just plain fact that this is NOT Superman and nothing more than an attempt to slap Christopher Nolan's name to a film in order to get people to see it. While it may work in the short term, the problem is how monumentally flawed this ""new"" and ""updated"" incarnation is of what is supposed to be Superman which is why it is getting such a poor reception from most critics. The chemistry between Superman and Lois Lane is nonexistent and with a horrible script by David Goyer, the actors cannot be necessarily blamed entirely. As for Henry Cavill, I wouldn't call him a horrible actor but he does not pull off the charisma and most importantly the essential dichotomy between his alter ego as Clark Kent and as Superman. However the producers, director, and writer of this mish mash mess of a ""reboot"" didn't help. At least, Brandon Routh had the all-American wholesomeness similar to that of Christopher Reeve. Certain liberties are taken with how Clark Kent is presented in this movie which I won't give away. This movie is full of creative choices that make absolutely no sense and defy logic in general not to mention everything about who Clark Kent/Superman is. That's why this should really be referred to as a ""reimagining"" and a very poor one at that. The race of Perry White and gender of Jimmy Olsen is changed for no plausible reason other than to be ""progressive"" but Laurence Fishburne is a gifted actor wasted with the bland material he had to work with. Ultimately this is a knockoff of the real Superman character playing off the success of ""The Dark Knight"" films. The worst part is the CGI overkill which is a page ripped right out of Michael Bay's book on worthless filmmaking. It is becoming painfully clear how much like The Transformers this film is and any subsequent installments will only get worse. Hence we have Christopher Nolan's involvement to thank for this garbage. However I'm sure he is regretting his name being attached to this right now with the kind of reviews it is getting. Fanboys will surely cry when he chooses not to be involved and have his name attached to any sequels. Director Zack Snyder is definitely on his way to becoming the next Michael Bay. This ""reimagining"" is far from a masterpiece like Richard Donner's 1978 classic, ""Superman"". John Williams epic theme is sorely missed but fortunately not associated with this disaster. Even ""Superman Returns"" with it's flaws at least remained true to who Superman is as the character has and always will be. ""Man of Steel"" is a complete insult to over 70 years of rich history regarding the most iconic superhero character in the world. It's truly sad to see the character portrayed so badly and ruined by this film. I'm sure we'll be seeing ""Man of Steel vs. Transformers"" coming soon in 2016. No matter how much money or how it appeals to today's junk minded kids it will never be fondly remembered the way Superman always was and should be.","141 out of 281 found this helpful.

Simply put; I felt Nolan got complacent after he absolutely nailed Batman Begins and the masterful Dark Knight.Now we have a reboot of Superman, with Nolan as Producer and action-junkie Snyder as Director. Nolan seems to take up where he left off on the Dark Knight Rises by producing a movie filled with plot holes. I don't want to divulge any spoilers beyond what you will have gathered from the trailers, but to give 1 example, our villain (played by Michael Shannon) & his goons survive the demise of Krypton because they are outcast on a spaceship as 'punishment' for their crimes while the rest of the planet perishes. There you have it, an advanced Alien race living on a doomed planet is able save only 1 new born baby and a gang of crooks, despite having the technology to scope out and evaluate another planet in seconds, then terraform it to accommodate their race. Is this the standard of script-writing we can associated with Nolan now? After-all he served us up the genius plot of Gothams ENTIRE Police Force being trapped underground for 3 months, with no food, yet still able to charge out into the battlefield when Batman sets them free. Like The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel is full of these kind of pot holes that is likely to leave even children scratching their heads.I did however enjoy much of the first half of the film, Kevin Costner gives the best performance in this movie by a distance in my opinion. His emotional interactions with his adopted son are heartfelt and he plays a pivotal role in shaping Clark's path to finding himself. Snyder strings the background story together pretty well, maybe a little too much use of 'flashbacks', but Snyder's storytelling is actually good here... which is why it's all the more frustrating that he lost control in the 2nd half of the movie.Once we have the back story in place and Superman gets some answers as to who he really is, well, this movie simply doesn't feel like Superman. He doesn't become the caped hero saving civilians from bank robbers (although we get a couple of instances of his good deeds before he ever dawns the cape). There's no disguise as Clark Kent, no news reporter or phone booths. No feeling of 'is it a bird?' or 'to the rescue'. No adventures. Instead it just jumps into a showdown with the goons from Krypton who have tracked him down to planet Earth (as you will have seen from the trailers). At times I felt like I was watching Independence Day as the US military is rolled out with tanks & fighter jets to protect the entire human race from superior beings threatening our existence.The last 60-90 Min's of this film is just 1 giant action sequence, loaded to the teeth with CGI, trucks smashing into skyscrapers & Alien light-beams. The Metropolis half destroyed... Superman probably kills a few thousand civilians himself as collateral given the amount of vehicles he uses as bowling balls. I enjoy a bit of action, but this was way too much, and way over the top to the point it just got tiresome and the film starved itself of dialogue, character development and audience interaction. We the audience are asked to endure some horrible one liners such as ""they say it's all downhill from the first kiss"" in between the brain-dead smashing up of skyscrapers. I was firmly switched off in the last half hour because the director asked nothing of me while he got his kicks. This action overkill wasn't really what we were sold in the trailers which focused on the gritty & emotional interactions of a young Clark with Kevin Costner over an Enya score (almost Gladiator-esque) - this sold us a totally different tone to the alien-action movie we actually get. Overall i'm left with a feeling of what this movie could have been with the right director & stronger writing. Perhaps Sam Mendes would have been a better choice given the job he did on Skyfall and the human interaction of Craig, Dench and Bardem throughout while maintaining awesome action set-pieces. Snyder had a great cast at his disposal here he that really should have done much better with. Crowe & Shannon did the best they could with what they had to work with. Costner stole the show. Cavill was a perfect fit for Superman and brought a physical presence to the role of Superman that Bale & Hardy brought to Batman & Bane. Laurence Fishburne may as well have been cut from the movie all together in his utterly pointless role as Editor at the Planet and Adams was wasted in the weakly written part of Lane.It's perhaps unfair to expect another Dark Knight, given it's standing as one of the greatest films ever alongside The Godfather & Shawshank here on IMDb, but I was at least hoping for a movie on a par with Batman Begins, to really set the tone for another epic series of modern-day comic hero movies from DC. Instead I left the cinema feeling like I just saw 20 minutes of Avatar eventually turn into Independence Day meets Transformers in a piece of film-making that will be rather forgettable in the end.Maybe at some point in the next 30 years Superman will finally get his day like Batman got his in 2008 in The Dark Knight.","48 out of 88 found this helpful.

They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like 'The Hobbit', I didn't think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun, entertaining movie.","543 out of 964 found this helpful.

This film is all special effects, superman running around. Whats stupid though is that there is almost zero back story what so ever. We see superman on a fishing boat early in the movie for about 2 seconds before he goes off to be a hero, and that was supposed to be like a big emotional arc ohhh he worked a regular man's job.I found myself about halfway through completely disengaged from this film and had I not been with friends I probably would have left. Now don't get me wrong I like entertainment I enjoy Iron Man and Thor but this movie was just lacking any kind of personal connection.There are also long sequences of Superman fighting these other alien villains in the film who are also generally unbeatable so there's no suspense and its pg-13 fighting so you don't want to actually show anything.I wasn't expecting much going in to this film and I got even less than I expected, all the reviews that are on here are from pumped up fanboys who have been waiting for this movie for months. I am sure if you are into special effects and mindless action you will enjoy this but if you want something more you won't get it.","34 out of 70 found this helpful.

Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has come in possession of data saying that Krypton will soon be destroyed as its core begins to distablize, but Jor-El's warnings are ignored by the council. As a last resort Jor-El and his wife send their infant son, Kal-El, to the planet Earth, where Kal-El's physiology will make him stronger and more resilient than humanity, as Jor-El embeds the Codex of Krypton's entire genetic knowledge into Kal-El's cellular structure. The ship crashes on Earth in Smallville, Kansas where Martha and Johnathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) find the child and adopt him soon discovering his superhuman abilities. The boy, whom they've named Clark (Dylan Sprayberry -teenager, Henry Cavill-adult), grows up keeping his powers secret at the wishes of his father, John. As Clark wanders the world he eventually finds the answers to who he is at an abandoned Kryptonian scout ship that can access Jor-El's consciousness but is discovered by intrepid reporter Lois Lane. Additionally Zod locates Earth and is intent on conquering it and turning it into a new Krypton.In 2008, Warner Bros. Began exploring ways to reboot the Superman franchise following the underwhelming reception of Superman returns. Following a series of pitches, producer Christopher Nolan and writer David S. Goyer's pitch was selected based on the duo's success on the Christian Bale Dark Knight films. Zack Snyder then boarded the film as director in 2010. The end result of the final product isn't the masterpiece many claim, but it's also not some sort of ""insult to Superman's legacy"" as many have spouted.To start on a positive note, Henry Cavill is really good as Clark Kent/Superman. Cavill feels like a good man with extraordinary power and when we see him don the Superman suit it sells the premise quite effectively. Amy Adams is also quite good as Lois Lane who's given added grit and a hardened edge that builds upon the reinterpretation we got from Margot Kidder in the Donner films. I also rather liked performances by Diane Lane as Clark's adoptive mother Martha and Russell Crowe as Clark's biological father Jor-El who both give committed performances to these roles. The story also has a good core if you look at it from a distance. Thematically it's about Superman's struggle both internally and in the primary conflict between the Kryptonian side of Superman and the Earth side with the duality of Clark Kent/Kal-El reflected with antagonist Zod and his soldiers who stand as quite possibly the last remnants of his birth planet.What doesn't work as well is the execution of this story. Man of Steel is visually speaking a very busy movie with a lot of lengthy sequences that are there solely for the sake of creating visual noise. While the Man of Steel may be the titular focus, the actual focus is on destructive excess taken to the nth degree. The third act in this movie features a lengthy sequence of Metropolis being literally leveled and the destruction becomes gratuitous to a level equivalent to Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich. I will admit the destruction is better produced and lacks a lot of the more obnoxious bits you see in those movies in that you can actually see what's going on, but every action sequence goes on way longer than it needs to and it goes from exhilarating to exhausting. Action sequences are a lot like ketchup: good in small managed amounts, but loses its appeal with too much. I also didn't like the performance of Michael Shannon's Zod or Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent with some of Johnathan Kent's scenes such as one involving a twister being ridiculous.Almost a decade ago when this movie first came out I was split on it, neither loving it nor hating it as so many others did and continue to do so. All these years later I remain conflicted on it. It's an ambitious movie, it's a well made movie, it's also a well-acted movie (for the most part), but it's also a movie that feels at odds with the core of Superman. Destruction is expected in a Superhero movie and it has it's place, but Superman's first priority mostly seems to be punching or lasering foes and maybe (occasionally) rescuing people. I wish I liked this movie more than I actually do because there are parts of this movie that are brilliant but they're held back by the creative decisions that just feel at odds with the character.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I enjoyed this detailed back story, making me root for him all the more.Henry Cavill is perfectly cast as Clark Kent, or Superman. Despite being a superhero, Kent is filled with emotion and feelings like ordinary human beings, and Cavill lends credibility to the character. Cavill is also darn sexy! Amy Adams stars as his love interest, Lois Lane. Although the romance developed a bit too quickly for my taste, I did enjoy the chemistry and endearing moments between them. I somehow would have preferred Lois Lane to be dark-haired, and not red-haired. Just a personal preference to the character...As for the visual effects and action sequences, wow it's incredible! The action is fast-paced, and the visual effects are dazzling, making 'Man of Steel' a visual spectacle of note. For such a long film (almost 2½ hours), it was never boring and captivated me from beginning to end. Even when there were no action, I was so invested in the characters that I didn't even miss the action. I found it compelling with interesting characters.Michael Shannon stars as the film's antagonist, General Zod, and I thought he, too, did a really good job. He was a fearless and determined character, and a worthy antagonist. In general, 'Man of Steel' is a top-notch production, fast-paced and exciting.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The reboot of the Superman saga, ""Man of Steel"" updates the Metropolis Marvel as an allegory of America in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Sure, it's flawed, if not crass. The depiction of Krypton, in particular, seems to be the consequence of some artists being too carried away in imitating other fantasies such as, say, ""Avatar"" (2009) or ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Still, I'll take it over the desolate 1978 iteration of Kal-El's birthplace. The depiction of the United States military, too, is rather placid, which was surely a demand of the real army in assisting the movie's production. Although the troops here are quite busy in their active spectatorship of Superman, their involvement doesn't lend much of interest to the extended 9/11 allegory. Similarly, Lois Lane is partly her usual constant damsel in distress, but at least she's not an idiot this outing, and she even assists Superman, while also providing the meta-narrative context of her being the reporter of the very story we see. She's the surrogate author within the movie. Being portrayed by Amy Adams doesn't hurt, either. Indeed, the cast in general is good and well balanced between up-and-coming stars and veteran talents who lend their celebrity of past projects to the proceedings here.To bemoan loud explosions or to debate the salience of whether Superman punches and kills or not misses the point. Professional entertainment criticism of superhero flicks, if not in general, often confounds me. Besides a couple blatant masterpieces (""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Logan"" (2017)), darker or seemingly-more-realistic superhero movies are largely panned. They appear to want cartoons, as though one can't take comic-book characters seriously and, thus, neither should the superhero genre treat itself in earnest. Much of the movie-going public must agree, too. Hence the dominance of the MCU, I suppose. But movies in general and superhero ones, too, are always ideological; they're a product of the real world. It's just that the smarter ones tend to be more coherent about it. Don't pretend, for instance, that Tony Stark doesn't reflect our society's infatuation with tech CEOs, or that ""Black Panther"" (2018) and ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) aren't about overcoming historical racial and sexual misrepresentations. So, too, Superman has long been claimed a symbol of American virtues, as well as a reflection of Christianity by the association of the Man of Steel with Christ.Clark Kent is the most vital fictional character to come from America's middle state, Kansas, since Dorothy Gale. I think it would be interesting merely to compare these two works of genres, children fairy tales and comic books, that are often frowned upon, and to trace their influence in shaping how the United States is seen--especially through the wildly-popular film adaptations, but I digress. Expanding upon ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"" and the messiah metaphor, ""Man of Steel"" reimagines young Clark as a refugee and migrant worker--an illegal alien or ""dreamer"" (note all the fatherly talk of dreams) taken to the ""nation of immigrants"" when he was but a baby and who has since been nurtured in the idyllic settings of America's heartland, upon the farm and by Ma and Pa Kent. He's something of an ideal immigrant.General Zod and his gang, on the other hand, realize the country's most xenophobic fears. They don't share the values of our world; indeed, Zod preaches about purity of bloodlines and submitting to his rule. Social Darwinism, eugenics and genocide--Nazi pseudoscience, basically. Inadvertently, Kal-El (and since christened Clark Kent) brings about this intergalactic chain migration, whereupon Zod and his crew insist upon remaking our world as their own rather than conforming to our ways--and atmosphere--as Clark had. This results in the famous destruction sequence of Metropolis that, none too subtly, recalls the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. Of course, there's also a clumsy environmental message of destroying one planet and setting out do so to another one.There is one more important thing to note here, however, which is that Clark is only able to become our savior by embracing his roots and bringing his culture into the light of our and his own American one. His race is literally encoded in his blood (via that codex thing). He's of two worlds, two sets of parents, two remembered fathers, two identities. This is an apt addition not only because it finally makes sense of the Superman costume, CGI cape and all, but also because it celebrates contemporary notions of diversity. It's not the melting-pot narrative of Kent the Daily Planet reporter; it's the story of the good immigrant who embraces the best of two cultures and, thus, enriches the lives of those around him. Whether or not one finds the city destruction gratuitous, the writing stupid (that bit about the first kiss is my most hated piece of dialogue here, and don't hide below an underpass from a tornado!), or is fond of Zack Snyder and company's snap-zoom style, and regardless of one's political and cultural views, that's a coherent ideology for a blockbuster superhero movie, and it's a change of pace from the credo of DC's other most famous vigilante, the plutocratic billionaire who likes to punch the poors and mentally deranged, Batman.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow(e). The character Perry White wasn't used to his full potential, but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman, you might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty up- tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous, making him less charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future. (that makes for an awesome showdown, by the way.) To summarize, I give Man of Steel an 8.6 for it's portrayal of a classic American hero.","483 out of 878 found this helpful.

When I first watched it in the theater I was blown away. I loved the film and considered it part of my top five superhero films. I thought the movie was flawless and the best rendition to date of Superman. I couldn't wait to watch it again.Let us move the clock forward to yesterday; I watched it again and the euphoria wasn't there. I felt like the guy who won the lotto and finds out he's sharing it with 40 other people. What I glossed over the first time was just glaringly obvious the second time around.The things I liked before and still like are the special effects, the story to some degree and the nemeses. It was an excellent display of Superman's powers, how he found them and how he was able to use them. I never tire of his super strength, flying and acts of heroism. And the villains... bravo. Zod was the leader, yes, but his right hand woman, Faora Ul (Anjte Traue), stole the show with her ruthlessness and fighting prowess. There was quite a bit of destruction when it was all said and done... OK that's an understatement, there was massive destruction which would have resulted in the loss of thousands of lives and whereas fighting on that level is kind of cool, there is a saturation point. But, apocalypse level destruction aside, there were some darn good battles between Kal El and Zod and crew. As for the aspects of the movie I didn't like but glossed over initially: the dialog was so-so if not mawkish at times. There were some scenes put in there as well as some lines put in there in order to convey a deeper sense of purpose and meaning to Superman, which is where I think the movie tends to veer off course. They even repeated a particular Messianic pose that had me rolling my eyes at Superman Returns. Then there was Lois Lane. In order to get us up to speed on what her character is all about (i.e. a no nonsense dogged reporter) they introduced us to her at a military setup where she was unwelcome yet she was going to show them who's boss. And of course, no Superman movie is complete without saving his main squeeze at least three to five times.What I gather from my two different experiences is that seeing my first movie in 3D was mesmerizing and skewed my judgment. Because, essentially that's what happened. I had never seen a movie in 3D before, I saw this one and I was so impressed I ignored the other cinematic flaws. Well, watching a movie on my 13"" MacBook is a better test because you better have a very good product to make it awesome on a laptop.

I can't believe that they would even consider making a Justice League movie after this hunk of garbage.

I don't know why I feel so strongly about defending this movie.)As a summer tentpole, Man of Steel delivers. It's sprawling, feels epic, and is loaded with enough booms and bangs to keep the popcorn going. But don't let that distract you from the story: the origin is properly managed, and although it does look back to Donner's take on Superman II, it's been given a fresh spin. Let's face it, he's called SUPERman. They've made him out to be a god on earth, and the action is adequately OTT to address it. This isn't a movie that's meant to be taken seriously; if you can believe a man can fly, you should be able to appreciate the outrageous action. This is clearly not The Dark Knight, but you'll at least leave the cinema with a hint of a smile on your face, and feeling that the money spent was actually worth it.High spot: Seeing Russel Crowe as Jor-el. What a fella. Low spot: The last 20 minutes fell a bit flat - but they weren't dull. Feels like: Big, loaded with thrills and spills.","432 out of 794 found this helpful.

Being the first real comic book superhero, it was only fitting that he be brought to the big screen properly for modern audiences. With Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel,"" I don't necessarily think this is the Superman film we've been waiting for all these years, but I do think what we got is something that set us off in the right direction. This is another take on the origin story of Kal-El, a baby born in the last days of the planet Krypton who is sent to Earth by his father (Russell Crowe), where he is raised by a simple farm family, the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Raised as Clark Kent, he discovers that on this planet, he has magnificent powers that he eventually decides to use to protect humanity as Superman. This is a story that nearly everyone knows, but ""Man of Steel"" takes some different story beats that definitely lead down a darker, more emotional and realistic path that I really enjoyed. One of the strongest elements of the film is the casting, particularly the casting of Superman and his fathers. Henry Cavill definitely showed flashes of greatness in this film, and while he hasn't given a character-defining performance here like Christopher Reeve did in Richard Donner's ""Superman,"" I definitely believe that Cavill has the potential to grow into that perfect Superman for modern audiences. The true standouts, however, are Crowe and Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, respectively. Both of these men gave performances that elevated the emotional weight of this film beyond that of a typical comic book movie, Costner in particular. Amy Adams also does a fine job, probably giving us the best Lois Lane yet.However, this film is not without it's faults. I think the pacing felt awkward in the second half particularly. The film was primarily split off in two halves, a story-driven first half and an action-packed second. I enjoyed the action in this film for the most part, but after a while, it started to feel sort of dull and lifeless. It was borderline excessive for this movie, but I also think that the problem with the action in this movie is that it was so separated from the story elements. If the action would have been more interspersed among emotional, character driven sequences, they probably would have seemed more special when they happened, but instead, the action sort of felt redundant after a while.Despite its faults, ""Man of Steel"" is a really enjoyable film. While it's not the Superman film I've always wanted to see, I think the groundwork has now been set. I'm very excited to see where the sequels take us from here, because now that everything is established, we can now have a Superman movie we've been waiting for. And as far as the origin story goes, ""Man of Steel"" is a great way to set up this DC Universe. I can't wait to see where Big Blue goes from here!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, was thrilled to see Syncopy logo at the beginning of the movie. This movie is the beginning of superman saga, kindly showing the world of superman for ones like me who have never came across the superman story. One of the major drawback in this movie is the setup of the character. There are some appealing motives that shapes up the character of Clark Kent (superman) but all stories are juxtaposed, without creating a solid figure as a symbol of justice. However, this movie serves as a great summer blockbuster, with action packed later half of the movie. As a Nolan fanboy, I was expecting more of dark twist, realism, and solid story as his previous work, but have to admit that Nolan has not played a major role in this movie. The story is linear, except for few events that shapes the character. This will make audiences easily get into the story.Overall, this movie can win the blockbuster war of Summer 2013. However, there could have been an improvement over narration, which leaves bit dissatisfaction. Bottom Line : ""Action packed movie that lies somewhere in between Dark Knight trilogy and Iron Man""","27 out of 69 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An immense spectacle that despite its flaws injects new excitement into Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814942/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","In this superhero-obsessed culture/Hollywood world we live in, it's a wonder that the grand-daddy of them all, Superman, hasn't had a successful debut in the 21st Century. Obviously I've just implicitly bashed 2006's ""Superman Returns,"" which I will not be taking the time to discuss beyond this sentence, but I don't think anyone disagrees that Bryan Singer's film failed to do the Man of Steel justice.Knowing they had yet to tap the full potential of one of the greatest characters of all time, Warner Bros. finally committed to bringing in the amount of mind and muscle befitting of Superman and channeling it into a new incarnation. The duo of producer Christopher Nolan (mind) and director Zack Snyder (muscle) promised an intelligent, visually extravagant and emotion-filled blockbuster spectacle. A tall order, no doubt, but they manage to breathe new life and excitement into the character.""Man of Steel"" doesn't feel like a Snyder film or a Nolan film, and it visually distinguishes itself as separate from the Christopher Reeve/Richard Donner ""Superman,"" whose imagery became the definitive take on the Superman universe. Purists might well have an issue with the liberties taken with the Fortress of Solitude, Phantom Zone and likely more. There are no visual easter eggs or homages to famous dialogue either. ""Man of Steel"" clearly wanted a fresh start.It begins fresh as well with an extended sequence on Krypton, which sets up a bit more of the reason Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sent his newborn son to Earth as well as who is General Zod (Michael Shannon). It's definitely rushed, but in showing us part of the Superman universe we've never seen before it manages to keep our interest completely piqued with an array of dazzling action, sets, costumes and CGI.The on-Earth beginning of the story, the origin of Clark Kent, also goes in a different direction. As Clark (Henry Cavill) ventures through Alaska in an effort to discover his greater purpose, the narrative flashes back to pivotal moments during his upbringing in the hands of Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane).Screenwriter David S. Goyer keeps the momentum going forward while touching on the crucial thematic points of Superman's origin, the bits about keeping his identity a secret and finding his greater destiny, etc. This creative choice also helps to avoid a total feeling of deja vu in experiencing Superman's origin story yet another time, a fault that many saw in the reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" for example. That said, toying with the chronology keeps us from experiencing the greatest degree of empathy for our hero. Fortunately, Cavill plays the role with great humility, so it's tough not to like this Superman.As much as the script takes certain liberties with the origin and how its told and also how Clark meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams), it stays extremely focused on Superman and Zod's invasion of Earth the entire time. So many superhero films get bogged down with subplots, but ""Man of Steel"" has none. Anything you might deem a subplot directly connects with whatever else is going on in the film at the time.What Goyer and Nolan have done with the story could spark endless discussion (and in some circles, debate). Anyone expecting an artistic blood transfusion from ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" will be let down a tad. Batman's universe can theoretically be steeped in realism; Superman's flat out can't. ""Man of Steel"" embraces the science-fiction elements of ""Superman"" and plays them up. Considering one of every two action films these days involves aliens leveling a city, it's not hard to see why Warner Bros. was more than happy to go in that direction.At this point we can safely say that the more audiences are subjected to final sequences involving mass-scale urban destruction, the more they will begin to just tune it out. The film doesn't exactly do a great job of making us care about whether the Daily Planet turns to rubble. In fact, I can't recall if the word Metropolis is even used in the entire movie. Regardless, the photo-realism of the fight sequences thanks to advances in CGI is breathtaking. Snyder, known for his abundant use of slow-motion, goes hard left with extremely fast-moving, often airborne action and fight choreography that despite the potential for blurry, incoherent CGI, comes out stunningly vivid. Superman's showdown with Zod's buddies in Smallville serves as an incredible showcase of the visual effects work on the film. The climactic scene in Metropolis is too, but again, after Superman gets chucked through that 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th building (all in one frame), you stop paying attention and eagerly await how the showdown with Zod will finally end.Spectacle would be the first way to describe ""Man of Steel."" As much as it offers some interesting themes, the film doesn't take the time to sit on anything. It's go, go, go in order to fit the origin story and provide plenty of drama once Zod invades. It's a pure summer blockbuster as opposed to a grittier, more intellectual take on ""Superman"" (a majority of the time), but it's infinitely more interesting than similar spectacle films such as the ""Transformers"" series.All the elements of the film and characters are pretty likable, but these peripheral elements are underdeveloped. Much like how I felt after seeing ""Amazing Spider-Man,"" now that the origin story is out of the way, there's room for a little more complexity in future installments. And if just scratching the surface of this new ""Superman"" world was this exciting from an entertainment standpoint, getting an opportunity to dig deeper holds promise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Growing up in the care of the Kents(Costner and Lane, whose talents are warranted these not-starring roles), Clark(Cavill, lending a humble, yet powerful air to the lead) is struggling with his identity and feels alone, isolated, and must keep his lineage secret(this is a realistic take on the hero, and the issue of first contact is dealt with - how do governments deal with knowing that there are aliens?). And when Lois Lane(Adams as the strong, independent woman) threatens to unveil the truth in the interest of journalism, and our world is threatened by General Zod(Shannon, not as hammy as Stamp, or Spacey's Luthor), he will have to decide between these two worlds.The first issue is of course, does this have a reason to exist. ""Returns"" was not even a decade ago, and didn't go over well. The answer is, thankfully, yes. This does things that the '78 one, in all its glory, did not, and this is like that in being of its time and generation(hence the angst in this). Yes, another origin story... this fleshes out the backstory, establishing the mythos well, and grants the wonder(and shows the inspirational nature of risking oneself to help others) that has kept this a US icon for 65 years. And this proudly embraces the core elements of the American dream and Superman, with a nobody from Kansas growing up to become a legend, an immigrant finding new hope in his new home and loneliness(something everyone feels at one point or another) and rootlessness leading to aiding the common good.All of the acting is great, including the kids portraying the titular Man in the numerous flashbacks(this is mainly set in his adulthood). With Nolan having worked on the script until he was happy with it and then fully handing over creative control to Snyder, this is very much the latter's film. This helps DC show that Batman(as envisioned by aforementioned psychological director... who, by the way, would not have fit this man in tights) is not all they've got, like Marvel, they have more flavor to offer(and here's hoping this one will launch that shared cinematic universe).He brings his comic book aesthetic and compelling sense of visuals to this, wisely opting for film over digital, and a fantastic hand-held cinematography that doesn't confuse. The 3D post-conversion(not his call) robs that technique of some of its intended effect and makes it jarring. Frankly, just watch it in 2D. This is epic(note that we see plenty of rescues and heroics before the cape is donned), with a thundering Hans Zimmer score(OK, so there's *some* Dark Knight-ness in this) and fast pace(making the 2 hour, 12 minute running time, not counting end credits, not feel as arduous). Yes, the third act is non-stop action, and in general, these sequences tend to leave the status quo unaltered(that's why often, stuff like that is left on the cuttin room floor), are at times generic, repetitive(you will believe a man can punch someone all the way through a building) or feel overly similar to other blockbusters. Michael Bay comparisons? How...? You invariably care about at least one person involved, none of them go on for too long and we're allowed to breathe inbetween each of them, when there's engaging character development and drama them.There is a lot of implied(and nonetheless, inescapable) violence and death(which, along with the 9/11 imagery evoked, is in poor taste) and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to every fan, of any age, of the Man of Steel, and/or the people involved in making this. 7/10","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I've previously seen all four of the Christopher Reeve movies as well as the misfiring SUPERMAN RETURNS, so I had some idea of what to expect here; it's safe to say that the remarkably serious and complex MAN OF STEEL is the best on-screen Superman yet, although that's not to say it's a masterpiece.Gone are memories of the cheesy Reeve films, to be replaced by intensive and destructive action, all achieved via some remarkably impressive CGI effects. Henry Cavill struggles to bring charisma to the role of the iconic character, but he certainly looks the part and his work in the gym has paid off too. The always-great Michael Shannon makes for a fun bad guy, and others like Amy Adams and Laurence Fishburne flesh out their parts pretty well too.The only problem with MAN OF STEEL is its length. Like many modern-day superhero movies, it's a bit overlong, which makes it feel bloated. Zach Snyder offers some surehand direction, but this isn't on the same kind of level as WATCHMEN. Almost half of the running time is made up of massive action sequences, and these do get a bit repetitive when they keep doing the same shots over and over again, but at the same time it's still a visual feast and the film-makers are able to put stuff on screen that hasn't been put there before. For what it's worth I enjoyed MAN OF STEEL, although it's not one of those films I could imagine sitting through again; once was enough.","18 out of 45 found this helpful.

However, I should have never waited this long.Aside from the blatant disregard for the theory of relativity in dealing with space travel (which is why I gave it 9 stars out of 10), this is by far the most exquisite Superman portrayal ever made.Superman has always been the rarest of superheroes in that he overcomes his ""heroic problem""--his inner conflict--with a singular decision: to always do right and protect the Earth. He surpasses other superheroes in this regard because it is not an ongoing conflict; he resolves it everlastingly in one checkmate move. This film captures that epic choice with clarity and precision.Henry Cavill does more than shine--he glistens--in this role that was his from birth. Watching this movie, you feel with him all of the pain, sacrifice and triumph of Superman's story. I have never been so moved by a superhero.I have heard people say that Superman is ""too good"" and that they prefer dynamic superheroes who walk a fine line between good and bad.

I'm not taking that away from it. However, in my opinion, not as great as it could have been.Let me start off with the positives, because there are a lot of them. You have to take your hat off to everyone involved for making this film work. And it does work, really well in fact. One of the film's best attributes is that is manages to ground Superman in our modern day and age, without it seeming ridiculous. This, Snyder nails perfectly. The cinematography in this film is noticeably Snyder-esque, and the camera movement reminded me a lot of 300, which isn't a bad thing. All of the actors involved nail their roles, and Cavill does a fantastic job of portraying our modern Superman. Hans Zimmer's score is unsurprisingly stirring and uplifting, and completes the overall package, just like he managed with the Dark Knight trilogy. And the action, well, the action is something else entirely. The CGI is the best I think I've ever seen, surpassing even The Avengers of last year, and the sound FX hits all the right spots.However, it's not a perfect film. My biggest gripe is that I felt there was very little character development in any character besides Superman himself. I felt like, had someone stripped away all of the CGI and action, the resulting film wouldn't have been up to much. This doesn't mean I'm taking away any of the merits the cast & crew accomplished in the epic action sequences, because they really did take my breath away, but in the words of another critic, 'less could easily have been more'. I felt that the final standoff (not giving anything away) could have been easily halved, or even cut altogether, and the film would not have lost anything. By the end of it, the huge action scenes became somewhat dull, because I felt like I'd already seen enough of them. This is one of the things I loved about the Dark Knight trilogy - there is a fine line between character driven moments and action, a line which Nolan hit perfectly and one that I feel Snyder did not. I suppose that's what to be expected from a director like Snyder whose previous films have revolved a lot around action sequences. I hate to compare the Batman trilogy and Man Of Steel, but it's very hard not to.Overall, Man Of Steel is not as good as it could have been, that's for sure in my mind. However, credit must go to everyone involved, especially the great direction from Snyder himself, for pulling off what could easily be the start of a fantastic new franchise. I look forward to seeing where they take Kal-El next","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill did the finest justice to the character, and Amy Adams was the opposite (worst), do not count me wrong, could it be the way her character made... The movie promises to be breathtaking when we watch first 15 minutes of the beginning, puts our hopes high.. But there we go, too much unnecessary violence, meaningless script... I am a huge fan of Zack and Christopher.. But sorry ya, You got me hate you this time, disappointed!! Do we really need 143 minutes to spare for the movie with epic emotions and brutal violence? Ah, that was too hard to bare!!BTW, better avoid watching this movie in 3D, and do not think of IMAX at all. 2D is okay to go, of course If you want to watch... We can even ignore watching this movie...","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There were two redeeming qualities to this film: the ending credits and the guarantee that I'll never have to watch it again.The storyline was so rushed, empty, and flat that I was laughing at how cookie cutter and formulaic it was. No, I mean I was 'literally' laughing out loud. It followed suit with all of the new ""re-imagining"" of films of late; stepping up the political correctness to a painful degree, abruptly revealing one dimensional lead characters, entirely Mickey-Mouse-scary antagonists, and unbelievably shallow motivations on all sides. Not to mention, it has so many plot holes that if it were held up against a light it would look like mesh.There was a clear motivation, however. Keeping the optioned rights to the Superman namesake by putting out a 2.5 hour piece of tripe to rake in big bucks from the uninspired and vapid herds. Oh, and merchandising.My girlfriend and I often joke about taking a shot anytime a film depicts a cliché movie phrase, action, dynamic, or scene. We would have died of liver failure within the first 11 seconds of this film.","98 out of 199 found this helpful.

Watching it for the first hour, I was about to give it a solid 4/5, until it went up to such perfection level of watching satisfaction. The storyline was quite impressive, without losing its originality but a better improvement in line. The plotting of the synopsis was done amazingly different than the other versions of Superman we ever saw in the theater. And characteristically, it was perfectly put on such great screenplay. I wasn't sure if Henry Cavill﻿ was a suitable role player with Amy Adams﻿ for the Clark-Loise characters, but through out the movie, they seemed like doing the best as it should. Clark is a good choice. And I can see there's somewhere in the scenes, Tom Welling is never left behind for the heroic role. He resembles him very much. And not to forget, there are some extra credit deserved to this movie, which somehow balanced the movie to its perfection. I even love the arts of its photography. It was full of drama and actions, emotions and everything else needed to be there in a great, legendary film should be. Everything was perfectly there, from the storyline itself, the plotting, the casting, the cinematography, the screenplay, the actions and all the effects, the plus and minus, and the everything.

At that point, people wanted the Marvel filter, especially from a character like Superman. Ultimately, it was Zack Snyder's daring vision, a brilliant piece of art at the wrong time, that led to it's lackluster reception; dooming all possibility from said point on to build to something greater with WB executives breathing down his neck. Had this been released a couple years ago instead, even today, this film alone would have given Marvel a run for their money. This is a quality superhero film, something very rarely seen these days. It's absolutely criminal how poorly it was received at the time, but my hopes is in the new era of the upcoming DCU with David Corenswet, James Gunn takes cues from this masterpiece for its tone, atmosphere, biblical telling of the worlds greatest superhero.When I first heard of this movie being made, I in the middle of watching the hit CW show Smallville; as a young child falling in love with Superman, you can probably gather just how exited I was. Every image released, every trailer, every piece of news I could find I was there and waiting for the day this would release.I went to watch this film as a freshman in high school on opening day; my friend and I had the day off. We got the best seats, ultimate features at our top local theatre. I was even feeling incredibly ill that day, but nothing was stopping me from watching my second favourite superhero come to life on the big screen (as a DC fan, there's an obvious first 🦇).Like so many people at the time, I left the theatre disappointed, disheartened and feeling betrayed. The Superman I grew up with, the boy scout from Kansas that beamed optimism, positivity and hope.. Was turned into this dark, heavy murderer. I had just come out of Smallville, previously having watched the Reeve films and the Routh returns. Needless to say, I was an echo chamber of the hundreds who said ""Not my Superman"".Rewatching this today, after a decade, I can say with full confidence that I was wrong. This film does have it's flawed moments, but it showcases itself as a refreshing glass of water in a genre of milk. I am so pleased to stand corrected, as I can confidently say that this is the best film of the DCEU. Like I cannot express this enough, we live in a reality where superhero films are theme park rides. This, like The Dark Knight and Joker, is an art piece.Looking to the future for this character, we will see. Superman may be this bright and optimistic character that brings hope, but the Man of Steel delivers an artistic telling of a hero set in a grounded world filled with gods.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

The critics hated it for the most part. Honestly, I can understand why. The story wasn't the focus of this movie. Zack Snyder's movies are all about visual interest. Nolan, I think, on the other hand is about story and realism.I was interested in the beginning to see how they would balance it out. I think critics had this idea it would be like the batman movies mixed with the Avengers. It's not really. It's a visual masterpiece. Well, maybe masterpiece is a strong word to use, but the visual special effects are amazing. I personally think they are the best I have ever seen. If you are going to see this movie, realize that you are going to see a movie with a ton of special effects and they are the thing Snyder cares about the most. The movie does a back and forth between the past and present day. Nolan really takes over the story when it shifts to the past. The past drives the current story and it does it well I believe. Without spoiling anything, the past shows why Clark Kent has become the man he is today and it doesn't hold much back. There is going to be a large battle scene at the end, the critics noted it was over 20 minutes long. It probably was, but I like to think it was well done. Critics, and a lot of people have an issue with the ending, once again not to spoil anything, it gets dark. I think people expected this to be a super kid friendly movie, it's not. I don't know what gave people this idea, but with Zack Snyder and Nolan working together, you had to expect it to be a darker, more realistic movie.Could the story have been better? Maybe. But for what that movie was, it was the perfect story for it. Could the special effects been better? No way. That's really what you're going for.It's a good story, nothing phenomenal, but a great looking movie. It's not a kids movie and you shouldn't expect it to be. It deals with how people have to make choices and the lines are never black and white and where that grey is, is what makes Man of Steel a great superhero movie.","73 out of 128 found this helpful.

You can certainly tell they put a lot of money into it. It really paid off as it makes for a great action movie. Don't listen to the critics as Man of Steel is about entertainment and it does exactly that. Although the overall tone of the film is much darker than previous versions which is a little depressing and Amy Adams was quite possibly the worst choice for Lois Lane but other than that it is a great movie.I feel like this version of Superman has never been told before. It doesn't feel stale and ""done before"" but instead offers a new take on a very familiar subject. It's no shiny saviour story, it shows how toxic fear and prejudice really can be. It probably didn't need to be quite so long to send that message but it fills the time adequately nevertheless.So watch and enjoy it for what it is, the cast is more than enough reason.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Secondly if you're a none superman fan or a fan of the new 52 comics you'll love snyders vision of the character.Being a true fan (read the graphic novels) I can understand why die hard fans don't like this take. Superman is traditionally a more wholesome, moralistic and optimistic character but Snyder offers the other arc which is more nihilistic.Henry Cavill is pitch perfect as supes and Clark, and shouldn't be compared to Christopher reeve, given the era and version he played. Amy adams is likeable enough and captures the right amount of spunky sass of Lois, as is Michael Shannon as zod bringing the menace to his otherworldly denizen.The action set pieces are well put together, with some nice VFX as well. A must mention is zimmers score: exhilarating, grandiose and even uplifting at times.Just to address the main bone of contention and fallacy that has outraged a huge section of fans - ""superman doesn't kill"" FALSE! Throughout superman's storied history he HAS killed and more than once. Given the tone/arc Snyder took for the character this is more than appropriate it's just a question of where your tastes lie.It's a travesty that Cavill didn't get to play the character again for a sequel But given the hate received for the above mentioned point I believe put the brakes on it ever happening.

Yes, it was visually amazing with a great cast.... but seriously, it really does suffer from the old adage - ""If you can't make it good, make it loud and fast!"". The onslaught was relentless and could certainly have been cut by 20 minutes for the better.It's also inconceivable to think that the continuous mass destruction of Metropolis didn't result in thousands of innocent people dying because Superman made a wrong call and chose to not battle an identical machine that was located in a sparsely populated area of the world instead.Superman shows absolutely no concern for any of the people around him when he fights. Yes, he can fight battles and save people, but truly the emotional soul of Superman is that you should feel protected when he's around and in this film that is unfortunately lacking and you could now as easily be a victim of collateral damage.Another serious flaw was it's lack of heart. There was no emotional attachment to the characters. Superman, we have to remember is supposed to be a Paladin figure, whiter than white with goodness oozing through his pores. In essence a superhero that his contemporaries look up to.The final nail in the coffin for me was the dispatch of General Zod. Superman does not kill. Period. There are no ifs or buts on this one. FACT.The Marvel films although treading on similar territory have humour and soul that this DC flick fails to deliver. Dark and broody works for Batman, but Superman....???

(I mean, what if he was raised by Paris Hilton?) Kevin Kostner plays the dad, and he is a kind of superhero himself for his wisdom and self-sacrifice, much like Glenn Ford was in that role for the 1976 movie, ""Superman."" In fact, there is a lot here that will be an homage to that groundbreaking movie.And often it doesn't compare well by comparison. Here, the special effects are more advanced, but they are also simply more. There is so much computer driven action stuff here, and often with such fast pizzowy cuts and big explosions, it's all about sensation. The plot is there, and at least you can tell who is who, but there's little of what you would in a better movie call choreography. A good cast comes to the rescue. Amy Adams is terrific in her straight forward role as Lois Lane, and the evil nemesis played by Michael Shannon is excellent without ever being exaggerated and ridiculous. And most of all, Clark Kent a.k.a. Superman is really excellent—and hot—as played by Henry Cavill. (You can argue all you want about who is better in the role, Cavill or Christopher Reeve, but you need to see both movies first. I have and I leave it a tie because each fits the personality of the movie he is in best.)There are some raving good reviews of this movie and I don't blame them, but I'm guessing many of them have never seen earlier Superman movies. Not that the 1976 version is better—it has a similar bag of tricks and parallel flaws—but that the plot in this new one is not new. If you've seen the other movie. So if you are looking for some surprises rather than a series of reminders, you won't find them here.Except for the one big one that the enemy is from, well, you'll see soon enough. But what that means is lots and lots of high tech (and not always very well done) computer effects. The falling buildings are brilliant, and the set designs on Krypton are amazing, and they take up a large part of the movie. Some of the folksy warmth of the earlier movie is missing here, which I miss—they don't even reprise ""faster than a speeding bullet"" and all of that, which is kind of archetypal.Christopher Nolan had a hand in this production but did not direct it, but on the horizon for 2015 is a tantalizing title, ""Batman vs. Superman."" Let's see how that plays out with his superior movie-making intelligence. For now, this is a halting and sometimes numbing entry point.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I heard from other reviewers saying it was great, but others disliked it. I however, am part of the latter.I'm going to try my best to write this review without any spoilers, even though there's one moment that made my sister walk out of the theater in anger and made me nearly scream.This review is coming from someone who has watched 2 Superman movies, 8 and a half seasons of Smallville, and a season of Lois and Clark. I think I have knowledge of the original source material. First off, I'll discuss what made up most of the movie, the fight scenes. The only indicator to tell what the hell was going on is that Superman is wearing blue and the villains are wearing grey. It was also shaky and the city looks absolutely ugly with the grey and brown colors everywhere. Also, Superman sometimes doesn't seem to care about people within the city dying as a result of the fights. Now the acting. Amy Adams was a very bland Lois. Her connection with Canvill's character seemed like a friendship. Costner and Crowe aren't actors I'm a fan of, so obviously, I didn't like them. Everyone else's acting was either bland or average. Also for original fans, Perry White is bland too as a character and Lana Lang shows up for two scenes.There were a couple of moments that would be spoilers if I gave away why I hated them, but I'll just summarize in this: Bland acting, awful fight scenes, gross looking scenery, missing the point within characters, and boring as hell. I'm only giving it 2 stars because at first the scenery wasn't the worst I've ever seen, some of the acting was good, Martha Kent was very good, and the fight scenes weren't so repetitive at first.","54 out of 105 found this helpful.

"1","/10","What happens when the filmmakers don't like their main character.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3348891/?ref_=tt_urv","joshthegrave","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45628517/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2015","Man of Steel is a depressing example of what happens when a studio decides it would be profitable to make a movie based on a pre-existing franchise without any appreciation or love for the franchise itself. It's obvious in watching interviews with the producers and director, that they think Superman is lame and cheesy and needed to be made cool again. Unfortunately the person trying to make him cool is Zack Snyder who has a somewhat juvenile sense of social interaction and ethics. As an example, in the movie Clark destroys a man's big rig because the man harassed a waitress and poured a beer on Clark. It's clear in the film that we are supposed to accept this as a just punishment for the man's actions. It's meant to be cathartic. We're supposed to cheer at the justice of the situation. However, what Clark did was terrible. He did a really bad thing. He destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars in property and ruined this man's livelihood out of revenge. Revenge can be a cathartic experience for the viewer, but it's not the right thing to do. It's just the emotionally satisfying thing to do. Heroes are heroes because they do the right thing despite their emotion. Now, fanboys will argue that this is a young Superman just learning his moral code. However, this misses the point. The filmmakers themselves thought that this form of revenge was a good thing. Superman isn't learning his code. He's implementing it. It's such a cynical film you can practically hear the boardroom meeting that spurred its creation. The words, ""modern,"" ""dark,"" and ""gritty"" must have been said hundreds of times. The film is desaturated because bright colors are too campy and light. The opening is one long action scene because the creators thought we'd get bored just watching people talk. They need to talk while a war is happening behind them! Superman can't have red trunks because they're ""silly."" Ignore the fact that the film is riddled with silly nonsense. It's dark and gritty silly nonsense so it's cool I guess. Now people like to throw around the word, ""realistic"" sometimes to describe movies like this. This is a Hollywood marketing gimmick that they've unfortunately fallen for. This movie is shot almost entirely with a hand-held camera and features a significant amount of bouncing and snap zooms. This is meant to subconsciously evoke the feel of news footage from the audience. The color is desaturated to remind us of 9/11 and WWII footage. This is simply an aesthetic trick. Nothing about the film itself is more realistic in tone or content. None of the characters act or talk like real people. Things happen just because they need to happen in this type of movie. Zod could have won easily but he gives a cheesy villain speech that has been the downfall of so many movie characters. Lois appears places seemingly randomly just to hear or espouse expository dialogue. She loves Superman because she's the girl in the movie. They kiss because market research dictates that more people will buy the film if there's a romance subplot. There's no in universe explanation for why they would like each other. They have no apparent common interests or personality traits. They get together because they do in all the other versions we've seen. That's it. Why is Superman going to the Arctic? Cuz the ship is there and he needs to find it to talk to Jor-el and get the suit and send the signal that starts the invasion. Things just needed to happen for script reasons. Character motivation is irrelevant. Basically this movie is a marketing scam. They know that people will buy it because it's the most recognizable superhero in a day of very successful superhero films. They didn't know how to sell it so they made a generic alien invasion action movie full of one-dimensional characters and gave them the look and name of Superman characters. It's loud, it's dull, it's boring, and it's full of melodrama in an effort to convince us that it has themes and heart. I'd give it a zero if I could. Please don't support movies that have such little faith in the audience and put forth so little effort in actual story telling.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

"10","/10","For the critics who wrote bad reviews about MOS! This is absolutely a great movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814199/?ref_=tt_urv","lionatathens","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38504533/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","I have read some critics here, the great, the good, the so so, and the bad ones. I understand everyone has right for his opinions, and I certainly understand some people have high standards. But what I get out of these negative reviewers is they are just haters. Haters are going to be haters. No other ways to put it. First of all, when you walk into a theater to watch a blockbuster movie like MOS, what do you expect. Anyone who has seen the trailers should pretty much guess the story line, because general Zod's name was mentioned. So for these people to expect great story line completely blow their mind, they are simply asking for way too much. After all, superman's story has been told SO many times, there are certain things you simply can't just change. I think this movie did a great job to add some novelties to the character.Secondly, for those complain about too much fighting scene, imagine this really happens in a large city like New York or Chicago. You expect Zod will take it easy simply because it's earth? The whole point of this movie is to make it believable, we are not living in a world of 1970's any more. Things have to follow real law of physics if they want to look real. If superman can fly faster than a bullet, this is what he should fly like, not just floating in the air, so people can see how he flies. If you want to do that, go back to see the superman from 1978. That's the year you should have never grow out of. Unfortunately, this is 2013. I hate people give low scores to a film simply because they can without justifying the score while brag about their intelligence. I don't see any of that intelligence showing from their reviews at all.Finally, like every movie, this movie has its flaws, I think the kissing scene was way too sudden after all the big fights, it was not very convincing they would feel such a strong urge to kiss each other rather than looking for survivors. But again, as much as I liked Revengers, how much fighting scenes in that movie was believable? Blackwidow kicking ass using a hand gun against flying aliens, yeah, that really made sense! The point is, sometimes, you just need to throw all your prejudice out of the window and treat the film with respect, and learn to enjoy it. If with an open mind, it still turns out to be a bad movie, then by all means. I think this is a solid 9/10 superhero movie deserves better reviews.","81 out of 145 found this helpful.

"","","Terrific cast - lots of action but a bit too serious","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812166/?ref_=tt_urv","phd_travel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22484170/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2013","This is a visually stunning exciting serious movie. It's different from the Christopher Reeve version. It shows a lot more background about Krypton, Zod (quite noble here), Clark's childhood angst, his adult angst. I know it is no point to do a similar plot and so they have made some interesting changes in the Lois and Clark relationship. The action sequences are over the top and range from Smallville to Metropolis to space.The cast is almost perfectly chosen. Amy Adams is the ideal Lois Lane -charming and brave. Her role is sufficiently proactive. Diane Lane is moving and believable as Martha Kent. Russell Crowe is usually a bit grumpy looking but here he is alright. Chris Meloni is a good U.S. commander. Michael Shannon (who knew Boardwalk would lead to this) is quite a sympathetic and charismatic Zod. As for the comic book handsome Henry Cavill, he completely looks the part of Superman. It's too bad he has to look gloomy and scruffy for a good part of the movie. The new blue suit is an improvement on the older one with a more modern color. A few faults: The music was a highlight of the 80s version with the ""Superman Theme"" and ""Can you read my mind"" which are still memorable today. This 2013 film had a completely forgettable score. The climactic fighting and smashing into roads buildings is a bit overdone and repetitive. A few clever and original action sequences without so much destruction would have been better. But even if they went overboard, too much action is better than the Brandon Routh version which just sank.I missed the charm and humor of the Reeve version (eg the magic of the first flight with Lois) are not found here. Just a couple of chuckles in 2013. Some lighter moments might have made Superman a more rounded hero than some gloomy Dark Knight kind of action figure. Superman needs to be more fun than the other Avengers and Marvel heroes. Hopefully a sequel will go more into these other aspects of romance and humor.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

The good things first, Henry Cavill is great as Superman. The visual effects are spectacular and some of the changes made to the Superman folklore was surprisingly refreshing, IMHO. Having said that I found the movie to be a bit unsatisfying. Once the action starts its goes on forever and is kind of monotonous. The supporting characters are not very well developed ,but given that its just the first of the series(reboot) it can be ignored, I guess. My biggest gripe is that it does not contain enough thrills of a superhero movie (other than the elongated fight scene). Coming from the people behind the Dark Knight series, it just does not stand up to the standards. Overall I gave it 7/10","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

When their planet Krypton is on the verge of destruction, Kal's parents, Jor-El(Russell Crowe) & Lara Lor-Van(Ayelet Zurer) send him to Earth on a spaceship along with Codex, which is something that contains the DNA of every unborn Kryptonian. Clark lands on Earth & is raised on a farm in Kansas by two loving parents, Jonathan(Kevin Costner) & Martha Kent(Diane Lane). However, when Clark is old enough, Jonathan tells him that he's an alien & believes that he was sent here for a reason & even if it takes him his whole life, Clark owes it to himself to find out what that reason is. So, Clark goes on a journey to find out who he really is. When Clark saves Lois Lane(Amy Adams), she is amazed by his abilities & wants to know more about him. Meanwhile, another Kryptonian called General Zod(Michael Shannon) finds out that the Codex is on Earth along with Kal-El. He lands on Earth & tells everyone that they are either supposed to give him Kal-El or he's going to destroy the entire planet. Now, it is up to Superman to either do as Zod says & turn himself in or, save the day! Man of Steel was an outrageously spectacular & epic film! The special effects were mind blowing, especially in 3D. I must say that I loved Superman's new suit & I'm glad that he's not wearing his iconic red underwear. After the last couple of Superman films were huge disappointments, I was really hoping that this reboot would rejuvenate the Superman franchise. With Zack Snyder hired to direct & Christopher Nolan coming on board as the producer, Warner Bros. & DC were already halfway there. So, my expectations were pretty high. This movie did not disappoint! It surpassed my expectations by a huge margin. This is the best movie of 2013, so far. I think it's also going to be the best summer blockbuster of this year. The action in this movie is surreal, visually stunning & mind numbingly brilliant. Each fight scene between Superman & General Zod, Faora-Ul(Antje Traue) and the other enemies had me on the edge of my seat. Henry Cavill has done a spectacular job as Clark Kent/Superman. For me, he's even better than Christopher Reeve as Superman. Amy Adams is outstanding as Lois Lane. She's not just your average damsel in distress, she also helps Superman a lot. Michael Shannon is great as baddie, General Zod. Kevin Costner is mind blowing as Jonathan Kent. Diane Lane is impressive as Martha Kent. Laurence Fishburne is hilarious as Perry White. Russell Crowe is great as Jor-El. Antje Traue & Ayelet Zurer are effective as Faora-Ul & Lara Lor-Van respectively. I would like to conclude by saying, Man of Steel is an outstanding film. Even if you are not a fan of the comics, you will still love this film.","84 out of 152 found this helpful.

CGI is at its best and the action sequences are so much engaging that you would not care for 2D, 3D or N-D. So my suggestion would be to go for a 2D version.There are a few moral exaggerations in the movie that some viewers will find a bit difficult to digest, but in the overall backdrop of the movie, those would not matter a lot.

When Clark learns at last that he is from another world, he comforts Clark and embraces him in his arms;Clark: Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son? Jonathan: You are my son.Likewise, there are some scenes with Jor-El that work. For instance, when he says ""You are as much a child of Earth as you are of Krypton"" as opposed to the Donner version, who was obsessed with Clark abandoning his human emotions and embracing his Kryptonian heritage above all else... despite admitting that the Kryptonians' arrogance destroyed them. MoS Jor-El sees the differences, and says that humanity's difference from Krypton could be a good thing since it could lead them to not make the same mistakes.There are some beautiful moments in this film that show Superman as hopeful and inspiring. For instance, the scene where he first learns to fly has always been my favourite part of the film, and has one of the few instances of vibrancy of colour, and Clark actually smiling. And, when he's rising up to destroy the ""World Engine"" to save the world, likewise it's quite well handled.Now, though, I get to what kills the film for me:I used to think it just wasn't to my tastes, that it was over-dark and over-grim for Superman... but now, I flat-out think it was incompetent on a lot of levels, with many stupid scenes that make no sense and add up to a whole lot of nothing.We spend FAR too long, and have far too much focus on Krypton. The story has not changed in almost any version besides this one. Doomed planet, arrogant council who don't believe Jor-El, goodbye to son, rocket. That's it... yet here we've got a ridiculous amount of action, explosions, fighting, the weird skull codex thing that isn't explained why it's a skull, weird symbolism, the ""birthing matrix"" that looks like... well, The Matrix pods... it's kind of a mess.In that same opening, Zod is pretty pathetic--he seriously gets his ASS KICKED by Jor-El! A SCIENTIST, and the supposedly great military general, genetically bread to be a soldier and fighter... gets his butt kicked by essentially a nerd. Seriously! And do I even need to go into the ""I WILL FIND HIM!!!"" line? It's hilariously out of place, and I giggled so much at that. When Zod yelled stuff like that in the original, it fit the tone of the film and he had consistent funny, goofy moments balanced out with intimidating ones. Here, though... it's just a weird bit of laughter- inducing out-of-nowhere silliness.After that, we have so many random cuts to different points in the film at entirely random intervals that it's really difficult to tell what the hell each scene is meant to mean most of the time, and the flashbacks are so jarring, unnatural, brief and out-of-order that we don't even know when they're supposed to be, and what they're supposed to link to. Most of these scenes would probably be fine if told in a proper sequence, but they aren't, so I'm left not having a clue what to think about them.So often in this film, it'll feel as if it's about to explore the characters, build towards something, explain something about their personalities, and JUST as it's about to do so something explodes, or there's a crash, or the ambush-tornado turns up.The tornado scene is one of the most idiotic moments of the movie. Pretty much everything is wrong with it, from Jonathan seeing a trapped dog and sending his invulnerable super-strong son AWAY to hide under a bridge, only to try to save the dog himself (because Clark, a young 20- something fit man saving the dog is suspicious? But the 50+ year-old-man doing it is perfectly normal?) to the complete fundamental misunderstanding of tornadoes actually work on every level.Zod captures Superman in his fortress--Clark being the ONE GUY that he needs for his plan to succeed--and he puts absolutely no guards on him, just some weedy guy who immediately runs away. Oh, and weedy scientist outright states that Clark DOES NOT have his super-powers that he gets from the sun... and yet, a couple minutes later, with no exposure to sunlight, he breaks the bonds with super-strength. There is no excuse for that level of lazy writingThe villains are idiotic at almost every turn. They give no reason for why they have to make this new Krypton civilisation on Earth, they just want to because there'd be no movie otherwise.The climax of the movie, the final fight between Supes and Zod was never supposed to be in the movie to begin with. That was added later at the request of the studio who wanted one more fight. So, that scene of Superman snapping Zod's neck wasn't part of any directorial or writing vision. And that very much shows. None of the scenes following it make any reference to it, and the tone is so jarringly different that we seriously smash- cut from him screaming about killing Zod, to him joking about destroying government equipment and smiling.I hope that in the future it'll be justly left in the dust and practically forgotten.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

(Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Russell Crowe, Christopher Meloni, Amy Adams to name a few.) It made the movie interesting to watch. A performance worthy of applause. 3. Computer Generated Imagery - I can't help but say Wow, Amazing during the entire show. It was a visual feast. Feast is an understatement.2. Story Line. Well-established characters. The story was weaved creatively enough to bring the audience in an understanding the previous and post heroic sequence of Superman. And this is not just your ordinary Superhero movie, it has a heart. 1.

His chiseled made-for-GQ-cover looks and what-guns-are-you-packing body won't make it difficult for anyone to believe he is worthy of being tagged the Man of Steel.I love Christopher Nolan's work since I first saw ""Memento"" at an indie theater and the fantastic job he did rebooting the Batman franchise. But he's donned the producer's hat for this one and passed the directorial reins to Zack Snyder who I thought did okay on ""300"" but not much else (was NOT fond of ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"").The rest of the all-star supporting cast is enough for the price of admission.The anticipation from seeing the first official trailer a year before the movie was set to come out snowballed all the way to the minute I handed my ticket stub.The opening scenes were great, fantastic. Packed with enough action and drama that I started whispering to my teenage nephew how many times did he think we'd go back to watch this again.The non-linear story-telling worked well and it transitioned effectively from current time to flashbacks as the character is slowly revealed.I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But something about it just kept holding me back.Henry Cavill was convincing as the brooding, conflicted man from another planet coming to terms with his alien status. Unfortunately the script didn't give him much substance in terms of dialogue. He seemed more of a ""listener"" and ""observer"" and the bulk of the emotional character background was built through the dialogue of his parents. This made it tough to access the core of his psyche - which is one of the crucial things, I think, that made Christian Bale's ""Batman Begins"" so effective as you follow his journey from man to superhero.The second downer was Lois Lane (Amy Adams) having about as much chemistry with our main guy as marshmallow and ketchup. Their story line felt rushed and could have used a bit more flirting to build up some semblance of anticipation. (Smallville was quite more effective with this but that was helped a lot by the spunkier, self-assured, naughty, carefree Lois version than the plain-jane-trying-to-talk-tough-but-not-really-believable version on this one) Lastly, the fight scenes in the mid to latter stages between hero and villain - while as grand and explosive as you can imagine combat between two clashing megapowers could possibly be - starts to get tedious and overextended that at some point (after dozing into quick microsleep) I muttered ""just finish him already"".It's not as fun (or funny) as the Marvel stuff. It's not as deep or engrossing as the ""Batman"" reboot. It's just stuck in the middle - a victim of its own great expectations.Seeing it once was enough.","48 out of 160 found this helpful.

Could be the Angst of 9/11 Still Haunts and there are Human Casualties in the Film that is Estimated to be a Few Thousand.

Superman is a classic superhero movie that has been there and loved by generations of superhero fans. However, this movie is absolutely terrible. OK, it focused on action and dark tone, that is to be expected, maybe even wished for. But Zack Snyder really pushed it with his dark tone. I had high hopes for this movie, maybe it was the advertising and everyone looking forward to watching this movie, maybe it was just the fan in me. But this movie was depressing, this was maybe the movie with the least lines I have ever seen. Superman is not some brooding, depressing character. He is a person that has superpowers, yet he always wanted to be normal, just like any other guy, he always wanted to help others. This movie depicts him as some dark person, in the fight scenes the primary focus is on destruction. Have you ever seen Clark Kent fighting among as many people as possible, destroying everything around him? He is the kind of superhero that takes the fight away from the population, yet here he just destroys everything like its not important. He almost seems like he has no emotion, does not care about anything and the movie overall is just depressing and saddening. Zack Snyder, how did you manage to ruin a SUPERMAN movie, HOW?!? Shame on you! My recommendation, don't watch this movie and if you do, don't watch it with high hopes, terrible movie!","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

We of course owe this to director Zach Snyder and writer/producers Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer.The film stars Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman who makes the role his own along with everyone else in the cast that includes Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, and Russell Crowe. All these actors are phenomenal and have a good dynamic together that really shows particularly with Cavill and Adams who are dynamite together. This movie is essentially perfection from the ground up for many reasons that include direction, cinematography, casting, screenplay, special effects, pacing, acting, and story. You can tell everybody involved really cares for Superman and want to open up an exciting new mythology for audiences of all ages.The bottom line is watch this movie whether or not your fan of Superman or movies in general. Man of Steel is one fun ride that's completely new and fresh.... Plus there are plenty of easter eggs to get any Superman fan excited for the next step in this franchise. 10/10","30 out of 50 found this helpful.

I have been a fan of his since he was on ""The Tudors"". I was so rooting for him to be cast as Christian Grey but that is a different story.I liked the casting of this movie for the most part. Henry Cavill as Superman was obviously a good choice. Even though Superman was not technically human, I felt Henry's portrayal made him seem like someone I could emphasize with. Clark was always trying find where he belonged and what he was meant to do with his life. Something many of us Earth bound people should be familiar with!Both Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner did a wonderful job as the fathers'. Diane Lane was also a great choice as Clark's mom.I didn't care for Amy Adams as Lois Lane though. She was a take charge kind of girl but I found it hard to believe she really had a ""connection"" with Clark Kent. No there wasn't a lot of romance, which was fine, but I think her character shouldn't have taken such an active role in this story.Basically, I felt this film was trying to show the audience more of the history, which I liked. The action was good and the special effects were phenomenal. I walked away from this film knowing there had to be a sequel and curious to see what Zack Snyder has in store.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He delves into Kal-El's origins, his struggle to fit into a world that fears his powers, and his transformation into the beacon of hope, Superman. This character exploration adds layers of complexity, making Superman relatable and human.Henry Cavill's portrayal of the Man of Steel is exceptional.

His internal conflict between embracing his powers and protecting humanity resonates with viewers, making his journey all the more compelling.The film's visual effects and action sequences are groundbreaking. The destruction of Krypton, the heart-pounding battles, and the sheer scale of Superman's powers are breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals beautifully, creating an emotional resonance that elevates the film to epic proportions.""Man of Steel"" challenges the traditional superhero narrative by exploring themes of identity, responsibility, and the consequences of power. It doesn't shy away from the moral complexities of being a hero. The clash between Superman and General Zod forces Kal-El to make difficult choices, highlighting the weight of his decisions.The supporting cast, including Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El, deliver standout performances that enrich the film's narrative.Snyder's direction takes bold risks, breaking away from the campy superhero formula. He reimagines the Superman mythos for a modern audience while respecting its iconic legacy.

Smallville made the wise choice of delaying the costume and cape till the 11th hour and Singer's stab was a dead duck for being a quasi-reboot/sequel mash-up.

I felt I was doing more analyzing than watching during this monstrosity. It was increasingly annoying to me. What was ever wrong with the Superman we knew!

"","","Another disappointing ""remake"" of Superman 2","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812545/?ref_=tt_urv","zhubertX","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26634786/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2013","After seeing Man Of Steel, I'm still not entirely sure what Chris Nolan's ""big idea"" for Superman was. The film is less a mythic story and more a propulsive study in consistent movement, in a way that will remind people of J.J. Abrams's Star Trek films. The picture starts strong enough, with a prologue set during the final hours of Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) spirits his infant son to Earth in the hopes that his son will thrive as his home planet dies. There is a rather off-hand sense of fantasy here, with random flying animals, fantastical production design, and pure gee-whiz action on display. But once Kal-El is on Earth, the film gets choppy and unfocused for the rest of its running time as nonlinear flashbacks of Clark's childhood are intermixed with present-day journeys which leads directly into a third act that takes up the entire second half of the film. The flashbacks themselves are fine and occasionally moving, as Diane Lane and Kevin Costner make a terrific Ma and Pa Kent (kudos for keeping Ma Kent at the center of the story throughout), but the flashbacks seem randomly inserted into the film, with no rhyme or reason in regards to which one appears at what point in the story. Producer Chris Nolan's tendency to explicitly spell out character motivation and themes first rears its ugly head in these early moments, a pattern than continues all the way up until the end.Henry Cavill makes a frankly terrific Clark Kent/Superman when the film actually lets him act. But this is a a film almost completely lacking in scenes where characters actually talk to each other. The emphasis is on over-complicated plot, burdened by the inexplicable need to explain every little plot detail while precious running time drips by.It's a pumped-up, seemingly dumbed-down, and action-packed franchise reboot apparently designed to appeal to the stereotypical mass audiences that allegedly like their blockbusters big and simple. The picture looks great (in 2D at least), with peerless technical credits on every level, and is mostly well-acted. But it is hobbled by a terrible script and a disjointed and rushed story that fails to gel as an emotionally-coherent adventure film. I take no joy in expressing disappointment in a film like this.My grade is 2/10. (just for the CGI).","19 out of 46 found this helpful.

Unlike the 1978 Superman, it tackles the emotions of Clark Kent a.k.a. Kal-El a.k.a Superman, as we all knew him. The visual effects was awesome and it gives us an out-of-this-world look of planet Krypton and the chaos in Metropolis was way better than that of the Avengers and Iron Man 3 combined. The standouts were Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Amy Adams' Lois Lane is just not your usual damsel in distress and Michael Shanon's Zod was also good. The most surprising of all is FAORA, General Zod's disciple. Henry Cavill's Superman fits the Superman of the 21st Century but needs more sense of humor. They say it's ZACK SNYDER's best movie to date but I say it's the BEST Superman movie to date!Man of Steel is the Dark Knight version of Superman but much less darker and full of emotions.","77 out of 144 found this helpful.

My 3 friends and me have already bought tickets to see MoS on Friday and Sunday - one of my friends - a die hard Superman fanatic has vowed to watch MoS 10 times before its run is up....i think i too will end up watching it at least 4 times if not more. The cast is superb, the score by Zimmer is top notch and the action combined with the score will make your spine tingle. I have seen some negative reviews by some critics - They are obviously either bitter old men angry that new Superman is not the smiling, Cat saving Superman from the Donner era or frustrated women who wanted more 'romance' and 'feelings' for which they can just watch Superman Returns. Go watch MoS - it is the Superman movie the world has been waiting for.","48 out of 86 found this helpful.

To see the product of such a talented collection of filmmakers, many having created films I've thoroughly enjoyed, be so joyless and feel so unfinished and rough around the edges and blunt, is very disheartening. Ultimately after the film was over, it really felt like I had watched an imitation of a blockbuster film, made by people who just didn't know what they were doing, or trying to say.The movie is technically brilliant. CGI is superb. It was shot on film using anamorphic lenses, which I really appreciate for the look it creates. But what the film actually captured, and what the CGI was overlaid on top of, the actual movie, the story, is a flatline. The filmmakers just strung together a bunch of trailer shots and told Hans Zimmer to ""do that thing you do"", and that is it. There is no substance here. There is almost no character interplay, so many scenes basically only has two characters interacting. There is no effort from the filmmakers to actually weave the characters in the film into an engaging storyline, playing multiple characters off each other, exploring the dynamics of superman having two father figures. Superman has only sporadic dialogue, of which only a small percentage actually has substance and isn't just written to be a cool soundbite for the trailers.The rest of the film is just a blur of CGI destruction imagery you would be hard pressed to differentiate from Transformers or Star Trek, which I was devastated to realize while in the cinema. The last 3rd of the film is in essence a particle effects demo from the effects houses involved.I really cannot recommend this film to anyone. If you haven't seen a few previous films that destroy cities on massive scales it might still be a novelty you won't regret spending money on, but for anyone who wants to watch a movie with characters that engage you emotionally, stay away until you can watch it free of charge. Considering the film wanted to explore the character, and the huge possibilities that lie with Clark Kents dual heritage, where he belongs, who he is as a person, this film is one of the biggest creative failures in recent memory.","33 out of 63 found this helpful.

In this case, I think the movie is better in 2023 than it felt in 2013. I enjoyed it back then, but now it stands out from today's movies by striking a healthy balance with character development, action, believability, fantasy, heartwarmingness, and some pro-American, pro-human messaging without feeling too cheesy. For example, when Christopher Meloni's character, an Air Force Colonel, refused to force Lois Lane to go with the Kryptonians, it felt believable and just honorable enough without making you roll your eyes. In that scene, Meloni was also indifferent to Superman's fate (""the alien""), so when he later proclaimed ""This man is not our enemy,"" you felt like Colonel had a legitimate change of heart. To me, much of the movie tied together really well like that.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

The emotional attachment between Clark and his foster parents was portrayed well (kudos to Hans Zimmers music to make it realistically emotional) What the movie lacks: The plot overall, didn't have much of a grip.

This is the best superhero movie of all time just because of its special and visual effects, every thing is just fantastic about this movie such as effects, story, acting, directing, cinematography and so on. It's duration about two and a half hour but when you're see this movie you'll realize that how the time will pass after you watched this movie.There are several reasons to watch this movie, here's a quick list :-1. This is the best superhero movie till date you all admit it after you watched it. 2. It contains the best action scenes and special effects. 3. All the actors and actress gave peerless performance in it.4. The plot of the movie is never make you bored. 5. Directed by ZackSnyder and written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. (we all know these legends and also know what they're capable of)Everything is just perfect about this film like director Zack Snyder, writers Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer and all the star cast. Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent done amazing, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburn as Perry White, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and last but not the least Michael Shannon as General Zod. All the actors and actress done peerless performance so does the directors and writers and make the wonderful movie. Man of steel has some epic scenes. Michael Shannon as General Zod done well. I gave 10/10 to this movie and now this is the best action movie till date. After watching it i am came to the conclusion that finally DC > Marvels and this is the epic superhero movie after batman trilogy (nolan's)Man of steel has good visual and special effects so its looks more amazing when you're watching in 3D.","199 out of 400 found this helpful.

The depiction of Krypton is perfect and the best in a live action or animated movie.

Followed by a decent Star Trek sequel, a very successful and unexpected Fast and Furious 6 as well as an out of nowhere decent flick Now You See Me, the reins were handed to Man of Steel to be the summer blockbuster to blow everyone away. Man of Steel is a solid movie as a whole. The plot suffers from clichés and it is rushed to death, but some substantial stuff is there. Performances all around are good but special mentions go to Russell Crow and Kevin Costner for an outstanding job. As far as an action flick goes...expect a lot of it. If you thought the previews had all the action...boy, you're in for a surprise. The movie is nonstop action, things blow up and get destroyed at least five minutes within one another and the last hour of the film defines mayhem. As a superman film, here is where Man of Steel succeeds. Henry Cavill was an outstanding Clark Kent. His portrayal was on point: charismatic, fragile but strong, charming but menacing, and a pretty boy for the ladies if they felt turned off by the Fourth of July over the top action sequences that were taking place around him. The storyline was very fragmented but his character was made out to be a lot more interesting and less cheesy than other films, but still had its flaws. Now, for General Zod. As excited as I was to see a villain that can rival Superman and a break from the overused Lex Luthor, he was too much for the first film. Why do I say this? His character was developed rather poorly and his dialogue sounded very similar to that of many other villains that we have seen before. Despite that, the final fight scene was memorable. You get what you expect. Two titans go at it for a good amount of time and if there fighting does not pump your adrenaline, go check your pulse. Man of Steel. The best of summer 2013 so far, one of the best Superman film (if not the best to date), amazing action flick (believe it or not, people might say it has too much action), and overall one of the much better superhero movies out there only rivaled by Nolan's batman trilogy (Someone give the Justice League a green light, Bale and Cavill? That would be unbelievable). Forget the critics, everyone has something to enjoy here, thats for sure.","50 out of 92 found this helpful.

I got a good view up Superman's cape but it was hard to keep up with the action since I was less than 20 feet away from the screen. Anyway, from what I was able to surmise, Man of Steel as a story is a disappointing addition to the stable of Superman movies. Perhaps it's just the character. I'm a Batman fan and I think the world is subdivided on Superman vs. Batman lines, so maybe I'm being unfair ... but I doubt it. Anyway, from a visual standpoint, it was spectacular. The action and particularly the fighting sequences with Faora-Ul, Tor-An, General Zod and Superman are incredible. How Metropolis is supposed to rebuild itself after the super-being Armageddon should be a documentary unto itself.I wrote about this elsewhere: You know a movie is in trouble when the film creators have a harder time asking you to suspend your disbelief about the relationships and drama between characters than scientifically unsound principles commonly found in superhero movies. It felt like Lois Lane was shoehorned into parts of the film where she had no reason to participate. I'm sure it was to create some sort of early emotional connection between her and Clark, but it felt awkward and unnecessary. Amy Adams should have been a miscast, but since the Lane character wasn't really working, I suppose it didn't matter that she played the role. That's not a dig at Amy, it's just an unfortunate side effect of a poorly formed role. On the flip side, Michael Shannon as General Zod was brilliant. He's such a malevolent looking character when he furrows his brow and curls his lip. I thought his final pre-fight invective was very well written and played. It took the edge off Zod's evil and exposed him as more of a relentless, unsympathetic warrior. I thought that the periodic flashbacks to Clark's formative years was a good instrument for building a better understanding of his character. It was formulaic to be sure, but the method of delivery was intriguing. Having said that, the film lost me a few times. It definitely tried to pack in a lot of material even though the film's run time was long. That's something I think is partially unavoidable in superhero movies. With interweaving story lines that span years, it's hard to simplify them into a single film even if the focus is on only one aspect of the character's tale.In all, I think Man of Steel is worth watching at least once for its sheer summer blockbuster value. If you like big special effects, and wanton destruction, you'll enjoy this film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Goyer and Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy. It stars Henry Cavill in the title role of Superman/Clark Kent, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El.Man of Steel retells the origin story of Superman, from baby Kal-El's birth on the doomed planet Krypton, to his earliest beginnings as Superman, the protector of Earth. The story moves at a leisurely pace so nothing is ever too slow, but not so quick that you would miss important information.One of my favourite things about Man of Steel is how it manages to balance a thoughtful, complex narrative with kinetic, effects-driven action. For me, action and story are two very important elements in a superhero movie, and Man of Steel has plenty of both.Henry Cavill manages to give everybody's favorite blue Boy Scout some depth to balance out his mega-powered persona. I'm sure some were hoping for a little more smiling but it didn't bother me too much, as this is an origin story, after all. Cavill and Adams had a fun dynamic as well. They play off each other as well as you'd hope from one of pop culture's most popular romantic pairings. Michael Shannon's Zod is a menacing foe, and one with a complex history, making him a worthy adversary to Superman. Russell Crowe's Jor-El is an interesting character to watch; he has the silkiest voice, and it's fun to hear him speak all mythically.Another thing I enjoy about this movie is Hans Zimmer's music. His theme for the movie is somber, with a hint of hopefulness hinting at Clark's eventual turn into Superman. As for the action scenes, all the CGI is stellar, explosions are plentiful, and the final showdown in Metropolis is one for the ages.One thing that may turn off Superman purists is the darker tone than what we've come to expect from this kind of character. It is haunting at times, but it doesn't bug me to the extent it does some people. You should be able to form your own judgment when watching the movie easily.Man of Steel: a fun, thoughtful movie that may turn off purists, but should satisfy newcomers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Or in the words of a non-critic leaving the preview: ""There was an awful lot of unnecessary destruction."" My nightmare has come true—maybe the most sacred super hero story is reduced to the rubble that piles up in almost 2 ½ hours of the Superman back story, loaded with mayhem, be it with childhood accidents young Clark Kent must attend to or the bad guys from Krypton playing nasty with earth.You got it: I dislike a surfeit of destruction, and this sci-fi actioner is chock-full of it. Funny thing, though, you'd think director Zack Snyder would avoid images of Metropolis buildings falling down that remind us of 9/11. However, the hours are filled with disintegrating structures and their skeletons that are too similar to the iconic destruction of lower Manhattan a dozen years ago. Anyway, abundant destruction, not enough dialogue.The time spent on Krypton is too much with too little importance for the earth story as Superman's father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe), sends baby Kal-El (Henry Cavil) to our planet. Then more unnecessary time is spent in Kansas as adoptive dad and mom (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) help him determine what kind of a human he'd like to be. ""Unnecessary"" because the heart of the Superman story is his adventures as an adult, which mirror the struggles of simple folk everywhere writ much larger.More waste in the little attention paid to the rich possibilities of challenges with Clark's girlfriend (Lois Lane is played by a competent and not impressive Amy Adams). Lawrence Fishburne brings promise to the role of editor Perry White, a part woefully underused. Michael Shannon as General Zod, very bad guy from Krypton, has so few good lines that any mean looking dude could have played him. That homely bowl haircut, though, is distracting. Diane Lane is a believable and attractive mother, but she can't save this banal adventure by herself.","29 out of 82 found this helpful.

Russell Crow does a great job and plays a bad ass dad.The action is superb and keeps your gripped.It's a shame that Man of Steel (at this point) isn't looking likely. I , for one.

I would have ended the movie with Zod being sent back to the Phantom Zone without having his neck snapped thus leaving it open for Zod to return.The soundtrack was OK but you need to respect John Williams. I know they were going for organic and wanted nothing to do with Superman The Movie but even the Bond movies changed actors but kept the theme music that has been around since Dr. No. I am tired of the origin being retold and redone.

I think man of steel is a pretty good movie, watched it a couple times in high school and enjoyed it then too. It was the start of Snyder's dark vision of what the DCEU was gonna be. I was afraid to revisit because I loved it then, but recently learned of how much people hated DC in the past few years.The visuals of krypton in ruin were amazing at the start. Actually reminded me of the Kryton series. Michael Shannon was acting his ass off, like he took this very seriously and made a good villain from that. We really get to see Superman's origins, not just the home planet but also his upbringing. Showing that despite basically being a god, him being raised by humans made him as human as any of us. So he's not just the man of steel. We see him as a young adult trying to find himself.I Still think it was pretty dumb to reveal to general zod he had to hone his senses. You know one thing I don't understand that annoys me so much is that humans, usually a military guy, fires guns at someone/something and can clearly tell they're bullet proof, but they still keep firing. Martian manhunter is revealed later on. So what was he doing? Watching Superman get his ass whooped in front row seats lol?This was a different take to Superman and most fans were upset. A lot of people were mad that Superman killed, but I didn't mind. We got to see a flawed more human Superman, but he was still a positive light. He was just a superhero who made mistakes like we do, who had moral dilemmas like anyone would. I also loved we got to see his connection with his human parents. I'm writing this after binging man of steel to ZSJL straight so I might be blending things a little.Some similar funny lines from different movies, I'm forgetting one more because I remember thinking of four while watching this:""Where did you train? On a farm!"" - Zod.""I am Kang, you talk to fish!"" - Kang
""You think you're so great because you have boats!"" - Napoleon.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Good acting/casting, decently well written story (I'm not one of the ""grimdark"" complainers, that didn't bother me,) and it had a big plus in Shannon who was excellent as a very well-written Zod. The fight sequences were suitably huge and bombastic... all in all, this movie didn't make very many mistakes. But... the one mistake it DID make was so pervasive that I could not leave the theater NOT hating Man of Steel. EVERY SINGLE SECOND of this movie is shot in shaky-cam, pretentious, ""realistic-o-vision."" Editing the movie to look like it was filmed on an iPhone is OK for maybe ONE or TWO action scenes. Maybe a long shot or 2 as well. It is unnecessary and unforgivable in a scene where 2 people are standing still and speaking to one another, and even worse if it is every single frame of the movie. Add to that the bizarre use of intentionally blurring foreground and background to give the impression it was filmed by 1970's camera technology as opposed to the state of the art digital cameras we KNOW they used. It is a baffling (and ugly and stupid) choice of visual aesthetic, and was SO overused it never stopped being annoying. So, 2 out of 10. If petit-mal camera doesn't bother you... I'd say at least a 7.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

Special effects 10/10. Story 4/10 (and I'm being generous). I swear, I just don't understand how they can make a movie like this since there was ample examples in the past on how to do it and how not to do it.I don't even know where to start at how bad the story was. Leave it at that. About the only thing I can say positive was that the writer(s) tried something different. Makes me wish I had gone into the movie business if this crap is considered good. And I like pretty much every prior iteration of Superman, the comics, the old and new TV shows, the first few of the Christopher Reeves movies.Update: I have watched this a few more times over the years and I bumped up my rating from 5 to 6. It isn't bad and Cavill is good in the role (maybe even excellent). The lame script held things back and the inexplicable bad casting of Amy Adams (who I like in other roles) was a horrible choice.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The fact that the superhero is not Superman just boosts up the score of much I liked this film. In this film Clark Kent is Kal El who is much better known as the Man of Steel. They spent loads of money on the action scenes which is quite overrated as they weren't as good as other action sequences but still make you jump up with joy and make you feel like flying around the cinema with Kal El during the movie (Even in 3D). At parts Man of Steel does bore you but gets away with it in time for you to get back on track with the movie and follow its circumstances. The plot was very good especially in the end. It has quite a few twists and turns that work in different ways but my favourite one was the one at the very end which I won't spoil in case you are going to see the film soon. The dialogs were very strong especially from Kal – El, General Zod and basically everyone else in this film. Henry Cavill as Kal-El was a good choice and Russell Crowe also does his 20 minutes of the film well but the person who's highly commendable in this film is Michael Shannon as General Zod. He's not the best villain but he does his role as good as it can get.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's a bunch of vignettes that show us only the important stuff that shaped Clark into the man he will become. Being spoon-fed this origin content is basically pointless, as the Clark Kent we see all grown up fighting for what he believes in and protecting what he believes in speaks volumes and we can come to the conclusion about his back story ourselves. The usually reliable Amy Adams makes a not very believable Lois Lane and while she's not bad by any means, she comes across miscast. Henry Cavill fits the bill and is a strong enough presence on screen, where the previous Clark Kent in the unsuccessful Superman Returns Brandon Routh was like watching a black hole on screen. The action is miles over the top, with some great effects leveling Metropolis. A minor gripe is some soul deadening overt product placement that cheapens some scenes. Fighting in IHOP, 7-11, SEARS - I'm glad to know the fictitious city of Metropolis has the same annoying franchises. The action climaxes for about 20 minutes too long and becomes disaster porn and watching the 50th skyscraper crumble becomes a bit monotonous, but overall Man of Steel is a good watch and the money spent is clearly on screen.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

His compulsion to put ideas before any heart or emotion costs him again.
Yes it's watchable, it's visuals are great, the action, the score, is phenomenal.
Especially the action. But Snyder fails to keep a grip on the story rendering it uneven for most parts and only seems to have a grip when the action begins or the visuals enroll. He tries and just passes to make a competent film overall, but we expected better in terms of character and story maybe he isn't the right one for the job
Watch it purely for its visual greatness.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I collected every kind of comic book possible and I still have them all, 37 years later. I was delighted when Marvel decided to get into the movie making business. The time was right and computer effects were cheap enough to create stunning movies which could be faithful to the stories they were reliving.And stunning they were, in true comic book style, as they concentrated on character development which is all important in this kind of story.An unfortunate trend has begun in the last year or two. Because anything is possible in CGI the movie makers attempt to make bigger and bigger spectacles, relying on the crutch of physically impossible action sequences, tumbling buildings and explosions to keep momentum going. This was very evident in Iron Man 3 which I disliked, and it's plain to see again in Man of Steel. The few attempts to evoke emotions from the audience were back-slappingly funny (Kevin Costner, you know what I am talking about).About 3/4 of the way through, I realized I was thoroughly bored with the commotion and I yearned for some humour and plot development. It was obvious none would be forthcoming. I am afraid despite the high scores people are giving this film, it's a real dud.I hope this recent trend to appeal to the lowest common denominator ends soon and that movie makers go back to what really gets people talking about a movie: the story.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

Goyer (screenplay) must have run out of cardboard from which to cut them.Action movie fans may like the action sequences in this film. But I felt no sympathy for any character. It was almost as if I was watching an old-style movie about zombies ... trudging through their roles until the movie reached its conclusion. Normally, I doze off during soulless films like this. But, I forced myself to stay awake ... hoping to catch even a glimpse of ""depth"" or ""flesh"" given to any character.

On a surprising note ,Russel Crowe as Jor-El, has a good amount of scenes and hes amazing in them!Diane Lane and Kevin Costner do good as the foster parents.There's a tight bond between Superman and both his parents (his dad and both foster parents) and the actors do an excellent job bringing it out.The stumbling block for MOS is its story.Don't get me wrong ,its good ,but there's some heavy structural problems and thats mostly the directors fault.Other than that ,the story is engaging.The excellent depiction of Krypton and explaining Superman's powers on Earth were all done neatly.Goyer has brought in the realistic natures that were seen in The Dark Knight Trilogy and lends MOS the same ,a hard task considering the highly out of the world powers of Superman. The relations between Superman and his parents were excellently highlighted.But his romance with Lois was not good enough.Some scenes do go a bit over the top (ex:The tornado flashback) ,and its hard to understand the choices the characters make.Zod's character was well developed and this helps in making him a great villain.The visual effects were amazing.The Krypton sequences and especially the climax was wonderful!Music from Hans Zimmer was as usual amazing.It really gives the movie an intense atmosphere.Direction by Zack Snyder was good.He keeps the movie packed with emotion and drama and amazing action scenes.The pace of the movie is a bit uneven at the start as it shifts back and forth from action to drama in the course of minutes ,but the latter half is fast paced and action packed.One of the issues i had with MOS was, Zack trying to 'Nolanise' the movie.The first half is riddled with jumping from the past and the present almost continuously.Juggling with timelines is best left to Nolan.Some scenes end all of a sudden and others just jump ahead without proper clarity.Editing is weak especially in the middle ,and this could irritate some viewers.But Zack does master one aspect of the movie and thats the ACTION.I really have to talk about the action of this movie. It was just mindblowing!!! The entire third half of the movie is one gigantic EPIC battle.I have to say that its the best superhero fight sequences I've EVER seen.Mixed with the soundtrack and the visuals ,the action is just jaw dropping.The scale of destruction was immense.It was really great to see Superman actually fighting someone that matched his powers.The finale left me speechless There are plenty of powerful scenes showcasing Superman's powers and all of them are spot on.Zack has made no mistake handling the action sequences ,and thats what keeps this movie afloat.Overall ,Man Of Steel will go down as an excellent reboot of Superman made memorable with those jaw dropping action sequences.Its not perfect but its a blast!Its a must watch if you love action!Acting- 4/5 Story- 3.5/5 Direction- 3.5/5 Action- 5/5 Drama- 4.5/5 Thriller- 5/5 Visual Effects- 5/5https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=673752085985052","33 out of 59 found this helpful.

A big budget wash over Superman Returns without the charm or fun of what we want out of our summer popcorn films. Look past its technical CG precision and you'll get one unusually dumb film. It's a true waste of a great cast.I blame Goyer for the terrible script and Zach Snyder for not being smart enough to polish that bad script enough to deliver anything fun or meaningful. This movie falls into the abyss of most summer movies - excellent advertising for an inferior product. Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern.

The film is directed by Zack Snyder who is a master in creating stunning visuals (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch). So, it is quite natural that the output has shades of The Dark Knight with the protagonist having to lug some emotional baggage of his past despite being a superhero.The story basically has Superman trying to save earth from a misguided General Zod who was banished from their home planet of Krypton before the planet's core collapsed destroying the entire planet. Zod wants to build a new Krypton on earth even if it means that the present inhabitants of the planet would have to be exterminated for that purpose.The film works only in parts especially where a young Clark Kent has to get a grip on his superpowers as a young kid as well as in his youth. He is guided by his adoptive parents played by a wonderful Kevin Costner & Diane Lane. Russell Crowe also does a competent job in the initial sequences as the chief scientist of Krypton as well as in several appearances strewn through the film in guiding his son. The film also benefits immensely from a rousing score from Hans Zimmer.Henry Cavil fits the part beautifully though he could've added further dimensions & depth besides the grey & sombre moods. It might well be because the writers haven't provided him with such scope.And, that is a major issue with this movie because for, what I am sure is, a first installment of a franchise, it almost completely shuns the lighter shades and humour and seems to revel in its dark tones. Even the part of Lois Lane played by Amy Adams seems incomplete. Yes, she seems to be a capable, Pulitzer winning investigative journalist. But, little else....My next & biggest grouse is that the action sequences though awesome in all their CGI wizardry have a very chaotic & noisy feel to them and appear more from that dull & jarring junkyard rampage, Transformers. The last half hour is almost completely mired in sequences where almost an entire city is ground to dust. While Michael Bay might feel happy to find this carnage & may even feel inspired, it is such a put off.. Wonder when these guys would learn from Cameron or even Joss Whedon ...This appears even more of a criminal waste when you consider the first part of the movie seemed to be in a tearing hurry of a runaway freight train and throws so much at us including the backstory of Krypton, the growing up of young Clark Kent, his youth, his discovery of his origins, etc. All that for this crescendo of chaotic madness... Oh, how we wish they had dwelt more on building characters with more shades & depth.....Overall, while the movie is definitely a good watch & might be THE BIG BLOCKBUSTER of the season, one feels SUPERMAN deserved something more SUPERlative than this ! Hope they do a better job with the sequel !!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Zack Snyder-directed film revisits Superman's origin While certainly a superhero movie, Man of Steel is first and foremost a science fiction drama about an alien trying to find his place in our world and dealing with humanity's reaction to his existence. More than any other Superman film since the 1978 one, Man of Steel reminds us that Superman isn't human,The hugely entertaining Man of Steel is the best Superman movie since the 1978 original. Cavill makes a great Superman, but we don't really get a true emotional attachment to the adult Clark Kent until he meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams). The flashbacks to Clark's youth inform us of his journey thus far and give us a sense of his inner demons. Otherwise, Clark is, as Lois describes him at different points, like a ghost or a cypher.The visual effects, many of which were created by WETA Workshop, are generally great, especially the screen's most fully realized depiction of Krypton yet...Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department.

First I'm going to say it is great. There's a lot of critics comparing it to the Donner movies, but this is something different. I loved the Donner/Reeve movies. But that is 35 years old. It's time to move on. Something that a lot of critics are also saying is that it doesn't have ""magic"", or ""humour"", taking away the ""fun"" that superman has.... Excuse me but that belonged to the Donner universe, which was fine for it's day, but nowadays some may call it ""cheesy"" and not serius, too fantasy and all powerful. Man of Steel is serious. It's in the real world. It shows what would happen if it was inserted in a real world, what would be people's reaction, governments, army, media, etc... This approach was taken with The Dark Knight trilogy and it worked. It's different than the light movies Marvel has given us (except for the first Iron Man, which I think had a little more serious tone). And believe me, it is not ""dark"", it feels real!!!. The movie gives answers to a lot of questions. The Clark 's journey from boy to man is very well done, like batman begins. Cavill is great as Superman, and he gives the role a real character's decisions and reactions. Amy Adams is a great Lois, tough and very brave, not the woman in danger every time, but a real badass!!! Russel Crowe is also great as Jor el, and Shannon is the best Zod one can hope, maybe a little over the top. Faora is also frightening and shows some robotic coldness of a society of warriors with no moral to stop them. Diane Lane is a great mom and Costner is the best Pa kent with little screen time. The other characters are all great and their screen time serves the pacing of the film. The critics also say it has little character time, but it serves for the porpose of the movie, there's a lot of things happening and there's a limited time to tell the story, which is awesome and very entertaining. Also it is built as with the sense that there will be secuels, so the romance, conflicts and characters will be more explored or developed in secuels. There's sci fi, adventure, drama, action, all in one. The best action I have seen. The Fx are really great and the fighting is similar to the animated justice league's best fight's, with massive destruction. I could go on and on talking great about this movie, but to say something, I will say it's one of the best movie experiences I've had. 10/10.","57 out of 109 found this helpful.

For one, the climax had too much building smashing. Who does Superman think he is, the Hulk? And another thing, it's not shown that Superman has weaknesses. No Kryptonite in sight. So that's a big problem when you have Superman, who is practically immortal, vs. General Zod who is also practically immortal. The ending is like watching a game of Chess that you know is going to end in a stalemate. Luckily it doesn't, but I'm not saying how. Plus, it feels like, to quote Journey ""the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on."" Don't get me wrong I thought this was great! For one, much better writing than Superman Returns. Another thing, it feels darker than a Superman movie normally is, which isn't surprising considering Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) was the producer. That's a great improvement over the other films, which, compared to this feel silly. And Bonus: In 2015 when Man of Steel 2 comes out, Superman AND Batman FINALLY come together on the big screen! I'm really looking forward to that! Grade: B- 8/10 4/5 stars","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

Yet, here we go again. Like the character, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It is advertised and sold as a piece of summer popcorn entertainment, but tries to be a ""Gladiator"" type film at the same time and ends up being neither. It's overly moody in a bad way. I always like Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner and they did the best he could given the material but that doesn't really equal anything special because their screen time is so brief. Both are gone from the film fast like they were cashing pay checks and their agents promised them they would have to spend more than seven days shooting this awful script. Was I expecting too much given this cast and director? I haven't been this disappointed since Crystal Skull hit like a bad punch to the gut.It was really disappointing. I find it very hard to believe that any intelligent critic truly liked this film. I chalk the few positives up to blind love for the character itself or the flare of Zach Snyder and not his actual work this time around. Most of the critics hate it for a good reason. It's overtly dramatic and tries to play on sympathies that they just don't set up. Character driven? That is the most overused term, thrown around by those who don't know any better. If a character strings together more then four coherent lines people love to label the movie as ""Character driven."" The fact is, the characters aren't developed during this film. The movie is presented in such a hammer-handed fashion that you just want to cringe. It's all dumb video game action all the time. So sad.Bottom line: wait for video. Don't get your hopes up. Some of this is interesting to watch but NONE of it can be classified as high quality in any way. You'll need your fast forward button if you're at all an intelligent movie fan.","33 out of 102 found this helpful.

Between Marvel and DC, there is no shortage of CGI-rich superhero films and this one doesn't offer much new. Once again, the villains are almost God-like in their power and come with technology that can do want ever the plot calls for. I didn't like the film's depiction of Krypton - the mix of retro and futuristic, the clunky armour (really trendy these days) and Jor-El's dragon (?) was an awkward blend of styles that looked contrived and forced. The action set pieces went on too long and after while all started to look the same. The cast is fine, despite his Earthly origins, Clavill has a super-hero body and Shannon is OK as Zod (but lacks the supercilious menace of Terrance Stamp's take on the villain in 1978's 'Superman II'). Amy Adams was fine as ever-tenacious reporter Lois Lane (unfortunately Laurence Fishburne was wasted as her boss Perry White) but Russel Crowe outstays his welcome as Jor-El's avatar. The final fights between Superman and, first Zod's hench people, and then the General himself featured lots of destruction but eventually just blurred together. Superhero movies seem to be polarising themselves into grim and pretentious vs. silly and flippant. I miss the whimsical fantasy of the Chris Reeve films (the first two, the less said about 3 and 4 the better) or their semi-sequel 'Superman Returns' (2006).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Clearly, that is two possible outcomes and the carelessness of this line sums up a clearly inadequate script. There are no sharp interactions between hero and villain (think the Joker and Batman), the speeches seem hollow and meaningless and explaining the back story seems forced and untidy. The script is probably the largest failing here but it is not the only one. The movie is hideously paced, tediously inert for the first 90 minutes followed by 45 minutes of explosions and rugby tackles. The film tries to establish itself as dark, brooding gritty yet this appears in stark contrast with firework display of a conclusion. The casting is questionable, Adams as Lois Lane is uncomfortable fit to say the least. There also some established names wasted in nothing roles, primarily Laurence Fishburne. In general the film fails to update the Superman story to the modern world, unable to escape the campy feel and implausibility of the plot. All in all this film is not terrible but it really isn't very good. It seems criminal to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special effects and not pay someone to check the dialogue makes sense or write anything memorable at all!","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

I also saw this in Iron Man 3. Anyway Superman lost pretty much every single fight he got into. He didn't do much fighting until later in the movie but once General Zod and his mineons got to earth Superman lost every battle he was in until the final one against Zod where he just barely pulled through at the very end of the fight. Cals dad said that he grew stronger than he would have because of the earths sun, so if he grew so strong than why could Zod and his minneons so easily beat him up? Also in Iron man 3 in the end of the movie the bad guys were beaten only because the regular citizen helped defeat the bad guys.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It presents an awful Superman that is good and does good ""because"". No character development, no psychological weight. A skin deep character that when really analized, it's not what the movie say it is.
He's selfish and vacant. He uses his power to get a girl or without thinking in the awful consequences that they could produce, all for personal reasons (time travel). The rest of the characters aren't better. Lex Luthor's plan is embarrasing and Louis Lane is insultingly superfitial, falling in love, basically, of power. She doesn't know Superman as a man, but she does love his powers. Great. Great character!Anyways. That was 1978. We are better now. And now we have a real human (that's how he grew up after all). Clark is filled with contradictions, complicated feelings and full of fears and weaknesses. He's phisically perfect, but mentally, he's just another boy and man. We see how he becomes Superman, slowly learning from his families (both), and finally making decisions by his own, not for himself, but for the well being of others, even sacrifizing things himself. But not by solving everything with his powers and that's it. No. It's never that easy. There is colateral damage and he has to deal with it and improve. I can love this Superman. Now you can really believe that a man can fly.","22 out of 38 found this helpful.

That shaky camera, zooms, out of focus shots, that's too much; studios or directors making movies with these kind of techniques, need to stop that now, that kind of shots were appropriate for films of lost footage type (Cloverfield, documentary type); people are now noticing (that's a bad sign) and been annoyed by this type of scenes more and more every day. Bad casting of Lois Lane and again rushed, not romantic love story. I waited all the movie for that epic scene that gives you that excitement or adrenaline rush, it never came. The music score was completely forgettable and repetitive, providing nothing to help feel the emotion or theme in every scene. Too bad we wait so many years for this attempt of making a memorable and epic movie that was at most a regular one.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

I am not the biggest fan of Superman, but I do like the character, and this movie does have what I like about this character.I liked Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman; he was likable, he cared about the people of Metropolis, and he worked together with the public, which is what I like about Superman. They did not put the significant times in his life in the right order, most of them being about him learning his powers and him talking to his dad Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Costner, I just think it should have been put together the right way. Other than that, I liked seeing him learn his powers, figure out who he is, and get his cool looking Superman outfit.Michael Shannon did a respectable job playing General Zod; he was intimidating enough to be a big threat, and I understood his plan to save the planet Krypton by using planet earth as the foundation. Sometimes his performance can be a little over the top, but mostly he gives a satisfactory performance, also I liked some of the interactions with him and Superman when they are arguing about saving or destroying earth for Krypton's sake.The beginning of the movie when we see Krypton, it had a unique design with some interesting technology that would only work on this planet. Superman's real father Jor-El played by Russell Crowe was an excellent choice in role; the interaction between him and General Zod was not bad, but I would have liked more of it. I also liked Amy Adams as Lois Lane; I liked her personality and what she will do for a story working at the Daily Planet, but I wanted more chemistry between her and Superman to show them build their iconic relationship with each other.The action scenes are fun to watch with a fight between Superman and General Zod, and the destruction from it, plus there was a lot of product placement in the fights in Metropolis that can be annoying. Also, the cinematography was pretty with locations like the city, the Kent farm in Kansas, or just in outer space camera shots. Man of Steel (2013) is a good Superman movie with a great actor in the role of Superman, and Zack Snyder who did a respectable job directing with good action and cool scenes that fans of Superman will like and remember.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It has all the elements of great sci-fi high fantasy, the effects, of course are spectacular. The actors too, can't really fault them either. By about half way through the film, you've pretty much got your money's worth though and the rest is like being hit in the face and ears repeatedly by Dubstep sound effects and explosions. There is no love, no investment in any of the characters and the failings of this film lie purely with the screenplay which could have been written better by a child and the director who seems to have missed the point of sci-fi fantasy completely. This film has one story line, no twists, no characterisation, no point and no pleasure factor past the first half. The second half seems to go on and on and on and on, never ending explosions and fighting. I love a good fight, don't get me wrong but when you know how the film is going to end and there really isn't any suspense left but you still have to endure another 40 minutes of ear splitting explosions and fists hitting things, it began to actually feel like torture. I was left feeling grief for the amount of time, money and creativity that so many good film industry bods put into what could have been an excellent summer block buster. How could this film end up being SOOOOOO dull? Lois Lane was a massive fail. Amy Adams is a red head for a start and even though I love her and think she's a fabulous actor, this was not the part for her. Lois Lane is an awesome Marvel Character, you could argue that she is as important as Superman himself, her part is crucial and her relationship with Superman is a massive part of any Superman story. In this, the script basically explains the plot, there is no actual acting out of any of the story and Lois Lane is allowed to look like a helpless ditsy girl who gets into dangerous situations that make no sense, I didn't believe her character at all. It wasn't her acting, it was the script and direction at fault, not to mention that she shouldn't have played Lois Lane in the first place. The sound track could have been written by a robot, again, it had all the elements of what could have been really good but then lacked any feeling or emotion. The whole point of the music is to embellish the story and I found my self being irritated by it. So so disappointed. I can watch John Carter and Avengers over and over again, I actually read graphic novels, I love Marvel films in general and I love most things Sci-Fi Fantasy but this was a spectacular waste of money. I've looked up Zak Snyder's other films to date and I really liked 300 but I will avoid him in the future, he just doesn't float my boat.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

(3D)Genuinely and perfectly real! EPIC From Beginning to end! Superman has changed! At first I'm starting (meh?) it will not work. With seeing him again and again is more I get used to his costume and everything. It has no opening titles that we all love! Missing it felt not too bad but give it a chance.Although behind all this, this new Superman offers a great theater experience that you will never forget! You will feel everything, Sadness, Loneliness, Anger, Pain, Suffering, Happiness, Heart Warming, it's all there. From his childhood, the bullies that threats him. He was just a completely lost person and he is finding a place on Earth where he could fit in.NEW MUSIC. We all know the theme song of Superman, well it's not here. The good thing is I liked and loved the score of Academy Award Winning Composer Hanz Zimmer! The music is in perfect place. Beat by beat when the action starts!NEW SUPERMAN Henry Cavill! HE WORKS! Although fans of the original Superman won't be able to get used to him much yet. I think he's better than the 2006's version Brandon Routh. NEW LOIS LANE Amy Adams works her way beside Margot Kidder (Lois in 1978 Superman) and on top of Kate Bosworth (Lois in Superman Returns) She is very amazing. Both Lois and Clark/Superman in this film has really great chemistry that we've been waiting for.The ACTION Palooza are striking furious like a speeding bullet! Every scene is new and what Superman Returns (2006) lacks! It has a really heart-pounding in the climax!'S'ymbol The Superman logo is second known other than Christian Cross. In this film it gives meaning to it. To us the 'S' logo stands for Superman for Krypton it stands for HOPE.The ending will leave you speechless but with a smile. This is the part that I'm waiting in this movie and I'm glad they had a short glimpse. You'll see.A Sequel is now in early stages and I do hope so it's yet the traditional Lex Luthor! BRING NEW ENEMIES! Remember what the producers said ""This is the beginning of a universe"" what do they mean? Justice League.","44 out of 85 found this helpful.

My question is: Why? When Superman 2 was made, did the writer hack up some story from a previous Superman TV episode, or steal it from a comic book? No, I think he put together a fun story about Superman fighting 3 bad-guys (one was a semi-cute chick with sexy crooked teeth) dressed in patent leather jump- suits. Back then I don't think a writer could get away with hacking other movies or TV shows, you had to know how to write a story. It's not difficult to write a new Superman tale, so why re-use an old one? That sucks. And I don't care how awesome the battle scenes are and how much better it was then the original Superman 2, it's still a hacked up redo with nothing original going on. I'm sick of Hollywood ripping me off.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The actors worked well in this film,non stop action from start to finish and its OK for ""The Man of Steel"" to be serious. I was reading previous reviews on this and everyone was saying he was way to serious. I am here to tell you yes he is but think about wouldn't you be serious to trying to figure out who you are if from a different world. Not to kill it for you but the cgi scenes were also fantastic. It was just enough cgi to make you understand that this world is not real and this is what could possible happen if fights or destruction would occur in the real world. All in all great movie I'm not giving it a number cause then I'm using a number system to be picky. It's not good it's great, for adults and children. You can admire the will and inspiration of this film and don't just go off my judgment on all of it.

It was really Russell Crowe (Jor-El) who stole the show though. And that's quite a compliment coming from me, because I'm generally not the greatest fan of our Russ (I think that's what we Aussies are meant to call him).Overall I guess the film hits all the marks it needed to and I particularly liked the opening on Krypton. Zack Snyder certainly has an inspiring handle on modern visual effects and it was wonderfully utilised. I'm so over the whole aliens-and-their-tech-causing-chaos-in-a-major-city shtick though. We seem to have had so much of it in recent years with Transformers and The Avengers and others. Unfortunately 'Man of Steel' contains yet more of this without bringing much of its own innovation. I'm eagerly anticipating how Guillermo del Toro's upcoming 'Pacific Rim' will show us all how these films are really done!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the cinematography and effects it is by far one of the most impressive superhero movies I have seen, and finally a serious movie of the greatest superhero, Superman.What I love most about man of steel is how serious the tone is. It's a story of a man raised in a different culture, his struggles trying to fit in, to be one of them and to finally recognise who he really is. In my opinion, it's a beautiful story. With some fast paced action that needs to be seen, some scenes I wasn't able completely take in from the first watch. Man of steel definitely needs more than just one viewing. I highly recommend owning it on blue ray.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Who doesn't know Superman tales with multi movies, cartoons, games & comics? I delayed watching this for years believing no one could beat Chris Reeves / Brando trilogy, seeing many poor ratings. I was So Wrong.This Superman has evolved & has solid acting, great cgi & reimagining of Krypton. Costner & Lane are believeable in their roles. Russel Crowe & his general nemesis are very good. Amy Adams is solid as obnoxious modern reporter. Cavalier from Tudors is a good likable Superman, believable in being naive due to farm life isolation & his simple uncomplicated protective human foster parents' life philosophy. The flashbacks are well placed during this engaging film. There are twists & new perspectives making this unique. It's not perfect but no modern Marvel film reaches such lofty heights.This is not a documentary biography but a sci fi human tale of young Superman trying to find his purpose in life like many ppl. He suffers from survivors guilt & is more human than god in this film. To state religion has no place in humanity is misguided as religious wars cont now in 2021. I didn't see religious zeal in this story- just a simple overly good father trying to guide an ET to be good instead of easily taking short cuts to be a billionaire or adverse force due to his great powers.So kick back & enjoy this film, both it's old & modern messages; ignore few plot holes. I watched it twice & enjoyed it, esp the Crowe Krypton parts.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It shows a far more in-depth portrayal of how Superman came to be, showing the loneliness that an alien to another world would feel & how one would try to blend in. It also treats the hero as a god like creature, as indeed anyone with the powers he has compared to mankind would be treated. This is greatly shown in the fight scenes against Zod and his crew. The fight scenes are epic as would be the case if two gods were to fight each other. It's far more epic in its destruction than was shown in the Christopher Reeves adaptations, which were rather somewhat cleaner, tidier and somehow more clinical. Where perhaps this film does fall down is for a start there's no memorable theme tune. And you don't tend to feel the love, warmth & calmness of Supermans father, which Marlon Brando portrayed so excellently, indeed at times in doesn't even seem to matter that Jor-El played by Russell Crowe dies, as his body and mind work perfectly well afterwards, even being able to walk about! This version however does bring back the magic of Superman to a new audience, and the imagination of children can once again run wild as they reinact their hero across many school playgrounds.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What's more, is in this first part, the strange birds on which the characters are flying, that also seem to come from Avatar. And it's only the beginning.

The budget clearly went into the action and for this, I score the movie 10 out of 10. The fight scenes are an incredible match for what you see in the cartoons, and I was very impressed. Unfortunately, there were only two other positive aspects for me:1. Russell Crowe, who gave a surprisingly good portrayal of Jor-El. 2. Although I disliked the rest of the movie, it is still better than the rubbish that is called ""Iron Man 3"".Although you could argue that this was the Superman from an alternate age, I did not get any kind of feeling for the actor's portrayal. Disappointing since he obviously felt bad after losing the 2006 role to a relatively unknown actor who, in my opinion, did a better job of playing Superman than he did. We waited 7 years for him to do a better job and yet, we get a lifeless wooden performance instead. That said, Amy Adams was no better. Both the leads gave very wooden lifeless performances which was a big big letdown. For me, the lead actor and actress had no chemistry whatsoever.I normally hate reboots but after watching this version of Superman, I can't wait for another reboot.... the decision to pull the plug on Brandon Routh was a stupid one.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

The action gets a little over-the-top, with characters getting thrown through buildingsand I mean A LOT of buildings. Millions of people die as buildings are collapsing. It just gets a little too much. Although, the special effects were very well down and some of the action scenes were fun to watch. The random zoom-in during scenes were sometimes annoying. It was a bit overused, but it worked at times, especially when Superman was flying.The dialogue gets a little hilarious at times. A scene in particular is when General Zod, while fighting superman yells, ""either I die or you do."" I couldn't help but think to myself, who wrote that line? Of course, one of you are going to die. Superman obviously knows that. It was just one line I just couldn't stop thinking about after the film.Obviously, the few lines with dodgy dialogue weren't the actors fault. As a matter of fact, the acting was actually very good. Henry Cavill played a very good Superman/Clark Kent. He was quiet, but he looked great in the costume and looked exactly the way I envisioned Superman. Michael Shannon always plays a great bad guy. He was very animated as General Zod, and like I said, his few dodgy lines weren't his fault. He made the best of his character. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were also good as the emotional characters. Russell Crowe plays Superman's biological father Jor-El and Kevin Costner who plays the ""adoptive"" father Jonathan Kent. The two fathers love their son and just want to see them be the best man he could be.The music was also very good. I always love Hans Zimmer's work. His work in The Dark Knight was a particular favourite for me. He never fails to make an action scene that much more epic or a emotional scene that much more emotional.I've never followed Superman very closely, so I can't compare it to the comic book or the old movies. All I know is that the film didn't mention Kryponite and there was no Lex Luther, which is okay with me because I knew it was an Origin story. I enjoyed Man of Steel. I waited awhile to see it, but I must say it was worth the wait and I will probably buy it eventually. I can forgive it for its flaws. I'm excited for the Batman vs Superman sequel coming out in 2015. Let's hope there's less random zoom in scenes.Grade: BPlease be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on www,themovieboy77.com","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So it saddens me to see that apparently it is so hard to get his movie just right. The four films that Reeve did were a joke, while Bryan Singer's one failed in a few big ways. Man of Steel showed such potential with the new take on Superman's story and the names behind it, such as Nolan, who I thought did an amazing job with the first two Batman movies. Yet it was let down completely by the script and some story-line choices that just didn't work. I will not enter into much detail here as there's actually so much that bugs me with this movie, but I will mention just a few things, like the need to destroy entire cities and kill thousands of people just to make the movie dark and serious. The problem with that is that, this inadvertently makes Superman guilty of mass murder and not the savior that he is supposed to be. Also, the fight scenes were so computerized that it made me feel like I was actually playing a video-game. Some dialogues were just horrible and unworthy of the blockbuster they were part of. And there were so many things that didn't make sense or questions raised, that when all put together, leave a bad taste of disappointment in the mouth.A shame really; I have no desire to play the critic, I just feel frustrated that this wasn't the movie that I was hoping for and could have been. I hope there's a very extended version when it comes out on DVD, that will contain some more material to make it feel more complete.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

In just the same clothes she wore when she got there. She's a hard hitting type of gal and she doesn't need thermals or anything.Once she's in there she gets to see Superman fiddle around with some stuff and gets hurt, but he uses his super powers to heal her, just like Jesus would.And that's my main problem with this big pile of plop. Ka Els story is told via flashbacks to his youth and early years where he travelled the earth doing menial jobs, saving everybody's life (apart from his dads) and never, ever hitting back when attacked. I started to wonder if I was watching Superman or The Littlest Hobo at times. These flashbacks served no other purpose than to show that he was a good guy who never asked for reward and always turned the other cheek. Well, he once destroyed a mans truck and livelihood for being a douche-bag, something he managed to do in a busy truck stop without anybody hearing or seeing it, and only eliciting a look of mild bemusement from his erstwhile assailant.So when he reaches the age of 33, duh, its time to reveal himself to mankind and show off his superpowers. The baddies are here and they wan't to kill everybody and it up to Ka El to stop them, even though he knows humanityy might reject him. They won't, obviously. He's the 2nd coming and we all know how well that went for us last time we were mean to the saviour.So the baddies come with their guns and they have a pretty impressive fight that takes them into space,through a gazillion skyscrapers via exploding trains and stuff like that, but they never seem to leave the same city block and always crash back to the exact same place. Right where the good guys are. And the cardboard cut out Lane. Now, during this fight, the baddies are crushed, burned, shot, bombed, dropped from hundreds of feet, smashed with huge steel bars etc, but Ka El manages to kill Zod with the old 'break your neck like this HEEEEAAURGH!!'choke hold trick that you'd expect to see in an especially crappy Chuck Norris flick.The dialogue in the film was dreadful, the acting atrocious, the characters completely one dimensional (especially Zod), the underlying Christian message lurked like a fart on a cold day and stank the whole thing up. It is a terrible, terrible action film made worse by the over use of special effects and sentimentality in all the wrong places.I wish IMDb would give us a 0-10 option, but as I can't go lower than 1- 10 then this gets that. It's appalling. Oh, and add to the rest of the garbage the typical scene where the Americans hear the news of imminent attack in a massive military complex while the rest of the world lives in huts and tents made of Yak.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

"","","Engaging if superficial darker tone gives way to excessive special effects and noise later in the film – mostly works for what it is though","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2890818/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2013","When this came out in the cinemas I must admit I didn't really care; the years have left me less inclined to go and sit in packed cinemas full of code-of-conduct breakers only to be disappointed by yet more hollow noise. I had heard the promise of a ""darker"" reboot, but the effects heavy trailers and the presence of Zack Snyder at the helm really made me doubt that. However, on a long flight it seemed like a good way to fill the time when I had little else to do, and so I gave it a go. In fairness it is actually not too bad and the negative things I had heard were mostly rather exaggerated and perhaps coming from other agendas rather than meeting the film on its own terms and judging it there.The dramatic opening on Krypton lets you know that this is going to be a film with lots of special effects thrown around but it does at least set the tone well. This continues in the first part of the film where the nicely done structure allows us to have key moments of backstory without the whole film having to go back there and work forward. This section of the film does have some weight to it but could have done more and be more heart-felt. Although it deserves credit for trying, it does feel rather superficial in its delivery, I enjoyed it for the content but would have liked it to be smarter and better. The second half of the film becomes more and more about the action and it is noisily dizzying. I enjoyed it for the spectacle and much of it was well done, but some of the very specific scenes of peril involving very specific characters, could have been cut with no great loss. It uses the dramatic music and dark tone well though to add weight to this – having its cake and eating it in some ways but ultimately it does just become a blur after a whie.The cast probably has too many famous faces but mostly they work while also being a parade of distraction. Cavill makes a likable Superman, although the material never tests his emotional range too much, but just enough to work. Shannon is a very good piece of casting as he brings a really good dark intensity to Zod (as he does to everything) and he adds weight to the character which remains even when he becomes a special effect rather than an actor. Adams is OK but a little out of place – you sense her light, pretty approach is there for the romantic or flirty moments. Costner is solid while Crowe, Lane, Fishburne, Meloni and others do good work. Too many recognizable faces do float around, but it is a big budget movie and this is the danger I guess.Ultimately Many of Steel was better than I expected despite doing just what I thought it would. The darker tone is rather superficial but still just about works although the second half of the film really is just one big effects showcase without too much else to be had. It is noise and distracting for this and it did the job even if I doubt I'll remember much about it when/if a sequel comes around.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Returns better after watching it again, yeah I just said that) I am going to say that it's full of CGI and if that's all you care about in a movie then you'll be happy with all the destruction of property, but it just didn't do it for me. I realize I'm not saying anything new here but where is the story, ya know? This movie seemed like it didn't take the time to get it right or that it was trying to make everyone who watched happy by dumbing it down or maybe things just got all messed up with everyone who was involved and had no clear vision. Many things seemed very Implausible or out right ridiculous (like Lois Lanes ability to be everywhere Superman was-maybe she can fly now too huh?). I was really happy to see that Christopher Nolan was involved after seeing the Batman trilogy (which I was amazed by and which left me thinking or even believing that Hollywood could in fact do it right after all) but either Nolan's involvement wasn't Included enough or even he couldn't save this one, who knows. Unfortunately I am back to being my old cynical self about Hollywood again (and about most everything else i suppose. Lol) until someone can make a better film on an American icon, which honestly shouldn't be that hard, I mean he's F-ing Superman come on. No wonder they have to bring Batman in on the next one.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Your sentences was extremely painful to read specially the first paragraph.Anyways, in regards to the movie itself, the action could have been lessened and still has that same thrill or that ""wow"" factor. But as usual Snyder always overdone many of what he thinks are interesting scenes. However, I do like the lack of the romance in this movie; it shows a different side of clark rather than the usual redundant or very cliché romance with Lois. As MovieGeek 218 stated ""The movie focused more about superman's origin and his battle with Zod"" So, this movie is not going to have one of those moments where the hero's loved one gets abducted by the ""bad guy"" and the hero comes in for the rescue. I thought the movie was OK for an action thriller; I gave a solid 6 out of 10 and is worth watching for free in live torrents or actual movie theatre. However, one cannot possibly compare it to a more successful movie such as the Avengers. The Avengers simply beats this movie hands down in every aspect ways. But then again, everyone is entitled to their own opinion right Moviegeek 218?In conclusion, I do hope that Snyder will do a more refined Superman movie. It is still worth watching but most of the superman fan clubs would be disappointed on how the movie actually turned out. They will always compare it to the comic books.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The acting, the action sequences, and of course the CGI were all great. But, I felt that Clark's character was not fully developed for a startup to what I anticipate will be a good Superman trilogy. The plot also felt subpar, in fact one of my friends mentioned afterward how it was similar to that of Superman TV shows we watched as children. Zack Snyder does a good job directing, not to mention the score by Hans Zimmer. But, overall I felt that this movie is a good follow-up to the epic Dark Knight trilogy and lays the foundation for a future successful DC comics trilogy, if not the upcoming Justice League movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Much of the film feels unrehearsed and performances often feel like first of second takes with under-directed actors unsure of the tone of the scene they are playing and the motivation of their characters.Even the special effects, which are crucial to a film like this, are ropey.

Amy Adam played a good role which I simply enjoyed. The action is pretty cool in some sort of Dragon Ball Z way in how the fights were portrayed of having Superman and his enemies fight through buildings and delivering punches that make them fly like rag-dolls.

No, this isn't your parent's Superman.. This is not golden or silver age Superman- THIS is for every kid that watched Bruce Tim's ""Adventures of Superman"" and ""Justice League"" or the DC animated films like ""Doomsday"" or ""Crisis on two earths"" and said ""why can't we see THIS Superman live action?!"" This is for anyone who watched Matrix and said ""now... why can't we have a Superman that does this?"" (no.. i'm not saying it's like the matrix- at all) Now, i'm not a crier- especially at movie... but, this one had me a FEW times. There's a strong emotional thread that runs through the picture. As you follow this character who can't quite find his place, doesn't quite fit in- yet has a heart for people... a true good Samaritan, who even in the face of mockers risks his own life (to his knowledge) to save them... protect them.. you empathize with him. The critics have it wrong- Clark's not dour in this movie, he's humble. He's patient and compassionate. It's not apathy he's displaying... it's a disciplined reserve. He's a man who's learned that his power and how he chooses to use it will define who he will become. The truth is, we're seeing Clark WHILE he's still discovering himself- still finding out what the consequences are when he uses his abilities and also when he chooses not to use his abilities. This is someone who's never been able to have a real relationship with anyone.(outside of his mom and dad) and throughout the course of the movie he learns to trust people- exemplified in one person that sees who he truly is, and is not only not afraid, but honors that trust. The small moments are emotional and tender (and despite what you may have read- sometimes humorous. The audience in my theater laughed at least 2 or 3 times, out loud), the big ones are exhilarating and bombastic. The battles are TRULY epic- with much at stake... This is OUR Superman... Snyder has successfully shaken the campy ""gee whiz"" and ""Crime doesn't pay, evil doer"" caricature and given us the Superman we grew up hoping that someday... someday someone would be able to deliver and they did- and it's here- Man of Steel. P.S. the entire audience loved the film, complete with applause at the end.","40 out of 79 found this helpful.

Superman use to be a charming, flying hero that saved the world on a regular basis, but today's superheroes are expected to be more human and, as a result, more hopeless (i.e. Batman and Iron Man). But Superman has never been either of those things, so what audiences can expect is a Man of Steel struggling with some serious identity issues.What Works – Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman with just the right amount of bravado even if he is lacking the boyish grin. He's a man's man/lady's man – all around ""super"" man. His muscular physique is enough to keep female fans in their seats while his rugged manliness, and lack of spandex, should keep the guy's satisfied.What Doesn't Work – The infinite flashbacks seriously slow down the film. Abandoned as a baby, Kal-El makes the long journey across space and lands on earth. That's an appropriate, and necessary, back story, but his struggles as a middle schooler, teenager, bartender, fisherman and explorer are not and at 2 ½ hours, the film felt as long as Kal-El's journey to earth. Russell Crowe as Jor-El (Kal-El's father) also makes these odd Obi-Wan Kenobi flashes throughout the film – giving Clark Kent guidance and direction in the way he should go in the Force Earth.What I Thought – Superman Returns was so awful that any remake is going to be better, but better doesn't make it the best. While The Dark Knight Rises and Iron Man 3 strolled down the darker street, Man of Steel could have rose above it all. Still, for its Inception sounding-score, Avatar cinematography and all around Superhero special-effects its worth a trip to the theater – at the very least you'll be able to converse with your colleagues about how good/bad it was.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Its completely different from any Superman you've seen before this, so go in with an open mind. I have to be honest, i went into this movie not expecting much since it got so many bad reviews, but don't listen to them, they're dumb. BEST Superman so far. There was a TON of action, some of it may look a little ""Mortal Combat-ish"" because of the super fast movement and fighting. I don't want to give anything away but we'll just say they added some ""space stuff"" and it was awesome. thats where i think it differs greatly from the other superman's. but they didn't ruin it with that by any means, in fact i wish they could make a prequel off of this haha! The actors chosen for their roles were perfect. Henry Cavill is the absolute best choice for this, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner played their roles great, the actors were chosen well.

The film romps along in similar vein to other comic book based summer blockbusters. The CGI if that's your bag is on a par with Iron man 3 and Avengers assemble and the soundtrack is suitably deafening. Henry Cavill is our chiselled all American hero who plays the part well. Although save for looking moody, throwing things around and having to probably do quiet a lot of chin ups daily, the role is not the most challenging. Michael Shannon following on from the excellent The Iceman plays the baddie well and doesn't ham it up. Alongside these Amy Adams is on a par with Terri Hatcher in the eye candy department.The film is as I expected of this kind of vehicle. The main problem I had was I grew up on the Christopher Reeve franchise which had a certain charm, was warmer, way more humorous and took itself less serious than this po-faced attempt. Get the bus and see this if you found the Chris Reeves version too cheesy, failing that see the 1st two in that franchise you won't be disappointed.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This film revitalizes the legendary superhero with a fresh perspective, delivering an action-packed spectacle alongside compelling character development.One of the most impressive aspects of ""Man of Steel"" lies in its exceptional visual effects and jaw-dropping action sequences. The film's CGI is truly groundbreaking, making Superman's superhuman abilities come to life in a way never seen before on the big screen. From the breathtaking Kryptonian landscapes to the epic battles that redefine superhero action, the film is a visual treat that keeps audiences engaged from start to finish.Henry Cavill's portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman is a standout in this adaptation. Cavill brings a new depth and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and human despite his extraordinary powers. His struggles with identity and the burden of his responsibilities as the last son of Krypton are explored in a heartfelt and poignant manner.The supporting cast adds strength to the narrative, with Amy Adams shining as the brave and intelligent Lois Lane, breaking away from the damsel-in-distress trope. Michael Shannon's General Zod is a formidable and menacing antagonist, adding tension and emotional stakes to the conflict.However, ""Man of Steel"" is not without its flaws. The film's pacing feels uneven at times, and some viewers may find the nonlinear storytelling approach confusing. Additionally, purists of the original Superman mythology might take issue with certain liberties taken in this retelling.Despite these minor drawbacks, ""Man of Steel"" successfully sets the stage for a new era of DC Comics films. It lays the groundwork for the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and sets a darker and more serious tone than previous Superman adaptations.In conclusion, ""Man of Steel"" revitalizes the Superman franchise, blending awe-inspiring action sequences with a fresh take on Clark Kent's journey to becoming a hero. Henry Cavill's powerful performance, combined with outstanding visual effects, makes it a must-watch for superhero enthusiasts and general audiences alike. While not a flawless film, its strengths undoubtedly outweigh the weaknesses, making it a worthy addition to the superhero movie canon.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

But I thought I'd still write a review about it.Its a block-buster and I didn't expect anything less. It managed to exceed my expectations a great deal even though it wasn't perfect. The actors were well cast, it had good direction and pacing but it was the visual effects that stole the show...This is one of the best visually stunning action display I have ever seen in Hollywood (yes, right there I SAID IT). Among my top five at least. In fact the only standout movie I can recall that could beat it is The Matrix. The beauty of it is that though I have seen movies before with short well constructed visuals , and others have been jam-packed and in the process would then get to be all over the place leaving the audience not knowing what to make out of the muddle, shambles and disorderliness, like TRANSFORMERS, this masterpiece had effects in excess(and I stress ""in excess"" a good 1 hour,20 something minutes dedicated to action ) and still succeeded in pulling it off beautifully. I wouldn't like to spoil it but you need to see it for yourselves.The story was okay with the first third dedicated to showing the home planet's and its inhabitants' destruction though I wouldn't say no plot-holes *spoiler alert*: Why wouldn't a council try to save some of its planetary citizens with its technology but instead are able, and choose to transport criminals who could have been executed to another dimension. This being said, as a Fan I was still able to respect the minor exclusions from the original Superman material. In fact the exclusion of the panties over spandex costume was more than welcome. And I like as the story kept close to the source material. The struggle of Superman with being an outsider and minor romance story with Lois Lane. It wasn't perfect though as it still had plot-holes.The score was great. I wouldn't speak much on that. And the choice of actors. Visually, Henry Cavill is one of the best embodiments of superman ever. He reminds me of Tom Welling in the Smallville TV series who, I also think, along with Cavill are better than previous editions. A welcome inclusion as well as (as I strongly believe) a marketing accessory Bankable star is Russell Crowe. The perfect Jor el. Amy Adams and Michael Shannon were okay as Lois Lane and General Zod respectively but special mention goes to Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Diane Lane was a breathe of fresh air as Martha too. This still reminded of Smallville's Kents.Overall a great movie. Sets up well for a sequel.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Now I'm watching it a decade later after seeing the Flash movie. This movie is by far one of the best DC superhero movies. Henry Cavill is great, conveying a lot more emotion than Christopher Reeves ever did. Kevin Costner is phenomenal as Jonathan Kent, even tho he has barely any screen time. For being only in the film maybe 5 total minutes, you connect with the character and feel saddened when he goes. Russel Crow is also amazing as Jor El. He too barely had much screen time, yet he clearly knew how to make the most of it. He is very charismatic and humble, and although an alien to us you can't help instinctually trust him and know his motives are pure. Likewise the brief scenes of Krypton are amazing. A world that looks both a utopia yet also very alien compared to Earth.The story all around is very good, dark but real. This at the time gave the film a much needed contrast from the more upbeat Marvel movies, and still makes the movie stand out today. This is hammered home with the villain Zod. He is evil and yet very understandable. Yes he wants to wipe out all of humanity via terraforming the Earth. And yet you understand him. He isn't evil for the sake of evil. He is a survivor, the last of his people who wants to keep his species (Kryptonians) alive and will do anything to achieve that. You could say Zod and Jor El are two sides of the same coin, both wanting to save the Krytonain race albeit through very different means.My only complaint is Amy Adams, and I had this same complaint when I saw the movie back in 2013. She is not Lois Lane. She doesn't even try. Lois Lane has black hair, she is slender, she has a very thick City accent, speaking quickly yet eloquently. Amy Adams by contrast refused to dye her hair for this film, which is odd considering she's gone from blonde to redhead to brunette depending on the role. She also has a little bit of southern accent and talks very bubbly and slow, not at all like the fast talking big city girl Lane is. Every time I saw Amy Adams, I saw only Amy Adams from Disenchantment, not Lois Lane. She is by far the worst Lois Lane there ever was, and yes that includes adult rated Supergirl parody ""Mrs Magnificent"" that sued for copyright infringement.It's a shame DC never created a strong movie franchise like Marvel because it would've been amazing to see this version of Superman get the proper arch it deserved.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

I was one of them. I didn't understand where the Superman I had known in my childhood was, where the character we all wanted was. There was this destruction everywhere as well, which leaves the city completely demolished.And recently I saw it again. With more years behind me, without prejudices nor expectations. And I have loved it. But you know, like a lot, to the point of liking it much more than the classics (which I admit have aged fatally, it's much better to remember and love them, than to see them again and hit a fiasco).Why? Because I have realized that this Superman that Snyder brought us was not the Superman that we wanted, but the one that our society needed.I explain myself:
The original character emerged at a very specific time, in a very specific country. The goodness of then has disappeared. The country where he came from exists no more. There is no trace. It is very normal that in the end he kills Zod: between being good and being an idiot there is a long stretch in this case, since we are talking about a genocide who does not regret it.And that's what they brought us: the Superman that our society needs today. Yes, darker. Yes, with some slightly twisted values. But he is, after all, the society in which we live today.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Too Dark for a Superman movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814913/?ref_=tt_urv","haldurgz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37726938/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","Henry Cavill makes a really good Superman. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Dianne Lane, and Russel Crowe also all do a good job in their respective roles. It's unfortunate, though, that this is the movie that they are acting in, because that's not enough to save it.First of all, the cinematography is so dark and depressing through nearly the entire film, completely uncharacteristic of a Superman film I didn't see this in 3D since 3D films are usually shown with less than sufficient lighting and generally look inferior to films not filmed in 3D as a consequence. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the dark appearance of the film or if that was by choice. Either way, you have to blame the director for the problem. There's been an incredible change of opinion against 3D recently, and films like this one are a big part of the reason.Second, the writing is so incredibly wrong-headed, particularly for a Superman film. As others have pointed out, it was dumb to have Jonathan Kent telling his son that it would have been better had he let the children on the bus die. It makes him sound like a monster. It was dumb to have Superman kill. The one thing that EVERYONE knows about him is that Superman does not kill. IT was dumb to make half the movie be about leveling Metropolis. I always knew that the fight scene, which was poorly filmed, and went on entirely too long, was not over every time they showed a building that was not knocked down, because you know it was only so that they could then show its destruction.As I said, there were a few good things about it. But the writing and the direction were not among them.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Great Movie. Great Potential for Sequels.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812679/?ref_=tt_urv","matisback","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10365324/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","First, for all the people concerned about negative reviews from critics, I can tell you that critics' reviews are not always a measure to depend on; it's as if the majority went into the movie hating it already either because they are too defensive of and attached to the Donner/Reeve's Superman, or because they simply hate Zack Snyder (Check the 300 movie reviews and judge for yourself).Second, the movie itself. Man of Steel above all is a great foundation for sequels. This is the Batman Begins of the TDK trilogy: it's not the best movie of the 3, but surely TDK wouldn't have gone anywhere without its foundation and intro in Batman Begins.In Action terms, this movie contains the Action that Superman Returns lacked. Yes, it might get a bit overwhelming at the very end but it's nothing close to boring. The same critics that wanted more action in Superman Returns are the ones that are hating it in Man Of Steel, absurd don't you think?Man of Steel presents an impressive back story that is played out well by Crowe and Shannon. Cavill is a great Superman, he's everything I could've envisioned. Lois has good screen chemistry with Superman, definitely something to weigh on in sequels. Although some other characters felt a little under-developed, it was irrelevant because the movie was keeping me busy and interested between action and conversation scenes. Also I'm sure that Goyer/Nolan are delaying some characters' development to when they will need it more in the follow-up movies. Man of Steel has a couple of scenes to weigh down the action while playing on human values and emotions; you get to see what Superman's really going through in terms of identity crisis and what makes him a human/alien. Coupled with the great music of Hans Zimmer, you will definitely be moved in those scenes.All in all, don't miss this movie; go in and enjoy it because it is exactly that, an enjoyable Superman Movie; something unfamiliar to the old superman cartoonish take, but still well worthy of its title.","26 out of 49 found this helpful.

This movie is criminally underrated and definitely deserves more credits..Solid story with some flaws but good pacing. Tbh everything is so well done about this movie. The visuals, the music, the acting they were all out of this world. But the writing...it was good but it could have been better.Overall a very enjoyable movie and was surprisingly touching. Just don't think of the comics, don't think of any Superman media pieces and try compare it to this flim.

This is not only the Superman movie we've all wanted, but its one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. This is a very serious take on the character of Superman, but don't worry, it has its mild laughs. You should walk into this movie with complete disregard towards the Donner films or else, yeah, you'll be pretty disappointed. Wipe the slate clean and enjoy it! If I had to tell people about this movie, I'd say its a mix between a science-fiction film and an action movie. Combine the sci-fi elements of Star Trek or Prometheus with the grounded/realistic tone of the Dark Knight trilogy and you have Man of Steel.The visuals are absolutely breathtaking and these are some of the best action scenes I have ever seen. This movie made The Avengers look dinky. The casting choices were also brilliant. Great performances from everyone, notably Henry Cavill & Russell Crowe. Zack Snyder put his blood, sweat and tears into this movie and props go to him for that. This is his best movie and he has seriously just entered the ""even bigger"" leagues of action directors. And for those of who thought David Goyer coudn't write a script, you were wrong! Chris Nolan didn't have much to do with this movie, and its pretty noticeable, not much to say about that.My hopes were high for this movie but I was still blown away. In my opinion, this was a much better movie than this years Iron Man 3, and much better than some other recent reboot titles such as the Amazing Spider-Man. I am honestly BAFFLED over the horrible reviews, my whole theatre seemed to love it! Can't wait for the next one!","24 out of 45 found this helpful.

Michael Shannon (Zod)...by the gods, he is such a good actor and him playing Zod was the best thing about the movie that is not saying a lot tho since the movie is the second worst movie I ever watch. (no insult meant at Michael Shannon he was awesome at every point of the movie).This so called ""Superman movie"" has nothing to do with the comic book or animated series Superman. The writer of this movie presumes that the viewer is an idiot, I'm not talking about the Superman comics and cartoons at this point. The characters: - The actions and motivation of the movie characters don't make sense most of the time. Only Zod and his crew seem to have well written characteristics and motivations. - While on the other hand ""Superman"" does not resemble a rational or thinking human/kryptonien. I did not care much for the actors acting either, nothing special. The US army acted like a parody of the US army. the other characters in the movie seemed absolutely irrelevant. Look and feel of the movie: - Krypton looks like it was designed by some one who only sees things in shades of brown. - Zod and his crews military armor looked awesome tho. - The special effects were alright but nothing we haven't seen already. - The fight scenes are jumpy and fast cut, sometimes it can be hard to follow what is actually happening.Story: - Spoilers: Google - Man of Steel plot holes. There are too many to write em all down here.Final Verdict: The creators presume that the viewers are brain dead idiots who will not notice the major plot holes and inconsistencies that repeatedly occur in the movie. The visual spectacles are nothing special and the acting is average at best (except for Michael Shannon who was awesome as General Zod). Don't watch this movie if possible, but if you really mush, watch it alone cause after you will want to punch something out of sheer frustration.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

I happen to love Superman, but the film was way too long even for me. It's almost as if Zack Snyder went into the edit room and said, lets not take anything out. While I appreciate the origin of Superman, it was way too much origin and not enough Superman. The first hour of the film, is like something out of Firefly or Star Trek, not what you expect from Superman. So while it may not be obvious, I did like the film, but I'm disappointed in the direction that the film took.

The theme is buried in really well, and continuously comes up. The film, as well as the characters, seemed believable and not far-fetched. There was fantastic acting from everyone, as there were many talented actors signed into this film. The film had some great moments and great scenery, and really followed through with the story. Some parts of the story are a bit questionable, but that's really for the audience member to decide. I personally didn't like some of the choices the writer made, but that's just my opinion. The camera work for some of the film was very tough to watch. The camera continuously shook during certain scenes and made it especially hard not to focus (on top of that, the film was in 3D). Also, the camera moved too fast, making it very tough for audience members to follow. The music was definitely my favorite part of the film. Hans Zimmer comes in with a very strong orchestra and really plays the strong points of the film. The music got you absorbed in the film, and really contributed to the overall theme. If I were you, I would probably check out the soundtrack. It is fantastic! There is a lot of action, and the action scenes are great. The film seemed to be tailored to more of an action film, rather than focus on origins as much. Personally, I found the film to be a bit stretched (as some of the action scenes were drawn out) and the camera work really needed to be focused. The music was incredible, but the film could have been shorter. That being said, this is definitely a film worth watching in theatres. It was a great superhero movie, and felt somewhat balanced to the dramatic side and action side of Superman.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder's majestic direction, earnest turns from a cast of memorable faces, and a soaring score can't mask a script with a severe identity crisis: is it the tale of a confused and lost loner in search of a home? A man-child who just needs a father figure? A brash reporter looking for an emotional tether to her world? A hero trying to find his courage? It is all and none of these things, which is why Man of Steel remains an exhilarating failure. The biggest weight to carry rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Henry Cavill as Superman. Cavill's stepped from relative obscurity (an earnest turn on The Tudors and a capable performance in Tarsem's blissfully bizarre Immortals notwithstanding) to one of the most iconic characters in fiction. The camera loves Cavill and he fills every shot with a truly resonant stoicism, warmth, and vulnerability. He capably handles both the heroism and the humor of the character, but both are in short supply in the script. When it's time for his character to talk, his performance falls apart. A variety of humanizing themes are toyed with in Cavill's Superman, but none of them ever comes to fruition. His tortured relationship with his human parents is dropped, his search for belonging in the world gets left in the dust, and what we're left with is a very promising performance that only takes flight when Cavill is allowed to eschew the script and inject personality in silent moments: among the best being his poignant catharsis after the film's brutal climax and his unbridled joy at his first flight. Amy Adams exudes a welcome feistiness and ebullience, but her character is only partially developed after a promising introduction. Superman is in love with her because the audience is, but he could only be in love with Amy Adams, as Lois Lane barely exists on the page. The lack of development in their relationship is nowhere more apparent than when Superman thanks her for believing in him 3/4s through the film: at what point did Lois do anything but act as a springboard for the film's endless supply of exposition? Mario Puzo knew enough to give Superman and Lois some genuine banter in the 1978 film. Goyer's script leaves it all to our imagination, for the sake of some glorious, repetitive mayhem. Kevin Costner injects an earthy charm into Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father, but with nothing other than platitudes for him to recite, we never truly believe in his relationship with his son. Its tragic conclusion, while beautifully shot, rings hollow. Diane Lane packs every moment with heartland pluck and tenderness (though the script certainly doesn't), and Russel Crowe once again proves himself one of the screen's most charismatic actors with his majestic turn as Kal El's blood father. But even he is no match for the script's nigh-incomprehensible sci-philo-babble, which he seems embarrassed to spout in the movie's bewildering prologue on Krypton. He is far more comfortable with the moments of genuine tenderness with his wife (well-played by the lovely Ayelet Zurer), his infant son, and the grown son he was forced to give up. The movie's opening scene is a masterpiece of vivid acting and lush staging and film work - but we rush all too quickly into an almost comically flat council chamber sequence full of baffling dialogue we can't be bothered to attempt to understand this early in the film. It is into this ill-wrought fog that Michael Shannon attempts to make his grand entrance as the occasionally menacing Zod. He laudably wrestles through it, but the cheesy space opera lines he's saddled with lead to an at-times borderline comical performance. Shannon finds smaller character moments to imbue his one-note maniac with a very human rage and despair. His botched introduction is remedied by a later scene with Crowe and a very well-played climax, but one can only imagine what kind of monster he could have created with a script worthy of his considerable screen presence. The effects, the art direction, and the magnificently well-staged action sequences almost elevate the movie to the heights of grand entertainment. Zod and Superman's final conflict is easily among the greatest fights ever filmed (or rendered, given the obvious CGI). But in all the sturm and drang, the audience, without an emotional tether to the two dueling behemoths, is left wondering about the poor little pixel people scurrying through the streets as buildings collapse - how noble can Superman be if he lets his rage at Zod blind him to all of the citizens being crushed in his path? Goyer has argued it's the point that Superman is not yet fully aware of his power and the responsibility it comes with, but that simply isn't on the page. Despite Zack Snyder's earnest efforts to elevate the film with his fantastic cinematic eye, it's not on the screen. In the end, the audience fills in much of the gaps in character development and emotional payoff on the strength of the craft work that went into the movie, but we're left wishing that the film's script did more of the work for us. For their flimsiness and crass assembly line quality, the Marvel films have at least generally done some excellent character-building work that Man of Steel could benefit from. The perfect comic book movie would merry the production value of Man of Steel to the spirit of Iron Man 3. Until then, we're left re-watching Christopher Reeves and waiting for Superman to truly take flight.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Admittedly, I am not exactly the target audience for movies like this. I can't really get past the fact that I'm watching a bunch of men in their 40s dressed up in plastic costumes.But this.... this atrocity embodies everything that's wrong with mainstream cinema. Why bother writing compelling characters for me to care about when you can simply tell me how to feel with flighty cinematography and saccharine music? Why leave anything to the imagination when you can hammer me with hyperbolic dialogue? Why worry about anything when you have a $225 million budget and can dazzle us mindless zombies with two and a half hours of CGI? It's a travesty. I can generally accept movies for what they are, but Man of Steel has the feel of a movie that thinks it's genuinely moving, profound, important, and this is what is most insulting about watching it. Films like this have zero respect for their audience's intelligence. Utter, utter piff.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

The latest take is a far cry from the previous versions, and even the latest meaning of the ""S"" in Superman, would have Joe and Jerry shaking their heads. There was a noticeable lapse in any comedic relief as with all previous versions, including Superman Returns, which is probably why I felt so drained after this flick. In Superman Returns, Brandon Routh's portrayal was excellent and had much more depth than Henry Cavill, although Cavill was more muscular than any previous Super's (and reminded me of Gordon Scott in his Tarzan movies). I wasn't impressed with ""Lois"" in this offering. Although Amy Adams was OK, her character was very shallow and there was little effort given to knowing anything about here other than that she had the hots for what's his name (which was mentioned only in passing in this version). If wall to wall action (eg fighting, destruction, fighting, loud explosions, buildings falling, and fighting) is your thing, then you'll get your fill with The Man of Steel. However, if you want something more earthly, digestible, with more interaction and depth of characters, including the contrasts of the Clark/Superman characters, I'd consider passing on this one and re-watching Superman Returns.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"6","/10","'Man of Steel' soars","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817660/?ref_=tt_urv","DubhDoo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29045991/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2013","'Man of Steel' has arrived with a lot of expectation. It has been seven years since we last saw Superman on the big screen with Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns', but that film was seemingly loved by few (I was one of the few) and declared ""a flop"", subsequently rendering the prospect of a new Superman film to be a make-or-break opportunity. As the film's production progressed, anticipation rightly built and this sense of anticipation was heightened when Christopher Nolan spearheaded the movie's production, bringing Zack Snyder in to direct his proposed reboot. So, after all this, does 'Man of Steel' live up anticipation? With a sigh of relief, I can safely say that it does.The plot of 'Man of Steel' is both familiar and fresh; we get the basic bones of Superman's origin story, but it is told in a way unlike anything we've seen before. It opens on the planet Krypton, which Jor-El (Russell Crowe) believes is on the verge of destruction. Going against the norm of manufactured birth, he and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer) conceive their child naturally, and as the planet approaches its demise, Jor-El steals the planetary codex and filters it into his young son, Kal-El, before sending him into space, crash landing on Earth. Years later, Kal-El (Henry Cavill) has been raised on a farm by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and is now drifting between various jobs, everything from a fisherman to a bartender, leaving a variety of incidents in his wake, as he searches for himself. As an award-winning journalist named Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets on his tail, Kal-El discovers about his past, just as Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth, fiercely determined to retrieve the codex.A lot of common criticisms have been thrown at 'Man of Steel' since it premiered. Many have declared it to be ""too serious"" and ""humourless""; many have said that there is too much action in the final act; that Henry Cavill isn't charismatic enough; that Lois Lane isn't developed enough, etc, etc. After seeing the film, I found it difficult to agree with the various and recurring criticisms. Yes, I acknowledge that this is the most serious Superman movie we've seen thus far, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This isn't intended to be Richard Donner's 'Superman', this is meant to be a new take on Superman, for a new generation. The third act is also pure action from start to finish, but this matters little, because A) we care about the characters involved, B) it's justified in the plot and C) it's really entertaining. Even though I love his hyper-stylised adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', 'Man of Steel' is arguably Zack Snyder's finest film to date. It is also his mature; there is no slow motion or music video-like scenes; and in the quieter and more reflective moments that make up the first half, he displays both a mature tone and a clear respect for the source material. It is also a joy to look at, whether it be the beautifully realised version of Krypton or the Kents' farm outside Smallville, especially thanks to Amir Mokri's great cinematography. Hans Zimmer complements these visuals with a wonderful score that helps to further establish this as a new take on Superman, helping the viewer to instantly forget about John Williams' iconic theme tune.However, 'Man of Steel' wouldn't be the great film it is if Krypton's last son wasn't cast right. Henry Cavill makes the role entirely his role, delivering the most developed portrayal we've seen of Superman on screen; he's by turns, confident, unsure, reflective and lost. He essentially makes a superhero often disregarded as ""too perfect"" into a likable character that we really root for. Despite solid performances by Amy Adams, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne, it is the superb trio of Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner that best support Cavill. The brilliant Michael Shannon gives a great performance as Zod, making him a formidable villain. Crowe's turn as Jor-El is magnetic, while Costner's turn as Superman's adoptive dad is properly touching.'Man of Steel' was a movie that I anticipated for years and even with this undying level of anticipation, I cannot say I was disappointed at all. This film is super from start to finish, when Kal-El is and isn't in the iconic suit. Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have truly invigorated Superman in a way that should please old fans and make new ones. With spectacle, thrills and emotion, 'Man of Steel' soars.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Can you imagine the Captain America with the power of the Hulk,what would be? The answer is Superman. I was not a fan of superman before,but after this,I am a fanatic. This film,I highly recommend to you,would definitely break your concept of Heroes and give you a new perspective. As many remarks say,the director of the film is good at building Hero's heart world,and that really push Hero Movie to another level. This film surely pay more time to focus on Superman himself,using scenes changing from past to now to show the bumpy road that Superman himself traveled. You know,I am really speechless now,it just.....I am really stunned by this film,whatever in it's peace,emotion,action,special visual effect were controlled properly. When I saw the scene that Henry Cavill walking out of spaceship with superman suit,I suddenly realized that yes he is the superman. Handsome,strong,well-built...etc.It seems he is born for the role of Superman. The director of the film also should be praise,because his creative direct way makes the film unique. By the way,Amy Adams is really striking. Trust me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never,ever to miss this film.

I blame the director for wanting more action and not the lead character. Regardless, Henry Cavil is definitely the right man for the job. He not only looks like the former 1978 Superman star, but is a very good actor too! His American Ascent over his native British ascent is almost unnoticeable, while he certainly brought in a new, real dimension to the role. I would definitely put this at the top of my action/superhero films and hop that the lead character remains for many more sequels to come!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This new script places a lot of emphasis on the Krypton story, with a long introduction segment with Russell Crowe who does a solid job as Jor-El, and Michael Shannon who provides a very good and human General Zod.On the plus side, Henry Cavill is the best Superman since Reeve and he gives the character a lot of humanity as well as charisma; although, the Clark Kent persona doesn't appear until the end, and I'm not sure he can pull that off. Amy Adams, on the other hand, is very vanilla as Lois Lane, bringing none of the character's zest or passion into the role. Since she's already in love with Clark and knows who he is, we don't even have the sexual tension to look forward to in the sequel. The script isn't as flawed as other Nolan films but it's still messy; visually, it looks good but not as stunning as other Snyder films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It made sense that Kal would have a lot of questions about himself and his origins and the film did that well, I thought. The back and forth of time frames was a little off putting, but worked. If I have any criticism, it's that the battle scenes went on too long. They could have been cut back and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. Also, it was the loudest film I've seen since the Who's Tommy and believe me ,that's saying something. I think that my ears were bleeding by the time the credits rolled.

"9","/10","Packed with some of the most exhilarating action and brimming with unexpected poignancy, 'Man of Steel' lives up to its titular character's measure of mettle","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812169/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2013","Did Superman need a reboot after his last big screen appearance in Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns'? Not really in our opinion, but nonetheless the task of making Superman relevant once again has fallen to Christopher Nolan, he who successfully rebooted another DC Comics character with a grim and gritty treatment under the banner of 'The Dark Knight'.Though '300' and 'Watchmen' director Zack Synder is at the helm here, Nolan's fingerprints are all over the material, serving not only as producer but also sharing story credit with his 'Dark Knight' scribe David S. Goyer. This is a Clark Kent conflicted with his Superman calling as much as Bruce Wayne was with his Batman persona, and the key struggle for Superman here is that tension between both his Kryptonian and Earthly identities - or to put it simply, though he was raised on Earth, Clark has always wrestled with the fact that he is not of this planet.Such an existential dilemma has been explored in similar fashion in Marvel's 'X-Men' movies, but Goyer makes it personal, heartfelt and ultimately moving in a way that no other film has done. Employing a flashback structure not unlike that in 'Batman Begins', Goyer paints an intimate portrait of a unique individual whose innate nature and ability to do good is tempered by a genuine need for self-preservation. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a stirring sequence where a young Clark pushes an entire school-bus of his classmates to safety after their vehicle plunges into a raging ravine, only to be regarded with trepidation from the ones he saved and their loved ones as well.""You're not just anyone,"" Johnathan Kent (Kevin Costner) tells his adopted son. ""You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be."" So convinced was his father that the world was not ready for Clark that he would make the ultimate sacrifice just to preserve the latter's identity, that singular demonstration of love counting as one of the most powerful emotional wallops in the film. And amidst the bombast you would expect of a summer blockbuster, there are many such heart-tugging moments to be found here, which lend a depth to the character that no other Superman film has been able to.In building the emotional core of the movie, Synder makes some unlikely yet inspired casting choices. Costner and Diane Lane play Clark's adoptive parents Johnathan and Martha, and both actors bring seemingly effortless warmth to their performances. There's also Russell Crowe, who plays Clark's biological father Jor-El, the Academy Award-winning actor injecting nobility and gravitas as Clark's other fatherly figure motivating him to realise the destiny for which he is capable of. It is indeed rare to find such acting heavyweights willing to take up supporting roles, but no matter how Synder managed to convince them to do so, the dramatic tones they add to the film makes it all the very much better off for it.One suspects that these actors might have signed up because of the creative liberties that Goyer has taken with the material in a studious attempt to ground mythology in reality. There's no Kryptonite for one, and the Fortress of Solitude gets only a passing mention - but beyond these obvious revisions, Goyer makes bolder moves to find reason for just how Superman ended up with an 'S' on his suit, or for that matter, such a spandex suit in the first place. Just as significantly, he lets Clark and 'Daily Planet' reporter Lois Lane meet and fall in love even before the former joins the very newspaper, taking that familiar dynamic between Clark and Lois in a wholly different but entirely refreshing direction. There is both ingenuity and meticulousness in his revisionist plotting of familiar elements, even to the point of building credibility and reason into what could have easily been designed as a cardboard villain in General Zod.Clearly inspired by Goyer's reinterpretation as well as Nolan's guiding hand, Synder delivers what in our opinion is his best work to date. With Goyer's character-driven script, Synder establishes a level of heart and profundity that has escaped even his best films thus far. That's not to say that Synder has let up on what he does best; on the contrary, the visuals are simply astounding, especially so in the relentlessly thrilling action sequences. Aside from the messy prologue that sets up the destruction of Krypton, all the rest of the sequences pulse with an urgent rhythm that draws you in with bated breath and keeps you on the edge of your seat. That is particularly true for the second half of the movie that begins with an awesome decimation of Smallville and culminates in an exhilarating finale right in the heart of downtown Metropolis. This is action filmed on a scale never before seen, the mano-a-mano between Superman and General Zod alone enough to rival everything you've seen so far in them Marvel superhero movies. Yet all that flying and smashing and ass-whooping would not be as stunning without an emotionally satisfying centre, embodied perfectly by British actor Henry Cavill as well as his complement Amy Adams. Cavill plays Superman as quiet, reserved and thoughtful without ever being angsty, while Adams has plenty of sass and spunk to spare as his romantic other half. Their Clark and Lois isn't what we would be well- acquainted with, but hey, if you're going to do a reboot, you might as well be audacious in spinning the oft-familiar elements of the tale.And that is what director Zack Synder, screenwriter David S. Goyer and producer Christopher Nolan have accomplished so beautifully in their rendition of the caped crusader. This 'Man of Steel' doesn't just take flight - it soars.","30 out of 59 found this helpful.

This movie truly gave us the Man of Steel in all of his super powerful glory. This is definitely a movie with flaws, of course, but if you can overlook a few minor issues and just sink yourself into it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.Let's start with the positives first. The scenes on Krypton in the beginning of the film are truly epic in scale and presentation. We get to see a view of Krypton like we never have before. Rather than just present us with the super clean, white, crystal-like Krypton from the Reeve era, we get a more gritty look this time. Krypton is in trouble and it is felt within the opening moments. Russell Crowe is fantastic as Jor-El, and gets much more screen time than I had initially thought he would. Even well after Krypton meets its fate, he still shows up as a guide for his son on Earth, and has a few surprisingly awesome moments. Even after death this guy is a formidable.Then we have the Man of Steel himself, Kal-El. Henry Cavill did a great job with what he was given here. He shows us a vulnerable and yet still formidable version of Superman. He looks the part and fills the suit well. When it came time to go to work, we truly get to see Superman do things we've never, and I mean NEVER seen him do in a film. All the while, Cavill keeps us grounded with him and does his best to keep us interested in Kal-El's journey of self discovery. Great choice.The rest of the supporting cast did their parts well also. Amy Adams did fine as Lois Lane. She wasn't completely vulnerable and was tough without seeming ridiculously over-written to be the quintessential damsel in distress turned super girl. She carried herself well. Michael Shannon was also great as Zod. He played all the right notes and didn't give us just a one-note villain who was bad just to be bad. Zod believe what he's doing is right, even though he knows it's cruel. Shannon gives us a Zod who feels regret at times, and we can read it all over his face. The only other character who was truly a stand-out here was Faora. She was a nice contrast to Zod, because while he seems grounded and aware, she is just cold-hearted and evil. She does what Zod asks her to do and is fiercely loyal to his cause, but you can tell she enjoys it much more than he does. Not to say the rest of the cast was bad in any way, but I'm just mentioning the stand-outs.The action in this movie is FANTASTIC. A few moments my jaw literally fell open. If you want to see Superman fight, and I mean REALLY fight, then this movie has you covered. I'm well aware that some people don't get off on action, but I eat it up like candy. I was VERY pleased with the action in this movie and I didn't feel it overstayed its welcome at all. Some will inevitably disagree with me, but that's the way I see it.On a small note, the score by Hans Zimmer in this film is orgasmic. I can't put it any other way. Seriously. I had chill bumps every time a new movement started up. If you're like me and feel like a movie is enhanced ten fold by the music, you'll be more than satisfied here.As for the negatives. I'll do my best to lay them out as matter of fact as I can. It is true that there is a lack of character development in this film. I didn't want to believe it, but I can't lie to myself. I felt like Snyder was trying his best to give us those notes of emotional resonance to make us feel something for some of the events that happened in flashback, but the mistake was that not enough time was given to those scenes. When we see the flashbacks, they work. We get the message of what each particular flashback is trying to convey. However, had a little more time been focused on those flashbacks, we would have felt closer to Clark by the time he dons the blue and red suit. Which brings me to my next issue.We literally get thrown into Clark becoming Superman. It happens so fast that you might feel like a part of the movie was left out by mistake. When Clark sets out of the Fortress of Solitude and tries to fly for the first time, we feel like we have barely heard him say a handful of words. It just felt ""off"" to me and going over it again and again in my head, I still think it felt a bit too rushed.Any other issues? Well, not really. I had issues with this film just like I would with any other. No film is perfect, ever. With that said, I had A LOT of fun and felt like a kid again when Superman finally threw his kid gloves off. The action scenes, again, are brutal, fast and suited to this character. We don't have a 'weak' Superman in this movie, so don't worry if you were concerned about that. He gives as good as he gets, and personally I'm glad for that. Showing a Superman who has a challenge to face is much more interesting than just making him an unstoppable god. I don't like giving number scores because it can throw everything out of balance. I won't do that for this film. All I can say is that if you go into this film with an open mind and let it take you in, you'll enjoy it. Dare I say, you just might even love it.","34 out of 69 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill, I think he embodies who we see when we see Superman. 2. Russell Crowe as Jar-El and Kevin Kostner as Jonathan Kent, great actors who really bring something to their roles. I also liked the casting of Diane Lane and Lawrenece Fishburne. In fact casting is something this movie does really right. The beginning is great with lots of time spent setting up the new Kryptonian story. I think this was a good choice it gave Russell Crowe some great scene time and set the tone for the movie. I think the Kal-El, Clark story told in real time and flashbacks was also a good choice. It worked really well even though it was non linear. The scene's with Jonathan Kent are good but I feel that Diane Lane's acting talents were wasted for the most part during the whole movie. But this movie is all about the Fathers so I guess I can understand it a little. At first I had trouble with the introduction of Lois Lane but I kind of got into it after awhile and thought that it took some imagination to come up with this. It was definitely different. I also enjoyed the whole fish out of water feel for Superman, for the first time the movie really showed what it must be like to be an alien, not a bad thing at all. All the good being said there were some really poor choices in this movie. One of which might just doom any franchise expectations. One was too many redundant fight scenes. Too much destruction. It was totally unnecessary and started to get boring which really blew the wind out of an otherwise enjoyable film. Again poor choice on what to do with your villain. I just really can't understand why writers make this really dumb choice over and over again. It just doesn't make any sense and really hurts future stories. The end (which I guess will be much talked about) was the worse choice and I think many will be very put off by it. It is the total destruction of the Superman image. Too bad because the rest of the movie has great promise. I gave it a 7/10 for Henry Cavill and the other great actors.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Superman should have being a no brainier, how can u not find a script, its there in 1979 and the one after and for god sakes take your time, you could have made 3 movies to get to the point where Superman has ended up in this one. Movie one origin, without that ridiculous krypton scene in Man of Steel (Marlon Brandos 5 Min's outclasses that whole 20min shambles. he lands family shelter him till hes able to control his powers then high school(loads of filling there for awkward teen who has the ability to kick ass but has to restrain himself), Mr Kent giving him pearls of wisdom along the way before he dies....naturally. Again the natural death of Mr Kent was important and much more profound that the tornado scene in MOS, it was an important lesson for superman and showed him to be much more vulnerable. Then he goes to figure out where hes from drawn to the crystal palace and gets his cape which I would have loved if Jor-el wrapped his son in before he puts him into the escape pod, again for me no brainier and its these little things that make a movie not skyscrapers falling down all over the place. Any way you could end there after he turns up in ,Metropolis save Louis Lane from some impending disaster in full super man outfit before turning up at the Daily planet for a job and she still doesn't know who he is. Movie two Superman doing his thing, Louis trying to figure out who he is, Lex Luther trying to harness his power all that stuff. loads of fun stuff including the iconic superman music changing persona etc.Movie 3, General Zod lands on planet earth and demands the Surrender of superman.

Anyone missing the Richard Donner days of Superman will need a large box of tissues to console themselves with just how much better this movie is.Where Donner's movie was hammy and full of slapstick (and arguably of its time) it looks ridiculous in comparison. This is a serious attempt to tell a story of universal scale and goes all out on suspending disbelief.Man of Steel jumps in with both feet from the outset world building in a way very few movies have ever matched. And In no way is the movie too long. The opening scenes last a mere 20 minutes but they are breath taking in their ingenuity.It forgoes the traditional and tired linear narrative of Clarke growing up employing flashbacks which integrate with the story and only introduces Clarke to the Daily Planet at the very end (thankfully).Clearly the writers set out to avoid as many cliches and repetition of previous efforts which is welcome offering a fresh and modern perspective.Acting is good throughout with some excellent casting. FX are literally out of this world.The haters are just missing their spandex. Great film.. and one of the best superhero movies you will see.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was so disappointed in the overall plot and left feeling that there was way to much time spent on the demise of Krypton, how the boy got to earth etc. For almost the first 1/2 hour it was all about putting the baby in a pod and sending him off. The other disappointing factor for me was the sci-fi aspect. Way. Too. Much. With. The. Spaceships. If that is something you really like then I think you would enjoy the many, many battle sequences but for myself, I just wanted to see Superman grow up and become the hero he is. It was too much a cross between Star Wars and Star Trek. So I'm giving it a 4.

Let me put it this way: remember those scenes in Family Guy where Peter Griffin runs into his giant chicken nemesis and a long, perpetual brawl breaks out that pretty much destroys everything in its path? Well, imagine that punch-fest drawn out for over an hour, and that's basically most of what you'll see when watching Man of Steel, albeit with more elaborate and over-the-top effects. It gets boring after the first minute. And then gets endlessly repeated.The script is incoherent with plenty of logic flaws to pick at. Characters that aren't Kryptonian seem to have teleportation abilities or seem to have a suspicious habit of finding themselves in constant peril for no apparent reason other than to give the supposed hero an added challenge. Which brings up the nagging question of whether he's ultimately responsible for all the destruction.Hans Zimmer's score sounded awesome in the trailer. Pity it didn't make an appearance until the end credits. Even now, I'm not sure what the new Superman theme is supposed to sound like. Certainly nowhere as recognisable as the Williams masterpiece. Not a fault of Zimmer mind you, more likely just poor sound editing.If you've seen the third trailer, then honestly, you've already seen the best version of this film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","An important, albeit imperfect, game-changing chapter of the Superman saga","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812249/?ref_=tt_urv","adamleetlu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29769739/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2013","Zack Snyder's superhero spectacle serves as an epic and often overwhelming response to those who criticized Superman Returns for playing it too safe. There is no doubt that Man of Steel stands as the definitive Superman film in terms of action, transcending our wildest expectations of what we ever hoped to see Superman capable of. Unfortunately, and despite an incredible ensemble, the film relies too much on that notion, forfeiting restraint and levity in favor of a special effects overkill that chokes the story in its final act. The story falls into two halves and sometimes feels at odds with each other in its attempt to connect the two. The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's (Michael Shannon) rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him. The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best. Shannon's turn as Zod provides a perfect counter to Cavill's Superman as the insanely loyal and genocidal General. The Kryptonian outcast brings out the fire in Superman, ultimately forcing him to wrestle with an extremely heartbreaking decision. Shannon's scenes with Crowe also merit attention, as the two wax philosophical with theories on how to save their race. Antje Traue backs Zod's ferocity as Faora-Ul, Zod's ruthless and lightning fast sidekick, and chews up scenery in many of the film's best fights. And my God there are a lot of them. The film ends on a lighter note, promising the opportunity for an expanded relationship between Lois and Clark, as well as a new vocation and warm welcome to the Planet (Double entendre intended).Henry Cavill deserves all the praise bestowed upon him. His interpretation of Clark/Superman is complex and hits all the right notes, bringing to light many of the emotions that remained absent in previous translations of Superman. Yes, he is introspective at times but the response is understandable given his life experiences. This is a ghost of a man who has disconnected from the world, carrying a heavy burden as he honors his surrogate father's request to wait until the right time to reveal himself. We haven't reached the point in Clark's trajectory as a superhero where he can enjoy life on Earth. There are much more important matters to attend to. It isn't until he meets Lois Lane that he learns to trust a human independent of his family. In many ways, Lois saves Superman as much as he does her. All of Cavill's moments on-screen are remarkable, whether he is offering sensible and sweet dialogue to Lois Lane or Ma Kent, or when he is finally unleashing years of pent-up aggression towards Zod. If there's one complaint to be made regarding his character, it's that we're missing the lighthearted notes Reeve offered as Kent, but that has more to do with the story and is of no fault to Cavill. He emerges as a worthy Superman for a new generation.With that said, the story's faster than a speeding bullet pacing prevents Man of Steel from truly rising above the clouds and suffers from the law of diminishing returns. A non-stop explosion extravaganza may sound thrilling to anyone who found Superman Returns to be impotent, but trust me when I tell you it gets to be a tedious exercise. The first time you see Superman battle Zod and his army, your mind will be blown. After over an hour of seeing two essentially equally powered titans smash through skyscraper after skyscraper in the destruction of Metropolis, it's hard not to feel a bit concussed. Man of Steel offers everything we've ever wanted to see in Superman as a powered-up superhero, but it also could use a little less brawn in favor of some brains. We're also never really given an explanation as to how Superman, who has little experience as a fighter, can match a battle-tested General. Zod evens asks as much. Christopher Nolan struggled with fight scenes in the Batman franchise but you at least got to see Bruce Wayne cut his teeth on way to becoming the Caped Crusader. But it's Superman so we'll give him a pass.Overall, Man of Steel deserves credit for being its own film and refusing to yield to its predecessors. It's not without its slip-ups but you have to respect Snyder for having the heart to take risks. The film puts the Superman franchise back on course, will make Warner Bros. tons of money and finally offers Batman a worthy ally in the Justice League movie that waits further down the road. If Snyder and Goyer can let off the gas once in a while and lighten the tone up a little bit, allowing the sequel to breathe, they just might have what it takes to offer a chapter in the Superman saga that rivals The Dark Knight. That alone should be enough to motivate you to see the film.","8 out of 24 found this helpful.

And for a good reason. It was a loud action filled blockbuster that is worth your time. But one major fault was that it felt rushed.The introduction to the movie was long, that's a good thing, but it lacked in the in depth detail to introduce us to the universe. I thought there could have been a little more talking and calmness in the film, only because I thought the amount of action was ridicules. It was fun action, and for that I didn't really care much about the plot.I also thought there was a bit of a CGI overhaul, but its Zack Snyder, it was expected.So all in all if you are looking for a Hollywood history moment like the Batman movies, then this is not your thing. But if you are looking for a bit of fun that is CGI infused, loud, all out action, a plot that you will lose interest in, then this is a film you might want to watch.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

For years Warner Bros. has tried to bring back the greatest hero of all, and it was David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan the ones that find out how to do it. The seriousness of the story, the depth in Clarks feeling and the entertained spectacle they bring in screams Chris Nolan everywhere. There is no doubt (and Goyer and director Zack Snyder has said so), that without Nolan, this movie couldn't be possible. The script, based on the story by Nolan, is the first great script by David S. Goyer. Everything this guy has done is dumb, except for The Dark Knight trilogy and he did those with Nolan. But if you check out some of his solo works you will see titles like The Unborn and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. But this time, he wrote the script alone and is his first mature and serious work on his own. Excellent script, with no dumb lines and shallow characters.Then enter Zack Snyder. Because I hate everything this guy has done, I was very nervous of him directing this movie. I told to myself ""In Nolan I trust"", so if Nolan chooses this one, then he could do the job. Thank God Snyder decided to change his style for Man of Steel. He promised in the beginning there will be no slow motion scenes, and there are none. The cinematographic style goes with the premise, ""what if this happens tomorrow?"" It has a lot of hand-held shots, very fast and brutal. It must be a 3D nightmare, but if fit perfect in the mood of the movie. Snyder proved he can do better than he has done in the past. What is an awesome story, beautifully directed without an amazing score? Hans Zimmer proves he is the master. The best he did was not trying to imitate John Williams. Zimmer comes with a different score, full of emotion, and with a simple melody he makes a statement: ""This is a new Superman, and this is his song"". Music is very present during the movie and it will be as memorable as the original John William score.The cherry of the pie came with the cast. There is no superhero movie with a better cast than this one. No Avenger or X-men can be compared with this cast. First there is Henry Cavill. After Immortals I had my doubts about him, but make no mistake, this guy was born for this roll. All previously actors, were the perfect Clark Kent, but Cavill is the perfect Clark and Superman. He is big and strong, but at the same time has this sad face, full with the pain of not being part of this world. Finally we can enjoy a Lois Lane that is not a damsel in distress. Amy Adams is strong and independent. She might get in some big trouble, but she definitely can defend herself. With her it is Michal Shannon. Who would think that man could be a good bad guy? Well, he is. He is as strong as Superman and he is dangerous, he have no mercy and is capable of destroy the whole planet if Superman let him. The character I feared most was Jonathan Kent. After seeing TV series Smallville I understand that Jonathan has to be a strong man, but honest. He is the man responsible that Clark is the good man he is. He raised him, and teaches him about good and evil. Kevin Costner is a good dad. He is solid on his position and very honest. He brings to life the kind of character makes you think: ""I want him to be my dad"". Well, he is Superman dad. The other dad is Russell Crowe and he'll make you forget the ghost of Marlon Brandon. I like this Jor-El better. He is not just a voice, but a presence. He is there teaching his son who he is and what is the purpose of being sent to Earth. Even thou this is a realistic look at Superman, it is a solid sci-fi movie. There is a lot of action, a lot of science fiction themes around it, and very good special effects. At some point of the movie it feels like is going to get boring, but never does. Just when I thought, ""if you stop now it's going to get boring"", it was when it got better. The action starts and it never stops until the very end. Man of Steel is the perfect summer movie of 2013, full of action and feelings. You can't miss this.","29 out of 58 found this helpful.

This latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb. A colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology, artistry and very strong story telling. The film begins very syfy, I was thinking ""Star Wars for several moments"" while watching the set up, but quickly turns into the comic hero, action adventure with lots of heart. The action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing. The fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker, more serious than previous versions. Unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring Christopher Reeve, thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route. You may find that this Superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics. Carrying the film with great elegance, character and charm and as a perfect fit is Henry Cavill. He conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis General Zod and his bad guys from Krypton.The clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect, because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well, so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival. Their arrival onto earth is understandable. The stellar cast who accompany Cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of ""Man of Steel"". But fear not, clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle. It is safe to say, this latest superman is so far the event film of 2013. The film you are not soon to forget. It's hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more. The ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels. Without question, this latest version of Superman brands Cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements ""Man of Steel"" into a new, fresh longstanding franchise. 10/10Entertainment Film News review","31 out of 64 found this helpful.

This movie is terrible. The problem with Man of Steel isn't the laughable script or the Michael Bay-style action sequences, it is the utter lack of love and appreciation for Superman by everyone involved. In 1976, when Richard Donner accepted the job of directing TWO Superman movies at the same time, he said great movies had to be made because Superman is as American as apple pie. Comics books, like Jazz music, was born and bred in this country and Superman was the first to leap off the pages and into our hearts. Donner's passion is on every frame of his 1978 adaptation.Now compare that to Man of Steel. The set-designs and costumes are ugly. I can understand the dying planet of Krypton looking like crap, but did the entire film have to look so hideous? Secondly, the cinematography is the worst I've seen in a major Hollywood production. Zack Snyder shoots everything like if he's 50-feet away on his cellphone. Thirdly, can we please, for the love of God, get rid of Hans Zimmer and his team of ""additional composers""? John Williams is rolling in his grave and he's not even dead yet. And finally, let's get to the root of the problems. There is no heart. This is Superman. He represents hope. He represents truth, justice, and the American way. He's the ray of sunshine. So why is this movie so downbeat, moody, and depressing? Superman kills Zod. That's how messed up it is. Oh, and let's not get started on Metropolis turning into ashes. I can understanding heading there in the second installment of a trilogy or even in a movie featuring Darkseid but starting a Superman series in that direction is absolutely ridiculous. Especially when there's nothing light-hearted to balance it. Man of Steel is just dreadful.On the positive side Henry Cavill is a good Superman. Does he lack charisma? Yes, but what did you expect from a film that has no charm whatsoever? He fits right in with everything else. The rest of the cast is decent as well. And the action scenes and visual effects were impressive. So, the movie works from a shallow perspective.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Excellent Reboot, but Too Reminiscent of ""Superman II""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2811648/?ref_=tt_urv","3xHCCH","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4294858/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2013","""Man of Steel"" gives us a twist in the usual way the story of Superman has been told. We see a number of scenes of Clark as a bullied child struggling to cope with and control his special powers. We see young Clark as some anonymous worker, hitchhiking from odd job to odd job. We see Lois Lane meet Clark in one of his odd jobs in the Arctic, not as a mild-mannered reporter at the Daily Planet. We do not hear Perry White say ""Great Caesar's Ghost!"", nor did we meet Jimmy Olsen.It was very heartening how we get to meet more of Superman's real and adoptive parents more in this film. We see that Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) lived up to 1997, and he did not die from a heart attack. We see Martha Kent (Diane Lane) still alive when Superman begin his career as a hero. We still see Jor-el (Russell Crowe) in many other parts of the film guiding Clark (and Lois!) even as we see him die at the beginning. The relationships of Kal-el/Clark with his fathers and how these shaped him as a hero is a central theme of this film, and I liked that a lot.The whole movie is essentially a remake of ""Superman II"", which was generally adjudged to be the best of the Christopher Reeve series. In that film, as with this one, Superman faces General Zod and his minions, who was able to escape his fate in the Phantom Zone and found his way to Earth to create havoc here. General Zod in this film (Michael Shannon) had different motivations for attacking Earth from the first one, which was generally for revenge. Of course, with today's computer generated technology, the special effects were much bigger and better than before. Gone was the simplistic shiny white spiked space pod which brought Kal-El to Earth or the flat rectangular mirror prison of Zod et al. in the Phantom Zone. The fight scenes were so much more explosive, ala Michael Bay style, since both Supes and Zod had matching superpowers crashing through practically all the buildings in the area where they were fighting. Both Smallville and Metropolis were practically demolished to ruins after the big scale martial combat of the Kryptonians. Henry Cavill cut a very dashing figure as the new ""Man of Steel."" His was a brawny, hirsute Clark. His acting style was serious and intense, but never shallow, unlike the last Routh version. Cavill was a fiercer, more macho Superman. I must admit though that it was a little funny how he suddenly became clean-shaven with neat shiny hair once he donned the new Superman costume for the first time. Amy Adams was a strong no-nonsense Lois Lane. Although of course she too had a scene where Superman made her knees weak, but this romance angle was gradually introduced. The dynamics of their relationship was changed quite a bit in this version. There was of course that scene where they fly together, but the situation was totally different and there was no soaring romantic music and poetry reading in the background like the Reeve-Kidder version. I am sure this relationship will be explored more in sequels to come.Overall, this is a very satisfying reboot of the Superman series by Zach Snyder. I liked that they took this one seriously, not devoid of humor but without the slapstick that made previous versions corny. The technical aspects of the film were excellent, especially the rich cinematography, the fast-paced editing, as well as the visual and sound effects of the battle scenes. I looking forward to seeing them reinterpret the evil genius of Lex Luthor in a future installment. This film has a charm distinct enough form the Reeve version and will be a successful franchise of its own.","35 out of 74 found this helpful.

But their Dark Knight-style makeover never quite comes ­together.The story falls into two halves and sometimes feels at odds with each other in its attempt to connect the two. The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's (Michael Shannon) rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him, which interrupted the movie flow a lot.The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best, but in this case its a heavy overdose and u feel like punching Snyder. Meanwhile you learn vital things, like what the ""S"" on the Superman costume stands for. Redundant, unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money, you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. ""What are you smiling about, captain?"" asks another cop. ""Nothing, sir—I just think he's hot.""Wait For the DVD ..!","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

But I will try to avoid comparisons. Lacking the humor and charm of Donner's 1978 Superman and Christopher Reeve's iconic performance (Damn It) pretty much starts from scratch, and has all the trademarks of Nolans work. Like he did with Batman, Nolan puts the man of steel in the real world. The fantasy is gone, as is the bright colours, triumphant music and fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Instead we get dour colours, a slow, melancholy Hanz Zimmer score, suspicion and a world that is not particularly worth saving. I think it impossible to better Reeve's take on Clark Kent/Superman (damn it again) that said, Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic book legend and the humanity to match his superheroism. And boy did he get in shape for his shirtless scenes. Of the supporting Michael Shannon is OK as General Zod. He has definitely been better, but he is OK. I like Any Adams take on Lois Lane, even if Lois is surprisingly chill with wiping out Aliens with a blaster onboard an spaceship. Russell Crowe has a great voice for the voice overs and makes a fine Jor El. I also liked Lawrence Fishburn as Perry White. But for me, Kevin Costner (who received great reviews) is the heart of the movie. He doesn't appear till over 20 minutes in, has only 4 scenes that run under 10 minutes yet his presence looms large, helped by the fact that his scenes are spaced out throughout the movie. Both Costner and Diane Lane (who I've always had a crush on, and still would here) are great as Clark's Earth parents, although Costner in particular deserves much more screen time.Those that complained Superman Returns didn't have enough action, will have been happier with this one due to three major battles in the latter half of the movie. For a movie that's all about saving Earth, there's an unaccountable amount of destruction in Man of Steel. The collateral damage caused by the battles bothered me the first time I seen it, and I was glad it was addressed in Batman V Superman.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

There are so many scenes that are so contrived, it ruins suspension of disbelief. I was pulled out of the movie so many times, it was a chore to just sit through it to the end.I do not recommend seeing this film; if you want superhero action/adventure, you are much better off renting any of the recent Marvel films (Avengers, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, etc.) and enjoying on the small screen. Better a good film on a small screen than a terrible one on the big screen.","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

I was utterly devastated when I watched the first few minutes and realized immediately this was The Avengers but with just one superhero. How does one justify $225 million on just CG and VFX. And that's what this movie is all about. There are virtually no performances to speak off beside the moment Kevin Costner gets swept off by a Twister. He should receive his pay check. The rest...nope. It was the most painful few hours I have ever spent watching anything. The storyline was shallow and fragmented, performances were non existent, there was zero character development, everything seemed over emphasized, the soundtrack was barely audible etc etc.Zack Snyder and David Goyer should take a serious lesson from Bryan Singer of Superman Returns fame. Now that was a properly made movie. Beautifully shot, gorgeous performances, believable characters, romance, hate, fear, anger, joy, happiness all rolled into a film that has made the franchise proud.This movie is deeply disappointing. Hollywood is spitting out rubbish on almost a weekly basis but drivel on such a grand scale is nothing short of a crime.

It's heartfelt, poignant and thrilling in so many ways. The production team was always a dream: Produced by Chris Nolan and directed by fan favorite Zack Snyder. Snyder has always be criticized for putting style over substance, and I have to completely disagree with the critics that seemed to yearn for the older 'Donner' Superman...Sorry folks, this is the Superman for the 21st century. As much as I revere the original (I must have watched in 100 times since I was a kid), it's a 35 years old film. That strong nostalgic value may made critics happy in Superman Returns, but heck...ask anybody whose tastes are not so 'avant garde', Returns was a good effort that failed to ignite the masses. The Man of Steel will be that movie.Brilliant move to cast both Russel Crowe AND Kevin Costner as the two 'fathers' of Kal-El/Clark Kent. Surprisingly, despite being surrounded by such great actors on all front, Cavill makes a surprisingly conflicted, modern Superman. Being told all his life to hold back and lost in purpose, before the Kryptoninans arrive and cause havoc. And what havoc it is....incredible action set pieces, that some critics found redundant but the 'younger generation' will find jaw dropping. It's always clear that Snyder is an 'anime geek' at heart, and this time he has the budget to pull it off. Building falls, super beings punching each other through the sky...'Dragonball' style fights at high speed ON AIR...It made the action sequences in other super hero felt so small and anemic in comparison. This is what the audience is expecting all these years..having Superman using his FULL power. So enough said, go watch it this weekend..it's worth it, don;t listen to the critics this time.","16 out of 30 found this helpful.

'Man of Steel is one of the most thrilling and coolest movie I've seen this year. The movie opens with loud and promising story about how Kal-El was sent to earth. The plot itself is quite fast though, not what everyone think that it would be long introducing of character like 'Batman Begins' did. 'Man of Steel' tells Clark's childhood by doing flashback that is clear enough for audience. And the last 1 hour action of the movie is just epic. The action scenes really thrill, it makes something that you won't ever forget and miss this summer. Henry Cavill is satisfying as Superman, he's absolutely more fit than Brandon Routh although there's no challenging line for him.The weakest part of this movie is their plot and storyline. The storyline is silly, predictable, too hurry and just a formality that would guide to a non-stop action climax. Don't expect the storyline would be as complex as Christopher Nolan's Batman cause it's totally not. The other character is also not introduced well especially Lois Lane character that appears too sudden and many coincidences, and Perry White character could be acted by any actors besides Laurence Fishburne. May be Zack Snyder doesn't want to make same mistakes like 'Superman Returns' did. It's rather impossible to focus on storyline while he wants to create a full action movie especially in the first franchise. That's acceptable why most critics hate this movie, it's definitely because of mess storyline that really matters for them. It seems 'Man of Steel' have two sides of audience here. Audience who minds a solid and structured storyline would disappoint of 'Man of Steel'. But, audience who seeks an entertaining and massive action sequences are gonna love it. For me, Zack Synder has succeeded to open a promising franchise from one of the oldest Superhero in history for fans and non-fans with a spectacular and punches action scenes although it's a little bit exhausting in the middle. Hopefully the sequel would focus on a relationship between Superman and Lois Lane which doesn't happen in this movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

SUPERMAN.Not hard is it.Why is it then that he is completely absent???Sure there's a blue and red blob that zips from one scene to the next but I didn't pay to watch a pixelated blur.I came to share a couple of hours with my favourite super hero of all time. The guy who, when I was a kid, was on my bed clothes and whose outfit I proudly wore to every fancy dress party.Alas it was not to be.I'm not knocking Henry. He ticks a lot of the boxes but we just didn't spend any time with him. We didn't get to know him. We didn't care for him.How could the writers of the brilliant Dark Knight series and the director of the equally brilliant Watchmen get it so wrong. Those films were all about character development. We got to know them as human beings. We could relate.Like the Iron Man trilogy, those movies weren't about the men in the suits, they were about the men. It made the moments they were in their suits so much more powerful.And yet no. It was not to be.I only hope they get it right next time.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

This is a tough review for me to write. I waited a long time to do it. There are two parts of me at war here. The movie fan didn't think it was that bad. The Superman fan hated it beyond belief.The cast is good. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were much better than I expected. They had nice chemistry, which I liked. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, etc. are all fine. The flashbacks are the better parts of the movie. That was kind of what I was hoping the movie would be. The present-day stuff varied in quality but got progressively dumber as the movie went along. The special effects are mostly good, although the fight scenes between Superman and the other Kryptonians seem like choppy insertions of video game animation. The codex plot device is a stupid addition to the story and one can only assume it was thrown in with the hope of seeing it pay off in a future sequel, which may not ever happen. The script gives lip service to hope, etc. but it's all mired in gloom and bleakness. Drab, depressing, with very little happiness. The last hour becomes mindless destruction. Don't even get me started on ""that moment."" It enrages me just thinking about it.As a sci-fi action summer blockbuster, I can't deny it's well-made and entertaining on that level. As a Superman movie, it's heartbreaking. Gone are the days of ""you will believe a man can fly."" No more inspiration. Now it's Superman in the 21st century: brutal, cynical, dark, self-absorbed. He's not even allowed to wear the traditional costume anymore, presumably because of infantile ""underwear on the outside"" jokes from braindead teenage boys (in age or just in mindset, no difference) raised on dark anti-heroes who have no sense who Superman is and what he stands for. Or rather, stood for. Anyway, off my soapbox. It's not a bad movie, judged solely on its own merits. But characters this iconic don't exist in a vacuum so it's very hard for me to look at it without comparison. See it and decide for yourself.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Having ignored him in the past they refuse to heed his warnings now but before they can dismiss him a general named ""Zod"" (Michael Shannon) breaks into the council chamber and after killing one of the leaders declares that he is now in charge of the entire planet. However, Jor-El manages to escape from the chamber long enough to send his young son out into the universe in a spaceship headed for Earth. Not long afterward, General Zod and his small band are captured and after being tried for murder and sedition they are all imprisoned in another dimension known as ""the Phantom Zone"" which, ironically, saves them from a certain death when Krypton explodes. The film then fast-forwards to a grown man with incredible powers saving some workers on an oil platform and then disappearing out of sight. Needless to say, this scene is the initial introduction of a person who will soon be known to the entire world as ""Superman"" (Henry Cavill). Now even though the CGI in this particular film gave it a significant advantage over the ""Superman"" movie produced in 1978, I was terribly disappointed with the manner in which the director (Zack Snyder) chose to deviate so radically from the original story. Likewise, the action scene towards the end dragged on much too long and was totally unnecessary. Now don't get me wrong-good CGI and action definitely enhances certain films. Unfortunately, Zach Snyder typically relies too heavily upon these two features and this film suffers as a result. Be that as it may, while this movie certainly had some good points, it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Just slightly above average.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just saw it for the first time today, August 2021. I regret not having seen it in the theatre as it's clearly meant to be watched on the huge screen, in bone-rattling surround-sound.I should amend the above by saying I loved the OG Superman when I was a little kid. Naturally, from a production-value standpoint this film blows that one out of the water (it was the early 80s...or late 70s?...after all), but the important bit is it does so without also coming off as incomprehensibly-CGI'd (cough *every other superhero action film in the last 20 years* cough) and it rivals the original in all other categories as well, except Reeve, who will forever be the best Superman no matter how fantastic Henry Cavill is (and he is pretty much perfect in this), except...okay, think of it this way: they're basically neck and neck for best Superman, just different kinds, Cavill the serious one, Reeve the goofier one. There's enough room in my heart for both of them.This film is beautifully shot and edited, cinematography A+, score A+. Instead of cheap action and cheap, dumb, adolescent humor, it's grown-up, as in, smart and remarkably sensitive (it's basically about love, after all); That's what happens when you produce a film around story instead of a bunch of contrivances designed to force plot points, cause explosions, and move gratuitous action along.That just about sums it up, except to say the critics were fools, and I agree with other reviewers here that it's much better than it was given credit for when it was first released.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

That generation brought us the Tim Burton Batman and little else of any success. The second generation kicked off with Bryan Singer's X- Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. With the reboot of The Amazing Spiderman, the re-invention of the epic blockbuster in The Avengers, the critical and commercial success of The Dark Knight trilogy, and a new team in X-Men: First Class, we have entered a third generation of superhero films.Man of Steel is Superman's return to relevance, and his first truly great screen appearance since 1979.An extended look at a much more realistic Krypton opens Man of Steel, and successfully sets the tone in a much darker way. Despite being Zack Snyder's film, the impact of Christopher Nolan is felt throughout; and although this sacrifices some of the light charm that Reeve's films were known for, it is a firm statement of independence that works in the film's favour.Unlike previous incarnations, the back story of Krypton is key to the entire film, and true motivation is developed for Superman's Kryptonian parents and the film's big bad, General Zod (Michael Shannon). Slight alterations to the technology, physics, and explanations of Superman's Kryptonian DNA are brilliant manipulations of the classic story that bring it up to date for a modern superhero blockbuster. Batman Begins started the reset where audiences would not accept a superhero without logic and reason. Man of Steel's creative team, including David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, have brought the same respect for the character that rebuilt Batman so effectively.Henry Cavill, the man who was almost cast as Aragorn then Batman and then James Bond, has finally found his blockbuster franchise. He fits the suit that few mere mortals are physically qualified for, and he manages to pull off the reluctant hero without appearing mopey or frigid. A downside to the origin story that this film tells is that we don't get much of his human alter ego. Part of what made Christopher Reeve's Superman so likable was his bumbling Clark Kent, but we'll have to wait until the next film to see if Cavill's awkward journalist is as good as his bulletproof hero.Even though the film revolves around Krypton's destruction, Clark Kent's childhood development in Kansas, and General Zod's escape from the phantom zone for revenge, Man of Steel carves a very original path from the first two Christopher Reeve films. By the credits it has established a new Superman in the same way that JJ Abrams established a new Star Trek. All the characters and elements are present, but they have not been dropped in front of us for no reason. By the end of the film we believe in them, and we see the connections that make them cohesive.With Batman joining Superman in the sequel, there is a danger that Henry Cavill's Man of Steel will get overshadowed by the (much more popular) Dark Knight. But it's possible that this film will get the Batman Begins status of being the somewhat successful opening act of great things to follow.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

We all know he can't be killed. But by god this film could potentially contain some mind blowing set pieces. I mean Neo from the matrix rescuing Morpheus on top of truck on the freeway in Matrix Reloaded, for me is the nearest thing to Superman (and that was filmed about 10 years ago) to say that 'MoS' ten years on did not have set pieces is somewhat a sad but true statement. There's Lots of noisy explosions and plenty of pleasing building blowing up eye candy. The fight scenes in smallville and metropolis was very repetitive ( a lot of throwing body's through the wall) but impressive but nothing we haven't seen before. The biggest problem for me was that the action was too fast, way too fast, blink and you'll miss it. The music was brilliant until it started to grind and repeat itself after the first hour and a half. God I wanted to so like this film and like the dark knight rises I was (and still) so disappointed. The acting was good M Shannon's character is flawless and Henry C's innocence is perfect and then we have Amy's next door Lois lane is spot on and the older actors were all great. Superb flash back scenes of the younger Clark Kent but batman begins already did that 7 years ago, nothing new here but the excellent flash back scenes gels the story together seamlessly. I've read some 1 star reviews on IMDb and I think that these review are very very unfair and absolutely wrong but giving the film 10 stars is also wrong. 6.5, maybe even a 7 out of ten I'd say. Worst bits- action way too fast and repetitive. Best bits- flash backs of young Kent at school and at his teenage life.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

When Man of Steel was announced with Snyder as the director and Nolan producing it, I thought that the Superman franchise was in for a big revamp. I have watched a few Superman films before, not being too much of a fan of the action genre, as expected did not enjoy them as much. With this film I had hope that maybe they will delve deep into the psyche of Superman, which they did to some extent, but the problem was that they did not stop at that. The first half started off in Krypton , with a little bit of the Superman backstory. Then two timelines were interlaced, one showing little Clark Kent inhibited to show his superpowers to the world, and another one showing a grown up Clark starting to show his powers to the world. The best part of the film is in these parts. His conversations with Jonathan Kent ,his father were powerful. Loved them. His discovery about his past and his subsequent conversations with Jor-El were also emotionally charged. The use of Zimmer's background music was probably the best thing about this film. Absolutely Brilliant. Then came in the 'Summer Blockbuster' 2nd half with the explosions and the action sequences, quite reminiscent of a Micheal Bay film. It's a Superman film after all, only an idiot will go in with an expectation that it will be Batman Begins, but still they overdid it and the script took a backseat .I would have been totally disappointed if it was not for the last 10 minutes, which managed to salvage some of the damage already done by the mind-numbing action sequences. It was not wrong for fans to expect a better output from a Nolan , Snyder collaboration .Although the best Superman film till date but clearly falls short of expectations, and yes there was no need to make this into a 3D film.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

In fact, Captain American and Thor was so terrible, and the origin movie made me impressive in Marvel was just the Iron man. Which can show its difficulty.But Zack Snyder and his team did that. The clothes, the music, the fight, and the simple but meaningful story. No one borns good, even Superman, but everyone can choose to be good. A simple story but more close to the reality. This time we didn't see a Deus EX Machina, but a human forced to be a god. And that's the key to the next movie.What a pity for DC.

I watched Superman Returns which I found boring, Aquaman and Dawn of Justice just awful. Thinking about it the only DC stuff I have liked were the 60s Batman series, Christopher Reeves Superman films (1 & 2 only) and I saw the first Wonder Woman a while back which was ok.

It popped up on Netflix and I thought I would give it a whirl. It was great. I thought Cavill was excellent in the lead role. Something I had not really noticed in Dawn of Justice. He looked the part and acted the part. The closest to Reeve yet. The back up characters were also good, his folks, Lois, Crowe, Zod. The story was great as were the action sequences. My only real criticism is the noise levels again. I constantly had to use the remote to keep turning up when they were speaking (could not hear them) and then down what with all the explosions and background music. It was a pain. The sound people at DC really need to sort those issues out with their movies. Great movie though. Was going to say that I am looking forward to the next one but DoJ has been and gone and was a disaster. I have not watched Justice League though so will give that a bash and am looking forward to the next Cavill Superman Solo movie.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The special effects were many and fantastic and really worth seeing on a big, big screen. I loved Henry Cavill as Superman. He brought something special to the role just as Christopher Reeves did years ago in his version. Cavill was so believable, he was superman. I liked the actor playing the younger Superman. All the casting was right on and added so much to the movie. Russell Crowe as Superman's powerful father from their home world. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue playing it just right as villains who were not over the top weird as sometimes comic villains can be. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as a Kansas farming couple raising Superman and coping with his powers and differences. Amy Adams as a questioning but honorable Lois Lane. Christopher Meloni as tough military.It had something for everyone so go enjoy it.","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

I was actually expecting some big solid fights and powerful scenes were missing.Just a simple Superman fighting the villain in the city, buildings and glass crashing were bore and nothing new.everything has been shown very fast in a hurry so that you wont come to know its animated etc.Overall an OK film which cannot beat the simple and superb Superman 1.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I must say there aren't many movies that actually warrant such a low score. This is not one of them. Any self-respecting cinema-lover should appreciate the giant strides Man of Steel attempted, as the last few Superman movies were certainly didn't deliver on this caliber. The movie features stunning visual effects (some reviewers claim they were used too much, I don't feel that way, especially for a movie featuring inhuman feats), visually-surrounding environments and situations that leave you gripping the end of your seat. I must admit, I am a huge fan of what Superman stands for in culture. Henry Cavill, who portrays Superman, appears a kind-hearted, chivalrous yet confused young man trying to find his purpose in life. The other actors and actresses did a phenomenal job. I don't think I would personally replace anyone if given the opportunity. The movie offers a touching landscape amidst a complex storyline. I feel that if Superman waltzed into public view in today's time, reactions would be similar to what the movie posited. Many reviewers rant negatively about the correctness of the lore, plot holes and the like, all of which can be argued and eventually refute. To spare everyone of this silly debate, I just wanted to mention that the film simply touched my emotions. The special effects and climactic timed were placed perfectly within the movie, and it was difficult for me not to feel emotionally for the situation. Many movies do not move me on a subconscious level, yet overtime this movie constantly met all of my logical and emotional requirements. If you have not seen the movie, don't listen to the overly harsh critics, and just go see it for yourself. Probably avoid watching with anyone that is too critical about movies as well, as negative preconceptions often deliver a negative experience afterwards.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Stunned at how dull, dumb and lifeless the film was! Is this truly Superman's return to form? I strongly doubt it. It was the first Superman film I saw, but now that I have watched the five other instalments I can compare them. The first two films that starred Christopher Reeve in the title role remain classics of the superhero genre that stand almost head to head with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The other two should not even be mentioned in the same paragraph. 'Superman Returns' on the other hand was a loving tribute to the late 70s and early 80s Superman that we all know and love.It is in the great tradition of reboots to try to distance themselves from the last reiteration as much as possible. Apparently that now includes making the film as dull and dreary as can be. Superman is a character who stands for ""truth, justice and the American way"". There is nothing to suggest any of this in 'Man of Steel'. With Zack Snyder showing no love or appreciation for his wide and varied source material. This time around Superman faces off against Zod! Wait didn't that happen with powerful consequences in 'Superman II'? Yes it did. Why Snyder did not choose to tell another villain's mythology is actually beyond anyone's comprehension.Let me start from the beginning. The film opens and it is literally beat for beat the same as the opening for 1978's 'Superman', albeit with a much higher budget and production values. We see Krypton, which is now a twisted darker version of Avatar's Pandora world. Then we are introduced to Jor El played with affection by Russell Crowe, God bless the man, he still tries his best even when the film surrounding him is poor. Oh dear, and Michael Shannon as General Zod hamming it all up; at least he doesn't give a damn. Baby Kal El is then sent to Earth in a thirty minute sequence which is the only glimpse of a heart in the whole film. Thirteen year old Clark Kent does not know who he wants to be and becomes feared and rejected.Kids do not want to be seen with a freak who saves a bus load of children from drowning. He looks to his parents for love. Even Kevin Costner displays emotion as Jonathan Kent. I was actually enjoying the film up until the point where Superman dons the cape. It all goes downhill from there. We are then treated to endless talking, at this point the film feels like it has lasted a lifetime. But hey wake up the action scenes have started! Oh my, they are appalling. They go on forever and consist of Superman beating the living daylights out of Zod. Then throwing him into nearby buildings full of innocent civilians. What does old Superman stand for now eh? Lies, injustice and an American death? Well that's the lasting impression that Snyder gives us.Cavill does a fine job in the role as Superman, but it is nothing like Reeves who effortlessly blended confidence and nerdiness when taking on the dual role and personality traits of Superman and Clark Kent. Hans Zimmer is no John Williams, but still reaches into his inner self to provide the best element of 'Man of Steel', a soaring score. Williams' theme would have been completely misplaced with all the death and destruction taking place in the background. So at least his legacy has not been destroyed, just Superman's.The ending is atrocious and laughable at best. Does Superman have any morale whatsoever? Because Snyder does everything in his power as a director to try and show that he possesses none. In this day and age we have seen a variety of superheroes with relationships; Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes, well briefly at least. I have found memories of Margot Kidder playing Lois Lane. Amy Adams is unfortunately an uninspired casting choice and even looks like she has no wish to be there. I kept on hoping that her character would walk off screen but to no avail. Snyder has not just destroyed my Superman, he has blown to smithereens my Grandfather's as well.Snyder has adopted the 'Batman Begins' approach to Superman. By doing so he has ended up in losing the superhero's appeal, essence and my interest. He has stripped down old Superman to the most boring hero imaginable. The villainous Zod feels like a complete retread, especially when 'Superman II' handled him so superbly. Maybe next time Superman will soar or actually save some innocent civilians, restoring his former glory in the process. For the moment though, Superman flies no more.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Alternative Interpretation of Superman May Enthrall Some and Frustrate Others -- Visuals Accentuated Over Character and Plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814244/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2013","The main issue with the latest version of Superman via Christopher Nolan is whether audiences will buy into looking at Superman through a new lens; a lens which takes the Superman mythos and warps into something quite new. Is it better? That's the fundamental question. Many of the elements from the 1979 version are here: the planet Krypton, Jor-El, General Zod, Jonathan Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and of course the Man of Steel. However, in this version, the many ingredients are switched around and the order of the recipe turns out quite different. It's still the recognizable Superman, or is it? Several elements are changed, including Lois meeting with Superman, and later the arrival of Zod on a mission so different than any previous offering whether it be comic book, film, or television.Probably the strongest aspect of the film is its imagery rather than the dialog or the acting. The story begins on Krypton like the older film. Alternatively, the imagery of Krypton and the inhabitants ring of 1930's and 1940's SF rather than the 1979 film or the comic books from the 1940's through 1960's. The ships and devices have their roots more in the original Alien film, with dark gray's and brown's instead of the bright crystals of the 1979 version. The story is updated to reflect 21st century United States rather than Superman of the 1940's or the 1970's. Lois Lane has a cell phone and even posts a story online. When General Zod and the baddies arrive, albeit before Superman is really known, the imagery and feel is much more like a current science fiction film than Superman battling domestic bad guys. This could frustrate some purists who wanted the story to reflect the Superman of tradition.Although the look of the film is tremendous, the acting and writing department is not equal to the first two offerings starring Christopher Reeve. While Russel Crowe is not a bad choice as Jor-El, the script and his subsequent performance are not as compelling as Marlon Brando's Jor-El several decades earlier. When Brando's Jor-El appeared in a black cloak with the ""S"" insignia, proclaiming an indictment against the traitors of Krypton, Zod and company, with the words ""This is no fantasy"", we are pulled into a story about justice, right and wrong. The myth of Superman embodies the ideas of justice and morality. Although Superman itself is a fantasy, the issues of right and work, good vs evil, are every-present. Unfortunately, the present script didn't quite find a rhetorical theme from which to build a story. I had trouble really understanding what this film was about.The one character which was the most disappointing was General Zod. I realized what a tremendous performance Terence Stamp offered as Zod in the earlier films and yet here the present casting and his script were far less compelling. Somehow, the current Zod seems less intelligent and more prone to fits of rage. When Zod and his cohorts are on trial in the original film, you never sense that Zod is a victim but an individual who has acted out of malice by pure choice. In fact at the beginning of the 1978 version, we know that the failed coup, although we never saw it play out. We recognize because of the seriousness of the criminal proceedings, the overthrow came dangerously close to succeeding. The current Zod seems over his head, and not in fully in control. The coup is shown but somehow seems less believable, maybe even slightly contrived. Zod will essentially continue what he began on Krypton on Earth.What may save the film is the two leads played by Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Cavill is a decent Superman and Adams holds her own as Lane. They definitely had more chemistry than the 2006 Superman Returns but not quite the magnetism as Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. The film then lapses into long action sequences which seem never to end, with the rather complex and convoluted plot not fully explained to satisfaction. While I understand the need not to repeat earlier Superman's, this film just misses the mark. A noble but rather disappointing entry into the Superman canon.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But once we get over the design of the film we are left with a feeling of emptiness. An emptiness that allows no character to develop and no character relationship to flourish. Instead we are manipulate into emotional falseness by an over relying score. With Christopher Nolan on-board we are introduced to flashbacks which worked so well in the Batman movies, but here the flashback's fail due to the lack of authenticity or fluidity.Outwith the before mentioned CGI and look of the film, the only pass marks go to Kevin Costner and Micheal Shannon who brings along his usual antihero prowess with great coolness and composure. With the building blocks now pathetically in place lets hope the next chapter can now develop into something much more complexly engaging.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

For some reason, I thought that such a furore could not be repeated by director Zack Snyder, unknown to me at that time. Oh, how I changed my mind after I left the cinema. Snyder gave the world a great Man of Steel.What immediately catches the eye is the thoughtful world of the planet Krypton, where the film meets the viewer. It is clear with what love the director approached the project. He showed, albeit briefly, but the utopian world that is doomed to perish. Beautiful futuristic scenery and costumes, its own culture of relationships between characters - all this perfectly demonstrates an alien world.The characters are perfectly spelled out, you understand the motivation of everyone. Superman feels like an outcast, a loner, an outsider. Throughout the film, the viewer sees how he is trying to find his place in an alien world, where he is essentially god.General Zod is a great villain. Snyder and the screenwriters perfectly showed his motivation, desire to save and revive his home. After all, as he himself declares, this is his main mission in this world.Lois Lane is just fine. Contrary to popular opinion based on comics, here the journalist appears to be a rather modest person. However, she is ready to stand up for her interests, enter into the position of others and empathize. Amy Adams is great in this role. The actress shows a completely unusual Lois, it's interesting to look at her.Clark's parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, demonstrate exactly what is expected of them on the screen. They prepare their son for the human world as best they can and try to protect him from all adversities. Clark's relationship with his father and their evolution are well shown. As a result, you realize for yourself that with age such a connection only grows stronger. And if conflicts are frequent in adolescence, then closer to thirty Clark misses his father very much, he lacks his wise advice.The visual component is beyond praise. Snyder has always shown himself to be a great visionary. Every frame, every scene - everything is verified and perfect. The presence of computer effects organically fit into the whole picture of the narrative. The viewer is watching a fantastic movie and is absolutely ready to see what the creators offer him.The musical accompaniment from my beloved Hans Zimmer is great. As always, he bypassed himself by creating a futuristic, slightly apocalyptic soundtrack that flows into the necessary scenes with powerful notes. However, there are also very soft melodies that are immediately associated with the parents of a superhero, a farm and something at home.The film is involuntarily compared to the classic pictures about Superman. And although Christopher Reeve was great in this image, Henry Cavill presented it perfectly. His Superman perfectly demonstrates modernity, he is young and hot, still little experienced, but still on guard of justice.The film looks in one breath, the timing of almost two and a half hours is not felt. The story is great, it gives a great start to the whole cinematic universe and looks great as an independent completed story.10 out of 10.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Man Of Steel IS NOT a Superman film. It's an utter bastardisation of the Superman character and this story could be easily interchanged to any generic super hero film. While the first half of the film is quite good, the second half is an exercise of CGI excess and generic action movie tropes and tedium quickly sets in. The film's last moronic half hour goes against Superman's true morals and beliefs and by that stage I lost any goodwill towards Superman that the film had earned at that point. Costner is easily the best thing in it. People may criticise Superman Returns, but after seeing Man Of Steel, I find Superman Returns is at least a true Superman film with a lot more integrity and reverence to the source, than this. Sadly they just miscast Superman Returns terribly. Man Of Steel confirms my belief than Zack Snyder is a hack. Evidence - Sucker Punch, Watchmen, 300 and this! A noisy, moronic, loud, unoriginal, missed opportunity and a far cry from the excellence of the recent Dark Knight trilogy.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The man of steel (Henry Cavill) is dark, rugged and beautifully explosive and leaves chaos and destruction in his wake as he attempts to fight General Zod and his forces. We start on the planet krypton as you would expect, however this time we see an alien and technologically advanced race that really fits the bill! Their technology is based on iron filings suspended in a liquid and is seen frequently in the early to mid stages of the movie. When combining this tech with space shuttles of various shapes and sizes and winged beasts soaring through the air the viewing experience is really quite spectacular. Battle armour is worn by kryptonians and are armed with plasma guns of some kind, all of which display stunning special effects and continues to get better and better throughout the movie.Jor-El (Russel Crow) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) play superman's farther and mother and have the painful choice of sending their son Kal-El to earth before Kryptons imminent and dramatic exit from the universe. After arriving on earth Kal-El is cared for by Jonathon Kent (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). We are instantly thrown into a world of heroism as a certain Clark Kent displays his raw superhuman strength and his immunity to fire. He soon disappears and continues living on the road looking for work and with his non-biological fathers encouragement he eventually finds the secrets to his past. Soon to follow is the introduction of lois Lane(Amy Adams) who pursues Clark in search of a story. It will be interesting to see how this relationship is written in the next movie. I Would of liked to of seen more childhood events, relationships and generally a slightly longer filming in this area. However what was shown about Clarks childhood was very impressive. I thought the entire cast was great and as usual Kevin Costner and Russel Crow were fantastic to watch. I thought Zack Synders interpretation of superman was very good indeed and would give a comfortable 7.5/10M.Rigby","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

For example his costume was too gaudy. People who love the original superman would think that ""Man of Steel"" is too serious, but I was moved deeply by this powerful movie.Superheroes are lonely, because they are too special for ordinary people to understand them. They show their superpower to try to save people, but their superpower makes people fear them. Superheroes are like Jesus who was betrayed by the people he wanted to help.I think that Superman is the loneliest superhero. Bruce Wayne is basically an ordinary human being. He wanted to be special, and he wears a mask to be Batman. On other hand, Kal-El was born in the planet Krypton and he isn't a human being. He is fundamentally different from people on the planet earth. But he fought against and killed Kryptonians to save human beings. He is far lonelier than Bruce Wayne. The plot of this movie expressed the loneliness of Superman very well. He is lonely, so the plot couldn't be comical but serious.As an aside, Diane Lane, who played Martha Kent, Clark's mother on Earth, was great. I was surprised that Laurence Fishburne has became so fat.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Some of the scenes are good; the performances are pretty good, with Kevin Costner turning in a fantastic one. In fact, it's fair to say he is under-used. The film does also look and sound very fancy; Hans Zimmer once again brings the magic he is so well known for, but sadly the execution is overblown and all over the place; exactly the sort of approach I would expect, and was worried about, from Snyder. The man has very little grasp on how to actually tell a story, and after the first rather choppy hour of substance, he quickly loses himself in his own playground; he even brings it in too long. So all in all, it's not without its merits and is generally a decent blockbuster, but the good moments aside, this is ultimately disappointing; a lot of talent squandered.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Perhaps it's because it speaks to me on so many levels. For starters, growing up as a Superman fan, it's awesome seeing how this movie makes him come to life. It's beautiful and it's epic. I swear it never gets old watching Cavil's Superman take flight. One of my all time favorite scenes from any superhero movie will forever be when Clark first learns to fly. The visuals, the sounds, the boyish wonder and joy that Cavill displays... it's wonderful. Some moments look so good I kept rewinding to watch them again.The movie as a whole looks huge and expensive. I would even say on such a scale as 2012's The Avengers. The battles are big and destructive and the display of power and super abilities is impressive. I like that Snyder kept it real and wasn't afraid to show that this fight had many civilian casualties. It brings a heaviness and seriousness to the whole situation, and really sets up the following Batman v Superman film.It has the perfect tone for a superhero movie. It's not a silly superhero comedy that can't be taken seriously, it's not a dark drama like Joker that's hard to enjoy, and it's not a mindless action film like Black Adam. It's a mature action/ adventure with emotional depth and thrilling superhero action sequences. There's a great balance kept between the action and the storytelling sequences. I love how Snyder handled the flashbacks to Clark's upbringing and the scenes before Clark discovers his identity. It portrays a kind, good-hearted man just trying to find himself, and helping people along the way. The color, the mood, the music, and the content of these sequences make them feel unique and interesting. The artistic creativity is beautiful and no overdone.There's a lot of heartwarming moments between Clark and his parents, who by the way, are excellently cast. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are fantastic in these roles. No, I don't love how they changed Jonathan Kent's cause of death, but I paid close attention to this character during this most recent watch, and I understand him better now. Knowing better what he feared and what was most important to him, his mindset and actions don't seem so unreasonable to me anymore. He's raising, to his knowledge, the only alien on the planet. Clark's identity being discovered would in reality, change the world, perhaps in a very harmful way. Kevin Costner plays this character in a way that reminded me a little of his Yellowstone character. He's a strong and thoughtful man with strong convictions and you can't help but admire him.Everyone in this movie is so well cast. There isn't a single misstep. Amy Adams nails it as Lois Lane, and Henry Cavill is the ultimate Superman. Since the 1990s, we've had 5 men play this character, but it's like Cavill was born for this. The only other one who comes close to him is Christopher Reeves, who was the Superman of his time, just like Cavill is the Superman of our time. He doesn't just look the part, he embodies this character. Cavill displays raw emotion, grit, humility, quiet confidence, a sense of humor, and a strong sense of right and wrong.It is an absolute waste that Man of Steel will likely be the only Superman solo film we ever get with this perfectly cast Superman.With Hans Zimmer composing, Man of Steel unsurprisingly has one of the most beautiful and memorable superhero movie scores I've heard. There are dramatic scenes where the music fuels the emotion in such a powerful way, it reminded me of the 2010 masterpiece, Inception.You can't fully appreciate Man of Steel if you miss the Christian symbolism. I was moved by the imagery of Jesus Christ. It really helped me wrap my head around people's different reactions to Superman. Jesus came to earth and was mostly rejected and hated as an outsider. People celebrated Him when they thought He was fighting their enemies for them, but not long after, those who saw Him as a threat killed Him. There's a scene in Man of Steel where Clark tells the Feds, ""You're scared of me because you can't control me. You don't, and you never will, but that doesn't mean I'm your enemy."" Superman wearing handcuffs during this scene is a stark image as he surrenders himself to mankind. They are only able to do to him what he allows them to do. Do you see the symbolism? In the scene where the symbolism is most obvious, Jar-El tells Kal that he can save Lois, and also that he can save everyone. Superman then proceeds to float away with his arms spread wide and his feet together in an obvious picture of the Savior on the cross. He's also 33 in this movie. Jesus was 33 when He was crucified. As someone of the faith myself, I thought all of this symbolism was beautiful and very creatively and expertly filmed and written into the story. Hollywood isn't always very kind or fair to people of the faith, so it's refreshing and moving to see such Christian symbolism in such a big movie.Man of Steel is much more than a simple superhero movie. I think people struggle to understand why Zack Snyder has such a big fan base and why they fight for his vision for DC movies. Man of Steel is a perfect picture of why. He so thoughtfully and passionately poured so much depth and beauty into this movie. He handled it with such care. He deserved the chance to finish what he started.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

On the contrary it wasn't spoiled with the romance that took the domination in the prequel and with the trending excessive love stories that strip off the excitement from today's superhero movies. It was filled with exactly the right amount of action like it should be, because it is a Superman movie and should be like this. I wasn't expecting that much, because, honestly, Superman Returns bored me to death. Special effects were stunning. For the money that was put in this movie (220 million $), it is noticeable that most of the money went to the production of visual effects. Zack Snyder makes big action available in his movies, which tend to have respectable production values and stunning visuals. However, he always keeps the character and the story development behind and we are somehow used to it. It is a kind of movie in which you don't expect a beheading twist, you simple watch it as an average Hollywood action/blockbuster. As I said, I didn't expected it to be the movie of the year, but the selection of the actors could have been improved. Russell Crowe and Amy Adams gave their best and they are excellent, experienced actors, but other actors were just average and below. Probably it's because the most of the budget was given for production and smaller amount for actors. Also, I have to mention that the soundtrack was very good, especially in the finale. Considering all this facts, I give it 7 stars.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Seriously, more buildings getting destroyed than a Godzilla movie. After about 30 minutes of watching Superman et. Al crash into buildings, it kinda loses its flavor. Most renditions of Superman have him purposely & consciously avoiding battles in cities & around people to minimize civilian casualties, but this one steers for them. I suppose they had to find a way to compete with the Avengers for greatest battle laying waste to a metropolis.I didn't mind the different version of Lois & Clark, the unique take on the backstory was interesting, but shortly after establishing the backstory this film veers hard into the ""mindless action"" persuasion of superhero movies, a. La Marvel. It's far from the best rendition of Superman. For a more nuanced take on the character, try Superman & Lois. This film flirts with the idea of Clark being a role model for humanity, but it's both shallow and hit over the head of the audience quite hard. Other versions show him really grapple with what that means and how to live a moral life and use his abilities for the betterment of mankind. Even Smallville had a more complex take on the character. This is more of ""Superman fights bad guys"" for half of its runtime.I truly don't understand all the praise in these reviews. Many sound like they were written by teenagers. The movie wasn't bad as a mindless blockbuster or popcorn flick, but Citizen Kane it is not.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And it saddens me to see the ratings of this film continue to drop. Most bad reviews I have read complain about not enough romance too action packed and too serious. To those viewers I would just like to apologize for them not having their expectations of a ""The Notebook"" version of Superman met. If I'm going to see a movie directed by Zack Snyder I'm not planning on seeing a romance film. Especially if that film is a Superman remake. I thought the action scenes were great, I felt Cavill played the role of Superman very well, and i honestly enjoyed it! I mean good God after how awful Superman returns was can this movie not be appreciated?!? It wasn't the best superhero movie ever, it was not even comparable to the greatness of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, but I thought it definitely could have been a lot worse and I can easily say it was thoroughly enjoyed by myself and lived up to my expectations. It's worth seeing. I would watch it again without hesitation. It disappoints me that it was over-analyzed and critics decided and several viewers decided to pick out EXTREME specifics instead of just enjoying the movie. I feel this is an issue with several movies in our days. Movies are made to entertain, not to hate and pick on every little detail that means next to nothing. So say what you will about this movie, but i enjoyed it very much and think it is worth seeing.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

My question is: hope for what? What hope is there in a society where its entire population is cloned and predestined to become whatever the high council decides for them? At the end of the movie, I've decided that it simply represents hope for movie makers to milk more money out of our beloved Superhero, through ticket sales and product placements.Quite fittingly, this incarnation of Superman seems both immortal and mortal at the same time - immortal because character development is so poor and shallow that the minimal amount of human/mortal quality feels either fake or it got totally lost in the chaos of the CGI effects; and mortal because Zack Snyder was actually able to murder Superman.(I used to like Snyder, starting from the remake of The Dawn of The Dead and then 300. I did not even mind Watchmen and Sucker Punch, but his credibility as a creative director has really taken a big hit for me this time.) I wonder when big name directors can turn around and realize that the overused dark and gritty tone does not always make a movie more realistic and suited for adults. It only makes it more like video game graphics.This is by no means a horrible movie. I sat through the whole movie without much of a yawn and there were even a few ""close to memorable"" moments. Unfortunately, that is about all the good things I can say about it.Simply put, there is just nothing spectacular about this movie that I can remember to recommend it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is the first time someone tried to do something different with Superman in film, we only had the Reeve era as Superman and Superman Returns, a nostalgic take on that same era. Giving to us a conflicted Superman, bringing him to the real world, and forcing him in situations he hadn't been before in previous movies, is a bold move. I tought every narrative choice, even the polemic ones, were great and it had a purpose, built Superman persona, and prepared us to future arcs, as seen in Batman v Superman. The unique and fresh take on Superman is the outstanding part of this film, plus the cinematography, with the incredible fighting sequences, THE flight sequence, it gave the movie this breath of life, something I hadn't seen on MCU. Zod also added to this movie this fresh look, one of the best villains in comic book movies, his motivations, the passion in Michael Shannon perfomance, the dialogue, he have a purpose that drives him, the survival of his species, and you understand his points. Superman here is fantastic, this is a great incarnation of the character, Henry Cavill does a good job, while some say this is version doesn't show the side of Superman that embodies Truth, Justice and the American Way, this is not truth, Superman is driven by his belief in the human race, even if he is conflicted with his kryptonian side. There are a lot of many aspects, the photography, the casting, the production and the costume design, god tier in the Krypton Prologue, the visual effects, the pacing is good enough, among others. The first chapter of the DCEU show to us a new and daring interpretation of the Man of Steel, distinguish itself from the MCU and delivers one of the best super-hero origin story movies ever made.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The casting is perfect. Every single character was portrayed by the right actor and actress. No quarrel with that part. But the battles and fights that seemed a constant assault on the senses were over-load. I attended this movie with a friend who is a true to the bone Superman fan, has never, nor would ever, miss a single movie about Superman...and even she came away from this one unhappy.

Zod is one of the all-time great DC villains. you don't want Zod to succeed because it means the end of the human race, but at the same time you can understand why he's doing what he's doing. to me this movie isn't so much as a Superman movie as it is a Superman origin movie. This Superman makes mistakes because he's new to the job.

Especially because Chris Nolan was involved as producer, though that also meant the fun/camp feeling of Superman went out the window (without the flying abilities of our Superhero at hand here).The (main) problem I had watching this, was the action scenes.

The only exposure I have to the DC universe is WonderWoman and Aquaman, so I am looking forward to seeing the leader introduced.First let me hit on the positives. The fight scenes involving any Kryptonians were what I wanted and more. They were so aggressive and violent, but in a crisp and calculated way. One of my biggest pet peeves in action films is when a character is hit across the room, tripped, or otherwise incapacitated momentarily, and their opponent uses it as time to drop witty lines or pace menacingly. In Man of Steel, the Kryptonians would knock their opponent to the ground and instantly divebomb them and continue to pummel them. This action style alongside the classic Snyder shaky zoom cam were certainly the highlights.The negatives included a mildly lacking story, poor first half pacing, and an awful casting of the antagonist. The biggest crime was whoever styled the antagonist, outfitting him with the most ratty goatee I have seen in a movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"","","Superman is a welcome addition to the list of recently rebooted superheroes. It's worth catching this flight once.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816331/?ref_=tt_urv","sashank_kini-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14156875/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2013","Superman is a welcome addition to the list of recently rebooted superheroes that includes Spiderman (where Andrew Garfield replaced Tobey Maguire to don the new Spidey suit in The Amazing Spiderman). Henry Cavill is the young man in blue suit and red cape (without the red trunks, thankfully) who's our Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El this time, and the actor has everything that makes him the perfect choice for Superman -  a square-jaw, an extremely ripped body  and a dashing appearance. The character he plays is the strongest of all superheroes, but he is a superhero with a big heart  and Henry Cavill has the face of a charming guy, a loving son, a doting lover and a responsible citizen, everything which makes us instantly empathise with him. The character he plays is the strongest of all superheroes, but he is a superhero with a big heart  and Henry Cavill has the face of a charming guy, a loving son, a doting lover and a responsible citizen, everything which makes us instantly empathise with him. It takes Zack Snyder an entire film to establish Cavill as the harmless, bespectacled office employee Clark Kent, yet we already get to see our Superman saving the whole world from total destruction in Snyder's Man of Steel. My concern here is that when Snyder keeps the stakes so high in the first film itself, how will this franchise (everybody knows there are two more films to come in the near future, and then a similar reboot) move to a whole new level in the sequels? That is what troubles when I see the recent 'saving the whole wide world' trend in superhero movies. There was a time when common people ( i.e. Everyone excluding the Superhero and his nemesis) had some powers of their own but now it seems everyone has little job except to be attacked until their Superhero finally rescues them. Man of Steel had me wondering that when human beings on earth could use their technology and knowledge to create televisions, skyscrapers etc, why do they fall completely helpless a race from Krypton, whose world looks quite barren compared to Earth, invades them? Apart from this, I've observed that CGI has upscaled the level of calamity to a 11 out of 10 and nobody really bothers about property destruction worth billions of dollars in Superhero movies; in Man of Steel, it seems as though the CGI team invaded the sets of the film as the second half was being shot, drove out Snyder from his chair and took over until the very end. Half the city is blown to pieces with skyscrapers tumbling like a house of cards, and still everything turns fine just like before the moment good wins over evil. Wouldn't it take months or maybe years for redevelopment of a city, but no one pays attention to that!In spite of these grumblings, I found myself liking Man of Steel more than the other Superhero blockbusters released this year like The Ironman 3. While director Snyder falters during the action sequences (he similarly botched up the nearly unbearable Sucker Punch), he is able to film the flashback sequences well, which form the core emotional content in the film.While the first half of Man of Steel is entirely taken up in building the plot, going back and forth in time to give much insight on Clark's childhood and boyhood, the second half is taken over by a non-stop chain of action sequences. Something's going on everywhere and you feel quite disoriented because the first half did a commendable job of holding you in.There is little to write about the second half except 'Noise! Blasts! Destruction! Noise! Noise!!' and the sequences are not as smart as those in Tobey Maguire's Spiderman;   Spiderman could use his web to ingeniously trap his enemies, while all Superman can do is 'Pow! Pow! X-Ray Vision!'. And while I do commend Lois' tenacity, I thought her character seemed a little too over-zealous; take the scene where Zod asks the army to hand over Lois and she says 'I'll go' like she's going shopping. I would've wet my pants had I been in such a position.Still, still, still I do believe this movie works. It's sequels should scale down the scope and scale action and restrict to the destruction of New York or whichever place they're shooting in, instead of 'World destruction'. Maybe Superman should think twice before destroying property, and the sequels could have more sequences that show him saving a specific group of people (like Spiderman saving passengers on a runaway train in the brilliant Spiderman 2). This film has its moments, like the part where Superman finds out his true identity and soars across land and seas in his newly obtained suit. The first half soars in the same way; the second half spirals unsteadily but lands safely in the end. It's worth catching this flight once.Read the whole review on http://sashankkini.wordpress.com/.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now the idea is that though they report this child as having insane strength and odd behavior, he attempts to blend in with the crowd. The issue here, I feel, is they really lack the sentimental sensibility of the '78 Superman. The casting is off. Kevin Costner is no Pa Kent. And Diane Lane is no Martha. But the most glaring issue is Henry Cavil as the titular character. Superman, is a true innocent. The way Christopher Reeve played him was pitch perfect. Sweet, clumsy and endearing. Unfortunately, the too-cool-for-school crowd seems to think this version needs him to be Conan. Director Zack Snyder OR Henry doesn't seem to think that wholesomeness is modern day digestible. So the result is a harder edge version which seems off-putting. I'm not saying they needed to ape Reeve's version, but I was very saddened to see Clark not be that Kansas kid. Ideally, Cavil probably should've spent time in Kansas to see how they really are like. But again, it's most likely the time period. Pushed up to the 90's, according to the music choice.I also think Russell Crowe's Jor-El seemed too...forced. Marlon Brando had a presence that played better for making declarative statements. In Crowe's version, he seemed to be re-enacting ""Gladiator"" His harder edge was simply to match Michael Shannon's General Zod (he is no Terence Stamp).I don't know, perhaps I'm too married to the best one.The story itself is great though. Trying for the survival of Krypton whilst debating Earth's existence is fascinating. And done really well. The structure of that story was fantastic! And I'm sure much debate will be held of the end battle between Superman and Zod.The film runs a little too long. The city battle scene gives you too much time to realize the absolute destruction of Metropolis and all the people who perished during the melee. It hurts the stomach to realize how much was destroyed. Just because you have CG doesn't mean you need to use it. And sure, they address this in ""Superman v. Batman"" but still...a small moment where Superman calls Zod out of the city to do battle may have been a better choice. There is also the conversation about Superman as an alien. And because of his power, would he be their enemy? They brush past this because they knew they would address it in other installations. So it seemed trivia. Especially the end. After all the destruction, an inserted scene (felt like) of a general explaining why they are spying on him or his whereabouts. This seemed to fit better probably earlier in the movie.Any way, it's a really solid Superman. But just had a few nagging thoughts while watching.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I watched Man of Steel numerous times shortly after its 2013 release, and it's as good today as it was in 2013. Very entertaining from start to finish. Not a dull moment. Flows beautifully from beginning to end, begins beautifully and has an incredible action-packed ending. Even if you were a die-hard fan of the 1980s Superman originals, Man of Steel is an entirely new, darker and more exciting experience compared to the originals.Zack Snyder created a masterpiece with this film. Amy Adams is an excellent Lois Lane, Henry Cavill fits the Superman role like a glove. Russell Crowe is the perfect Jor-El, and Diane Lane/Kevin Costner further add to the excellence of the acting and cast of this movie. Man of Steel is up near the top of my favorite DC movies. It's the most polished, best scripted/acted, and most action-packed of any of the DC movies, in my opinion. I grew up as a kid watching Superman in the 1980s, and Man of Steel blew me away almost 30 years later. This adaptation of Superman is the by and large above the rest. One of the most rewarding aspects of this film was watching my oldest son fall in love with this movie when he was just 6 years old. It remains one of his favorites to this day, as a 13 yr old.Bravo and well-done to Zack Snyder and the entire cast of Man of Steel. It's a Legendary film. If you haven't seen, rent it asap. I have not rated a film on IMDB as a 10 until this review, Man of Steel is well deserving of it.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

When I heard that Nolan is involved with the writing of the movie, I expected a great deal from his new Superhero venture. The movie started out with a good origin background and great promise, but ultimately the flaws and screenplay made me lose interest in the movie. Some flaws in the development of the character and story are so glaring & ridiculous - 1> The day Clark Kent gets to know the details of his origins, the next day the whole earth becomes aware of it as well. 2> Lois Lane knows Superman's identity from the very beginning, and Clark joins the 'The Daily Planet' much later. 3> The whole movie turned out to be more about General Zod than about Superman. 4> And in this version, Superman didn't give a damn about the destruction and lives; he never tries to take the fight outside Metropolis, instead he slams the aliens into skyscrapers.Henry Cavill looked great as Clark Kent/ Superman, but there wasn't much to act.

Two and a half hours of superficial, overblown, CGI packed nonsense that fails spectacularly to make an emotional connection with the viewer in the first hour and thereafter settles for mindless action, the film is worse than I expected—and I never expected it to be good.The special effects employed in 1978's Superman The Movie might have been crude in comparison to the spectacular mayhem presented here, but as an overall experience, the Christopher Reeve film wins hands down, director Richard Donner giving his audience humour, pathos and a genuine sense of awe, helped in no small part by the wonderful John Williams score; Snyder achieves only boredom, his huge explosions and random destruction rapidly becoming extremely tedious.Tall, muscular and handsome, Henry Cavill makes for an impressive Supes (even in his dingy 21st century version of the iconic costume), Michael Shannon is suitably imposing as General Zod, and although Amy Adams is miscast as feisty reporter Lois Lane, I never complain when she is on-screen. But as hard as the cast might try, the magic is simply not there, David S. Goyer's plot-hole ridden script and Snyder's soul-less direction making this as bad as, if not worse than, Superman Returns (2006).4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for Ms. Adams—who is as lovely as always—and that bad-ass, dark-haired Kryptonian chick, both of whom helped prevent me from dozing off.***EDIT*** I've changed my mind, this is only worth a 4 at best.","27 out of 61 found this helpful.

Its only redeeming quality is the fact that Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are great actors in any setting. Too bad even that can't save this movie. The second half of this movie plays out like a moody and idiotic video game. The changes they made to cannon are annoying but not half as annoying as the terrible story they tried to hammer home as better than the Superman mythos we already know. Is that arrogance to think they knew better or stupidity? Either way, this is just a bad movie experience, period.Sometimes updates on old stories work out wonderfully. Batman Begins and Incredible Hulk, for example, got a lot of things right and are great examples. They help make the reboot idea a good one. Sometimes they're a train wreck, however, and Man of Steel is a sad example of that. This movie may have more action than the awful Superman Returns but it actually gets more wrong than right. It does rehash old Superman glory. It forges its own path but that path is so far down the wrong road that maybe another rehash wouldn't have been so bad after all. Trying so hard to go in a different direction, they really did crash and burn. Word of mouth is going to be awful from the non-fanboys. Overall, I have to say there're some fine performances here but little else to make this movie worth watching.","11 out of 43 found this helpful.

It is ridiculous the destruction of the entire city to save Earth and the visual concept of Krypton and the Phantom Zone; actually they are pretext to use more CGI and explosions.

Pictures had to begin production on a Superman film by 2011 in order to avoid being sued by the Shuster and Siegel estates for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Even though Man Of Steel is a Hollywood product I still enjoyed watching it very much. What made the difference was Christopher Nolan's involvement as producer and David S. Goyer's script. Read historian Carroll Quigley's books if you want to know what was one of the influences. It's a solid script that tells the difficulties experienced by Clark Kent when he was growing up on Earth well. But we also get a detailed picture of Krypton's downfall, a new story behind the Superman suit, and then a great conflict when General Zod comes to Earth. The story is complex for a superhero film. Even in adulthood Clark isn't entirely sure if he can trust the people of Earth. His adoptive parents are a big help for him. These scenes of growing up and learning to coexist are some of the most effective. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are likable and earnest. Costner, playing Jonathan Kent, in particular effectively embodies goodness and wisdom. The whole cast is solid though. Henry Cavill was a good choice to play Superman. He wears the cape well. He's also sympathetic, especially when he deals with being an alien. My favorite scenes would have to be Clark learning from his biological father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and confronting Zod (Michael Shannon). Jor is a voice of reason that's an opposite to Zod's violence and cruelty. Crowe perfectly embodies virtuosity and hope. Shannon's Zod is a terrific villain with a purpose. Shannon's expressions are the best in the film, making his intentions compelling. Zack Snyder is a competent director but he often fails to draw viewers into his scenes. This problem is present in Man Of Steel. And yet the film is often exhilarating and touching too. Watching Superman fly for the first time is a joy here. Though some people criticized Snyder's ""overlong"" action scenes I think that this is exactly what was needed. Previous Superman films mostly lacked the godlike fighting that one expects, but here you get plenty of it. The addition of Hans Zimmer's new music themes gives the action a boost. It's almost like Snyder is atoning for Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006). My opinion is that Man Of Steel is a neat reinvention instead of an obligatory rehash. It certainly entertains and I recommend it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It showed a lot of Superman's past. It also shows Superman using his god like powers, cause that's what he is, a god among men. Other reviewers are saying it's action was over the top but that's what you get with Aliens from another world with such power. Best bit about the movie is that there is no kryptonite in the film, Kryptonite has been getting old and it's good to see that Superman can be beaten without having to use the deadly substance. It also made sense of why he's so powerful and can fly, but the bad part is that the film didn't explain how he got the heat vision power but they gave it a lot more uses than fighting enemies. I gave this movie 8/10. Action Blockbuster of the year.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

When will directors also realise that using a shaky hand held camera is really annoying especially when the film is being projected onto the big screen.

Throw in a load of effects to keep the fan-boys happy, as they cannot contemplate suspenseful dialog or story-lines we can relate to. So many superior movies out there made on a fraction of the budget. The star-ships etc are terrible considering the budget when compared to something like District 9.

A lot of critics are bashing this movie because they are from ageneration where cgi was nonexistent. but i digress the film was great,tons of action and lots of back story and a very heartfelt plot. the score in Man of Steel easily gets an A+. the acting an A. the Story a B+. the villains an A+. and the main man himself gets an S for super. this is the superman movie that we've all been waiting for. I would be completely content with my life if i was never told another Superman origin story again.

They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders"" Jor-El (Russell Crowe).Over 70 years ago. Joe Shusten and Jerry Siegel created a superhero which saw daylight in those days. The character were the first superhero which success created a massive changes and brought new era to superheroes. It was golden age to writers. Back then heroes were pure and traditional hero without darkness. There wasn't anti-heroes like Wolverine which reminded Hollywood icons like Clint Eastwood. Superman is always have been popular character and original concept is same like before. Until Zack Snyder took the film to directing.Reboots are big word on nowadays Hollywood. Man of Steel started again Superman's story. But this time in shortly way. The movie starts on the planet named Krypton which.. well every fan know how the story starts. Reboot worked very well in Batman Begins. Christopher Nolan's name is now ""hot"" and pure gold to the studios. He was one of the producers In this movie. Does his name helped and was man of steel good reboot like Batman? Unfortunately ""the gold finger's"" touch wasn't that powerful.The cast is a-list. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane nailed their roles in good way. Amy Adams were good in Lois Lane role but like many other love interest roles it became ""lady in trouble"" style and acting was not main thing. Michael Shannon as Zod was interesting choice. But the script was biggest problem that his performance was boring and unmemorable. Henry Cavill sounded good in the hero role. But once again the the story is full of special effects and the story suffered a little bit. He was like The Terminator/robot. At least he smiled a few times. The best thing in whole movie was Russell Crowe as Jor-El. I will not compare him to Marlon Brando's performance. In this movie Jor-El got more action and larger role.The visual side looked cool but some action scenes effects went to in the video game style. Not good at all. The movie has many action scenes and the battle between Superman and General Zod was quite good but boring. It reminded a lot of The Matrix Revolution final battle. Biggest problem was that Superman wasn't Superman in the end. I know that he was the rookie in this film. But Zack Snyder with his team took away man of steel morality and ""I don't kill"" attitude was gone.Man of Steel is an entertaining movie and I will wait a long awaited Superman Vs Batman movie","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Superman is and always has been my favorite superhero. But when I saw it last night, my expectations were completely blown away! Henry Cavill completely embodies the character of Superman. You feel his pain. You sense his confusion. You see that he truly is struggling with the discovery of who he is and how he fits into our world. He could not have been more convincing in the role. Amy Adams was a perfect Lois Lane and Michael Shannon now tops the list with Joker and Bane for the best superhero villains in my opinion. The fight sequences were incredible! There was so much going on, yet everything made sense. The filming and effects were brilliant. Nothing appeared fake or too CG. It was a fresh take on Superman for a new generation of movie goers. I love that they completely separated from all previous Superman films and wanted to start fresh with something new. You are re-introduced to Superman with much more detail of where he came from and how he chooses to become who he is. It doesn't follow the same pattern of story lines that all the other Superman films does. Its new, and it makes you fall in love with Superman all over again! Hands down, my favorite superhero movie of all time. Nolan and Snyder definitely delivered, as did the cast and all who worked on this movie. I hope it blows away the box office and paves the way for sequels and maybe Justice League?!","20 out of 40 found this helpful.

Goyer and director Zack Snyders's radically re-imagined take on the Superman story (with a hefty assist from Christopher Nolan). However, those who think that even a universally recognized slice of Americana could use a little updating every now and again will find much of interest in this new film.This one starts off fairly traditionally, as we are once again shown the origin story of the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes who would later grow up to be the super hero famous for being faster than a speeding bullet and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. We see again how, with their planet Krypton on the verge of being blown to smithereens, the baby's parents (Russell Crowe and Ayulet Zurer) launch him into outer space in a ship programmed to land on a planet called Earth, where he will go on to be found by a loving Kansas couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and raised as their very own. And how this baby, dubbed Clark Kent, will grow up to be a man with super powers that he first will not understand but over time will come to accept and to use for good by rescuing the innocent and vanquishing the evil.But after following the conventional path for a time - and just as you're settling in for a rehash of the famous 1978 movie version of the same material - ""Man of Steel"" suddenly verges off onto radically untrod territory. First of all, this Clark Kent is a much more psychologically conflicted creature than we are used to finding in depictions of Superman, who hitherto has been one of the sunnier, less brooding and more well-adjusted figures in the superhero canon. This Clark is genuinely struggling with his place in the universe, wondering why it is that he is ""different"" from all the other kids and why his parents keep telling him not to let anyone else know of all the marvelous feats of strength and heightened perception he is capable of doing. Even more radically, the Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in this version, while still a reporter for the Daily Planet, is onto Clark right from the start and, in fact, pursues him to find out what it is that makes him tick. No double identities, no coy disguises for this couple (if one could ever call a pair of black-rimmed glasses and a fedora a disguise).""Man of Steel,"" in many ways, plays less like a superhero movie and more like an alien-invasion thriller, as Clark is reluctantly forced to reveal his identity and special powers to the world when one of the survivors from Krypton, the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon), comes to Earth, all guns a-blazing, intent on making it his own.At first, Henry Cavill seems a bit stiff as the man of steel (pardon the pun), but, as that moniker suggests, that might not actually be a bad thing, for it underlines the earnestness and innate goodness of the character in a way that a more emotive performance likely would not.I must also add that among recent blockbusters, ""Man of Steel"" easily has the most spectacular special effects and the most exciting action scenes, bar none. Yet, Snyder clearly has his sights set higher than a mere comic book fantasy. The flashback scenes, recalling Clark's childhood spent on the farm, have an almost Terrance Malick, impressionistic feel to them, as they evoke the poetic richness of nature. This enhances the mythic quality of the storytelling and neutralizes the cheesiness that is regularly so much a part of the genre.To those who complain that this is not the Superman story they've known and grown up with, I'd respond by asking what the point would be of remaking an already overly familiar film if you're just going to do the same old thing anyway. This is the only movie in a long time that actually managed to surprise me, and I think that in an entertainment industry in which safe and boring imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - and often the surest route to box office success - I admire artists who are not afraid to shake things up a bit, even if it winds up upsetting a few people in the process. So sit back and enjoy this new take on a famous story - just know ahead of time that this is NOT your father's Superman. And I say ""Amen"" to that.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Also, I watched this movie first day, first show and hence I was not at all biased with any reviews in my head. Though, leniently speaking, I rate it only 6/10.The reason is clear that I was disappointed. Why? Easy. What do you expect when you hear a year ago that Christopher Nolan after his successes in Batman is producing a movie on Superman? Added to it is Zack Snyder's direction. I saw Watchmen(one of Zack Snyder's better movies) only to see his direction and I was utterly impressed. These are two classic movie makers. I had expected a gripping plot, unorthodox direction, a good story and some decent action.The only place where this movie stood out was the action part. Though, it had too much action. The second half has nothing else. So, maybe good for action fans. Next comes the story. Here are the most expectations since Nolan has got the ability to make stories exciting without twists (his special ability). Nolan has written a new story but it gives up in the first half hour itself. Very predictable. The direction from Zack Snyder promises in the first half but fails later. The first half show touches of both Nolan and Snyder trying to make a crooked plot but to no good as we all come to know where it heads. Still, I intriguingly saw the first half expecting a good climax. Hopes fail me even this time. The end is very straight. This disappoints because the second half has nothing but action and story lovers like me want to see the unpredictable or at least something fruitful of the wait. Lastly, as I already mentioned, the plot is no good since ""it is never created"" - the biggest failure of the movie.Overall, this is not what you expect when you see two of the best superhero movie makers combine to make one. The Dark Knight Trilogy was Epic with a similar to comic story though gripping and intriguing and Watchmen was a beauty in plot, climax.The acting can be said about as good since this was my first Henry Cavill or Amy Adams movie. They tried but to no good. Apart from this, there are holes in the story!!! Unanswerable happenings (don't want to write spoilers see for yourself). The dialogues, the strength of any Nolan story, are nowhere except one or two good ones which are copied themselves.Overall, the simple story goes on and fights keep up. Really disappointed (5/10). I make it 6/10 because I felt that there was hard work behind even though only in the action department. Also, I feel copyright issues are likely to have kept the story down even though this is improbable after The Dark Knight.Watch this on DVD.P.S. I talk about 1st and 2nd halves here because we had an interval in the movie about midway(created by the theater people for some snacks sale).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Talk about destruction. First off, let me say that anybody who has doubted this film because of it's ""lack of humanity"" is DEAD WRONG. I'm not saying that I speak for everyone, but there were several parts of this movie (no spoilers, don't worry) where I was more than a bit choked up, and wow, let's talk about the action sequences please. WOW. The sheer destruction and CGI is better than the Avengers, maybe even better than Iron Man 3 (and of course I'm only comparing the two in terms of visual effects). If I had any complaints about this movie, it would be about the pacing of the plot. It seems to go very fast, never really taking a moment to breathe. However, this is all done to cover a huge amount of material in a finite amount of film so it is forgivable.

I would advise Tina Fey to stay far away from the new Superman movie because that is all that awaits you on the other side of the theater door: eye roll after eye roll. By the third act I wished my eyeballs would eject from my skull. In an honest world, Man Of Steel should have been renamed Movie of Eyerolls.After The Dark Knight Rises concluded Christopher Nolan's classy Batman revival series last summer, fans didn't fall into despair, for they were suffocated with the initial Man of Steel trailer upon each showing of The Dark Knight Rises, with everyone's favorite director's name plastered as a ""producer"". Anyone could've guessed that Man of Steel was going to fall below The Dark Knight trilogy's quality, but I didn't even expect it to be as bad as it actually is. Clearly, the genre has not learned a thing from Christopher Nolan.Man of Steel is piled with bad dialogue, unfulfilling characters, and leaden visuals that never satisfy your eyes. The script has decent intentions, but the final product feels like a slapdash effort by the screenwriter. Many times, I asked myself ""Are they really going to go down this route, really?"" There is some effective aspects of a superhero tale, but most of the time it gets lost with making ""spectacular action"" that it uses clichés to fill in the gaping holes left by the characters and plot arcs. The beginning shows an idea was entirely drawn, though it's explored, it never feels as interesting as it should be. The dialogue is awful, but David S. Goyer does supply one memorable quote that hits you like a bullet: ""People are afraid of what they don't understand."" I hope, Man of Steel is a simple-minded movie, with no greater meaning, because if it does have a greater meaning, we know it will go the religion route. If that point ever came, I wouldn't wait for my eyerolling to eject my eyeballs, I would gouge them out myself with my movie ticket.Misdirection is accounts for most of Man of Steel's issues. Zack Snyder brings not much else except pretension to the table, therefore fails to shine light on the humanity that lies within the story and characters. There's countless of attempts at bringing the ""man"" to ""Superman"", all that the movie has to show for it is embarrassment. Most the film is told in unbridled periods of action it's not enough to satisfy the audience and their craving to know these characters. The action sequences are proficient and they improve in the second half. I'm not crazy about the technical aspects of Man of Steel. Sure the special effects and the sound design are give-ins that deliver, but the editing and cinematography are huge letdowns. The look of the film is unappealingly murky. I did really take to the new Superman costume, it updates the classic outfit comfortably. I'm not really sure if Man of Steel was motivated to be driven by the character of the man behind the ""S"" (which interestingly means peace in this movie) or if it's epicly driven by the destructive plot, but either way the movie hardly ever advances because the lack of development with its characters or actors. Leave it Diane Lane to supply the first and one of the only touching moments in the story. Lois Lane is the most intriguing character in the movie, but Adams doesn't try to break new ground with her even though she has audience's accessibility on her side. The characters are run-of-the-mill and fail to enter our hearts. Man of Steel hoodwinks the audience into believing that it's a thoughtful origin story that takes itself seriously. When an action movie fails technically, you know the movie is in trouble. In fact, I had the uneasy feeling like I was watching a straight-to-DVD, low budget horror movie during my two and a half hours with the new Superman. There are too many clichéd attempts at being a profound, character piece. If the movie we got is the movie sci-fi nerds and fans of the advancing work in this genre have been anticipating in Man of Steel, then the movie industry is in trouble. I walked out of the theater with haunting thoughts of an apocalyptic business down the road where originality and art are dried up.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The DCEU was an absolute wreck, and the blame lies squarely on what can be said in two words....Warner Bros.What, you thought I was gonna complain about Zack Snyder here? You're barking up the wrong tree. Look, I get it, Zack Snyder isn't the greatest director out there, I'd even accept Rebel Moon was a total wreck, but the problem is that people have been counting on him fizzling out even beforehand, and it all goes back to his take on Superman.Snyder had a vision, it doesn't have to be good or bad, but a vision nevertheless, and maybe the mainstream DC cinema canon wasn't the right place for it, given the fans DC have. If Marvel fans are obnoxiously progressive, according to grifters, DC fans are some of the most closed-minded, picky fans on the planet. Anything that isn't exactly like the source material is immediately declared garbage, and Superman fans seem to be the most closed-minded of them all.When it comes to this movie, it's not necessarily about a poorly executed Superman story in a vacuum, it's the fact that Superman isn't exactly like he was in the old days, if anyone says otherwise it's only because they now have Rebel Moon to turn to in order to shut people down. Cries of ""Comic accuracy"", or ""Beacon of hope"" or ""rampant positivity"" are all you need to see to understand. I get following the source material, but when it comes to Superman you have plenty of other things to fall back on, does every single movie have to stay on the same path every time?People should be allowed to experiment every once in a while, high risk, high reward, see how they can interpret the character, see what they did right and wrong and see how it can be fixed. You can't just play it safe every time because soon enough, everything is gonna be the same. Sure you please one vocal group, but that can only get you so far.As for Man of Steel, I can't really add much to it that has already been, at most I like the idea of a darker take on the hero and it's nice we got to see what that could be like, the idea has potential. Of course thanks to Warner Bros trying to force another stupid cinematic universe, the rest of the entries would suffer accordingly.Laying down the law because DC fans just don't know any better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world.¨There is no doubt in my mind that Man of Steel is a far more superior movie than its predecessor: Superman Returns. The franchise has gotten a positive reboot with director Zack Snyder at the helm and Christopher Nolan as one of the producers. I know this isn't a perfect film, I thought it had several flaws, but compared to Superman Returns this is a masterpiece. What surprises me is that even though most critics acknowledge the fact that this is a superior film, in Rotten Tomatoes this film was only recommended by 57% of critics, compared to the 75% that recommended Superman Returns. For those of us who have seen both movies we know that is a tremendous flaw and most critics would agree that they gave too much anticipated love to Superman Returns which was a really mediocre movie. I can understand why they disliked this film because I think the film suffers from an action overdose. There is just way too much action in this film and it grows repetitive and tiresome. Snyder goes overboard with the action sequences and there is just way too much destruction that goes unaccounted for. I mean the entire city of Metropolis gets completely destroyed in this film and there are far too many 9/11 references here. That is the major issue I had with this film. Other than that I thought the movie had a great cast. Henry Cavill made for an exciting and near perfect Superman, Amy Adams nailed her role as Lois Lane, and Michael Shannon was a convincing villain as General Zod. Besides the cast, I also thought the flashback scenes involving the young Clark Kent were the strongest moments of the film. It was those quiet moments that I enjoyed more than all the loud action scenes in which Clark Kent was struggling to find his new identity. Those scenes worked really well for me and I thought Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful playing his Earth parents. I wasn't a big fan of the opening sequence in Krypton, but thought Russell Crowe also was convincing as Jor-El. The film opens in Krypton where we see Jor-El (Russell Crowe) help his wife give birth to his son, Kal-El, the first natural birth in the planet in a long time. The planet is at the verge of being extinct and Jor-El finds hope in his son, although General Zod (Michael Shannon) has different plans for his people. Despite Zod's efforts to stop Jor-El, he manages to send his son to Earth where he can survive. At Earth he is adopted by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) who find him in their field in Kansas. The film centers on Clark (Henry Cavill) as he struggles to find meaning and purpose for his life. With the help of his parents he begins to deal with his powers, but is reminded that he should use these abilities as little as possible because the world isn't prepared for someone like him. The scenes involving Clark's childhood and his upbringing with his parents is told through a series of flashbacks as we see a much more mature Clark searching for the meaning of his existence in one place after another. He finally finds some answers when an ancient craft from Krypton is located on Earth and that is when he also runs into journalist, Louis Lane (Amy Adams) who discovers Clark isn't a regular human being. His secret life is shattered when General Zod makes a theatrical entrance in his spaceship along with his crew and asks mankind to surrender the alien. Of course Zod has other intentions for the planet and doesn't really settle for Kal-El. This is where the battle and destruction on Earth begins, and Clark Kent ironically remains the only hope for mankind.Man of Steel delivers and fans of blockbuster action films will love this film. I thought the action sequences suffered from too much overload and repetitiveness. The scenes are extremely exaggerated and they grew tiresome after a while. I loved most of the film, but the last 45 minutes took a toll on me and made me enjoy this film less and less. That doesn't mean I didn't like this and of course I would rather sit through this than watch Superman Returns again (a film that critics seem to have enjoyed more). The problem is that after so many great superhero films, Man of Steel does fall short to other films like The Dark Knight or even Iron Man. It is probably at the same level as Thor, but I wouldn't say this is a great superhero film because it is inferior to the bar that the Batman franchise set. I even think Iron Man 3 was a better movie than this, but Man of Steel did have its moments and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people really like this blockbuster film considering the excellent cast and the wonderful performance from Henry Cavill as the new Superman. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A long awaited Superman film that delivers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812546/?ref_=tt_urv","YJLcool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34627686/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2013","Man of Steel, similar to Batman Begins, is a serious, realistic, visually stunning, modernized take on Superman and his origins for the new generation, which is a solid step in the right direction for the character.This is the second Superman film in 25 years, as there hasn't been a Superman movie since 2006 (Superman Returns) and before that, not since 1987. Safely to say, this is the Superman film most DC fans have been waiting for.A straightforward, character-driven story about a boy, who was not born of this world, who had the power to change the world, being taught by his protective adopted parents to limit himself, pressured to control his powers along with his emotions and use them responsibly since young - to not be so fast, not be so strong, not be so powerful, in fear that he will hurt others or even himself. As a result of that, psychologically, he's afraid of himself, feel isolated and alone, self-doubt, being ashamed of what he's truly capable of. On the other hand, his biological parents see his son's potential to be the symbol of hope for all mankind - a source of inspiration and goodness, and not fall into the same footsteps as them (Kryptonians). It's amazing to witness again the character's transformation, from a person who was unable to accept who he was...to someone who finally accepts his destiny, to accomplish things so legendary that his name in the future will be known throughout the universe. This is what most fans had been waiting for ages - to see a realistic modern age superman that 'can' exist in the real world. A story that truly defines Superman's modern age persona, his core essence - searching and understanding his purpose for being here on Earth...Another rare comic book film which deals with some profound questions, ideas, perspectives and makes us think.All the actors and actresses deliver their best performances for the film(heck, what do you expect?...some of them are either Oscar winners or nominees).Most of the film critics made a huge mistake for comparing Donner's version of Superman (which is loosely based on the Golden and Silver age of comic book history of the character), with this new take of Superman (which is loosely based on the Modern age of comic book history).Although the character's core essence may be roughly similar to each other, but they are not identical. It is worth noting that all of the special effect sequences in the film, combined with Han Zimmer's epic scores are superb and managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the film - the scenes where Clark soars through the sky, breaking the sound barrier...the sheer scale of the fights between the Kryptonians...etc, simply fits how a Superman should be portrayed on the big screen.It shows that the filmmakers have a perfect understanding of Superman's powers and abilities.The weakest aspect of this movie is the Lois/Superman relationship. Since the movie is too focused on Superman, the relationship between Superman and Lois felt a little rushed and underdeveloped.The on-screen chemistry between them is simply not convincing enough to be believable. Many of the supporting characters are not fully developed (Perry White, Jimmy Olsen,Dr. Hamilton...) as a consequence of fitting in more epic, jaw-dropping action sequences.I'm not particularly fond of the gloomy outlook/darker atmosphere that surrounds the entire movie (the choice of using dark muted colors and high contrast for the film,Possibly to make the special effects looked more realistic I suppose), it's acceptable...But, I wished they could have brighten up the colors in the next sequel. The non-linear story-telling worked well, the film never drags and it managed to transition effectively from current time to flashbacks as we see the character is slowly developed. But, there's a drawback to this as it occasionally hurts the flow and pacing of the story as well. Overall, it's astounding, epic, spectacular. It's the most anticipated movie of the year and it delivers. This new cinematic take on Superman is a worthy interpretation of the 75 year old icon.(The character was created in 1938).Many thanks to writer David Goyer and director Zack Snyder for bringing back Superman his long-lost coolness, re-establish him in today's modern world. The origin depicted in the film will let people have a better understanding of who Superman is. Finally, the people know what the 'S' symbol stands for - the symbol of the House of El and Hope. From now on, no one will ever think of Superman the same way again. Finally, the man of steel reclaims his title as the world's greatest superhero.Now, just as Man of Steel is to Batman Begins, I'm extremely hopeful for a groundbreaking, phenomenal sequel that transcends the superhero genre to become one of the best films of the decade...much like The Dark Knight, for the Man of Tomorrow.Rating: 7.5/10""You were sent here for a reason...and even if it takes the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is...You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world..."" - Jonathan Kent""You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They'll race behind you. They'll stumble. They'll fall. But, in time, they'll join you in the sun. In time, you'll help them accomplish wonders."" - Jor El","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

I am fond of of the Donner original, but it was far from perfect. The sequels to that one rather forgettable to be sure. The Bryan Singer attempt was not great, but okay. It was somewhat dull and Brandon Routh was not the best choice to play Supes.In the order of full disclosure, I will admit to not being a huge Zach Snyder fan. This film did suffer some of his shortcomings. His vision of Krypton was wonderful and very refreshing. The way he introduced Clark to Lois was probably the best version that anyone has thought of. The action sequences are second to none. The actors chosen were well selected for their respective parts. But the film was a bit over the top with all the destruction of a city and dozens upon dozens of buildings. My biggest issue was the pacing and editing. The film was slow at times and I found myself being...oddly enough...bored. There were a few pivotal scenes that were interrupted with pointless ones so that the rhythm was thrown off.Overall I give it a 7/10...worth a viewing, but it could have been better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not bowled over. The casting was terrific. Oddly most actors dealing with this American icon were not American. But they were well cast especially Israeli Ayelet Zurer as Lara.The eugenics angle in Kryptonian procreation was a new idea and a bad one. While Michael Shannon was superb as General Zod, that character never appeared in the comics so seemed an artificial villain choice, and his dénouement scene, after all that excessive visual fluff, was muddy. Contrast all those Jack Kirby inspired comic book splash panel scenes with the calm practicality of the Chris Meloni character (who is still L&O's Elliot Stabler), which worked well. Zod and Jonathan Kent tried to be philosophical about patriotism and heroism and who Clark was. But it was fake philosophy, seemed to me, or was cut short. Half-ass try I guess. ""Our viewers don't want ideas they want action"" may well have been the operative sensibility.Interesting plot point that who Supe was became no secret to Lois Lane. But the closing scene she seems clearly to not know that this new reporter Clark was also the Clark she knew as the superman figure (though the Name Superman was not itself clearly marked out in the storyline). Was this a bluff in that scene or did she get Alzheimer's? That relationship and whether she knew or didn't know might be a better starting angle for the next Superman movie than more CGI bee-ess and more Krypton origins and more Luthor shenanigans. How about some real creativity.Superman on the radio was 35. In this film he was 33. Better than 20-ish like the last two.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The big difference between them, is Superman 06, Lois Lane has an illegitimate child (but Lois walks with another man, to take advantage of his financial condition - When the real parent is not present). In this new Superman movie, Superman is a psychopath, who by influence of the earthly father, he lets people die or in the fights he has, the collateral damage has to be in the millions. Both movies are stupid, by the way.The first half of the movie, in which Clark has his origin revealed (same with Superman 78), he learns how to deal with his powers and find Lois. And he becomes the protector of the earth. The second half, he confronts the Kryptonian general, whose aim is to turn the earth into New Kryton (same with Superman 2, 1980) wonderful, the filmmakers, are not even try anything new this time, differently from what happened 30 years ago in theaters. Pure laziness or project completely controlled by the studio, choose the worst option. If there is no desire to create something unique, innovative or at least interesting, what is a massive budget of 225 millions for? What they will do? Exactly, create a project as hollow as a jar. The special effects for the great battles of destruction, in which the characters are close to indestructible and invincible, fighting each other until the duration of the film reaches the end and the plot needs a conclusion.You can start saying goodbye to all the suspense in the action scenes, without that there was not much already, because this is a super hero movie and the hero has to win and be alive at the end (and Warner and the producers have to make a profit on selling toys and action figures to children and adults who refuse to grow).This movie is not much different from the Superman movie released in 2006, the only difference is that this movie is full of destruction scenes to appeal to Transformers fans. We have the same casting mistakes here (Henry Cavill, more like a dummy, or better Super Wooden man - only with two expressions the whole movie), Michael Shannon as General, just screams and does not nothing in the story, Any Adams is completely lost in the script.At least in Superman '78, the filmmakers knew what they wanted and how they wanted to do it. Here the filmmakers are just doing the job in the pipeline (or the studio sends it), because this franchise is famous, and it is a great opportunity to make money and fame faster. The people here are not making art, they're here to do factory work. This movie here, even fails as Blockbuster of entertainment, this movie even fails even as a mere fun movie. (Back to the Future and Jaws, examples, movies that have been successful in this area of course).A crooked film, the same thing seen dozens of times, without ambition, meaningless to give innovation, and especially without confidence in the project itself. Twenty years from now, when the special effects of destruction get old, someone will come here to see this stupid movie, And he will understand why this ""movie"" is more raunchy than a Pyrex. This is why the filmmakers want to make a product and not a film centered on the story and characters. And of course there are innumerable opportunities, If they would go that way, but they chose the first path. They chose the path what countless other products that make successful on the box-office, because of that the result was this tripe.What a waste of time.For any intelligent person except the fanboys. But who can be a fan of Superman, Why? Because in the last 35 years, all the movies have been crap.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

In stead of cars exploding almost every time there is a crash in an American movie, we now have explosions when someone crashes into a building...! After being told to hide his whole life, Clark reveals himself several times during the beginning of the movie without getting any better at concealing himself. At least a couple of times characters went from struggling to control their powers, and then mastering them within seconds... Perhaps the worst episode in the entire movie was how the fight with General Zod ended. That ending was COMPLETELY out of character for Superman!!! After some minutes into the movie, I realized that I had seen it before, and that I had forgotten. That is not a good sign for a movie...On the other hand, the sound and the visual effects were good, the acting seemed as good as the script and direction would allow, and the action was good. Realy good acting in the movie was done by Michael Shannon as General Zod, and Russel Crowe as Jor-El.In the end, I would say that this movie is not exactly a masterpiece, but it is OK, and worth wile to watch even if the flashy CGI outshines the story in this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In short, a big action mess with little logic behind it (and, yes, I'm aware it's Superman but that doesn't mean that the characters' motives and actions should also defy logic) to an extent that you'd think that Damon Lindelof had a go at the screenplay.

CGI can't and won't ever replace a good script, this movie, the latest Star Wars movies and many others are example of this in the last decade. Back when Independence Day came out CGI mass destruction was cool, it looked great, now, it still looks good, but it's getting old. I can't get past the fact that half of Metropolis was destroyed in this movie, a lot of the destruction was caused by Superman himself. How will the Americans fix that!? It's taken more than a decade to rebuild the World Trade Centre site! Yet I'm sure in any future sequel everything in Metropolis will be back to normal. Oh and beside the destruction let's not forget the hundreds and thousands of people that no doubt died! Good job Superman.

Boring, tedious, and unoriginal with plot holes throughout and scenes literally ripping off just about every other blockbuster movie you can think of from Independence Day to Transformers while it's supposed to be a Superman movie. Christopher Nolan, David Goyer, and Zack Snyder tarnished the character of Superman with this rubbish and as for chemistry between Lois Lane and Superman, none whatsoever. I couldn't understand what Adam Adams was doing in this movie. Nothing against her but she is not Lois Lane in the slightest. Henry Cavill had potential but fell short although with a director like Zack Snyder and horrible script from David Goyer it's hard to tell what he could have been in the role. And I won't even get into how completely weird the Superman costume looks. There has to be red of some kind going across the mid section. It's pretty basic color coordination and they couldn't even get that right. Downright pitiful.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Michael Shannon leads a group of militaristic Kryptonies to Earth in the hopes of resurrecting their lost civilization on a new planet and also along for the ride is Amy Adams (dare I say making us yearn to see Margot Kidder or Kate Bosworth instead) as our heroine/Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane who constantly seems to be putting herself in danger's way. ""Man of Steel"" makes itself out to be revolutionary and creative, but it struggles the whole way with strange casting, an interminable running time, offbeat pacing, and a resolution which is more migraine-inducing than memorable (and also more reminiscent of something this side of ""The Transformers"" rather than something from the ""Batman Begins"" series). Flashbacks strangely are the most compelling and interesting parts of the movie as we are transported back to seeing a young Clark Kent in Smallville slowly coming to terms with who he is and what his true purpose for existence is. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner (Costner, in particular doing quietly some of his best cinematic work in years) shine as the titled character's adopted parents. Russell Crowe is also on hand (and never seems to disappear even after his early demise) as Superman's biological father/accomplished scientist of Krypton. Superman's home planet destruction is a fascinating side-board as we get deep into politics, failed science, and even an unhinged militaristic coup. In the end, ""Man of Steel""'s main story pales in comparison with its sidelines and this makes the film basically a special effects-heavy would-be tour de force which unfortunately never does really take off in the end. A shame too because Cavill's performance and the aforementioned attributes were right in line to make ""Man of Steel"" much more memorable and critically successful than it really is. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Any knowledge I have of superheroes stems from watching the films.Man of Steel delivers on what it is supposed to. It is big, bold and entertaining. This was the summer tent pole for Warner Brothers, and, on that premise, it delivers. But, for me, it lacked in many departments. I found myself unable to connect with the characters, particularly with Lois Lane. This is nothing against Amy Adams, but more the way her character itself was presented. The last twenty minutes or so felt a bit flat and certainly didn't build up to a big enough ending to suggest this would be a one off film, nor did it conclude on a manner in which a sequel could easily be drawn from.Superman is such that any film will be difficult to effectively convey on the scale of the man himself. He is portrayed as being like a God on Earth, and the special effects and fight scenes had to be big enough to get this across to the viewer. But this occasionally seemed too over-the-top and Transformers-like, and now is just one in a long line of movies that seems to believe that the viewers can be overwhelmed with an array of (admittedly impressive) special effects and explosions.Big is not always better, and I found that this lacked the depth of the Batman trilogy, and to a lesser extent the Avengers. It's a good film, but at nearly 135 minutes, did drag at times. 6/10 for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It explores a small part of Clark's Smallville life and then we begin to adventure into Clark's older life and Superman. You would truly expect for the best parts to be only Superman's parts, but it's not the best part. The best part, is how this film actually takes the time to focus on all characters and build them up slowly, but when we finally get to Superman it's pretty straight forward from there!

But here it is. After having 75 years of wonderful stories where Superman stood for truth, justice and the American way while trying to balance a normal life as the awkward Clark here is the movie that thought that all of that should go out the window. The movie is choppy, has no character development and attempts to squeeze in pure action in every second. The script probably had only 30 pages of lines, because most of the movie is all visual effects. Go watch an episode of George Reeves and you'll see that you don't need non stop action and visual effects to tell a good story and to entertain an audience. Unfortunately, the goof balls who made this movie failed at making a true Superman movie. If you are fan, Don't watch this. If you have never seen a Superman movie, then go watch Superman 2 with Christopher Reeves over this crap movie.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

I found this movie to be very well made and honestly pretty damn good.Now I do like the Christopher Reeve Superman films, even though I have not see them in years, I only own the first film on VHS and fourth film we have on VHS as a TV copy with a few others movies on it. The only Superman film I did not like was ""Superman Returns"" and that film I seen in theaters with a buddy, more on that for another review.Now, this film I did not see in theaters but waited for DVD because I guess I was a little worried this was going to stink. But I was pleasantly surprised and relived that it was very good but most importantly it was awesome and re-watchable.Henry Cavil is an awesome Superman and thank god the studio chose him because you need a good actor to play this iconic character, I have not seen him in very much but I think he is more or less starting out as an actor right now.Amy Adams is a damn good Lois Lane and she was great for the part I have not seen her in much, but she is a good actress she was a good choice for the part. And I think she is a very sexy lady too.Laurence Fishburne is probably the best Parry White I have seen, I mean there are other actors who are good that played the character but he is probably the best, and thank god they did because you need a good actor to pull off a convincing boss.Michael Shannon is probably the best or at least second best General Zod, he was damn good as the main villain and the end fight scene was a blast, I mean what a colossal fight, it got my adrenaline going, Michael was another good choice.Director Zack Snyder did a good job delivering a real Superman movie that I been waiting for years for. As for his past films, I didn't like them very much I sort only liked the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake and that's about it. But his movies now as far as the DCU I've enjoyed very much. Plus the supporting cast was great as well. Overall, a damn good film that I enjoyed, I mean, I almost regret not seeing it in theaters, it was fun and action pact, very action pact, and I liked that it had a lot of action.I give it an 8.3/10. An awesome reboot and return for the Man of Steel. Definitely, a good time, I watched it with my mom and she enjoyed it.I highly recommend it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

He has repeatedly amazed with his visual concepts to film and has wowed us with sheer visual wonder. Unfortunately, his dedication to visual amazement often leaves characters in the dust, and this happens again with Man of Steel.While I do not particularly dislike any of Snyder's film, they seem to consistently lack the emotional appeal that I hope to feel that allows me to be more than a spectator, but rather a participant in the film. I do not feel engaged - mentally or emotionally - by Snyder's style; only a sense of visual admiration. Man of Steel is no different. While it provides the stunning presentation of Superman, Krypton, and an epic battle with Zod, I didn't feel enough emotional drive to really care about what was happening. Sure it looked cool, but in the end, I didn't really care. I had hopes for this movie with Christopher Nolan producing, and unfortunately his incredibly minimal participation in this film is felt. The script has potential, but the characters are not given the time needed to really establish the relationships that sell the story. Lois (the over- rated Amy Adams) and Clark's relationship literally develops across two scenes - well, really one and a half due to the fact that one of those scenes is broken up with a flashback. We see them meet, have one conversation a while later, and then the next time we see them, they're holding hands. Wait, when did that happen? There is the relationship with Clark and Martha (an unimpressive Diane Lane) that starts with a beautifully empathetic scene that is then left hanging out to dry. And Clark's relationship with his father is effective in it's duration, we just don't get enough of it. Meanwhile, an unnecessary length of time is spent establishing the downfall of Krypton and the character of Jor-El, that while relevant is made overly important.The pitfalls of the movie are almost redeemed by fantastic performances by Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon (Zod). Cavill brings the perfect balance of charm and power, while Shannon once again proves he is the most effective ""creepy"" guy in Hollywood. Unfortunately, these performances don't entirely make up for the bland and superficial performance from Amy Adams and a very underwhelming performance by Diane Lane. Kevin Costner definitely fits as Jonathan Kent, I just would have preferred more of him and less of Russell Crowe's Maximus (Sorry, I mean Jor-El. It's hard to note the difference other than wardrobe).Altogether, Man of Steel is the visual feet of summer entertainment that it deserves to be. Just don't expect to come out of the theater feeling any sort of emotion toward the characters. That's not what Zack Snyder does, and that's not what you're going to get here.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After a lot of garbage sold in the name of movies, comes a bomb. This bomb exploded right in my face. It doesn't burn though. It excited me to the core. It did send chills down my spine.Since it's a Nolan movie, I expected a lot from it. After witnessing the sheer brilliance of TDKR(The Dark Knight Rises), all I wanted to see was another epic which would shake me again. Here, I must say, TDKR was better.The Nolan element of great villains, genius planning of destruction, teaching morality in style and many other brilliant aspects made TDKR an epic. This movie lacked the evil build-up that knits together and blows everyone away finally, but doesn't lack it all.MOS is emotionally fantastic. After the emotion, this movie is a perfect action movie. High-speed action, impactive punches and slams makes this movie's action incredibly great.Characterwise, I really liked Russel Crowe(Jor-El), his presence on screen was very relieving. Kevin Costner(Jonathan Kent) acted brilliant. He portrayed a father's emotions perfectly. Michael Shannon(General Zod) is good but not the villain you'll remember. I think everyone built the mood of the movie except Amy Adams(Lois Lane). I think she wasn't even required in the movie, but no Superman without Lois. Henry Cavill was good but he should have kept building the seriousness of the movie at which he fails sometimes.Overall, sit down, adjust your ass, and get ready to indulge into another Nolan epic.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill also brings echoes of Reeve: he is handsome in a Tom Cruise boy-next- door kind of way (only taller and seriously buff). New to superstardom, he also has a touch of gaucheness which serves him well in this interpretation.The storyline plays heavy-handed homage to the 1978 'original' and the first of its sequels with Terence Stamp as General Zod, who is the lead villain here (Lex Luthor seemingly in cold storage for the moment). Michael Shannon's Zod looks more like a rival superhunk than Bad Guy.) MAN OF STEEL has thrilling (if familiar) action scenes, a star with potential charisma and an A-list supporting cast. What it doesn't have is a coherent linear script. Trying hard not to simply revamp earlier versions, the writer and director have delivered an episodic story that's a bit like flicking through clips on YouTube. This is a small improvement on the 2006 version but despite 3D and advances in CGI, it's not as satisfying - and doesn't feel as far ahead of its time - as Superman did in the Seventies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Firs of all the cast of the film is too good. Henry Cavil is the best Superman that we've got (and I hope that WB is not going to recast him). When you're watching you can feel the connection between actors.
Snyder's vision about DC is little bit darker and different from other films based on comic books. But it's good because of uniformity of superhero films. Also the motivation of antagonist is quite clear.
Soundtracks are on another level, Hans Zimmer has done great job as always.

Superman was to get the up to date reboot film he truly deserved only replacing the light hearted campiness of Christopher Reeves with a darker grittier Henry Cavill. With a story written by Chris Nolan and directed by Zack Snyder it seemed like the next Dark Knight was about to happen. So how does it hold up? It's Alright/Pretty Good.But in no way does it hold a candle to Dark Knight or even the Spiderman movies and here's why: It can't decide whether to be an action movie or a gritty drama film, it takes itself way too seriously and when the action isn't happening it's mostly boring. The story of Superman is completely scrapped and the viewers are left with a story full of clichés and stuff we've seen before.THE GOOD: The action and effects were amazing when Superman dukes it out with Zod you feel every punch being landed and when he takes to the skies for the first time the cinematography really makes you feel like you're flying with Superman-amazing stuff.Henry Cavill did a great job as Superman with what they gave him and he really looks the part.Could have used much more dialogue than just the one liners he was given.Several good clips of the challenges of Clark Kent growing up to become Superman and what it means to become a great person that really help make the movie decent. THE BAD: General Zod- Michael Shannon is hammier than an aisle of SPAM as Zod, I cracked up several times during the film because I just couldn't take him seriously. Gary Busey or William Shatner could have done it better.Lois Lane- Amy Adams was very out of place as Lois and it showed. I could buy that she was Lois Lane a reporter or even belonged in the movie.Jonathan Kent- Preachy Uncle Ben B.S everyone seen coming.Ending Scene was also kinda bad too.(You'll know if you don't)The movie really forgets who Superman is: yes, Clark Kent was mysterious but not dull or completely unrelatable. They should of shown how he was a symbol of responsibility and someone you could look up to and aspire to be.Instead they give Cavill very little dialogue often spewing one liners to compensate.And filled the rest up with gritty arbitrary movie tropes.

One might say I'm or was a fan at the time.I watched this and I thought the first half was decent. It had heart and it had promise but then it fell into a Michael Bay explosions CGI fest with the other half of the movie which let it down I felt somewhat.With Shazam for example, super hero movie fare better when they have heart and lovable entertaining characters that we can relate to. The part in the movie - *spoiler* where Lois Lane kisses superman I rolled my eyes I'm 37 years old not 7. So things like this let the realism down for me and really let the movie down. Also the writing was a bit lame to be honest.Russel Crow and Kevin Costner both did a great job as well as Zod the villain (the guy from Tigerland) although I feel he can't talk properly he talks as if someone has taken a dump in his mouth. But overall the movie is probably worth 1 - one watch. One watch only. If your an avid Superman fan I would recommend but you might be saying to yourself through the movie 'hang on.... did that actually happen?' A lot of the way through it.It's a nice take a suppose to a side story of Superman but overall don't expect the comedy and heart of a movie like Shazam.CGI fest with a tiny bit of heart and slightly interesting story.That's what your getting ultimately. Maybe I'm getting too old for explosions to impress me these days, but as for some that state this is a masterpiece ??? What are you smoking. Have you seen a good movie ? Think Shawshank redemption, green mile, forest Gump, Braveheart (sorry guilty pleasure), the shining, meet joe black, in my opinion these are much better movies but I suppose it all depends on your taste. Man of Steel does not hold any flame of a candle to a masterpiece but it serves as a nice distraction at least for one hour. The second half of the movie ? Don't expect too much.EnjoyThanks Gaz","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The character development felt like filler, the plot was unnecessarily over the top and story was full of holes and constantly trying to perpetuate itself to the next fight scene. This is not the Superman story I wanted to see. The fact that because Superman is this all powerful, demigod kind of character doesn't mean he needs an epic film. I would of been happier if it focused on the romance with Lois, how he got his morals and why he does the right thing, because with this rendition of Superman I'm really not sure. Thematically speaking this film is all over the place, it just has no identity just lots of CGI and money thrown at it.It really has the overly serious Nolan/Batman atmosphere where I think with a character like Superman Snyder should of taken a leaf out of Marvel's book and made the film fun.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

BUT this just doesn't work. It has all the seeds to be amazing but in the end doesn't deliver. The second half just ends up being a big explosive fight and because it lacks emotion it's a fight for fights sake. The story dropped. The intimacy that began with his struggle with being an outsider in the world dropped. The grainy look of him being a man without a home traveling from town to town dropped. And the result, a blockbuster without the heart, that it promised. I am guessing that it got lost in the editing floor and they decided to go with the big stupid scenes rather than the hearty grainy personal approach.

The story in itself is very reliable and relatable. There were some moments in the movie that was moving. The action sequences are phenomenal, thanks to Zack Snyder! There where some sequences where I felt I was watching a Dragonball Z anime recorded on film, which to me is a good thing. You've gotta remember that this is a whole new angle on Superman, but it's hard to not compare Henry Cavill with Christopher Reeve. Reeve can not be replaced, ever. But there is a more honest and a bit more charismatic feel around Cavill. And Henry did pull the job off in his own and original way. The only negative I have is that I felt the acting wasn't satisfying. Don't get me wrong, the actors in the movie are good, especially Cavill. He is definitely our generations new Superman. But I felt the potential of the actors could have been exploited a bit more. Now in order to place this movie somewhere between my Top 3 Superhero films. Then i have to resemble it with The Dark Knight, which is my 1#. Heath Ledger carries this movie the whole way on his shoulders, and The Dark Knight in my eyes, is in its own class. So Man of Steel is my solid 2#, where either The Avengers or The Dark Knight Rises is 3#. Overall: A beautiful movie with a good story and a solid tribute to the Man of Steel comics.

The FX team really outdid themselves with some stunning visuals and seamless animation! You really felt like you was in another world...However, I have to confess I was really let down by the story and character development. I really didn't 'feel' anything towards Superman himself, to the point where I kind of wanted the bad guys to win.. (they looked super awesome in their costumes!) The story was patchy and it seemed to jump around a lot without really connecting.Superman fans will love it. FX fans will love it. I liked it a lot, but I feel a lot of hype was built up for it and that hype was very much focused on the FX and not on Superman himself. If you are not a HUGE Superman fan and you go to this movie not believing in the hype, then you might just be able to ignore the shoddy character stories and the badly directed plot, and marvel at the beautiful CGI that was present throughout.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately in a reversal of my usual standpoint, today I can't help thinking that I have become a member of the ""highbrow brigade"" as Man of Steel is what I can only think of as a ""placebo of action for the in- intellectuals"". For me this film was tedious, I struggled to keep my eyes open and the character at the heart of the film wasn't Superman, it was ironman, thor or a generic super hero with a cape, who was indestructible and could fly...and nothing else. Assuming the writer ""Goyer"" and the Director ""Snyder"" are to blame for this debacle, what were they thinking?I cannot claim to be a comic book reader, I'm no super hero geek, and I honestly don't know whether Superman is DC or Marvel. But I do know what superman is, and this ain't it. Superman is not bolshy and tough, he is humble and meek, he doesn't allow thousands of people to die, because he is happy to push the bad guys through buildings making them collapse on the innocent public. There is a previous poster (lyre) that goes into the details of how many things are wrong with this film and I agree with every one of them. So reap what you sew those that accolade this movie, I fear is that this is the end of Superman, this film has ruined it for the future as with this being a box office success, and the great unwashed looking at it favourably. Be aware that all future Superman films will be driven by sales and money hungry corporations will say...make more like that.. so well done Snyder and Goyer..you have killed superman.one more thing to add to the nonsense reported by Lyer, how come everyone can teleport between Kansas and Whatever city ""Metropolis?"" it's supposed to be set in, seems superman and his foes push each other through countless collapsing buildings, up floors and be back and too between the desert, space, the city in a matter of seconds, to always have Lois Lane to rescue, or follow them up the stairs and be at the centre of the action...Is she super too?You may well applaud this film now, but give it a couple of years and watch it on the same day as the classic Christopher Reeve version and you will then see how lacking in substance and Superman ethics this horrible horrible film was. Superman Returns Also was much better.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

For me when the movie ended I got the ""satisfying"" feeling and I mean its really really good movie. Don't get me wrong, im NOT a big fan of Superman but Im glad that I've seen another side of A ""super hero"". I wont discuss about the action scenes because there is no doubt it is magnificent, terrific; one of the best I've ever seen: relentless, epic, crumble building, burning .... The movie wiped out all our knowledge of the previous Superman movies and replaced it with a darker version of Superman. One of the line from Zod that catch me is :"" No matter how violent, every action I take is for the greater good of my people."" Yes the line between good and bad is just lied in the selfishness of our minds. Not all heroes are good people and people who do bad thing are evil. I could feel the pain of Kal-el when he had to kill the last citizen of Krypton in other to save human kind as much as the powerless feeling when General Zod couldn't save his own kind and witnessed the extinction of Krypton. There's sci fi, adventure, drama, action, all in one. As a conclusion, I think Man of Steel is so far the best action movie this year","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Christopher Nolan and David S.Goyer are the team who already given a different dimension for Batman series and made huge success over it, can come out with Superman this time.As like Batman series, this movie also finds the same way of human-superhero movie concepts. Even though Superman having more powers and strengths he got beaten by villain and survive the life to make success by using his powers is the base idea of this movie and that shows the story was strongly written by Christopher Nolan. He always uses this methodology and one of the best examples is Batman series done by him.Man of steel is a much better reboot of Superman series and comparing to previous movie Superman Returns (2006) of its series; this movie is very good and done with neat story line with lot of action sequences.Zack Snyder who given movies like 300, Sucker punch directed this movie with high level of technical aspects.CG is very great throughout the movie and its Visual effects are stunning in action sequences.All the cast are done very neatly. Henry Cavill as a Superman is the best choice and he has done a decent performance. Also the costume and looks of Superman as been changed to very modern that should be liked by all very much. Russell Crowe gives more support for this movie by his brilliant acting. Amy Adams looks very gorgeous throughout the movie and acted very well. Michael Shannon as a villain tried to make fear the audience through his acting. In all the superhero movies villain is considered as the most important than hero, but no one can beat the joker.The reason for reboot the Superman again by Christopher Nolan is very clear the he finishes the Batman series and tries to make Justice League with Batman and Superman combo. That's why he given this Superman movie on his own style.But this movie should not be the best like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Because it lacks in screenplay and sound effects.BG score is not at all the best. Really felt very disturbed BG score. More noisy sound effects are done in this movie. And the screenplay should not be clear and having very lengthy fight sequences makes the movie to feel bore in the second half.Overall this is a better reboot of Superman series but not the best one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story of Superman being told in this movie brings something to the viewers they can relate to, it tells a story that seems as if it is out there waiting to be told. Now, that being said, there is room for improvement to this movie. For me, the use of computer graphics was over played in many sections of the movie. In some parts, it took away from the story that was being told. It seemed that at some points of the movie, it was all graphics, action and loud noise, instead of plot development.My first thought while watching the movie, was I that I was missing parts of the story. But, while watching it, I did like how Zach included parts of how Clark came to be and his influences from his dad Jonathan Kent throughout the film. To me, that was another part that draws the audience in emotionally. Another part of this movie that I enjoyed, was it's parallels to the original Superman movie and the incorporation of other DC elements such as Wayne Enterprises. I'm excited to see the sequel. My advice for the sequel, tone down the graphics, focus on story, and you'll have a mega blockbuster.Overall, great movie, I loved it. If you haven't seen it, go before you miss it in theaters.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But years later an unknown director decides to resurrect the franchise that was Bryan Singer case with ""Superman Returns"" and Christopher Nolan with ""Batman Begins"" but then the big difference: ""Begins"" had good critics and received the love of many fans, ""Returns"" had good critics but fans hated saying it was too boring. Nolan then felt pity of the poor hero, and then he asks for help from the young director Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer once again to revive the Superhero so long forgotten.""Man of Steel"" is completely different from the previous Superman movies that seemed to have a connection (even Returns), so that's why the critics didn't appreciate much, but neither was supposed to. Nolan along with Goyer does almost what they did with the ""Dark Knight trilogy"", put a good realism and make it almost unique, a new and fresh start to what is considered the greatest superhero of all time. Of course, it was obvious that they were going to grab the usual story of Superman that goes from his birth, to the destruction of his planet and his escape to earth and later become the great American hero, but the philosophical and realistic study that Nolan and Goyer can do to the superhero is amazing.The film is not only the life of Clark / Kal-El (Henry Cavill) from child to the almighty man that saves people, but shows how he comes to be called a superhero. The human touch that the film gives to Clark / Kal-El is superb; we feel that he is really a human being like anyone else who begins to discover that it has powers than his search for its origins leading him to a journey across the world. Not only gives Superman a human and realistic touch but also places the superhero as a symbol (same as both made with the Batman). What for some it can be a symbol of hope that a human can reach the limits of the impossible being a total miracle, or having in mind the fact that Clark / Kal-El is not human, the message that we are not alone in world, both perspectives give the hero a religious symbolism.But even with the film having philosophical touch; it never misses the reality by giving realistic explanations of Clark / Kal-El powers. When he was born in a totally different atmosphere of the earth, it can give a strong use of gravity (explains the power of flight and the super strength) and even the sun's energy (rays laser eye and the vision through things). And also the realistic feel of the consequences of his powers in our world, and that's where Snyder enters magnificently.Snyder is what Superman always needed to have action, giving a grand scale to the film and to the power limits of Clark / Kal-El, especially when General Zod (Michael Shannon) the villain of the film begins its his attack on earth, also beginning a mass destruction and a superb visual combats. And that's where Snyder impresses with the direction, which in the past always used slow motion in his films, in ""Man of Steel"" we never have those moments proving to be a director who can adapt to changes.Another point to be pointed out is the formidable cast that carries the film: Amy Adams great as always; Russel Crowe that everyone thought that would had a small role proved to be a strong and great Jor-El; Michael Shannon takes a ferocious and cruel performance as the powerful Zod; Henry Cavill completely convinces to be a superman, since his voice and even his posture.""Man of Steel"" even if not better than the first supermen or reach the feet's of the Dark Knight trilogy, managed to be, thanks to Snyder and Nolan, a film of Super-Heroes that many have come to expect: a nice philosophical and optimal human touch with a lush and destructive action scenes (without losing the reality). Having a serious and realistic tone but keeps a good pace of entertainment, and leaves many wishing for a powerful new franchise.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Having not read the comics I failed to recognise the subtle references that brought smiles to my friends and the plot went down a predictable, uninteresting route.As the plot moved forward I started to regain focus and I have to say the action/effects were pretty good. This being said I must criticise the consistent necessity in all Hollywood blockbusters to destroy every building in site for no apparent reason.

The interspersed flashbacks were done very well. Music was great. Produced by Christopher Nolan? Clearly. The film is gorgeous but has this gritty, dramatic overtone that, when paired with certain cinematographic moments, have the potential of triggering chills or, with me personally, even tears. And I'm not a major Superman fan! With all my praise, the only real gripe I had with the movie was, ironically, most (but not all) of the action; when Superman fought Zod and co, it was a mess of flying and zipping through the air or buildings. Between headache-inducing and monotonous to watch.

It tells the classic story of how Superman is transported to Earth, and how the planet is invaded by a villain called General Zod. Yeah, we all know the story by now, so let's just move on.I was not really looking forward to this movie. First off, DC Comics aren't really my favorite. I have liked the Superman movies in the past (except for Superman IV), but they've never really stood out. Another reason I was skeptical was because it is produced and written by Christopher Nolan, the creator of the Dark Knight trilogy. I was afraid he would turn the comical and family-friendly Superman into a dark and realistic character that wouldn't feel right.Man of Steel is a silly movie. It's pretty entertaining, but it's overall a stupid adaptation of the Superman name. They try to make us take the character of Superman seriously, and it doesn't work. When will they ever make Superman the comedic guy that he was in the past?This movie looks great, and the action scenes are some of the most spectacular I've seen in a while. But especially towards the end, it all becomes a bit too much. Even then, the CGI is great and the soundtrack is also pretty good.The movie starts off very promising, but eventually just develops into your everyday typical big-budget action movie. A lot of the characters are underdeveloped, and the only ones I really cared for were the relationship between Superman and his human parents.Another big flaw is how seriously the movie takes itself. It works for the first half hour or so, but when Superman puts on his suit ... oh man, that made me laugh. It just looks so silly and out of place. I was just thinking: ""What is Superman doing in this film?""Overall, Man of Steel is a pretty cool movie. However, if you enjoy the comedic Superman movies of the past, not to mention those hilarious classic cartoons, you'll probably be disappointed. The movie looks great, the acting is good, and the action scenes are spectacular. But the movie is really long and you don't care for the characters nor the story. Why does everything have to be dark and serious these days?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought they were going to make the same mistake they had done during Superman's previous movie and simply copy one of the first two Superman films. Superman Returns was a rehash of the first film, and I feared this would end up being a rehash of the second despite the casting of a new Superman and a new director. To many times directors and producers fear doing something different, so they rather copy the success of previous movies and such. Well, they did not do that here and they finally managed to give me the Superman film I have been waiting my life for. I was never impressed with the Donner films, the first a high budget film that focused mainly on Superman's flight ability. The second had its moments, but rushed the relationship between Louis and Superman in a way even the comic book had not gone to at that point in time. Superman III was just goofy, but had some charm to it as I liked dark Superman and Clark fighting and I actually though Robert Vaughn's character was more Lex Lutherish than Lex Luther himself. The less said about IV the better and then as I said, Returns was just a remake. Here we are finally given a Superman film, filled with action, more than probably those five films mentioned combined! The story goes over the early stuff and how Superman came to this planet. More detail is given to his back story here as the scenes on Krypton are amazing. Zod, himself, is given more back story and his character better developed in this section than he was in both Donner films. All I know of the Zod there is that he orders his minions to break crystals, he hates Jor El and that he wishes the son of Jor El to kneel before him. Soon we are taken to Earth as a young Clark Kent tries to cope with his powers and find out who he really is. Unfortunately, things are rushed as Zod makes his way to Earth. He seems to only want Clark Kent, however, he has sinister plans for Earth. Clark Kent will have to use his unnatural abilities to try and counter Zod and his forces, but can one man stand up to an army of super powered warriors?The casting was good, I really thought both Russell Crowe as Jor El and Kevin Costner as Johnathon Kent did great. I also like the choice of Henry Cavill as Superman. It was nice they did not try to go for a clone of Christopher Reeves this time. I think they learned their lesson after Returns, sure a clone can sound and act sort of like the person they were cloned from, but they have no emotion! The action was great, this film featured a lot of colossal battles between Superman and the other Kryptons. Lots and lots of destruction. It also had the best one on one fight between hero and villain I have seen yet in a comic book film...the Avengers having the best team battle. However, while I enjoyed this movie a lot, it is not without its faults. The gang at the Daily Planet were a bit underused, you never really get to know any of them beyond Louis Lane. The film also could have used a few more lighthearted moments in it. I do not mind that the film was dark, but just because the overall tone is dark does not mean you can not have a bit of comedy. Look at Amazing Spider-man.So, yes this is my favorite Superman film. It is the Superman film I have been waiting for, one where his abilities are all on display and are used in full force. With that said, I do hope the next film develops some of the Daily Planet's staff a bit more and that they do return to Lex Luther as the villain. Just a different Lex, one not consumed with real estate or a crazy crime lord, but a corrupt businessman. We have finally made up for the lack of action missing in all the previous films so I am okay with a return to a less threatening menace in the next film.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Unfortunately for the Man of Steel, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Something the average person learns when they are in kindergarten or First Grade! All three parts of a story need to be done well or else it's no fun! A great beginning does not make-up for a mediocre middle or a disastrous ending! The Man of Steel starts with a fantastic back story. For the very first time we really get to observe Krypton in all it's technological glory! Only to see the story slowly degenerate into camp with cardboard characters from the military that you could find in any comic books story. And, then like a car with a stuck accelerator, the story rapidly turns into another brainless war porn and 9/11-type flick (Chicago gets trashed instead of New York. When your story is so rotten you distract your audience by wrecking another major city! Wow! That was imaginative!)Man Of Steel is also the ultimate product placement film. In fact, you could randomly choose a half-dozen movies that have been shown on the big screen this past year - and I'll bet you the Man of Steel has more product placement then all of them COMBINED! It was so obnoxious it was distracting! In the 45 years of watching movies I can only think of a handful of times that product placement has been this aggressive! It's also symptomatic of an incredibly weak story!The Man of Steel is so bad I was dying to walk out; but, I went to see the film with a friend so I felt obligated to stay. At least I had the sense to close my eyes and tune-out the last half hour of explosions, grunting and screaming in order to put my meditation skills to the test! I'm happy to report that even though I was totally sober I was able to completely tune-out the last 30 minutes of the Man of Steel and I could care less about what happened to any of the story's characters!","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

He whines and bitches about having these powers, but he doesn't man up or do anything about it. And that comes down from his mother. This Anakin Skywalker vision for the character is miscast. Whilst the movie has no sense for a main character, there is none. Laurence Fishburne was a complete disappointment. Was expecting him to wave up and take the movie by storm, like he did with The Matrix. Since the aliens look very similar. I was expecting great things from him. Like I did with Tom Hardy in Batman. It wasn't even close. Most 3d movies over the last couple of years have brought you in and do good things. But this one, it, there's some shining bright lights in there that really burn the eye sockets.There's more boat scene in the trailer then there was in the movie. What happened to that? Hopefully we get some more of that boat action because there's a strong that there are some strong missing elements in the story there. The whole boat sequence needed to add more spice to the concentration of the character because there's so much to dream about at sea. I thought we were getting close to sea monsters and that the bad guy would get involved. There's more time in the city than there was at sea. Which is mind boggling.Where's this island that this mother figure is talking about? This whole sequence is convoluted and off-track. By the end, you think it's over but it's not. The last hour picked up a bit and the best action I've seen all year 'in a movie.' The guy who played the main character. He wasn't big enough. I don't know, this seems to be a very important character and there's no focus on him and what he deems wise, especially in that scene. All in fall, this is not a surprise ""Man of Steel"" can't jump he just hits the ground. He's too heavy for his own good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story-line was disappointing and simple, in the style of most of today's action movie spectacles (such as Transformers II or III, or Battleship...). Acting is also not better than in the mentioned action-movie-type-sort. All of us who had seen the classic character masterfully played by Chris Reeve know that his Clark Kent (but also Superman) is hard to beat in terms of acting and depicting their/his multi-layer personality. The Clark character MUST be clumsy and a bit awkward, it MUST be something opposite to the strong and determined Superman (in order to preserve his cover-identity). Sometimes these two halves of personality collide inside, and no-one has presented this better than the great C. Reeve. This movie is totally missing that bit. The Clark Kent character seems detached, talks little, and is more of a physical character. The director often said that he wanted to display ""a new Superman/C.Kent"", but they didn't manage to make anything but a crash-smash-boom-bang movie with a week story-line and shallow performance, and muscles seem to be more important these days than acting itself. Also, American directors apparently have to explain everything to their audience, thinking that the audience is perhaps too stupid to conclude something on their own. This was no exception: Lois Lane just had to tell us that C.Kent is a sort of a misfit, someone who was not accepted or understood by society. As if we couldn't see that for ourselves. Not to mention the almost constant reference to Jesus, from 33-year-old Superman, the savior of mankind, to his arms wide spread on several occasions, just like on church icons. The previous movie, Superman Returns, was criticized as a work not as good as the classic movies about Superman, but I must say that Brandon Routh played a much more charming C. Kent, although Superman Returns was also a disappointment in many areas: miscasting (actors way too young considering the context of the movie), a long and boring story, awful K. Spacey (maybe the worst of his parts ever) etc. It seems that today's audience (or at least today's movie directors think so) asks for a lot of explosions and CGI, and a little exploration of characters themselves, and the story apparently doesn't need to be logical, or deep, or plausible, if that is at all possible in these fantasy-story lines. All in all, although by today's standards, the special effects of the classic movie series seem ridiculous, it seems that no-one can beat C.Reeve and M. Kidder in portraying these epic characters. As for the story-line, after you watch the movie (and I say: do watch it), go to youtube.com and find a video called ""How Man Of Steel Should Have Ended"". This will speak for itself.","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A unique take on the story of Superman but is it better than the original?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2936975/?ref_=tt_urv","sean-curtin-517-748378","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37417060/?ref_=tt_urv","7 January 2014","Like many of the people who watched this movie, I grew up with the terrific and still sensational 1977/78 version of Superman and the movies that followed. The ultimate Superman, ""Christopher Reeve"".The original movies to me, still present the best Superman. They also introduced the world to Superman in way which was less in your face and with a story telling that flowed well.This version of Superman, certainly had some impressive CGI and an interesting interpretation of Krypton. All actors performed terrifically and even the tech had elements faithful to the original, which was pleasing.However, it had a serious flaw which made me want to go and re-watch the original, to detox.This was the jagged story telling. Jumping from past to present and everything in between. For me, it didn't work with a straight forward story like Superman. It was also trying to condense elements from the original movies into one movie(In particular Superman 1 and Superman 2).Essentially they gave Superman the treatments given to the Transformers, the main problem with this for me was that the original had a sense of realism, with this version it kind of destroyed the organic feel which Superman carried so well.Henry Cavill certainly had a tough role to play and managed to do it justice for me. At the end of the day, Christopher Reeve is always going to be THE superman for me(Kind of like Tom Baker is THE DOCTOR for example), however I understand for Superman to survive it has to continue in some way.Essentially, this movie is one of the many 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' messages that often screams through my brain on remakes. Personally as a Superman fan, I would have preferred a continuation as opposed to a remake which while OK, was told in a silly way. The format of the original is something that makes it so special, jumping around and making Superman out to be a drifter for a while was kind of silly. Also Superman wouldn't have facial hair problems(if he did, nothing on Earth would be able to cut his hair, correct?).The simple sets of the 1978 version for me, make it timeless, they work and they work even now. I watch that movie and can't believe it's the age it is. Yes the obviously 80's scenes that come into the movie later are a dead give away, but that introduction is a flawless masterpiece that did not need to be messed with.(In particular the learning tutor as the baby travels through space educating him, was missed in this remake). Superman is not John Carter or Avatar and shouldn't be made to mimic productions like those with it's use of special effects and CGI etc. It's Superman and it's terrific in it's own right. For me, they were trying to incorporate these elements into Superman and put simply, it's neither needed, nor wanted by this fan.For all it's terrific actors, CGI extravaganza'a and an interesting idea with the terraforming machine(again though, I think the writer watched the new Total Recall movie and got the idea), this movie failed to deliver the story as well as the 1978 version. In fact it was a massive step backwards, proving once again that it's not flashy wiz bangs and all the finest actors alone that make a movie, a great movie. How I wish Hollywood would stop shooting itself in the foot and start allowing new writers into the fold. Without a decent story and a rock solid script, this is what a movie becomes. A collage of flashy wiz bang effects with story sprayed in there somewhere. It's kind of like how everyone these days is huge on sms's and Facebook etc. People are replacing listening with talking. Well here we have good story telling replaced with an extravaganza of visuals. This is sad for the great actors who probably had no control at all over the ultimate cut of finished movie.Here's hoping if there is a sequel, it will not be as jagged as this attempt at remaking one of the greatest movies of all time.Superman fan, Sean.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As I usually do, following an entertaining movie, I look at other user reviews to see what people thought. I was disappointed to see such a disparity in ratings. Either 10 stars or 1. I'm here to tell you this movie is a solid 6.5 to 7. It's not going to be on any of my all time lists. However, I loved every moment watching it. There are lots of plot holes. So many that I wonder how this can happen in a big budget film. Surely someone should be able to say, ""this doesn't make sense, we have to correct that."" I'm even a little insulted that maybe the writers and directors assume the viewers are too dumb to notice. However, in a make believe, comic book, action movie, I can look past that stuff and take the movie for what it is.It is a great ride that successfully pulls all the right strings. I was gripped, I was happy, I cried, I laughed. I think it could have been so much more, but what was here, I'd watch again. I think most of us have been spoiled by the greatness of Batman Begins. I know I secretly hoped this was going to be the Superman version. A mature adaptation of, what is likely, the most beloved comic book hero ever. It isn't. Not even close. So, instead of comparing and wishing it was a more intelligent and well written script, I will enjoy it for what it is. That is a good action movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The only exposure to superman I had before walking into this movie was Superman Returns and brief looks from the Batman comics. So as far as my being blinded by fanboy obsession with Christopher Reeve, that's just not the case. This movie was boring for one, and totally focused on special effects. I felt like I was watching Transformers. I get that this was supposed to be a summer blockbuster but forgive me if I expect a little more story from such a hyped up film. Now a couple months have passed and I've had a chance to study the Superman mythos a little bit. I've watched the Reeve films and read a few comics and the only thing I have to say is that my instincts were right on. This movie didn't concern itself with preserving the Superman charm that made the character so popular. Cavill, while physically perfect, was a dark and brooding Superman, which is very opposite from the comics. I also hate that they gave Jor-el such a huge role simply because Russell Crowe played it. They changed more than personalities and costumes and expanded roles, however.You'll find a few differences from the comics that were so major to me that, even with my limited Superman experience at the time, left me confused about what did and didn't make sense in the DC universe. Seems like DC thought that since the Dark Knight films were dark and serious, this movie should be as well. Except Batman and Superman are pretty much polar opposites. In short, this movie was in one word, incongruous. Superman wasn't Superman as we all know and love him and that's what threw me off most. There's a difference between creative liberty and completely destroying a character's personality in the pursuit of box office dollars and preconceived notions of what it takes to make a superhero popular. The actual man of steel was fine the way he was.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's been a decade since Smallville ended so I was able to see this movie with fresh eyes no longer trying to compare the two. I really like this more realistic interpretation of the Superman story just like what Nolan did for Batman. The cast is wonderful, I like that the romance with Lois was underplayed yet, she still plays an integral part in the proceedings. I was very satisfied with this movie and felt that they truly gave us the Superman movie we wanted because there was a nice blend of action, drama, and mayhem. I would also say General Zod is a great villain with a clearly defined purpose and objective. I appreciated how this Superman is really like an allegory for Christ and how he was the only one sent to Earth to save mankind from itself.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Clark Kent is a simple young boy who learns that he has extraordinary superpowers and that he is not from Earth but for a different planet. After some years he discovers that he came from a different planet to Earth and he starts to search his true identity and why was sent to Earth. The superhero inside him starts to grow when an army of survivors invade Earth and threatens to destroy it. In order for Superman to become a symbol of hope for all the people and to succeed a lot of obstacles have to be surpassed.I liked this movie even though I was never a fan of Superman because it showed him from a different perspective than all the other movies of Superman or even some series. It has a well-written script, very good visual effects, and cinematography. I also liked the interpretations of Henry Cavill who played as Clark Kent / Kal-El/ Superman, Michael Shannon who played as General Zod and Diane Lane who played as Martha Kent. I expected more from Amy Adams who played as Lois Lane and from Russell Crowe who played as Jor-El. Despite that Zack Snyder for one more time makes an average direction with too much darkness as most of his movies and many flashes of lightning which makes impossible for audience to focus on something. To sum up, I have to say that ""Man of Steel"" is a good and interesting movie to watch and have a good time. If you compare this movie after watching it, with ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" which is a $250 million average movie and nothing more, you will find out why ""Man of Steel"" is far better than this. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because it has an interesting plot, very good cast and their interpretations which were mentioned above were excellent. It's not a movie just to spend two and a half hours of your life and I believe that if you have high expectations or hopes about it then you are not going to be disappointed by it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A More Human Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3434119/?ref_=tt_urv","kdavies-69347","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62910059/?ref_=tt_urv","19 March 2016","The popularity of Superman in comics has continued to supersede every title in comic book history, selling well over 600 million copies worldwide, beating Batman, Spiderman, and the famous Japanese manga One Piece (in descending popularity respectively). Superman in the movies movies, on the other hand, has never done that well. He has never even broken into the Top 10 of most profitable superhero movies of all time (unbelievably losing out to the 1995 Joel Schumacher film 'Batman Forever'). However, Zack Snider attempts a new look at the character, and a very different approach in 'Man of Steel.' In many respects, this film is a very unique take on the character. Zack Snider took a very humanistic approach and followed a slightly non-linear narrative, in order to show us a much deeper history of Superman. He created an outsider out of Clark Kent. What I enjoyed most is that you receive the whole visual history of superman in this film, something that hasn't been the real focus in previous Superman films. His mother and father, an epic view of his home planet, the troubles facing it, and remarkably an entire narrative into why Superman can do the things he is capable of. It may upset hardcore fans of the previous films by changing so much of the original storyline, but this new film does wonders, and I suppose separates this film from the rest of the Superman films. The biggest reason for this might be studios pushing for a new franchise after the incredible success of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy (both produced by Nolan's Syncopy Inc.), but it is a welcome change.There are quite a few detractors of this film, and for good reason. The story is disjointed to say the least, and you have to have a taste for the non-linear. Many pointed out the fair number of plot holes, (mostly to do with Lois Lane giving away his identity to the press, or screaming ""CLARK!"" when she he was in his superman outfit, or the fact that she doesn't freeze to death in the Northern Arctic scenes), in addition to a lot of convenient happenings and loose ends (how many people must have died in the battle of Metropolis?). But overall, it's a very interesting film. There is some wonderful storytelling here, outside of the plot issues. Where this film really excels however, is in superman's strengths and weaknesses. He is nearly god like and by far the most powerful being on the planet, and perhaps that power would corrupt some. But he is a man of morality, instilled by his adoptive parents, yet perhaps completely unsure of himself and his place on the planet he calls home. He is an outsider, and he knows this, and will he ever be able to call Earth his home. It is his emotional struggle throughout the film that makes this movie most interesting, and not just the epic fights.Kal-El's future is uncertain, especially to himself. This movie raises the question that if he should reveal himself to the world; will we accept his help in our failing society, or will we reject and oppose him because of the danger he represents to us? (Personally, this is where I think they are going with the future of the series in Superman Vs. Batman), but as a stand alone film, 'Man of Steel' is one of the better, if not more human Superman adaptations to date.6/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Undeniably flawed, but the good eclipses the bad","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2822374/?ref_=tt_urv","delmarterblanche","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26906405/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2013","This film came from a creative dream team. Christopher Nolan's godlike storytelling abilities and his extraordinary talent for making fantastical tales believable and relatable combined with Zack Snyder's great visual strength seemed a match made in heaven for the awe- inspiring tale of Kal-El. Yet, if mainstream criticism is to be believed, it has resulted in a film which is merely OK. Well? The truth is that Man of Steel houses both good and bad, so let's break it up into what worked and what didn't. The Good: Henry Cavill as Superman: Right off the bat I feel obliged to call this one of the best examples of casting in superhero film. It is on par with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine or Michael Keaton as Batman. Here is an actor who perfectly embodies every aspect of the iconic character they're portraying. Is he better than Christopher Reeve? Well, he's different. His Superman is more real, more firmly grounded. Whereas Reeve played an unshakable beacon of hope and light (and he played it damn well) Cavill gives a real sense of why Clark Kent grew to be the man he did - Superman is no mere act put on by Kal-El, he was the fundamental core of this man. He is tortured and conflicted by his tragic origin, but remains no brooding Dark Knight. He is in every sense the Superman we know and love, but his psychological journey and motivations in becoming this character are fleshed out, enthralling and believable. This is my favourite incarnation of the title character yet. The story: I endeavour to give nothing away, suffice to say that Christopher Nolan's influence is plain to see. From start to finish, the world in which Superman exists is of prime importance. The Kryptonian mythology is brilliantly reinvented, and young Clark's Earthly journey from infant to hero is presented realistically and believably. All characters' motivations are clear and clever, from Zod's to Lois Lane's, but again, it is Kal-El's journey which steals the show. Other good stuff: Hans Zimmer's score is unbelievable - better than any of his considerable work on the Dark Knight Trilogy. It easily holds its own with John Williams' iconic themes. Snyder's direction is excellent - here is a man who has a very good sense of how to visually choreograph a movie. The performances by much of the supporting cast are delightful - Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner and Lawrence Fishburne are particularly notable.The bad: Here things start to get a lot less wonderful. The film possesses only two major flaws,but they are BIG ones. Number one: The first two thirds of the film are wonderful set up which develop the story better than any other film about the Big Blue. The last is an obligatory action climax. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Action can be beautifully done - Lord knows both Nolan and Snyder have demonstrated this time and again. But it doesn't feel like either of them directed this action sequence. No, this torturous, thirty minute long, cartoonishly over the top abortion of a climax owes far more to Michael Bay than either of the above. It is especially gruelling when one considers that all the brilliant set up of the first 90 minutes is tarnished by an action scene which goes too long and too far for me to even care about the characters anymore. I know Superman will win. What is interesting is watching his development and reactions to the circumstances around him - that is why The Dark Knight is so great, and why I loved the first two thirds of this film. The other is perhaps an even bigger issue. Lois Lane is atrocious, and I can't pin it on anyone but Amy Adams. She comes across weak, timid and uncomfortable. Her delivery is awkward, as if she doesn't wish to say anything that may challenge authority. When she stands up to her boss, she barely does so, cowering at his instructions and slinking away reproachfully. She pouts, she fidgets, she glances around nervously - and not just when her life is actually in danger, but throughout the entire film. And this timid little thing who would look more at home on the set of Mad Men than Man of Steel is supposed to be a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist? Please. Lois Lane is smart, sassy, cynical - her personality establishes her as the co star of the Superman universe because she is the perfect foil for the titular character. The funniest thing is that, looking at the story, this is how it appears she was written. Her character is well rounded, devoted a lot of time to and genuinely important to the film. But Adams' performance undermines all that, which is perplexing considering that she is one of the best actresses working in Hollywood right now. I simply cannot fathom the reasons for her performance, but it's easily the worst thing about the film. All I can say is that I'm disappointed, and I hope that Adams develops the character far better in the inevitable sequels. All in all, I would say it's worth seeing for the first two thirds alone. I admittedly walked out of the theatre with a bitter taste in my mouth as I thought of the notable flaws, but on reflection, this is not what stays in my mind. What I remember is the beautiful cinematography, the intelligent script, the magnificent Henry Cavill and the ingenious reinvention of the most iconic superhero of all time which somehow feels both totally new and entirely faithful to the original mythology. What Man of Steel has done is put Superman in the real (realish) world. They have given us a brilliantly written and performed lead character and the best superhero origin story since Batman Begins. The flaws can be fixed in the follow ups. The good will remain with me forever.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

First i was very skeptical about this movie and thought that it would be a dud like green lantern and the previous versions of Superman. But when you have people like Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan and an excellent cast involved in a project you have high expectations and expect a lot of fireworks in the movie in all aspects of the movie. ""Man of Steel"" just manages to exceed your expectations and gives you a complete entertainer. Don't expect your average run of the mill Superman flying in Red undies and saving the world. This movie is completely different. This movie is about a person who tries to overcome and understands the reason of his existence on the earth and deals with the perceptions that he has about the society. The introduction scenes involving Russell Crowe sets the tone for the movie, Later then handled well by Kevin Costner and then of-course by Henry Cavill. There is not even a single scene in the movie where you will feel bored . Zack Snyder has successfully handled the visual aspect of the movie which itself reflects in every frame of the movie whereas Christopher Nolan brings out the performances from the cast. Lot of WOW moments in the movie for eg,where there is an emotional scene involving Kevin Costner and Young Clark Kent ""You are my son"" or Diane lane trying to get young Clark to open the locked door just manages to gather claps from the audiences or maybe a action scene where Superman angrily sweeps ZOD of his feet and saying ""How dare you threaten my mother"" gets a loud applause. As told earlier Visually the movie is simply a treat to watch but the theme of the movie is the winner of the movie (Kudos to Zack's Vision of Superman)everyone in the cast has done a good job.This movie makes look Marvels Superheroes movie look like Sissies and sets the perfect tone for the DC universe movies.Two and a half hour of running time of the movie looks small for this movie.You just want it more and wait for post credit scene even when there isn't one. I give this movie 9.5/10 , 0.5 for not wearing Red Undies :P ... Watch and enjoy the movie Guys.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

I don't know, but really this disturbed me. I am a fan of superman since I was a kid, and everybody knows that Superman is Superman, and he doesn't kill or let somebody to die, but here the concept is different, reason of my 7 stars.

Night Shyamalan's. After his break-out debut with the ""Dawn of the Dead"" re-make and followed by the eye-popping ""300,"" he started to stumble with the mind-bending ""The Watchmen,"" a cartoon movie about owls, and the disposable ""Sucker Punch."" But I was hopeful given the guiding hand of producer/screenwriter Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer. Man of Steel was a pleasant surprise that was vigorous and entertaining.Russell Crowe nearly resurrects his Gladiator greatness as Kal-El's/Clark's/Superman's reserved but bad-ass father on Krypton. The deeper dive into the chapter of Krypton's demise is absolutely captivating with the addition of a ton of science fiction elements. Instead of re-treading Superman's back-story on earth which has been covered abundantly already, the use of flashbacks between the adult and young Clark works really well. Henry Cavill as Superman does a decent job switching from brooding to giddy to serious, although when he's not in his suit his sculpted body looks totally unreal. Amy Adams as Lois Lane plays the part of a strong female lead well while putting the character, as always, in completely ridiculous situations requiring the classic save by Superman. Michael Shannon from HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" is solid as the maniacal and ethnocentric General Zod. Unfortunately, the movie falls into tedium and redundancy during the ""smash-things"" climax where Superman and Zod (and his minions) do 20-times more smashing and destruction than all of ""The Hulk"" movies combined. The Avengers smash-things climax was even longer (I think) but 20-times more entertaining because they smashed things in very different ways. There is a limit to how many times you can watch invincible beings get hurled through buildings. Ultimately, even these flaws can't diminish a well-crafted reboot of the oldest super hero of all time. Zack Snyder may have just got his mojo back.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In its entirety, the film is not a flop by any means. That being said, although I believe the critics have generally been harsh with this film, I do believe it could have been done much better in many different areasMy main problem with the film is the process in which they decided to tell the story. Instead of introducing us to Clark Kent as a child, and watching him grow and develop, we're thrown in the middle of his life and are sprinkled throughout the duration of the film was blurbs of important moments in his life. In my personal opinion, this didn't drive home the emotional development of Superman as well as it could have been done. Outside of this flaw in the storytelling, there were a handful of major scenes in the film that seemed ""forced"" or unnatural. I understand this is a movie about a Superhero, so as a viewer we are expected to take on the role of suspending some reality do to this fact. But there were moments in the film in which I felt as a viewer they were asking me to suspend belief or logic to an extent that wasn't necessary. To some I may seem overly critical, but considering the highly intelligent and creative staff that was surrounding the development of the film, I hold them to a much higher standard, which draws me to my next point.Although having Christopher Nolan's name attached to this film certainly helps its marketability, it puts a much higher standard on the quality we expect as movie-goers. Christopher Nolan and his production company ""Syncopy"" have established them as one of the most clever and skillful film producers in the business, and their work has been flawless. For me, this makes me feel the need to be more critical of their work and expect a far greater standard than that of other groups. Overall, ""Man of Steel"" is a fun and enjoyable film. There are scenes that are going to leave you wanting more and the way the story is told may have a negative impact on your viewing experience. If you're looking for a movie that provides you with sentimental moments as well as a handful of brilliant action sequences, you should look no further. Although the film is long, it is certainly entertaining through and through.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Like, at all. My mind immediately went to ""Superman Returns"" (2006) and I shuddered. Maybe even dry-heaved a bit. So naturally, I filed it under ""keep an eye on"".When the first trailer came out (you know, the one with Clark mostly spending time either in flashbacks or on fishing boats), I was intrigued. How did they manage to say so little about the film, yet make the trailer so compelling? The answer, I think, lies with them using the correct origin story. I won't tell you anything about the film (don't worry), but the origin story is unlike anything I've ever seen in a Superman movie. Wait, I'm getting off-topic. So - the trailers: When the second trailer appeared (you know, the one with all the action and the amazing epic score by Hans Zimmer), I was sold. I knew in my heart, that this was going to be NOTHING like ""Superman Returns"" and more like ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Especially, when I read Chris Nolan's name in the trailer credits. At this point, I was hopping with excitement much like the little child, that I am. NOW after having seen the movie I'm...torn. Oh don't get me wrong, the movie is great! Best Superman movie I've ever seen (I'll be watching it again next week in fact!). Henry Cavill is the ideal mixture of the brooding hero with an identity crisis and the shining light of hope for mankind. He makes you want to trust him and makes you think ""Okay, you seem like you know what you're doing. I'll get back to my work, you get back to saving the world."" He did a really good job and I hope he will stay for a future Justice League/Batman-Teamup movie, should they ever be made (if the gods are good and just). However, the movie did leave a teeny-tiny bit to be desired. The movie scored in terms of storytelling, acting/actors, visuals and music in my opinion. The only problem I have is the fact that I left the cinema thinking ""Now how on earth did it come to that?"". There was a little bit of confusing continuity in the story, which left me thinking that the ending was written quite hastily (Zach Snyder even admitted that Chris Nolan didn't like the ending) in order to cover up some previously made mistake. However, as I am forbidden from spoiling you (and as I hate spoilers with a passion), I will simply say this: ""You have to see it. It is worth it.""","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It helped that Christopher Reeves was perfectly cast.It was a shame that Warner Bros has treated the franchise so haphazardly over the years, although they were not helped by the Salkinds.Here is the rebooted Man of Steel, aided and abetted by the people who bought you the rebooted Batman films.Well Man of Steel has done well at the box office, whether it has kids running around believing they can fly is another matter.It starts of so seriously, portentously even. We begin in Krypton, we have Clark Kent having flashbacks coming to terms with his powers and then when he finally displays them to the world at large, General Zod turns up.The first half of the film takes time to get going. The second half is action upon action as the Man of Steel takes on his nemesis.The action scene were over long as I soon got bored with the Transformers type of destruction as Superman takes on his enemies. I would say it was done with more verve and style in Superman 2.It was a good movie but it should had been better. It needed the swirling Superman theme from John Williams. A bit more comic book humour and you really are left wondering what room is there for Clark Kent in the rest of the film series as so much is known about the Man of Steel to the world at large.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

Now, I don't exactly know how long I've been waiting for this movie to come out, but I do know that it was a very long wait.Let's begin with the fact that Zack Snyder made this movie, the person who gave us films such as Dawn of the dead, 300, Watchmen, Legend of the guardians, Sucker punch, and now Man of steel. I've always been a big fan of Zack Snyder because of him being a very visual (and visceral) director who literally makes comic books come to life, and I also think that Watchmen is one of the best comic book adaptation movies ever. I always found it very easy to invest emotionally in his movies and it has a lot to do with me being a comic book nerd in general, I don't find it weird at all that people don't but I still think that people trash Zack Snyder because it's fun, and very easy to do it. I don't think that I've ever read a ""normal"" review on one of his films, so when it comes to film reviews of Zack Snyder movies I hardly read them at all.My expectations for this movie were very high, and I think they were somewhat met because I didn't have any big problems with the movie that I know a lot of other people had. And I loved the fact that he made this movie into a Sci-fi, because there's nothing in the Superman story itself that isn't Sci-fi, once you start to realize that, it will be a lot easier to swallow this whole movie (and the idea of it) while watching it because it is a very exhausting movie to watch. It was shot beautifully and the look of the film was just beautiful from the beginning to the end - It reminded me of Terrence Malick, especially since it wasn't a movie with a chronological order. You can always expect this from Zack Snyder, if you don't like his movies, you have to at least accept the fact that his movies are absolutely gorgeous to watch.The cast of Man of steel was very good, and I like the fact that he got dramatic actors to fill up all the drama because that's what all those superhero movies are lacking in general, drama. Just because Superman has a lot of iconic characters it does not mean that all the actors have to give such performances. I've always been a big fan of very good drama and this is a good proof that it works all the time if you do it the right way. It also contributes to making the characters more human, which is clearly the vision they were aiming for. Henry Cavill, of course, was a great choice for our new Superman and I think that he is perfect for it. He's got the look and the physique for it, and the good thing with the physique is that he uses it for those action scenes when he is Superman and you obviously realize how big he is, but when all the drama starts to kick in, you forget the fact that we have a 200-something pound guy who is crying and that we are dealing with a person that was born on another planet but grew up on earth, giving him human emotions. Those were actually the bits which moved me a lot, where I was almost in tears - and also gave me chills.My ""problems"" with this movie was that it was so fast-paced, and I understand why because they had a lot of ground to cover. But that still doesn't change the fact that I was extremely exhausted after watching it. I think both Snyder and Nolan has this obsession with Hans Zimmer scores, don't get me wrong, he is great and experiments a lot, but I don't think that you need his score during the whole entire movie even though it was great. There were some bits where I could've lived without some of the music, and again, not because it was bad, but because it felt as a distraction.The last 30 minutes or so (I think) was just a big and epic fight, and I actually quite liked it. Because if you remember those TV-series (Justice league and so on) that's actually what it looked like, big cities and skyscrapers gets destroyed and so on, so I am not that chocked that Zack Snyder did it. And I think that if you find it chocking or annoying that so much gets destroyed in the end you probably had another thing in mind for the film, not saying it's a bad thing, but I think that if you want to show all Supermans powers and push him to those extreme limits, you have to bring up the scale of the film and that's exactly what Snyder did. But I have to say, if they make a sequel where they don't mention the fact that half of Metropolis got destroyed then I don't think it will be taken seriously and that whole ""human"" element will somewhat disappear.A great movie that everyone should watch because it is the Superman of our era.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814280/?ref_=tt_urv","voiceman56","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43187788/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","The first question on my mind when I went into the theater was, ""Could another Superman movie be worse than the 2006 bomb Superman Returns?"" The answer is just about any movie could be better than that turkey, and Man of Steel is not a bad movie.If you are a big fan of the Christopher Reeve vehicles Superman 1 and 2 then this will confuse you. The producers took a lot of liberty with the traditional story line and that was a little unsettling for a man like me who goes back to George Reeves as the man of steel on TV. But if you view it as a stand-alone film, it was not too disturbing. What was disturbing was the going back and forth in the timeline with Clark at different ages and just a little too much in the CGI effects department. Why can't people just put on an oxygen mask, a uniform, a seat belt or a phantom zone in movies anymore? They always now seem to form around them.Henry Cavill as Superman was a good choice. He is his own Superman and did not try to copy any of his predecessors. I am a huge Amy Adams fan, but I will admit I did have a little problem with a blond Lois Lane, although it was refreshing to see Miss Lane being portrayed as something other than a good reporter who always needs her super boyfriend to rescue her. Michael Shannon was almost too creepy as General Zod, and Russell Crowe was good as Jor-El, Superman's daddy. I did think, though, that he watched Brando play the role a bit too often. The stand-out in this cast is Diane Lane as Martha Kent. She plays Clark's mother as a wonderful, strong, caring woman.This is a fun film, and in spite of the ""Let's put all of the Superman story elements in a jar, mix them up, add some ingredients and spill them all onto the pages"" script method here, it is an enjoyable two and a half hours, so it gets a very good three out of Fordyce.Credit Check: In spite of the setup at the end of the movie for a sequel, there is no bonus scene at the end of the credits.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If other reviews are any indication, some are having their regrets, seeing that the realistic, non-campy Superman can at times be as unpalatable as campy (Donner) kind. It may be that Superman, the original superhero, through his films manifests the sheer difficulty of translating the comic-book to the screen. We just cannot be pleased regardless of the interpretation. But to this film's credit, it almost breaks this curse.Let's take moment of silence for the many thousands of mortals who lost their lives in this film. Upon reflection, the wanton destruction that unsettled me in the theater is not really mindless. If two super-powered beings were to engage in open combat in an urban environment, buildings are bound to fall on people. There is a slight chance that Zack Snyder, a more thoughtful version of Michael Bay, may also have wanted us to be unsettled (though I doubt this). Man of Steel might actually be the most realistic comic-book movie ever made, if only because it realizes just how terrible the consequences of having a alien ""superman"" on earth can be. Still a memorial service for the fallen would have been nice--even Star Trek managed to do that.Despite overcompensating for its dull precursors, this film has many positives. The action scenes, though there were far too many of them, were well-choreographed. The plot makes the best of its absurd source material (though it gets ridiculous in the third-act), and so do the actors--there are a good number of touching moments that allow a respite from the ultra-violence. This film certainly does not deserve some of the scorn it has been given. It is a solid beginning to a trilogy that suddenly makes Superman relevant again, with a charismatic lead and supporting cast. I just hope Snyder uses less explosions next time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

With Hans Zimmer replacing the iconic sounds from john Williams and if you were still not convinced that this is a complete reboot then the title alone should settle the argument. David S. Goyer states:""We decided not to call it Superman that was very deliberate. Chris Nolan and I suggested Man of Steel, and Warner Bros. said, 'why?' And we started talking about it, and we said, 'We want a line of demarcation in the sand between the old and the new.'"" The story is one from the beginning. From the opening scenes of the planet Krypton to Superman discovering his purpose there is very little rest bite. This is mainly down to the clever structure of the film with flashbacks of a younger Clark Kent understanding who he is when put to the test. These flashbacks are frequent for the first part and are intelligently placed and edited in a way that they never take you away from the story and help build what Superman is to become. It is an enjoyable way to move through a lot of information and ultimately provides a far better impact on the film than to structure it all together to make up the first hour of the film. This way it feels like a treat each time a flashback scene begins. With that all said how does it stand amongst the original films? The answer is simple, worlds apart. While the original films do look dated and have a sense of comedy about them. Nothing could be further from the truth with Man of Steel. It has that Goyer/Nolan touch as with the Batman franchise that just pulls everything from the comic books into the 21st Century. Adding as much realism and removing as much fantasy as possible.So what does that gives you with Man of Steel, the best film in the series that's what. Every member of the cast plays their part well and adds to the story being told. The two fathers (Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe) deserve a mentionable nod but none more so than the hero and villain of the film. Henry Cavill as the first ever non-American to play as Superman, does a fantastic job achieving a believable outsider who desperately wants to understand and be accepted. Michael Shannon succeeds greatly as the villain General Zod. He commands the scenes and makes a worthy opponent for Superman, showing real emotions of hate and a sense of determination. Sadly with all that said it's the action scenes that didn't quite do it for me. While there were many, there is only so many smashing through buildings you can take. As the film progressed it felt like they had run out of ideas and just decided to settle for a toe to toe slugging match through buildings until something or more interest catches their eye. Which is a shame as the film is so strong in all other areas.Overall Man of Steel is an enjoyable film and for me the best in the series. The story is strong, the characters are believable and there's ever a dull moment. But at the same time there has been other superhero movies released of late and before that, which achieve their goals a little better than what Man of Steel has done. Still none the less Man of Steel is a good foundation to build upon but will need Superman and CO to be at their best if they are to take on their biggest foe, the Marvel universe.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Plastic, dry and humourless...A total bore","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814855/?ref_=tt_urv","galileo3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8564485/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","We are now in the period of a Superhero Renaissance. It begun with Christopher Nolan's dark reinterpretation of Batman in the (overrated) Dark Knight trilogy, and then with the Marvel Project, which culminated in The Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America etc. etc.). Billions of dollars have flowed in the cash registers, and now it is the turn of the DC Heroes to have their project.Man of Steel, a $225 million project, aims to restore Superman in the pantheon of American Superheroes, after the unsuccessful 2006 reboot in Superman Returns. The directorship is placed in Zack Snyder's hands, the man who has brought us 300, Watchmen, and Suckerpunch (these are not good films, by any standard). But wait, Christopher Nolan is along for the ride, as producer and co-writer of the story (Wow: gasps). The result is not good – we have now two consecutive stinkers in the Superhero canon – Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Nothing said by any critic, will of course, affect the cash mountains that will be generated by such films. But it is a shame, when an unlimited budget is dedicated to a Superhero film, and we get a plastic, dry, humourless product.Superhero films can be interesting, particularly when they go along with the cheese and provide us with some humour and fun: Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy is a good example – sure it is uneven and unexceptional, but it is funny, and pretty entertaining (as opposed to the new bore in The Amazing Spiderman).By far, the biggest problem with Man of Steel is its running time: nearly two and a half hours. I guess that would be no problem, if the film was entertaining, for as Ebert famously noted, ""no good film is ever too long"". But this is no ""good film"" and it certainly is ""too long"".Again, we are provided with a drawn out Origins story, beginning on the planet Krypton and telling us the hero's story from his expulsion by his parents as a baby to Earth, due to Krypton's inevitable collapse, his adoption by two loving Kansas-farming parents, his troubles as a child, blah blah blah. I don't care anymore. Then, when the crunch time comes, we get mass destruction, crashing, metals flying around, and then again, the same thing: it goes on and on. Zack Snyder has an appetite for visual flair, but that is just about it, and the flair is often, not even that good.Another point is that, many of the special effects-laden sequences seem borrowed from other films. The beginning in Krypton looks like a mesh between Star Wars and Avatar, some of the scenes look borrowed from Spiderman 2 (note the robotic snake arms chasing Superman), or the Matrix (the artificially created foetuses in those weird chambers), and the climax looks like The Avengers (which stole from Transformers, which Transformers borrowed off other boring-ass films). There is no originality here; no author's stamp.Furthermore, some of the casting choices are bad, but none more, than Michael Shannon as General Zod, which is simply woeful and plainly boring. Russell Crowe is good as Jor-El, but is not given much time to shine. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are excellent, as Kal-El's human parents, but they are given little time. Henry Cavill looks like Superman, but his performance amounts to some grunting and angry flying: Superman is soulless.At least, with a ¼ of a billion dollars in budget, they managed to design a swanky Superman suit. That is about it.""I have so many questions. Where do I come from?""","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

That while this movie was to have elements that we know to be part of the Superman canon but it was to show new elements that we have never seen on the big screen and to try and present a Superman for the modern movie going audience. I am not looking to compare it to the Richard Donner film or any other Superman media. Now that being said I feel like the movie going audience should feel insulted like I was after watching this movie. The script was weak. Character development was either non-existent, slow as dog crap, or miraculously came out of the blue (not really a spoiler: such as the kiss shared between Lois and Superman that had absolutely no romantic development between the two characters up till that point.) Speaking of Lois Lane, maybe it was bad script writing, maybe it was poor actress choice, but she was most certainly a weak character, not the strong-headed, stubborn woman Lois has been depicted throughout the years. The actions scenes are exciting and well done. The fights look like fights between superhumans. People that post this movie was awesome I believe were memorized by these action sequences and ignoring the fact that there is a story that is to be told that should be just as exciting. Ladies, enjoy when Cavill takes his shirt off, I will admit that dude is cut and it will also distract you from the weak story. Laurence Fishburne, enjoy the few lines you had and the weak presence Perry White had in the movie, you have come a long way since the Matrix. Kevin Costner......I don't even want to talk about why he is even in this movie. Diane Lane, she is 47 and still looking good, wasn't convinced with how they made her look older. Let's talk about the soundtrack! The ""Hans Zimmer effect"" was in full effect! What do I mean by that? His music is repetitive, loud, is pounded out, and is a cookie cutter action movie score(action movies today are pretty cookie cutter themselves). Hans Zimmer was worried about doing this score because he knew he would have to try and match what John Williams did. Well his fears were realized and he failed. None of his music was through-composed (music majors will know what I mean but I will explain I guess). This means none of the music really identified a character, there were no identifiable themes. The ""Man of Steel"" theme was just a looped ostinato with this repeated scale figure that does absolutely nothing. The only purposed his music served to the film was to press action and depict a few moods and emotions. The character identification through the music was horrible. Michael Shannon did play an excellent General Zod. I thought Russell Crowe would do a good Jor-El, it started strong for me then fizzled. In the end David S. Goyer's script sucked, it was just weak and the characters weak. I'm done talking about this movie. Zach Snyder you have provided a disappointing addition to the Superman canon. What amazes me is how amazed people are at this movie. You are talking about an iconic character and this movie, script, and score did not reach iconic status. You people have been blinded by some fancy action scenes and loud music.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's the second best comic book movie this year behind Iron Man 3, and when Thor 2 comes out it will be number three, and a distant third at that. It was overly dark, which a Superman movie should not be. Christopher Nolan and DC seem to think that because the Batman movies were so successful, that every movie needs to be dark and depressing, and that shouldn't be the case, though looking at other reviews, maybe that's what people want. The plot is terrible, and certain things just don't make any sense. Superman seems to flaunt his powers to so many people, that it's a wonder anyone in the movie doesn't know who he is. The movie actually treats it's characters like they're idiots. An alien ship even parks on his mother's front lawn, yet the government can't figure out who he is. A secret identity is useless if you don't try to hide your identity. It's like the movie deliberately tries to insult the audiences intelligence. If you're fine with that, it's OK, but it took me right out of the movie and made me constantly roll my eyes. This review will not be popular because it doesn't agree with what everyone else thinks, but it is the truth. Save your money and don't go see this travesty of a movie","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

With Zack Snyder & C Nolan you expect some serious entertainment. I tell you - It is a serious matter.This movie is amazing for many reason, Superman is larger than life, You can't expect him to save a car or train. He is even way stronger than other superheroes, his plot must be that huge and that's what this movie gives. No comedy, no boring things in movie. As superman is SUPERMAN his villains should be equally powerful that's why General Zod is best villain to fight against.The movie doesn't leave it's story path. Action scenes are amazing & truly justifies superman level fight even better than many superhero movies so far ! Superman it truly fast or actually faster.Anything bad about movie ? Not exactly, some may see it's bit loud but with so much of fight, it is expected. I didn't like the 3D though (May be issue with AMC), it's effective in few parts, like superman's first flight he learns which Looks too great ! Other problem is, he is limited to US only , the superhero of such a power is concern about saving only US ? Too bad.So overall watch it for some serious fun !","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Man of Steel, finally a Superman movie that tries something new","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814191/?ref_=tt_urv","pureorangeness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35385644/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","Man of Steel can be broken down to 2 well-toned segments, basically post-Superman Clark Kent and Clark Kent as Superman, pretty much like the first movie ever in that regard. After a deliciously prolonged epilogue taking place in the planet Krypton, the movie focuses on Clark Kent's difficulty in adjusting to both his unusual powers (even to his own kin) and the society, at a really young age. What we see in terms of the portrayal of young Clark's difficulties in life aren't really all that surprising or even new, such as Clark as a kid being constantly bullied but not being able to respond the bullies, Clark having problems with his powers that he cannot yet control to fullest extent, him constantly requiring to save people without being caught into doing it, and so forth. Rinse and repeat, all the stuff we've constantly seen in many, MANY mediums; other movies, animated features, comics And I think Zack Snyder knew that we would expect it, so the exposure on Clark's life as a kid is told only in brief flashbacks, when it's actually required to be told, without making it seem like they're only purpose is to spew exposition. Aside from that, the first half of the movie tells the story of a 33 year old Clark Kent, being a citizen, while trying to learn his heritage and becoming the iconic hero.And that's where Hollywood finally, totally nailed how to do it. See, I don't like Superman I and II (and, well, goes without saying, I don't like III and IV either or Returns No Superman movie so far I've deemed ""good""). Say what you say about CG becoming more and more important in modern cinema than fully-fleshed story lines and characters, but it's what Superman I did at its own time, with reducing that whole notion to a tag line, nonetheless.""You'll believe a man can fly."" The first Superman movie had the visual aspects of the movie on its top shelf, for everyone to see. Sure I mean, when you watch it now it does not look all that impressive, but you have to remember that the movie was shot when the whole ""green screen"" and, well, ""string"" technology was invented, so they made a lot of use of such to make it seem like Christopher Reeve was actually flying around in set and/or they added some stuff in post production. The classic movie did prioritize the special effects, and this became the signature of all the other movies that came after (except for IV because I don't even know what they were trying to accomplish with that). But, you know Characters were caricatures and had no depth whatsoever. Superman's Clark Kent persona was only played for goofs and comedic relief and Superman himself, apart from his flying, wasn't really done all that well either. Superman does not even punch anyone in these movies, I mean, how do you even accomplish that? Anyway, in Man of Steel, Clark Kent was done well, we have a better empathy with his morals and decisions. His human side is played a lot better, for instance we see how he acts around his mother on Earth (after saving lots of people in Metropolis and everything) and that scene was actually very cute and unexpected. The scenes where the point of the scene is not Clark Kent not resorting to his powers despite dire circumstance in order not to reveal his identity, honestly, ain't all that much, but the other scenes are not set out to make fun of the character, which adds a tremendous human quality to the character, something the previous movies could not ever accomplish. You'd think perhaps ""this is because we take cinema more seriously now, as this is the modern age"". Well, Superman Returns was made in 2006, it had a similar line of advertising with Man of Steel, what with the ""kinda different looking suit/colors wow we're starting new and fresh"", but ended up being the very same movie with the first one, with all the jokes, all the stupid cartoon-y characters, with new but unworkable ideas thrown around. With all the new advancements in cinema, Superman Returns did not even DARE to go out of boundaries, the same boundaries that a movie made in 1978 built.Anyway, THIS movie. This movie's great. Go see it. I love how it's not weighed down by the other movie installments, it is a fairly lovely representation of the lore, and I love the score MUCH better than the classic Superman theme. It is actually fairly difficult to make a SUPERMAN movie altogether, because the character story does not offer much elements and when they do, they're blatant (character back story: HE'S AN ALIEN. powers: HE'S A GOD. weakness: THAT ONE GREEN ROCK AND NOTHING ELSE) but this movie offers good plot points that makes it feel more organic. Movie does change the Superman lore a little, but they are mostly acceptable. I like how the Kryptonian technology looks in this movie rather than their previous crystal design, which didn't make much sense to me. None of it is to say Man of Steel offers the same depth that The Dark Knight offers, as it is more of a great popcorn movie if nothing else, and certainly not a borderline offensive one like Transformers 3. Speaking of Transformers 3, Man of Steel does share one commonality with it, the commonality being having a really long climax with very complicated scenes botched together. This decade surely isn't for people who are extremely susceptible to seizure inducing visuals. I mean, in some parts it does look like anime, but hey. I liked the climax, although long, because it went somewhere with new interesting stuff thrown here and there. Go see it. One suggestion however, watch the movie in 2D if available, or I don't know, find a good 3D cinema.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

""Hmmm...I don't know how to write or come up with a storyline, so let's just have CGI man in a blue suit battle in Metropolis and ensure that every fist punches through 10,0000 buildings and then the buildings can fall...and then the rubble can fly into space...and then...heck...let's have more buildings collide with each other...isn't that pretty? UGGGH OK, so I absolutely had to watch Superman (yes, the Christopher Reeve one) last night to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I was in tears over this...that's how great that movie is. Man of Steel is NOT a superman movie. I want my money back.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

I can say that it is ahead of time for which some people had problem with the tone but honestly the dark tone fits well with the present real world kinda situation and that's why it's makes more interesting.

I've read quite a few bad reviews about Man Of Steel with people moaning about it not sticking to previous versions and that it's just ""CGI porn"" (yet a lot of these same CGI moaners rate The Avengers, Batman, and Thor. Go figure).Superman Returns went the way of previous versions yet look how that fared. People even moan about this having an ""alien/sci-fi"" feel to it. Well, he may not burst out of peoples chests or lay eggs, but Superman IS technically alien, so get over it people.This is a fresh re-boot & take on the Superman series, the same as how Batman Begins was a fresh re-boot for the batman series (yet that was praised), so to be honest, I have no idea why there's so much negativity surrounding Man Of Steel.This movie was absolutely fantastic, and for me it was actually refreshing to see Kent being portrayed as a normal man. I know why Kent was made out to be an accident prone mess in previous movies, but in all honesty it was a really nice change to see him the way he was in this film.Man Of Steel is a true blockbuster in every sense of the word. The scale was massive, the action was superb, and the visual & special effects were amazing. The 1st hour or so is a wee bit slow in places, but it doesn't ever feel boring. The last hour, though, most definitely makes up for any of the earlier slower paced parts as the action is absolutely non-stop and relentless.This movie is also a lot darker than previous versions bringing it's own unique mood and style and I loved that also as I'm a fan of the more darker comic book style than the lighter one. Henry Cavill does a great job and is excellent as Superman as well.In all honesty I really cannot fault this movie at all as I loved it from start to finish. If the next Superman movie is anything like this one, then I can't wait.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

It was more of a string ""hey, look how well we do CGI"" episodes, completely swallowing the proved performances of a star studded cast comprised of Hollywood ""A"" list, TV-Show A/B list, and relative newcomers. Cavill does a good Superman, but fell victim to the flash bangs & the blue suit, which extinguished his Shakespearean acting background. Amy Smart, Lawrence Fishburne, Diane Lane, Christopher Meloni, Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner, etc. were all good, but what else would one expect from names/actors of that caliber?! In all essence, Superman is a story of struggle, overcoming obstacles, prevailing and the representation of (former) American values. The overabundance of action is a by product to the human/kryptonian rise to stand tall where others have surrendered. Unfortunately, the show-off character of the special effects, which at times were too outdrawn, took a movie that could have been a character driven epic and turned it into something of lesser value. While it's too bad that this version of Superman didn't do it for me, I do have hopes that it built the foundation for future editions, hopefully with the same cast, and capitalizing on the extraordinary ability each one of these actors has.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In the first movie, you see Clark Kent becoming a journalist. Unknown, he is doing a lot of thing to help people. The movie is around 2h30. First, it take around 1h30 to get some action with the villain. So around the middle of the movie, the bad guys arrived on the earth. Their ship is located by the army. They send a little ship on earth and the first thing that happen, they goes live on every intelligent communication system they have (phone, TV, table).The first thing they say is that there is someone from our planet on yours. And they want him (clark) to be deliver or they will be consequence. So Clark deliver himself to the army.No the battle start, but at the really end, Clark is starting to work at the daily planet news paper with Loïs. But Loïs know him, since he saved her life many times in the movie. It's like the end should be the beginning!Anyway, the actor played well. I can't say nothing about the actingIn fact there is 2 major problem in the movie: 1- the realization is just weird or wrong 2- The computer (animation) take a lot of place in the movie 1- The realization is really different from what we have back in the 80's. My guess is that the movie will be loved by kids, but if you know a bit about Superman, you will be disappointed. For me, it's seem to be upside down. 2- Since the battle start, you see a lot, and a lot of animation. They kind of focus on the destruction of building in New York City. So they put a lot of time and money in the battle scene and destruction of building. Sometimes it's a good way to do it, but in that movie, my opinion is they is too much of animation.thanks!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I say the man Christopher Nolan signature here is the non-linear storytelling style. It worked for Batman Begins and it works here. The way story information is disseminated is impressive. This is carried out through a combination of the writing, directing and editing. It all works together well, culminating in a really new kind of movie experience. This retelling of the Superman story highlights the sci-fi aspect of Superman's origin. It features huge fights between super-beings, more destruction seemingly on NYC than we've ever seen (oh sorry Metropolis), but it's all wrapped into a coherent story that should satisfy any movie fan, and targets both super hero fans and sci-fi fans. That's why the re-introduction of the Superman brand to the marketplace was inevitable. Sci fi and super hero movies are the two top-grossing genres there are.I have a couple of nitpicky questions, however, that go toward the Superman story in general. The first will become more of an issue as the years go by and it is: Why do the people of Krypton look exactly like humans? Humans who all look like they're from Kansas? And here is the biggest issue with the people of Krypton all looking like they're from Kansas: The coincidence of the spaceship containing Krypton's last son LANDING IN KANSAS. This issue will never be resolved because the Superman story is too old and too beloved to be altered.Next question: Why does Superman have muscles? Simple answer is that he's strong, right? How can he be strong without muscles? Well in both Superman 2 (the half-Richard Donner one) and in Man of Steel, we have super villains with less muscle than Superman who seem to be faster and stronger than our hero. The explanation has to do with Earth being closer to its sun than Krypton was and having a different gravitational force as well (which really actually answers little). So then, back to the original question: Why would Clark Kent/Superman have muscles? How would he have even developed muscles? It would be like Neal Armstrong living on the moon and lifting weights there and expecting to develop muscles. He'd have to lift cars instead of dumbbells. So I just don't get it.Still, all that aside, I was entertained.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Movies that are excellent tend to garner high marks on both fronts; why wasn't this one? As a fan of Superman, I didn't let it stop me, and I went to enjoy it with my girlfriend in an IMAX 3D theater. She wasn't happy with me by the end of the film. Different types of fans, different audiences, will love or hate the movie. As a fan, I say it is worth watching only once. The fighting scenes are hard to bare as the camera quickly pans over large areas to keep focus on the protagonists as they quickly and violently move through space. As a viewer, focusing required a proactive effort that left me tired. The visuals aren't all that bad - the scenes on Krypton are quite beautiful, and I read somewhere the Krypton style is Gothic meets Organic/Natural, and I agree. As for plot...it's been done and re-done and it's not what is interesting. The action is more interesting than the story; but what the focus should be on is Superman's development and that... unfortunately... was scattered and shallow. The director tried to explore far too much in far too little time and as a result, the audience is left feeling frustrated. Fans of Smallville will agree with me as they won't be satisfied with the few scenes highlighting the humanizing internal struggle Clark Kent went through growing up. That being said the movie is worth watching. The director made a valiant effort to bring to life a super-god-super-hero. (the only super hero to go to the edge of the universe and back). It's really hard to convey the amazingness of superman on screen - he is a hero fit only for the comic book where creative freedom is such that one can really explore the limits of the possible for a god.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Origins and Action, Rejoice for The New Age Of Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814729/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","It's a bird, It's a plane, no it's another movie review from yours truly. As you can tell from the opening, my review is on the latest Superman movie, a project many of my friends have waited for since it's trailer debuted about a year ago. Now if you are like me, you have grown up with various media of the caped hero from the comic books and cartoon series to the real life films and Smallville. With such a broad range of media though, one may wonder just how they can make another new story, especially when the last movie failed to meet many expectations. I'm Robbie K and I'm here to give you the scoop on the latest hero movie.Man of Steel (MOS) starts off exactly as a Superman beginning should with a shot of Krypton that last more than five seconds. From the get go the beautiful computer graphic imaging has designed an exciting opening that not only introduces Kal-El (Henry Cavill), but gives us a glimpse of the world he was forced to leave. The opening left me feeling confident in the coming action, and set up the bad guy and story in an exciting manner that had me hooked. Now you might be thinking, the momentum from strong openings is often lost within seconds of a movie, and I would agree with that statement. MOS however, doesn't, or at least minimizes the loss, by balancing Kal's, now Clark's, past with the present day. Instead of getting a 30-60 minute montage of him growing up, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan chose to use flashbacks of his childhood, often integrating them at parts that either answered Lois Lane's (Amy Adams) questions, or served as a portrayal of the struggle Clark had to face. I liked this approach, as it allowed for us to see Clark grow up without getting a slow extra hour added to an already 2 hour film. This approach also worked on another level by keeping Lois involved in the story. Let's face it in most of the movies, TV shows, and comics she primarily is a damsel in distress who only serves to drive Superman's emotions and be leverage as a hostage. In this movie, Lois' reporting skills help chip away at the suppressed emotions/and story of the man of steel. After getting past the formalities she actually does other things that make her a much stronger character than in the past, which is always a plus for me. The rest of the story is then well driven, showing the evolution of a reluctant man changing into the icon of hope for Metropolis.Despite the developed and driving story I'm sure there is something else people want to know about, the action. Well with the last Superman movie relying on stereotypical flying, holding up crashing buildings, and stationary combat it was hard to get excited about this film. This movie has revamped the fighting to finally push out of the slow 90's style and gives it a modern style that I welcomed with open arms. Both hero and bad guy go toe to toe using their superb strength to deck it out in fast action that is surprisingly caught well on camera. Another positive factor to throw at you is that the contest isn't an isolated event like some movies seem to abuse. Instead the battle has both parties interacting with the environment, using both living and non-living obstacles to force the combatants to adapt to the situation and use the situations to their advantage. Throw that in with the heroic music and sound effects and you get a number of sequences that get the blood pumping and the crowd cheering.Perhaps the last topic I have room/time to mention are the characters of this film. As mentioned earlier Lois has a much deeper role in this movie other than a damsel in distress. This might be due to Amy Adams strong personality, but I liked the involvement she had, though maybe not the accustomed look. The approach they took with Clark in this movie was also a welcomed change for me, because he actually had qualities that made him a more believable character than another hero knock off. This realism made the character more relevant and made the situations more dire because he wasn't a perfect being who severed all human emotions and attachments. Plus, it was nice to see the morally perfect, holier than that attitude dropped which although admirable has been overdone. Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) was also a fun character to watch due to the balanced nature they took with him. At the beginning he seems a bit of a stiff who can kick butt in the pursuit of his noble goals. However, as the movie continues we get to see that attitude applied in other ways, from teaching lessons and showing love, to subtle comedy in the delivery of lines that breaks up some of the tension. The villains are not bad either, there moves are certainly impressive, but General Zod (Michael Shannon) was not as balanced as I would have liked to see. More so an egotistical general who screamed more than led, Zod was at least combat ready for this film and not a pansy as some other villains have proved to be. As for the other characters they are good, but I have to wrap things up.Man of Steel was a large improvement over the other superhero movie I saw this summer. Action, excitement, relevant characters, and so much more was wrapped into a movie that was entertaining and fun to watch. Yes, there is a bit of a drag at parts, and some of the issues he deals with take a little bit longer than I care to see, but these are minor changes. So I say this in caps, SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But in our case, this version of Clark Kent/Superman has been reconstructed by the modern society we live in 21st century, things are no merry-go-round as they never used to be, so in this instance it's about removing Superman from his reality and bringing him into ours, we then see that humans are not so forthcoming to receiving help no matter who it is especially to a higher being that why so many people dislike it so much because like I mentioned earlier it hits close to home a lot, and they reject the TRUTH.But all in all, the DC reality is a multiverse, so this is just one of the many iterations of the classic boy scout Superman.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It makes more sense too than the insanely ludicrous plot of the first Superman (spin Earth in opposite direction to reverse time, anyone?). For one, Man Of Steel (MOS) has a fantastic action choreography. The fighting sequences were breathtaking, and even Oscar-worthy I feel. But, unfortunately, the plot isn't. Zack tries to make it deep and dense with uses of deep quotes and somewhat meaningful moments which are flashbacks of Clark's life but ultimately came out shallow. Character development was pretty mediocre for me. The characters were so one-dimensional, even the Superman himself. Overall, this may be the ""Superman Begins"" of a new series of the darker, and more realistic Superman films. I just hope the sequel will have a better plot, one that will be engaging.7/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There also was the question of the, at times, ridiculous science-fiction, fantasy make-believe props and scenarios in the script which called for the knowing suspension of ones 'understanding of science and scientific nature' in willing acceptance of the story tellers view and description of a likely science-fictional universe with all its associated science-fictional 'quirks' which the story and its characters would portray and which we the viewers would find believable, and I honestly felt this was science-fiction for fools and children, not intelligent adults.I could go on but in short, I think it dishonest when 'spin' is used to make things seem what it so patently is not and in this instance I think it has once again been a case of Hollywood spin at its worst.This movie will not be remembered, except if 'vested interests' do their best to warp truth and reality and thus make it seem otherwise.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

My moms are big fans of Superman so I was positive I knew what to expect. Well, I was in for a huge surprise.This movie is not at all like other movies about famous superheroes. It starts by showing where Superman is born on another planet and what happens to his home. It touches your heart to see what sacrifice his real parents go through in order to save his life.The movie shows Superman's life from a little kid to a grown man; how he has to adjust to Earth's atmosphere and learn to control his powers. Other kids think he is weird and pick on him, but his earth parents teach him to be patient and not to attract too much attention so he can grow up and fulfill his destiny. You probably would like to know what his destiny is, but you have to watch the movie to find out. The events, the storyline and amazing effects will blow your mind, especially if you get chance to see it in 3D.I like this film for number of reasons. The graphics and storyline are very engaging. I also think they couldn't have done a better job with the cast. The funny and courageous reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), proud warrior and real father of our famous superhero Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's earth father (Kevin Costner) and a new face on the Hollywood horizon, Henry Cavill, who plays Superman.My favorite scene is when Clark surrenders to FBI so he can save the Earth and while he is there, FBI agents observe him through a one-way mirror window. Superman has super powers so he can see through the glass. He starts making funny comments and shocks the FBI agents with his skills. But best of all is the reaction of the agents on the other side of the glass. You can see that they struggle to believe that this is real and they are also amazed and fascinated by Superman.I recommend this great movie to ages 10 and up. It has elements of violence and a bit of harsh language. The graphic depiction may be too intense for a younger audience. I love the film and would definitely enjoy watching it again, though it does get a little predictable in the last 15-20 minutes.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O.

That was the big problem with it. And I'm not talking about the first 45 minutes of character development. Actually that was the best part of the film, had been been a little well defined emotionally. It was the eye popping special effects extravaganza later that did not work for me at all. So much so that I was fidgeting uncontrollably in the last 30 mins or so, waiting for it to get over. The actors did a fine job, Henry Cavill was very likable as Clark Kent/ Superman and fit the role rather well. Hoping for as detailed a character from him as Robert Downey Jr's Ironman or Christian Bale's Batman would probably be expecting too much. Rest of the actors or characters were not bad either. It was just that the film lacked any sort of emotional or intellectual depth or entertainment factor, either of which we have now come to expect of superhero flicks after Dark Knight and Ironman/Avengers respectively. Zack Snyder doesn't get it as a film maker. Amazing special effects can bowl over the movie-goers once, maybe twice, but you cannnot a great film make every time based just on eye candy. A film is about characters and their stories, both of which were not interesting enough to draw me in. Disappointed after having waited a LONG time for Man of Steel to come out.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Christopher Nolan's influence is felt from costumes to credits, which is good considering his success with The Dark Knight. This is not however, wholly a Christopher Nolan movie because Zack Snyder does a fine job as the director.The pre-production buzz for this movie must have been out of this world. The big names start from the beginning of the movie and just keep coming - Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, Christopher Meloni, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, among others, and of course the stars Amy Adams and Henry Cavill. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was solid, but not stellar. I liked her Lois Lane, but I didn't really feel as empathetic for her as I thought I should. Disappointing? Yes, but give the woman a break. She can't be expected to perform with the charisma of Giselle, her character in Enchanted, every time. No actress is that good. As for Henry Cavill as Superman, if you like bulked up, powerful, potent men, his performance won't matter after seeing him shirtless. (At least one of the two ladies that saw it with us prefers Thor, but that is a debate for someone else to moderate.) If you are like me, you want acting chops, which he proved he had in the Tudors and by his transformation here into our flying friend. His strength is as the quiet transient who moves from town to town trying to find himself and his way, and he pulls off the superpowers with the confidence one would want. The weakest of the main characters was Russell Crowe as Superman's father. I can't decide if this is the fault of the Academy Award winning actor or the writers, but either way some of his conversations felt so tedious that I thought more how flat the lines were, rather than how they were changing the plot.The film is listed at 2 hours and 23 minutes and while it doesn't move faster than a speeding bullet, it moves quickly enough to maintain the viewers attention thanks to the plot and the special effects. The flashback scenes to Superman's childhood are informative, interesting and not overdone as they easily could be. They are also spread out enough to be unobtrusive. I felt like some of the scenes on Krypton were a little too much, as if the artists were trying too hard to be visually spectacular and to create something different from Earth. I felt that way also in the ""Fortress of Solitude."" That said, the special effects have added a realism here that is not seen in previous iterations. The audience is bombarded, as they should be, with visual and audio cues for the power Superman and the other characters from his native Krypton exert compared to, as the Hulk would say, ""puny humans."" My issue with the length of the movie is that the last fight scene seemed wholly unnecessary, creating continuity questions rather than closure.A few of the themes are not handled well, like the idea of people not accepting others as they are, the struggle to find oneself and the raping of the natural resources of the planet. I don't need to be punched in the chest to notice them. In this case, though, that can be forgiven because with a PG-13 rating the repetition is probably for the younger audience.While I would not go so far as to say this version is leaps and bounds better than earlier ones, this, like The Dark Knight, stands as it's own worthy interpretation.

The oddity about Cavill's and David S. Goyer's Clark Kent is that he's far more interesting when he hasn't got the suit on, Superman while looking the part really hasn't much to say.Goyer and Christopher Nolan's story smartly avoids rehashing (within limit and where possible) previous incarnations, the alter ego mystery and relationship build up with Louise Lane and the working for the Daily Planet is mainly omitted here with interesting fleetingly dynamics in their place.The grim atmosphere and serious tone is welcomed, fitting the themes within the story. Gone is the glossy Marvel style pallet of the previous film incarnations and it is debatably more true to the tone of the later DC comics, sitting in the Dark Knight 'universe' possibly thanks to Nolan's writing/producing input.While Zack Snyder's fight scenes are a little too frantic comparable to the Spiderman trilogy (corrected in The Amazing Spiderman (2012)) they are wonderfully and superiorly put together even if somewhat repetitive. It's a shame Snyder's own Watchmen (2009) slow-motion effect wasn't used. Thankfully, this is counter balanced by some visual and interesting additions notably those featuring Jor-El perfectly played by Russell Crowe. That said, Laurence Fishburne is sorely underused. Both Diane Lane and Kevin Costner give weight and emotion to the proceedings. Michael Shannon while lacking the simmering subtlety of Terence Stamp's Zod is more fittingly menacing and physically imposing as the General.Amy Adams is solid as Lois Lane but while not underused like Fishburne is not given much substantial dialogue. Surprisingly it's not Cavill with his acting and physic who steals every scene, it's Antje Traue as Faora-Ul with her screen presence, piercing eyes, steely looks and accent to match. Credit needs to go to both Russell Crowe and the writers with bringing Jor-El to life, and the characters clever utilisation throughout.There's lot of new aspects to Man of Steel. While the opening is reminiscent of Star Wars (1977), John Carter (2012) and later The Thing (2011), AVP (2004) to name a few it is finely realised and is successful in expanding the alien races history, the planet Krypton's topography and outpost ship aspect. Sadly the third act is less satisfying containing so much obliteration and destruction that becomes numbing - possibly less would have be more.The first half is certainly when Man of Steel is at its strongest, with Snyder exceeding the character drama of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and this Superman outing works best when the alien invasion aspect of the antagonists are not focal.With great costumes, amazing effects and a powerful score from Han Zimmer, overall a great foundation even if a lacking a little meat and rushing the other main players introduction - namely Lois Lane.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The older parts kinda start off where this one ends. The only real complaint i could make would be this tried to capture way too much in it. It gives a realistic picture of what little Clark must've really gone through and being a superhero isn't all fun and games. But it would be practically impossible to raise him, he'd destroy the house and maybe his parents, only while playing. Don't want the audience sympathysing with him. We know its all impossible, we are looking for a hero and more or less get it later in the film. The setting of the origins was good. Storyline quite good. Plot development good. The action seemed over at times, too many buildings destroyed. But come'on its Superman, what were you expecting? Maybe could trim the length a bit, but i couldn't complaint more.

The premise of the film sees a young man who finds out he is an alien with special powers as he must stop members of his race from destroying his new home of Earth.Main Character
Henry Cavill plays Kal El/Superman and I think he is great in the role, to start off he really looks the part as Superman, he is very believable in the role and does a great job. Through flashbak scenes and his cureent day story you see his character really develop, I think the issue in the past is that Superman has been seen as above humans which makes him hard to root for and that is here but he just feels more human. He seems to be on the back foot for the majority of the film and as it's his first days on the job he struggles throughout which helps build his character.Supporting Characters
This film has a legit supporting characters, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane in the film and I thought she did a good job, she is a pretty strong independent character and her relationship with Superman feels more mature then the average comic book romances and feels appropriate for this film. Michael Shannon plays General Zod and he was a great villain in this film, he is menacing and strong but also has interesting motivations that made him a memorable villain for me. Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner & Russell Crowe have smaller but memorable roles and really add something to the film.Story
The story is a really interesting origin story for Superman, it looks at how the world would really react to a superbeing if they came to Earth in an effective way. The flashbacks documenting his earlier life do a great job of fleshing this part of the story and really adding dome emotion to the characters and the film. The characters motivation's are all well done and as mentioned seeing the average person react to Superman this way is really something we haven't seen before. Now there is something that happens towards the end of the film that has proven controversial amongst the fandom but I thought it reall worked effectively if you accept this is a new type of Superman for a new generation.Script
The script has some great drama in it, it deals with things in a more complicated way then you would accept in a Superman film but it works very well. Though I will say this film is incredibly somber, there is pretty much no humour at all which feels weird in a Superman film and sometimes the dialogue is a bit rigid but overall it does a decent job.Style
This film's style is the most action packed of any Superman film ever, the action scenes are really exciting and fit the God like characters really well, there is plenty of destruction but it fits the story well and can lead to stories in the future.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic origin film, it takes Superman in a different direction and does a great job in setting up a future for the character.Rating - 9/10.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

A common mistake people make when going in to watch this film is that they expect to be like the dark knight films because Christopher Nolan was involved in this project. To those people I have to say.....STOP IT. Batman and Superman are two different characters and therefore have to be treated in different ways. Batman is a dark, brooding superhero to puts fear in others whereas Superman is an alien and could be either mankind's hope or the means to end its existence due to his abilities.Well now that I have cleared that up, I went into watching this film expecting it to be a movie that the man of steel deserves. In a nutshell, Zack Snyder did somewhat pull it off. He did something that is normally difficult to do with superman films - make Clark Kent experience issues both due to his meta human abilities and normal worldly issues. I liked how they made him seem more human than expected. I enjoyed it when he was first discovering his abilities of flight, x ray vision and so on, because his reactions were very human like. For example anyone of us would have a big grin on our face if we one day found out we could fly. Secondly I also liked how they handled Zod because they didn't make him a typical 'bad guy' with no purpose. He had a purpose - to save krypton. Furthermore, the reason why I liked Zod's and Jor-El's relationship is the same reason why I like Prof. X and Magneto's relationship. Two men who have utmost respect for each other but don't agree on certain matters.However, I do feel that Zod was a bit overshadowed Faora because she was just bad ass in her scenes but that is one of the least of my complaints. One complaint I have was the amount of destruction. Not the one caused by the world engine. I understand why that happened because they were trying to make another krypton so they have to demolish everything on Earth and Zod generally doesn't care about humans. The destruction I am referring to is the one between superman and Zod because superman cares about the human race so he could've at least made an effort to take the fight somewhere else.So to sum up, I would say that I enjoyed this movie for the same reason I enjoyed the first Ironman film. Both films are enjoyable with their action scenes, treat the main character properly although with the addition of several flaws in the plot but all round good. I would recommend this anyone who wants that. NOT the best but enjoyable","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Maybe not on the big screen but certainly on the small. So something special really had to come along at this point to reboot things. As Someone who's never been the greatest fan of the ""Man of Steel,"" but actually liked the last attempt to renew things (Superman returns) I entered the cinema knowing only of the promise of this being Superman going all ""dark knight"" on us, and I think they've pulled it off pretty well, if perhaps, not as well as they did with Batman. Who I've always favoured anyway.The Winning team of Christopher Nolan and David S Coyer, has done wonders in retelling a familiar story in a new way, without it feeling to much like a pointless remake (Think ""The Amazing Spider-man"") and I have to applaud the decision to have no Lex Luther, no secret identity, no Kryptonite, and obviously no red pants in the movie. But Someone somewhere has gone a bit overboard with the action. I had already heard going in that the flick was CGI heavy and didn't have a lot of quiet moments, and at first this wasn't a problem. The Film pulls off things they could never off done back in the 1978 original, and by the half way point of the movie I was like ""YE! This is freakin' awesome!""Trouble is it keeps going. I think people might of complained that ""Superman returns"" had to much chat, but did they really have to go all ""Transformers"" on us with this one? Aye, seeing Superman and his enemies throw themselves through buildings is one thing, but when Lois Lane and the reporters at the ""Daily Planet"" start getting involved in the over the top action, things start going seriously over board. And why is Amy Adams Lois Lane anyway? Seems if they wanted to have this modern take on the character be more than a damsel in distress, they should have perhaps picked someone not renowned for being a girly girl in all those musicals she's been in.Still, there are so many crowd pleasing moments, that I have to take this otherwise un-necessary reboot as an overall success. If Smallville getting completely trashed doesn't quite literally blow everything else ""Superman"" related out of the park, I don't think anything ever will.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In the film he has no drive to start helping people. Instead we get the ""you're gonna be great someday"" dialouge from many many characters. We never once see why Clark wants to save people, just people telling him that he is destined to. John Kent was supposed to mold him into the Superman he becomes but instead he discourages him and then tells his son not to save him from a tornado. John Kent originally died from a heart attack, it was supposed to be something Superman couldn't prevent. A reminder that there ARE things he can't do. This humanizes him a bit. Instead it, ""Watch me die by a tornado son even though you can save me and you look exactly the same as you will when you are Superman (not wearing glasses), so it wouldn't even matter if you saved me in front of everyone"" Then when he gets the costume and all he seems more interested in throwing Zod into buildings instead of saving people.

The special effects and CGI are overblown and bombastic, and there is not a single minute that isn't flaunting its multi-million dollar budget. In the end, it feels more like a Michael Bay film rather than a Christopher Nolan product. Bereft of any semblance of heart or soul that made Nolan's Batman series so.. human.But don't get me wrong. Man of Steel is the very definition of a perfect summer blockbuster. It is spectacular and visually epic; a lot of fun to watch, and if you're a CGI-action buff, believe me when I say you won't be disappointed. However, there is just so much more to the Superman story that they fail to regard; the story is so focused on Superman's battle against Zod that it has no other layers.Henry Cavill plays a decent Superman, but in short, this movie did not require much of Cavill's acting prowess - if I'm not mistaken there was only one scene that required him to put on a face that wasn't adamant, confused or superhero-ish. Alas, there was only one scene where we saw a different side to Superman - the human side. This scene of course, was when he watched his human father die in the twister. P.S.: There were some angles in which I swore he looked like an older, wiser Tom Welling. With chest hair, that peeked out of his tights.Amy Adams was so-so as well. I'm glad to see Lois was not depicted as a helpless damsel in distress (but then again let's face it, was Lois ever depicted as such in any Superman productions?) But let's get something straight. People don't come to see this movie to watch the actors act. Acting was never a deciding factor for the success of a superhero movie. Even with that in mind, the cast in Man of Steel did what the script required them to do. Nothing more, nothing less.On a side note, I was also pleased to see the littered allusions to the expanded Superman universe - from appearances of high school sweetheart Lana Lang, bully Whitney Fordman and Pete Ross, to a mention of the name ""Sullivan"" (they were obviously paying homage to Smallville) to a brief blink-it-and-miss-it glance at a vehicle that bore the name Lexcorp.All in all, despite this lukewarm review, I am excited to see how they will continue this story, there are so many other elements they neglected to talk about in this flick, that I hope they will address in the many sequels (and maybe prequels and spin-offs) to come.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Move forward a couple of months and it's released on DVD, do I decided to give it another chance. I was more impressed but still not the euphoria I'd come to know from watching my favourite super hero. After all, this is Superman.
Fast forward to 2019 and this is one of my favourite movies, up there with The Avengers movies and Chris Nolan's Batman. The more I watched it the more I saw how utterly brilliant it is, seeing new and different things during each watch. The story has been put together fantastically and the opening scene is probably my favourite in movie history. Cavill is an amazing Superman and first the part brilliantly. And of course Kevin Costner plays the part of his dad, and Costner is awesome in every role.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I always knew Snyder had an over-the-top style with his directing, but this went miles and miles over the proverbial top. The total and utter carnage of this movie will make you feel like road kill when its all said and done. I just wish Costner and Crowe hadn't been associated with a film like this one. It was a total waste of their acting prowess. All Snyder seemed to worry about was how to ""up"" his next explosion and/or fighting sequence. I kept thinking, by the end of the movie, what did Superman actually ""save"" (and not destroy)?? Amy Adams character might as well have been deleted from the movie altogether. She served, through poor screen writing and directing, no purpose whatsoever. I don't worry about Affleck playing Batman in the next installment. I worry about Snyder directing it again. I think he needs to take a lesson from Superman and fly away.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I must admit I was disappointed. What really let the movie down is the CGI. It was too exotic and you hardly see anything that happens in the action sequences. Especially the climax action sequence feels monotonous and the only thing you remember is that they destroyed some hundred buildings.Henry Cavill perfectly fits the bill as Superman. Apart from Russell Crowe other characters hardly make any impact. Hans Zimmer as usual nails the BGM.300's action sequences were complemented well by CGI, but in Man of Steel CGI spoils everything.Man of Steel's action sequences have too much resemblance to previous alien invasion movies. The climax action is very similar to Matrix Revolutions, you will eventually feel bored and want the movie to end. For a change I have to agree with the critics.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

With Nolan's more adult take on the Dark Knight trilogy and Snyders excellent reputation for action direction, this had to be a hit. Unfortunately, it wasn't.Let me start of by saying that it wasn't a bad action movie. But that's as deep as it gets. Nolan's influence can't be found at all and Snyder's previous films were a lot better.The Bad: The characters in Man of Steel are incredibly stupid and/or shallow. I didn't care for most of them and was frequently face-palming at some of the dumber decisions they made. The only character that really gets explored is Kal-El himself. With Nolan involved I expected more.Then there's the running time. This was a really long watch and it wasn't necessary at all. I'll give one example without resorting to spoilers: the first scene. We have to watch this long scene all the way through and later in the film it's explained again for no apparent reason. There are plenty of scenes that add nothing to the film and it's a shame.Continuity wise there were also some obvious errors, again I won't spoil anything but just pay attention and you will find these mistakes without even trying. All in all it's just a sloppy film.Also, when the first fight between Superman and his enemies breaks out, it's actually superman who starts tearing up buildings and blowing things up. Not very heroic.The Good: The camera work is very nice and some of the action scenes are spectacular, if you can get past the unnecessary destruction caused by our so called hero.Conclusion: This was one of my most anticipated films for some time now. Being an admirer of both Snyder and Nolan's works AND avid superhero movie fan, this had to be great. Unfortunately it was far from that. Just a blank action film with no depth at all. Such a shame...","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

It shows how he struggles to survive among Humans, how he suffers to gain control over his superpowers and finally how he makes the difficult choice regarding the survival of his own race and the Humans. Genuinely and perfectly REAL. I have NEVER SEEN action scenes like this before. Visual effects and CGI at its best. Physics has been applied to such perfection that its literally hard to find any flaws. The fight between General Zod and Superman is my personal favourite. Also Faora Ul (Antje Traue) is one awesome sidekick with her super-quick stunts. Unlike usual movies, the movie shows justice to the trailer. Yes you can go watch the movie with HIGH EXPECTATIONS and you WILL be REWARDED. Trust me on that! Btw please DON'T give ears to the critic reviews, because they seem to have expected a ""Dark Knight"" like movie (less action, more talk, more ""darkness"") from Christopher Nolan. Zack Snyder has made this movie purely for fans. And when the movie ends, you won't know that you sat through 143 minutes. You'll leave the theater filled with awe and satisfaction. As a beginning to a new series of Superman movies, this one has executed it's job neatly. Keep in mind that it's a fresh start for Superman movies. Henry Cavill , YOU are the man.Man of Steel won't let down any viewer, whether he's a Fan-boy, a casual viewer or even a hater Must watch! Highly recommended.PS: The new costume, soundtrack and the entirely new cast has hit the bulls-eye ;)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I just saw the movie a few hours ago and I think it is the best Superman movie yet. Although, without any flaws (I'll explain at the end), it is without a doubt the best superman movie yet. Did those critics see the same frigging movie I did?Here's my rebuttal for most of the complaints of the critics that did not like the movie:1. ""The movie is too serious and is humorless"" – there were about 5 or 6 times when I heard laughter not just from me but from the audience as well. The movie has a serious and dark tone compared to the previous Superman movies. It does a good job of showing that he is an alien from another planet but has adapted human ways which is the only thing he knows. Then as an adult, he tried to learn more about his roots. That sounds like it should be treated in a serious way. You want a laugh- out-loud movie, go see a comedy instead.2. ""Too much over-the-top action and the CG gets in the way"" – Superman is probably the strongest and most powerful superhero that was fictionalized. He was fighting General Zod and a few of his soldiers who have the same strength. I think it's high time that a movie shows this enormous battle sequence between two beings of Herculean strength and can fly as fast as a jet. This is the part of the story of Superman that we have not seen before, but if you stretch your mind a bit, 60 minutes of related action make sense. A boxing averages about two hours. Superman can knockout the best boxer with one light punch. If you don't want to see this much action in a Superhero movie, go watch Barney on TV instead.3. ""The script is thin and the characters were not given enough time to develop"" – Besides Superman, here are the other important characters:Lois Lane(love interest) – There was good chemistry between the actors and you can see that there was a connection between them. Lois Lane was shown as a very capable investigative reporter and was fascinated by this alien who saved her life. Jor El and Lara (Birth parents from Krypton) -The movie did a good coverage of Krypton and given a glimpse of what Superman's birth parents are like. Jonathan and Martha Kent and General Zod (the villain of equal powers). There were a few good scenes between Jonathan and Martha Kent where they showed him to use his powers for good and not to lash back against those bullies even though he can probably knock them dead with a flick of his fingers. General Zod was also given enough exposure to see that he is very military like and have no qualms about using brute force to achieve his goals. (Minor Spoiler) As we learn from the movie, that Kryptonians were not allowed to pro create naturally and the off-springs of families are artificially created with genes altered to suit for various roles (military, scientists, politicians, etc.). Kal El aka Superman was the only one that was created naturally. And last but not the least, Clark Kent tries to fit in the world even after learning in his early teens that he came from an alien spacecraft. The movie did a good job of showing how much Clark was raised by the Kents in a good way but the humans were cautious about him after learning he is an alien. I am not sure how much depth and dialog to show that Superman's character was developed well and only enough treatment to those characters that matter to him. This is after all a reboot, so it dwells more on him and and his origins. So if you want more character development and thicker script, go see a TV mini series.4. ""There is not enough romance between Lois and Clark"" – The past Superman movies had more scenes on Lois and Clark's romance. Maybe this is a minor flaw. It seems that after they met, they had a deep connection already. But the actors did a good job on portraying that there might be real chemistry between them. But how much can you pack in a movie so epic in scope? This is not a sequel so that relationship still needs to develop. If you want to see more of a romantic banter, go see a romantic comedy movie.I might get rants from Christopher Reeve's Superman fans, but only the first Superman movie was good. But even this movie tops that by a notch or two. Sure the first movie did better with being able to relate to the characters but it's as if Superman was accepted right away. Man of Steel does a better job at saying that the hero is from another planet but was raised with good moral values. He is also portrayed that he cares about his home, the Earth. Humans were shown being cautious because of his powers.Also, the past Superman was portrayed as if he can save everyone without any casualties and fly around and get into fights without getting dirty. Too clean if you ask me. And thanks to the advanced CG today, we can see what that enormous strength and super speed can do. And if you get turned off by collapsing buildings and unbelievable fight scenes, don't see a Superhero Action flick!","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Also, Zod was less than captivating. So was Amy Adams who didn't fit the role of Lois Lane. Bummer.The flashbacks were cute but not as rich as I would have liked. Neither did they fit seamlessly into the narrative. There was no feeling like, ""oh wow, i really wanted to know that and boom here comes flshback."" it was more like, ""getting bored....oh flashback? Yes please. And afterwards- OK, whatever.""The action sequences were boring to be honest. The tension created in a single encounter like the one in the bar when the guy punches Clark for standing up to him was greater and had more opportunity for drama than the entire long, drawn out fight sequences with Zod's drones.They set the movie up for some strong drama and then let it devolve into some phony sentiments between him and Amy Adams and him vs the Zod crew.For me this was the third in a line of 3 disappointing superhero films lately.The worst: Avengers.

I just involuntarily searched for anything more entertaining to be distracted with. And almost anything seemed more entertaining than this.I'm not going to debate over the take on the canon story or Superman character, neither the general lack of common sense in superhero- comic-based scripts; what's more important for me is this movie failed to keep me interested for more than first hour or even less (and I've seen Lawrence of Arabia XD ). I'm not a big fan of any superheroes comics, but that's hardly an excuse, since many movies based on them still managed to entertain me. And when I'm not watching documentaries, I want a movie to entertain me first of all.Cast - Henry Cavill worked hard on his physique, yet I'd love to see him paying a little more attention to acting. His facial expressions sometimes just don't work for me. As well as generally I like Amy Adams, but it isn't her best role, she needs something more lively. Right here it's just dry cardboard 'acting', even compared to the usual level of 'cardboard-ness' in comic-movies. I bet Christopher Reeve could do a better job as Superman even in the wheelchair if he was alive.5/10 for the FX and shirtless scenes, which never made any movie good.

For some he is a sign of hope, for some he is just that cool superhero that can fly and is super strong,others he is a Christ like character which no other superhero character can parallel, and to a few he is just a overpowered, boring character. Due to the varying levels of enthusiasm for Superman, it is next to impossible to please all the fans of Superman and still keep the general audience eager for more Superman. In other words, it is inherently hard to create a ""great"" Superman movie to please all the crowds of people i described in my second sentence. Now here comes Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"", which tries to please both Superman fans that view him as a Christ like character and those who just see him as a cool superhero who can fly and do ""cool"" stuff, and overall Man of Steel, I believe, will please both to some extent. This is a Superman movie littered with Christ references all over the place, while still been a mindless Superhero movie with great action scenes ( the best ever in a Superman movie). However, this compromise is also the movies biggest shortcoming and must likely led to the polarizing reviews this movie got. Overall, I will recommend this flick to both fans of Superman and DC because it is still a solid Superman movie for a new generation of fans. And to those who despise this movie, you can always watch Superman Returns.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This remake lost most of the original plot and does not have a strong watch ability factor, actors with big names too couldn't pull up this disappointment. They tried to combine the original three parts into one, making a mess of the entire story. FX was great as expected and the background to the disaster on Krypton which was missing in the original is well told, enjoyable but for the first 20 mins. Afterwards the movie goes into a never ending series of flashbacks to Kal el's life as he arrived on earth, even here they have not stuck to the original movie.

I was not expecting it to be that good but it turned out one of the nice movies at par with any good recent Marvel movie for example Iron Man 3. Special effects and overall acting of everyone in the movie are pretty nice.Henry, Michael and Russell played pretty decent roles and did excellent acting. I never saw Michael in such a lead role and he did very well. Russell, being one of my favorite actors, as usual, played a nice role. Although he spent less time on screen, he did fine. Henry - the Superman - looked pretty much suitable for his role.So overall the movie is pretty good and worth watching but it just made me think (as such movies always do) that how weak are we as humans. We all live on this planet called earth and really have no power to save it. We can claim to have all the power in the world - but whenever aliens come we find ourselves pretty ineffective and in end someone like Superman saves this earth from the damage. I always wonder what if there are such superpowers out there who are ready to claim this world but there is no such superhero to save this planet then what? But on the positive side - humanity has always survived and earth lives forever. Maybe it is just the way we think - we might be fine having challenges throughout the journey but in end everything should fall in place. Having said all that - again it is a nice movie worth watching. So relax and have a good time!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It did several things; it focused on the character of the character, it provided a superman with heart, humility, and steel (hence the title). As we found out with Returns, no one likes a superman who has it all, it's not relevant to many of us. I enjoyed Returns and for fans of the 70's and 80's Christopher Reeves Superman movies it hit the mark. However, it isn't relevant any more and Roth didn't do a good job of portraying a goofy/nerdy Kent that no one would give a second look too. This too is an outdated theory as well anyways.This Superman was brawny, hairy, seething with heart, and unapologetic. This superman was willing to do what needed to be done and (without spoiling anything) went places Batman wouldn't even go.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I never really liked Superman until I read DOOMSDAY series and DEATH OF SUPERMAN comics. Thinking I was wrong and Superman comics deserved a shot, I tried another, only never to return to Superman Comic Stories.Same here...I thought of giving Superman movie one chance and it makes sure that I would never return for another one. The movie tries valiantly at showing darker hues in life of superman but fails. It just is not gripping enough. The film fares at mediocre levels in all other aspects too. Story line, though very good in beginning becomes fragmented towards the end. Looks like Zack Snyder was in hurry there. Even as The film is Sci Fi, it leaps over major logic several times. How come other warrior Kryptonians fare poorly to a non-trained Superman. The role of Villain is just not intimidating enough when compared to the Hero. And that was a major setback for me. The worst turn off for me was the Super things that Superman could do, it quickly scales past what you are willing/expecting to imagine. All other Villains are made to look like chickens.As for the effects, with little downs in between, the overall experience of effects was good. But 3D part in the release of movie stands nowhere close to what other Action movies are doing. I liked 3D of Star Trek and Iron Man 3 much better than Man of Steel.I guess you would have to be a real fan of Superman concept and comics to give this movie 10 or even 8 stars...I will hand over 6.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","So much promise in the 1st half squandered in the 2nd half","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2818132/?ref_=tt_urv","Sisiutil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1256739/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2013","After watching this film I can only conclude that Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan watched The Avengers and came away with entirely the wrong idea as to why that movie worked so well.Man of Steel had so much going for it, so it's disappointing that it fails to live up to its own promise. The first half of the movie is in many ways the best Superman film I've ever seen, and that's saying something, since I'm inevitably comparing it to the '78 Donner/Reeve classic. Man of Steel features some new, original twists on the Superman mythos and a refreshingly non-linear structure to the inevitable origin story. There's a lot of character development, and not just of Clark Kent--Lois Lane and Jonathan Kent also get their due. The cast is very talented and it shows.Sadly, the film starts to fall apart in the second, action-packed half. Not entirely, mind you; there are moments that show how a much better movie could have shone through. Secondary characters like Perry White, Dr. Emil Hamilton, and Col. Nathan Hardy all get moments of heroism. This fits with what both of Kal-El's fathers have said before this, that he will inspire others by his example.But the over-the-top destruction ultimately detracts from what the movie should be all about. Superman is a HERO. That means his primary concern is not just defeating the bad guy, but protecting innocent lives.Again, think back to the Avengers. For all the pyrotechnics and cool fight scenes at the end, that movie emphasized over and over again that the heroes are primarily concerned with protecting ""civilians"". Us, in other words. ""We keep the fight focused on us,"" Captain America tells the team, i.e. away from innocents. Iron Man nearly dies in the process. THIS is what makes them truly heroes. The public's adulation for them, shown in the film's end sequence, is justified.The supposed ""hero"" of Man of Steel, however, aside from a couple of all-too infrequent and brief moments, seems to have little concern for innocent lives. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that's the fault of the filmmakers. Buildings in Metropolis topple like so many sandcastles kicked over by bullies. News flash, Noland and Snyder: PEOPLE live and work in buildings, and your audience is well aware of this. I sat there thinking that the death toll had to be in the thousands if not hundreds of thousands.And Superman, the ultimate comic book hero, never gets a chance to save those lives. Far worse, he's probably responsible for many of the deaths; he's far to willing to let his battles with his fellow Kryptonians wreak havoc in Smallville and Metropolis. I kept wondering why he didn't divert the fights to a sparsely-located mountain range or desert. Kryptonians tossing tree trunks and boulders at one another? Still spectacular, and it would have avoided the distraction of wondering how many bystanders were maimed or dying.So ultimately, the problem with this movie and why it fails to truly capture the spirit of Superman is that the filmmakers never allow the hero to be one. They're too busy blowing things up real good, force-feeding the audience special effects eye candy, to bother living up to the premise of the film and of the character. Snyder and Nolan don't believe in heroes, they believe in production values.So, nice try, once again, DC, but Marvel just keeps kicking your butt in the movie department.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie is a spectacle that utilizes CGI almost perfectly. The opening scene alone is enough for me to call this movie good. The fight sequences are intense and exciting, making this a thrilling watch.The story is different from usual Superman shenanigans and dives deeper in the character of Kal-El, allowing the audience to relate to him much more by demonstrating the human side of Clark Kent more than the kryptonian side. The cast is all top notch, with Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner as stand-outs. The drama is extremely well-realized, there are a couple of really sad moments.As far as the negatives go, Snyder's use of zooms overwhelms and the 3rd act is way too long.

Nobody said that Snyder would win Best Director at the Oscars that year. Critics weren't too kind towards this movie, complaining about several different things. Some of it I agree with, others I don't.Let's start with the main attraction of this movie. Henry Cavill. No I'm joking (I'm not), it's the ACTION. The action sequences which filled the majority of the movie. I personally enjoyed the special effects and the sequences were nicely edited most of the time. I didn't enjoy the sheer number of action moments. Yes, this is first and foremost an action movie and I expected a lot of it. Just...not that much.Let's talk about the acting.Overall, it was good. The characters were well acted. Henry Cavill made a brilliant Clark Kent in my opinion. He looked the part and he acted the part well. His American accent was very good. His posture was fit for a superhero and sometimes I found myself seeing Chris Evans' iconic Captain America in his tone and words. That's a good thing, by the way. It means Henry nailed the superhero thing.And now onto one of my favourite ever actresses, Amy Adams, who found the role she was born to play, Lois Lane. I read somewhere that she auditioned several times in other Superman features to be Lois and there's a reason for that. To me, Amy Adams IS Lois Lane. Her portrayal was smart, subtle yet dramatic in all the right places.Michael Shannon played a great role as Zod. Sorry...General Zod. After only seeing him in Revolutionary Road, I expected to nail this role, even though it is a vast change from that role. He definitely did a good villain justice.I was sadly disappointed but Russell Crowe yet again (after Les Mis, I didn't really have high hopes). All of his dialogue felt wooden and I could sense boredom in his performance. It was very stiff and two-dimensional, and I feel like more could have been done with his character.All in all, I enjoyed my experience in watching this movie. Superhero fans will no doubt enjoy it, even if they find fault in some places. The chemistry between Cavill and Adams is natural and easy, the acting is great, the storyline is fun and action-packed. The cast is hot (looking at you Cavill) and it was a very solid effort at a genre that polarises opinion on every outing (see Thor: The Dark World for more on that)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's pretty much the same thing. A lot if fight scenes, underdeveloped characters, and indestructible bad guys that have one weakness that allows the good guy to predictably triumph in the end. With Zack Snyder directing and Christopher Nolan writing (both cinematographic geniuses) I had hoped for a super hero movie that would be unique and refreshing; not just another typical DC comics flick. Although, the film was very cliché, which I guess is what you would expect from superman. The Dark Knight trilogy by Nolan was by far the best portrayal of a super hero saga ever seen on the big screen; and well received. The producers of this film had the opportunity to go beyond the typical superman story that has been done many times before and create something extraordinary. But they didn't, which was a real let down.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now in my travels as an avid superhero-movie-watcher, I've come to realize that older superhero films tend to fail at meeting and exceeding expectations due to their focus more on characters and dialogue (though not in a character development way, just to fill screen time) rather than the action and critical stakes at hand. Superhero films need to provide us with a sense of urgency, danger, hope, despair and above all, awe as we watch our protagonist churn through their enemies and come out victorious, even if it is at a cost - this is something Man of Steel does so well, and I think it deserves much more praise than it got.I desperately clinged on to any hope of the earlier Superman films being interesting and gripping, but was beat to death each step of the way, rendering me unable to continue watching the older films. With Man of Steel, I was gleefully surprised when I watched the trailer a long while ago - it felt gritty and fast, doing justice to our hero himself and his powers. Henry Cavill as Kal-El is the perfect choice, his clean and defined build the ideal platform for Superman (between his chiseled jaw and those bulging muscles, you can't find any reason to disagree here). Though the Christopher Reeves films took a more juvenile, young Kal approach, Man of Steel puts Cavill into a role where Kal-El knows his strength and powers (as much as he is able before discovering his true potential) and is displayed as someone who wants to abide by the words of his adopted father, despite knowing his superhuman nature. This in turn makes for a much more satisfying hero, as the look of just pure disdain and disappointment from Cavill's face as he examines pathetic locks made to chain him provides small moments where you realize Kal-El is truly the future of Kypton, more than simply the Codex being a part of him.But while we come to Man of Steel for a glimpse at the new take on Superman, we stay for the riveting action. The film doesn't boast strong character development, but provides a solid backstory and wonderfully inspiring action scenes that go to the lengths required to show Superman's true power. Although the film lacks the small, interpersonal moments that would help drive it home further, it manages to provide Kal-El's first crisis, one that puts him as the saviour of humanity, at the forefront and examines our hero as he navigates this newfound responsibility - this isn't just saving a schoolbus of children - this is about saving the human race. And I can't write this review without mentioning Hans Zimmer's incredible score. Zimmer is a legendary composer in his own right, but this soundtrack for this film drives it into a league of its own, supporting the film with a powerful emotional presence that only continues to inspire us all, and for us to place our trust in a man we barely know, a man who will decide the fate of our species.Ultimately, Man of Steel truly does Superman justice by bringing him back to the big screen under Zack Snyder's umbrella, the action and crisis second only to Kal-El's struggle with both his fathers' teachings and the ideals he knows he must strive to uphold, driving the film home. I've been waiting for Cavill and Snyder to continue the story of Kal-El, but this film breathes new life into an iconic hero that had never seen such an honest realization.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, not of the DC/Marvel kind that you'd find in a US comic book store. I don't really read books, I love movies. I get distracted easily and prefer all my senses to be stimulated.I've loved the Superman movies since I was a kid and owned them on VHS, DVD and now Blu-ray. I have the extended editions, the Donner cut etc. I'm quite a fan.I enjoyed Lois & Clark, anything with a Superman costume has rarely failed to impress.I loved Smallville, even cried at the end, I own all those too.I even bought Superman Returns on DVD to watch over again as I liked that as well.Now comes Man of Steel, naturally I was looking forward to it.What I got was a Hulk/Transformers type film that contained a character that wears a red cape. Nothing about it was Superman for me.Sure there is Krpyton and the two sets of parents and the farm in Kansas and a bit of the Daily Planet and Lois Lane too, but this was all buried under ridiculous amount of CG battle scenes that had no appeal.I guess it's fair to blame Zack Snyder for a lot of the problems. I turned off 300 as I thought it was rubbish too. Sucker Punch was OK in the most part but again ruined by battle scenes towards the end.But he's not the only one to blame. The screenplay was awful, with script lines that made me grimace at times. I guess we can blame David S. Goyer for that. Whilst his style likely suited Batman & Blade, it doesn't suit Superman.Add to this the awful casting, the worst of which is Zod. I don't know who thought of putting this guy in the role, but it just didn't work. Terrence Stamp was always going to be hard to match up to, with his clear English elocution, but Smallville managed it with Callum Blue. See the connection? English accent. Here we have an English Superman, faking an American accent, and an American Zod - it doesn't work.Crowe was acceptable as Jor-El, hard to choose better in the right age group, but the choice for Lara I thought was poor. Back on Earth, Costner was as cardboard as usual and made John (Dukes of Hazzard) Schneider look like a good actor. Martha Kent was also equally poor and didn't get into character very well.Who on Earth chose to cast Christopher (Law & Order SVU) Meloni in the film? Could he be more typecast? Laurence Fishburne was about the best character, although he felt more like a police commissioner than Perry White.I'm going to give Cavill and Adams a pass for now as I felt they were truly let down by a terrible screenplay and didn't really get a chance to play either role properly. Adams is likely a bit feminine for Lois though and will really need to bring out a ""tom boy"" attitude for any sequel.So, all in, possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is truly the sum of it's parts. If you like the 300 and comic books, you'll likely think it's great. If you're a traditional Superman fan, though, I'd avoid it completely.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

I must say the introduction and take on superman was refreshing. we get to see more of his childhood and Lad years. i really wished for some more..! the Movie moved on well with some good story telling. the last 20 mins fight scene seemed cartoonish. anyways Enjoyable!!the direction and visuals are pretty good and easy on the eyes from the talented visually rich director of ""Watchmen"" and ""300"". The Cast is impressive, Good performances from Micheal Shannon (Cartoonish villainous), Kevin Costner, Diane Lane (Doting parents) and Antje Traue(Just Hot, watch for urself). Amy Adams is just alright as Lois lane...The one to watch out for is Russel crowe, his performance as Jor-El is simply awesome! Henry Cavill looks like superman, of course... :) Just right!Overall a good movie. Now Fingers crossed for the Justice League Movie!!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Man of Steel by Zack Snyder","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5356239/?ref_=tt_urv","lumieretrain","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62229406/?ref_=tt_urv","26 December 2019","Superman is one of the most popular and one of the most important superheroes of all time, for being a character who brings hope to the people, when they are in the danger. He would then receive during his journey some praise as well as some criticism, for what he is capable with his extraordinary powers. But the only way he has to hide his identity, when he is not Superman or also called with the Kryptonian name Kal-El, he has to wear the mask with the human name Clark Kent. After Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer have been discussing the possibility of making an origin story, about the character Superman, they start to develop the story as a fresh reboot. Once the screenplay has been completed, there were discussions about who would be the filmmaker to direct the movie, until the visionary filmmaker Zack Snyder has been chosen to direct the story. In 2013 came out Man of Steel by Zack Snyder, with Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne and Russell Crowe. The movie's plot: The Kryptonian Kal-El (Henry Cavill), or also called with the human name Clark Kent, has been brought in the Starcraft to planet Earth, from the destruction of the planet Krypton. Kal-El is facing a long journey through the years, to understand who he is and what is his purpose. To then accomplish whatever it would take to bring hope around the world, as he has to face the cruel General Zod (Michael Shannon) and become the superhero known as Superman. The movie from the beginning to the end would surprise the audience, as the screenplay has been elaborated to let the audience feel the doubts of the main character. Until he would find answers which he has been looking for, by then take actions to accomplish wonders. In the same way the movie shows, how the main character is the son of the two worlds, or Krypton and Earth, as he would try to bring hope without let Earth commit the same mistakes of Krypton. The lightings and the camera have been elaborated to let the audience feel the emotions of the story, in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots. The movie is filled with symbolisms, which make references of the Jesus Christ's story and the Moses' story, by making the movie impactful and unforgettable. Henry Cavill was excellent as Kal-El/Clark Kent, who once has learnt enough about himself, he would do anything to not let anybody be in danger, no matter how much the sacrifice is going to demand in his battle. Amy Adams did a well done performance as Lois Lane, a brave journalist who once understands about who Clark Kent is, she would support and believe in him. Michael Shannon was extraordinary as General Zod, a cruel and violent general who takes actions, to only follow his purpose which is to bring Krypton back again. Neither General Zod's sub commander Faora (Antje Traue), is going to be merciful with anybody to follow her mission. Kevin Costner did a well done performance as Jonathan Kent, the foster father of Clark Kent who is often seen in the flashbacks, as he tells his son to be careful by using his powers or the people around him would see Clarke as a monster rather than a hero. Diane Lane was excellent as Martha Kent, the foster mother of Clark Kent who would also teach Clark Kent to believe with what he has to do. Laurence Fishburne did a well done performance as Perry White, the chief editor of the newspaper Daily Planet and boss of Lois Lane. Even Perry White does not want Lois Lane to be in trouble, he understands her decisions are the right one to take. Finally Russell Crowe was excellent as Jor-El, the biological father of Kal-El who believes in what his son can accomplish with his will. Jor-El would be the one, who gives important answers about Kal-El's purpose. The score by Hans Zimmer was elaborated with specific instruments by creating rhythm and atmospheres, to be compatible in the most epic scene as well as in the most emotional scenes. As in every musical notes describe also the emotions of each characters, to be unforgettable without ruining the rhythm of the score. Man of Steel is one of the greatest superhero movies, as well as one of the best Zack Snyder's movies.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Superman is the vehicle that is used here and it's really effective how his mythology blends with this first contact story.The world building in this film is really good where we are introduced to a Krypton that is so technologically damaged that it's a really impressive almost High Fantasy world that's fleshed out and steeped in mythology and you get this in just the first 20 mins. The next act in the film shows us ""our world"" with all its good and bad which paired with the opening really sets the stage in a grounded way. In no uncertain terms this is an Earth very much like the viewers in a universe that also has worlds like Krypton. With this world building seen through the eyes of our main character set up the human characters are on the cusp of a discovery that will change the world and raise all of the questions that this revelation brings.The story of Superman being a child of two worlds is the plot of this story where Clark has to decide where he stands. The film has set-up Clark's interactions with people both good and bad to really show what Clark is deciding. Will he pick the imperfect humans? Or side with Kryptons that want to resurrect his dead world? I'm the final act Clark is forced to make this choice. Unfortunately given the history of the character in film, tv and books it's not a surprise where he lands but the filmmakers make an admirable attempt to sell the choice even if it's not quite successful.Henry Cavil is a good Superman showing a very grounded believable Clark Kent whilst having the physicality for Superman himself. He makes some wonderful acting choices down to some very simple gestures. The rest of the cast fit their roles really well from Clark's parents showing a really hounded home life and upbringing for Clark to Lois Lane being incredibly believable as a journalist.This film is really helped with its world building that really sets up this world and highlife all the differences and similarities between two vastly different worlds and cultures. The acting is really good with the Experian of Zod who is a bit cartoonish. I really enjoyed this film supplying us with a fresh take on Superman and a First Contact story.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's fair to say I had very high expectations for this film and I was sure it would be the ultimate superhero film and would stand up to the Dark Knight Trilogy quite well. After watching the film I was left feeling a little deflated at first. I expected to come out of the movie theater with an overwhelming sense of OMG but I didn't. After a couple of hours and once I had processed the story and the film I started to feel more optimistic about it. Visually Man of Steel is a feast for the eyes and Snyder has captured Superman in a way we have never seen on screen before. As for the film's star Henry Cavill, I was very happy with his overall performance. I think he is a far better hero then Brandon Routh and in my opinion matches up against Christopher Reeve quite well. As for the other players in the game I was left feeling a bit deflated. Amy Adams is good as Lois Lane (again far better than Bosworth from SR) and Michael Shannon is intense as the ruthless General Zod which makes a refreshing change from the boring character of Lex Luthor. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane where major let downs for me in the roles of supers earth parents. I am a huge fan of Diane Lane but I felt her performance in MOS is extremely lazy and lacks any form of depth. Costner in his small role as Jonathan Kent try's his best to make us believe in his character but ultimately fails in his attempt. Russell Crowe is good in the role of Jor El and does his best with some very cheesy and one dimensional dialogue. As for the overall storyline I think the David S. Goyer succeeded in his attempt to tell a modern Superman tale. He has changed superman from a cheesy boy scout to a hurt young man searching for his place in the world and his identity while trying to come to terms with his extraordinary abilities. This is as much Clark Kent's film then it is Superman's and Goyer has put a new spin on the origins of Superman by inventing new reasons as to why he has his powers, where the S (or symbols of hope) came from and he has given the character of Zod a deeper history and back story. Where Man of Steel fails for me is in its big attempt to be a realistic take on a well-known story ultimately becomes even more unbelievable with trigger happy fight scenes and cheesy dialogue. Man of Steel is a film with flaws, thankfully though these flaws don't overspill and make it a bad film. I feel we will need a second chapter in order to make this film better, the question is where does the story go from here?7.5 out of 10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While not terrible it certainly was far from remarkable. Guess the best thing I can say about the film was that it stayed well within the boundaries of mediocrity for at every opportunity this movie takes the low road.

We just seem to get a different take on his origin story every decade without them actually getting it right or it leading to a sequel or franchise. After 2006's Superman Returns disappointed 7 years later we're inflicted with another attempt, which again despite a huge ensemble cast and possibly even bigger budget just completely misses the mark again.I'm all for making familiar stories fresh but you have to have the basics in place. I don't understand why the completely did away with Clark Kent so's to speak. Yeah he was in it kind of, but there was no hiding his identity behind the clumsy news reporter of glasses to hide his alter ego. Heck, he doesn't even work at the Daily Planet. He's just, well, Superman.The story borrows very lightly from both the first and second Christopher Reeve films but the story told here is a mess. As you'd expect the film looks amazing but there's no soul to it. You don't get the sense that hey here's Superman to save us from the bad guys. It's all a bit dark and they seem to have nicked an idea or two from War of the Worlds that Krypton needs to destroy our planet to save its own.You can see why the Justice League and Batman v Superman that followed pretty much suffers the same fate. Michael Shannon is a great actor and (usually) makes a great villain, but not here. I'm no Nolan fanboy but given the same studio made this and The Dark Knight you wonder how they once again got it so wrong.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I put emphasis on Snyder because this film has his stamp clearly all over it, try as the marketing department might to fit in Christopher Nolan's producing credit in every trailer they can get. But no matter.If there was one thing I could pin Nolan on for this film, I would say, the mood of the film. This is definitely not your daddy's and grandaddy's Superman, or for that matter not your older brother's. Like ""Batman Begins"", emphasis is put on mood and atmosphere, with the lighthearted and campy factors virtually scrubbed out for a slicker, more down-to-earth feel. Unlike Nolan's reboot, though, ""Man of Steel"" opts to take a more action-oriented approach for its hero. And boy, do I mean action.Once the action lands on Earth, the audience is immediately whisked off alongside the now adult Kal-El, or Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), as he ventures alone on his quest to eventually find a certain (not-so) solitude location, while intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) investigates that very same one. Along the way well-timed flashbacks offer glimpses into Clark's youth and inspirations, most notably his loving Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who sufficiently provides as much inspiration as they can to properly shape up Clark as he nears his destiny.I say sufficient, because ""Man of Steel"" paces itself thunderously with gigantic and spectacular action sequences from start to finish, giving little time for the audience to breathe. The admittedly bare-bones plot is made way for some truly awesome sights to behold, showing quite possibly the most honest depiction of how powerful Kryptonians can really be if they really, really want to.I deplore ""Transformers"" for the very same reason I recommend ""Man of Steel"" - that is, non-stop action. This is because the former repeats an outdated formula that is aggressively forced onto the audience, while ""Man of Steel"" embraces its action sequences with style and technique. I usually deplore the excess of CGI in action sequences, but here I'm making an exception because this movie really shows that CGI can be used positively to create sights previously unknown to man, (a feat not seen since ""Avatar"", perhaps?). Buildings fall, planets explode, large objects are flying in the air, all done before, yes, but Snyder and his talented crew are probably influenced by Biblical catastrophes for their sensational action sequences. Imagine that.Snyder has a firm grip on action sequences, and injects them with such energy that one would think he drank a gallon of adrenaline and decided to show it through this film, but again, his crew is key. The marvelous production design by Alex McDowell, which includes the planet Krypton is given a major rehaul and now resembles something Lovecraftian, made me grin at the details and atmosphere created. Amir Mokri's framing of the action compiled with moody, muted colors makes it hard to not awe at the sheer spectacle unfolding while gasping at sights at the same time, and Hans Zimmer's rousing score keeps the film moving at a high tempo while pausing occasionally to take a breather.And what of our film's star? Cavill fits Superman to a T, he looks and sounds exactly what Supes would, but given the emotional mood of the whole movie, he manages to act convincingly in those emotional scenes. He looks like he has a bright future ahead. Michael Shannon, a character actor who is rising rapidly in his field, is intimidating as General Zod the villain, but most good actors can play the role well. As for the rest of the cast, they all deliver solid if unspectacular performances, though it was nice to see Costner on the big screen again.This is what I wanted to see in a comic book adaptation. Retaining the essence of the Superman character while wrapping sensational action sequences around a moody and Gothic atmosphere. It's no ""Dark Knight"" in terms of depth and character, but it doesn't even try to be, and it still works. Of course there will be a sequel. There will be a Justice League movie while they're at it. Hell, I'll be there if they can make it as rollicking as this.If I were to pick between this and ""The Avengers"", there is no question. I'm sorry, Marvel fans. Just my honest opinion.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, Christopher Meloni and Russell Crowe.An alien child is sent to earth to live among humans, he learns about the source of his activity when he visits an alien ship however an old enemy follows him to earth to bring codex from him.I really liked this film and probably this is the best film I have watched in DC series. The film is also one of the most underrated superhero films. The film is equally amazing in its action scenes, CGI, screenplay or acting.Henry Cavill did a tremendous job in the role of superman and the best part about his portrayal was that he carved a niche for himself and doesn't tried to copy or idolize anyone and makes his own style, Russell Crowe was surprisingly superb and leaves a mark in his limited screen space, Diane Lane was also equally impressive and Michael Shannon was superbly effective in his role. Amy Adams looked good.Screenplay of the film is good and will keep you engaged throughout, climax of the film was equally impressive. CGI, Stunts and action scenes were impressive. One of the best superhero film and surely an underrated one. A must watch.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Malick has won this round of cinematic evolution. His camera is all over this Hollywood juggernaut (see also Les Miserables), in the shots of laundry fluttering in the wind, in the reflections of sunlight on window glass, etc. I celebrate this eye because it goes past Kubrick's framed beauty to reflect on an awareness of the intermediate space, creating rich inner explorations.The cinematic evolution is the same one going on since the transition to sound and the same one that is carrying us to threedimensional narrative space; a better embodied exploration of worlds. The same hero myths persist in this journey, they are always a vessel for anxieties. Here we have a typical hero's journey, boring of itself but expected.The bad news? It's in the hands of a man who creates visual volume, never exploration. Malick's camera is used here as wallpaper, simply to cover surfaces, which defeats the whole idea. And he overdoes the destruction and exposition. It's the most mind-numbing thing I have seen to this day in terms of sheer visual volume, a dubious honor. Nearly half of the film is devoted to constant eruptions in a subjective eye, exploding cinematic matter. The fact that in twenty years time what we see here will be looked back as obsolete and that I'll be here to see this new blockbuster cinema tickles me ever so slightly. Just what is it going to consist of? Intriguing to imagine.A last observation. Nolan has also won this round. This isn't something I celebrate simply because I can't muster much excitement for his area of expertise, narrative architecture. But he has won and it must be noted. You'll see all over this (see also the recent Bond) his now famous scheme of anchored narrative, this is where he drops usually as many as three anchors in the story and drags in parallel; this is where as the Joker is about to storm the Dent fundraiser, we see the judge escorted to her car and handed the envelope, and the police commissioner is about to have the poisoned scotch.Malick and Nolan are the superpowers driving the cinematic world these days. One lives in the eye, the other in the mind. One tries to create a possible world for that eye, the other believes a world is the sum of its concrete parts. One finds reflection by taking a leap of faith, the other has to know it all before he can construct it. One a calligrapher, the other a geometer. Who's going to prevail?","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

'Man of Steel' gives the Superman character the 'Batman Begins' treatment, with 'The Dark Knight' creator Christopher Nolan producing the film. Director Zack Snyder is no stranger to adapting graphic novels for the big screen. He is the man behind '300' and 'Watchmen', but 'Man of Steel' is Snyders most ambitious film to date. With Superman being such a popular character with comic book fans, Snyder is under pressure to deliver a film that will please all audiences. The last time the hero took to our screens was in 'Superman Returns' which received mixed reviews and not the global acclaim it wanted. Will Snyder make Superman fly or fall?Before I go into the plot, I know that many people are anticipating the film, so I'll give away no spoilers. After his home planet of Krypton is just about to die, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his only son to earth in order for him to live his life on a new planet. His son lands on earth and struggles to find his place among humans. As he grows older he discovers his past and uses it to help humans when they come under threat by an alien called General Zod (Michael Shannon).The first 20 minutes of 'Man of Steel' are brilliant. The screen is filled with breathtaking action and stunning special effects as we see Krypton at the start of a civil war. Russell Crowe gives one of his finest performances in years and chemistry between the characters are terrific. After this thrilling opening, Snyder seems to try and rush through the script and skip all the interesting character development. We don't so much get introduced to any of the key characters as they just appear. The script doesn't play out as a film, but more like quick scenes and set pieces following each other just so we can get to the moment were Superman has to face General Zod.After skipping through the second act, we finally get to the main confrontation. Because we have skipped through the interesting part of the film, Snyder pollutes the screen with Michael Bay like action and we have around 50 minutes of head banging and bone crushing action that feels tiresome after the first 10 minutes. Whilst I admire Snyders original approach to the film, he hits the self destruct button in the last hour and lets the film become nothing more then a mindless mash up of characters flying and fighting around collapsing cities.Henry Cavill may look the part, but his Clark Kent persona is relatively boring and his Superman alter ego isn't much more appealing. The films best attribute is Michael Shannon who chews up every scene he is in. The rest of the cast are perfectly fine, but because Snyder skips through the second act we don't really get a chance to embrace any of the characters properly or enjoy the actors performances .Although the two Robin Hoods (Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe) are both great as Clark's fathers.It is clear that Snyder is a huge fan of the material and he gives Superman the whole Jesus treatment. From using Jesus Christ as a template, Snyder uses everything from making Clark a fishermen, to the world reacting to him as the second coming. This prospective on the character does make him more interesting and adds to Snyders credit for trying something new. I remember when I first saw J.J Abrams Star Trek and knew little about the film, but felt welcomed with open arms when I watched it. I do have a feeling that 'Man of Steel' is for the superman fans, and people new to the hero may feel like they are looking in from the outside.Credit for Snyder for trying something original with the character, even he does let himself down at the end. The film does feel incoherent in parts and in the end becomes its own worst enemy. 'Man of Steel' is a disappointment in comparison to the superhero films of last summer, but its full of moments that make great entertainment.Final Score 6/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If it weren't for Zod and Antje Traue I would've walked out and there are plenty of moments in the movie that will leave you with that gutted feeling. Krypton gets blown up, and Zod gets sent to the phantom zone, all in one go. The rest of the first act follows more or less the same rushed sense of pacing. You're just thrown from one event to another without any sort of momentum.Clark Kent is a fisherman=Clark Kent goes to the Arctic=Lois Lane keeps trying to find Clark Kent=Clark Kent finds Lois LaneYou see that? That's the movie.It's like the whole movie just meshed all the ideas they had on the drawing board at the time they came up with the idea for a Man of Steel movie, and threw them in this collage of non-linear ambiguity. Even the action manages to be pretty bad surprisingly enough, with none of the choreography being memorable for finally getting to see an A-list special effects treatment of a Superman movie; it's just Snyder slamming two action figures together for half an hour. As far as acting goes Shannon brings a lot of intensity to Zod that goes underused. Zod is probably the only guiding light in this ensemble. The script ends up failing this cast though. There are a lot of lines in the movie that are cringe-worthy, and moments that linger on this half-hearted/sappy sense of sentimentality for the Superman character that haven't really been earned (always accompanied by that somber 2 note piano chime). Speaking of Superman this is the first movie that manages to make Superman feel creepy. It makes sense if you think about it. You have this kid who is constantly told how special he is and he grows up to have this hyper-inflated sense of self-esteem, so much so that he'll even go through the trouble of telling you that, ""It's okay, I can do things most people can't."" Remember that kid Anthony in the Twilight Zone movie? That kid who could do whatever he wanted? That's Superman.You keep hearing how much of an impact Superman is going to bring to the world, and how he's destined for great things, this message was something that has been so forced down our throats through the advertising for the film, that you expect to get hit hard with some sort of broadened perspective about having faith in humanity, and being human, or being something greater, but none of it hits you the way it should, it just keeps getting harped on like some soulless mantra.This movie doesn't deserve a sequel or a Justice League movie, and I really wanted it to. It would've been nice to see what JJ Abrams would've done with Superman now, not back in 2006, but now. I think I'm going to keep watching Star Trek Into Darkness, or check out Lone Ranger. I wouldn't bother seeing this movie. If you're really, really, curious about it I'd wait for it on Redbox.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Anyway, I gotta say that there are more good sides to this movie than bad, so lets start with the bad and save the good stuff in the end.What disappointed me: Despite being the hottest superman ever, and doing a superb job physically, still Henry Cavill's acting could have been better. If the movie intends to make the story of Superman more humane and realistic, then Henry should have given a much deeper and/or natural performance, instead he was a bit numb at times. Second, the dialog turned very cheesy in the middle of the film, it just disconnected me from the movie and turned the most dramatic lines into comedy. Third, the action scenes were too much, I know its a Chris Nolan thing, but it was hard to keep track of the story from the numerous explosions that just prolonged the movie, at some point I didn't understand what was going on.What impressed me: The portrayal of the world of Cripton, it was very well put together (the characters, the technology, the costumes, the planet) it really does justice to the background story of Cripton and to the origins of Superman. Second, the Acting. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane give such heart-felt performances, they really give depth to the Kent family and the role they had in raising Clark/Cal. Similarly Russel Crowe and Ayelet Zurer as his real parents delivered very good performances as well. What was more impressive is the redefinition of Superman as a hero: This movie really rebuilds the character of Cal and makes him more human, instead of hiding his humanity behind the stereotypical image of Superman. The fact that not everyone was routing for Superman, waiting for him to bring them salvation and heavily labeling him as a hero throughout the whole movie. The word 'Superman' actually was only said once or twice in the whole movie. Apart from all this, the special effects were indeed out of this world!!! They were rendered magnificently by true visual effects artists who are the real heroes behind this movie. It just shows the amount of effort put in the film. Another thing that I loved is the fact that Louis knows the identity of Superman. Finally a superman movie where Louis is not such a fool and knows that Clark Kent is Superman. Its a hole that was finally filled in this movie.Well that's it basically. Like I said the good side outnumber the bad, but the bad side has a very influential role on the perception of the film, its what sadly made me leave the theater with remaining feelings of distress from the extensive action scenes and disappointment from the story, when I ought to have been amazed and excited for future sequels.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Because Superman wasn't Superman. He was an alien called Clark Kent/Kal El with great powers who didn't know exactly what to do with them or himself. On one hand told by his adopted father that he was here to do great things, and yet on the other hand told by the same adoptive father that he should conceal his powers, even if it meant a bus-load of school kids drowning in a river. Really? REALLY? When we think of Superman, we think of the guy in the blue suit who helps/saves people: A Hero. This guy wasn't really that. He was just a dude with some great powers who wondered form town to town occasionally helping people when they needed help, never staying anywhere for more than a few months. LAME! Here are the problems with the movie: 1. The acting was bad. I'll say mostly because the actors didn't have anything to work with. I love Amy Adams, but her Lois was flat, wooden, and one-dimensional. She had NOTHING of the spark and spunk that Margot Kidder brought to the role (which is surprising from someone like Adams). Same with Lawrence Fishburn's Perry White. There just wasn't anything there. There was NO distinction between the character of Clark and Superman because, as stated, there was NO Superman. His first appearance in his suit happened just before he started battling the baddies (Zod and friends) which came probably 2/3 into the movie. The characters lacked charisma and personality. In short, they lacked.... character.2. The characters didn't really blend well together. There was no chemistry between Lois and Clark. None of the banter between the characters that made their relationship so enjoyable in the original '78 film. They were essentially strangers, yet somehow were suppose to have feelings for each other. There wasn't the dynamic of Clark wanting Lois, but Lois wanting Superman, but Superman BEING Clark, but not letting her know. Again, the characters and their relationships with each other were just plain flat. Spoiler Alert: Lois knows that Clark is the superpowered alien from near the moment they met.3. Uber-destruction: Waaay too much, and needless, destruction in the fight scenes. Seriously, every time someone hit someone else, they went flying through buildings essentially destroying them, time after time, to the point where it just got downright boring. PLUS - the real Superman wouldn't have allowed the destruction to continue. That was, in fact, a plot-point in Superman 2: he LEFT the fight because it was putting people in danger. Here, there was absolutely no regard for the human lives whilst first Smallville, then Metropolis was being destroyed.4. While Michael Shannon did a fine enough job playing the ""evil"" baddie, Gen. Zod, he was no way as good as Gene Hackman's Lex Luther, who was a bad guy that you liked because he was fun. This Gen. Zod was played straight and was just another evil bad guy. He didn't even have the subtle flair that Terrance Stamp brought to the roll.Overall, as a stand alone, I probably would have given the movie a 5, or maybe even pushed to 6, but because it pales so much in comparison to the original Superman movie, which was a FAR more enjoyable viewing, I knock it down to a 4.The good points: It LOOKED good. That's about it.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Superman falls under the Nolan treatment by refocusing it's energies on reinventing him. As Nolan did with Batman he introduces Superman to the real world. Or at least as close to the way the real world works. Where Nolan directed Batman with a heavy hand and told a incredible story that spanned three chapters And in which nothing was wasted. Nolan was a perfect choice to tell The best re imaging of Batman for the screen. But Nolan wasn't the best choice for Superman. So they gave that to Zack Snyder a director who has a vision of what action should be. Where Superman returns suffered from a lack of action and a cohesive story. Snyder gives us More story and more action then you can handle and that's a good thing. My Wife who is a casual Superman fan had trouble following it but I'm a die-hard Superman fan and I understood everything. That's the basic thread I can give here. IF you're not a Superman fan and don't follow the story. You might get lost and confused along the way. But that doesn't really detract you from the sheer pleasure of watching this movie. If you are a Superman fan you'll find new twists and tweaks done to the origin that make it work better.FRom the beginning that takes place on Krypton which is as far from Donner's Krypton as possible. You get a sense of wonderment and horror. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Jor-El and he makes you understand the urgency of Krypton's situation. Crowe doesn't fall into the Marlon Brando trap. Where Brando played Jor-El with a underacting air of detachment. Crowe Gives us a Man of passion. A man of action.Kevin Costner gives us a Human Jonathon Kent a man who loves his adopted son and is terrified that the government will come for him or that people will reject him or be in terror of his power. Jon Kent teaches Clark about power about the consequences of misusing that power. The scenes detailing Clark's childhood are full of emotional impact and you get the sense of love mixed with responsibility. Kevin Costner isn't Glenn Ford but he takes the role further and shows us another side to Jonathon Kent. Caught between these two strong but different fathers Clark Kent grows into the type of man he wants to be. A man who wants to help people. A man who will become a symbol of hope and a defender. A Superman.Wonderful re imaging. The Action scenes are strong and realistic.when Superman moves it's with blinding speed, When Superman and Zod hit each other it sounds like Thunder. Nolan introduced the real world into Batman's world. and it works Nolan and Snyder introduced the real world into Superman's world and it works. It takes Superman into a darker place then he's ever been before. And it rewrites everything We knew about Superman. But it works.Henry Cavill is not Christopher Reeve, But before the purists start to argue that Reeve was the best Superman, Let me say Cavill's Superman is not meant to be Reeve's Superman. He is totally different. And He brings a totally new element to Superman. He's a Godlike being trying to be human. he's confused until the moment comes where he knows right or wrong he must make a choice and make a stand for what he believes.Man of Steel gives us a Superman for the 21st century. A Superman we need. A Superman we deserve.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No, I'm not expecting superhero movies to be all-time classics. I just think there are a few problems with Man of Steel, which detracted from my enjoyment of the film. Go see it, then see if you agree with any of my points.I'll start with the good stuff, because I did like the film overall. Spectacular cinematography. Sometimes all you need is a camera and a good eye. Fantastic job by director of photography Amir Mokri. There was thankfully no attempt to overly glam-up Lois or any of the other characters with either makeup or lighting effects. You see them warts and all, which adds a deep sense of realism and truth. It felt like an indie production at times, with just camera + actors + location, which puts a premium on acting skill. Speaking of which...Great acting. The ensemble did a great job with the dialog they were given. The biggest scene, from an emotional viewpoint, is one of Jonathan Kent's scenes. You'll know it when you see it. In general, Costner shined as Kent. He played the tell-it-like-it-is Midwesterner adoptive dad perfectly. Michael Shannon was fantastic as General Zod. As was Amy Adams as Lois Lane. And I have a huge crush on Antje Traue after seeing the film.And now for the the bad stuff. Just one sentence for each bad thing:The opening Krypton scene should have been shorter, less confusing, more compelling. The Jor-El character, as written, constrained Russell Crowe too much to allow him to really act. There was occasional poorly written dialog, especially in one scene with little Clark in school. Finally, the CGI fighting is too fast and cartoonish, like The Matrix Revolutions. Overall a 7 out of 10 in my book. Go see it and decide for yourself.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved this movie and I truly think that it's one of the best superhero films of recent times. It's not without fault but I really enjoyed it.In a nutshell, the film tells the story of both Krypton's last moments and Superman's first challenge as the protector of Earth. He has to face one of the greatest villains in DC's cannon - General Zod - disgruntled military leader and bad ass. Firstly, the special effects are amazing. A lot of people are criticising the look for the film and saying that it is dull. I found the visuals to be incredible. They weren't groundbreaking, but they will satisfy. Secondly, the film boasts an incredible ensemble cast that fit neatly into all of their respective roles. Henry Cavill is absolute perfection as Superman and Russell Crowe makes an excellent Jor-El.However, the critics are justified in some aspects of the film that they are currently criticising. The film has too much action, which in some parts is amazing, but made me feel disorientated sometimes and doesn't really work to the narrative of the story. I think the main problem with the film is that it has an incredible start and exposition, but becomes nothing more than a vehicle for the special effects department and another everyday blockbuster by it's conclusion. I personally loved it but my advice would be to see it for yourself to decide whether you love it or hate it.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The early superman films are a testament to this, and the last attempted reboot was similarly ill- fated. But when Zack Snyder decided to take a stab at it, I thought I'd give it a shot, given that he has managed to successfully translate Watchmen, and that was a very ambitious project.Sadly, however, the result was a mess of poor storytelling, sub-par acting and worst of all a soundtrack that sounds like it was dragged kicking and screaming out of Skrillex's b-sides. Every moment in the film where something large happens, you get this ""BWAAAH DIGGIDIDUN, DIGGIDIDUN, DIGGIDIDUN"" blaring through the speakers. EVERY time something powerful or dynamic fires. This is basically 70% of the movie, as it is purely a film involving Superman getting into massive fights. I couldn't have been more distracted if I tried.But to touch on the storytelling, simply put, it did nothing new, nor did it do the old ideas justice. The lead and significant other of the project are both about as flat and lacklustre as one would expect from relatively low level actors, but the worst crime is that Lois Lane is supposed to be a fiery woman, someone with independence of spirit and self-motivating. This appears intact in the beginning, but she quickly descends to a helpless irrelevant in no time.It just doesn't tick any of the boxes bar graphical flare. There's a lot of eye-candy here, but really nothing behind it. Truthfully I feel confident in saying you're not missing anything by avoiding it.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

This film is Superman as legend. Here, we get little of Clark Kent on the farm, and only a second of Clark Kent reporter; this movie is all about the epic mythology of Superman.The result is quite intense. There is a more elaborate than usual portrayal of the end of Krypton, with Russel Crowe offering an action hero interpretation of Jor-el that is far removed from Marlon Brando. It's an exciting opening with terrific special effects. Kent's childhood is mainly viewed as an alien trying to cope, and the adult Kent is an angsty hero in hiding.It's a seriously different approach to the character, but I think it's quite enjoyable. No, it's not a ""fun"" Superman battling a cartoonish Lex Luthor, nor an ""all-American"" Superman defined by his farmer parents, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. The action is terrific; much of it is basically elaborate fist fights between all-powerful beings, which is more entertaining than one might expect.The story is involving, the special effects are impressive, the acting is solid, and even though I like the Chris Reeves Superman, I'm happy to see a different approach to this well-worn material.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Having a heavily complex plot would have made this movie worse. Characters 9/10Some characters in the movie such as Clark have a good amount of character development.

Even small characters such as Clark's dad (both of them actually), were acted out amazingly. Special Effects 10/10I believe this is obvious. The effects in MoS are astounding. This is a fully action-packed movie with effects that add to the epic moments. This is an easy score for me. Music 10/10Hans Zimmer has done it again. The soundtrack for the movie is fabulous, amazing and several other things. Just by listening to it you can tell that Superman represents hope for humanity. The music makes epic scenes even more awesome and sad scenes even more emotional.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A blockbuster that gives us precisely what it promises: a well-executed story that sets the stage for an avalanche of visual effects and incredible CGI.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7622678/?ref_=tt_urv","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","6 December 2021","For the past ten years, cinema has been swamped by an avalanche of superhero movies. Each one of them, from the most famous to the most obscure, is entitled to his film, in what is still a relentless hunt for box office money. Superman, however, is apart: he has been entitled, many decades ago, to a series of films in which he was played by the iconic Christopher Reeve, but only one of those films deserves to be remembered. More recently, in 2006, we saw an honorable attempt to bring the character back into cinema... but it seems that's what it was, although I think the 2006 film had several merits and qualities. Now, we are witnessing the new resurrection and the new foray into cinema, in a blockbuster where many millions were invested, but which does quite well in its task and gives us everything it promises.Choosing Zack Snyder made me fear the worst. He's a director I don't think is skillful, he puts a lot of weight on the visual style and forgets to give us a good story. I felt calmer when I noticed Christopher Nolan's involvement in the conception of the story and the script. What the film gives us is a retelling of the same story we already know from the comic book and other films: Kal-El is the only survivor of Krypton, a planet where once lived an advanced civilization which, however, had eventually become corrupted and will explore their planet until destroy it. The film develops the last days of this planet and takes the opportunity to introduce us to characters like Jor-El and the villain, General Zod. The narrative develops very well until it reaches more or less halfway through. From there, the film loses its interest a little, as the story told loses space for successive and destructive action sequences. I particularly liked the way Lois discovers Superman's existence through her skill as a journalist, rather than (as in other films) the hero is always hiding and living a Platonic love for her.Henry Cavill was an excellent choice for the protagonist, as he has the appropriate age, the essential charisma and adapted his physical bearing to the character's demands without losing his elegance and without forgetting to know how to act. Even so, I felt that the script didn't demand a lot of dramatic or psychological charge from the actor. Amy Adams is effective and does her job well, even though the script doesn't give her anything substantial to work with. Michael Shannon was a splendid villain, giving Zod an unusual dignity: he is not a madman, a psychopath or a deranged, he is the product of a failed social conception that conceived him to do only one thing... he is not adaptable nor can he be, he is doomed to disappear with the planet he was born to defend. Russell Crowe also did an excellent job in the role of Jor-El. In addition to these names, the film features guest appearances by Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne.In addition to a pleasant story (which only loses itself a little in the second half), this film is a visual show at the level of what Snyder already used us to, with massive CGI, green screen and several other expensive resources, very well executed. There's no doubt that the film didn't skimp on the technical budget, and the result is astounding: Krypton has never been this wonderful, with amazing cities and flying creatures that look like they came straight out of ""Star Wars"" or ""Avatar"". The action scenes, particularly in the final half, are quite remarkable, with a lot of destruction and spectacular explosions, as well as incredible and visually impressive spaceships. The cinematography is beautiful, crisp, well executed and well shot, the colors are bright, clean, and the sets and costumes are very good, particularly the hero and villains costumes. The sound effects are really good, they work really well, and the whole soundtrack does an excellent job.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Who needs a few extra characters when we should concentrate on Mr Superman'Tongue in cheek all the way and leaves us just salivating for another dose of this marvellous spectacle.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Another ""meh"" movie to join the crowd with more gratuitous action scenes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2815402/?ref_=tt_urv","seangores","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33933447/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2013","I can't say I was too impressed by Nolan's rendition of the classic superhero movie, but I can't say it wasn't bad either. I came to this, in theatres, expecting anything like the 2006 Superman Returns and what I got was a blown-up Sci-Fi rendition. Being a big sci-fi fan, this actually made the movie very likable; however, I can see how this could take away from the experience for viewers like my mom who has no appreciation whatsoever for Sci-Fi. Character development was limited because of the action scenes. Action scenes were blown up like a Michael Bay movie, if not worse. I found myself not very attached to Clark, even near the end, and I was almost more attached to his nemesis.The story suffered the most. The timeline was split up with ""flashbacks"" to Clark's past childhood, in effort to represent a ""fragmented past"". Unfortunately, I don't think they pulled it off; I often found myself lost in the story, not able to actively identify where in the timeline we were. Worst of all, Nolan and his fellow writer neglected to leave in the key scene of Clark's parents finding him (key scene!). I think that if the story had been revealed in chronological order, the story could have been significantly more comprehensible, and as a result, more enjoyable. A key characteristic of any superhero movie is the scene in which the heroine discovers his/her powers; I found this scene to be very lacking. Perhaps if Nolan had taken from the screenplay of the Green Lantern (also DC), we could have a better development of the heroine. I really appreciated the prologue and the explanation of how Superman came to be. This was actually my favourite part of the movie, and it left me with a better understanding of how Superman started. I felt I had learned something.I will say it flat out: how can you make a Superman movie and not have the line ""It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman""? The whole movie I was waiting for this line but not once did I get it. You have to remember, a lot of parents come to this PG movie with little recollection of the series, but everyone knows that famous slogan. You can imagine how disappointed I was.The movie failed to do Sci-Fi correctly. This is a smaller factor, but for me, it disappointed me even more. I wish more directors had to take a basic physics course; you cannot hear anything in space – it is a void. Action scenes like the ones outside the earth's atmosphere should have no sound, but they were littered with it. We are giving these little kids the idea that they can hear in space. Likewise, there lacked explanation on how the superpowers worked. Though we were told that Clark's abilities were severely limited on Krypton-like planets, that doesn't explain how he is able to use his powers perfectly well in outer space (which has no atmosphere). Worse, the ""black hole"" idea of the two ships colliding. This is probably one of the most absurd ideas/hypotheses I have ever heard of, and this is not at all how a black hole works. In order to even create such a thing, both objects would have to be moving faster than the speed of light, which obviously wasn't the case. And even then, the matter ""absorbed"" would not just disappear. The Sci-Fi explanation left a lot to be desired.Lastly, if we are trying to portray Superman as a ""moral"" hero, I don't think he gets the title. The whole time, while he is saving Lois Lane, or some innocent bystander, we see him battling the enemies, taking down building after building of thousands of people. The least he could have done is taken the battle away from New York. Sure, the comics may have portrayed him as such, but come on, Nolan, this is your terrain. We could have developed a much deeper character with a better sense of morality!Through the gratuitous action scenes, the unchronological storyline, and the lack of sci-fi explanation, I was truly disappointed in many ways; however, Nolan's dark writing made its way back to reclaim yet another ""satisfying"" rendition of the superhero classic. Even though there were many parts to be desired, I found the performances by the actors to be accurate, and the action scenes were always ""fun"" to watch. The floor is now open to the upcoming sequel in the DC Comics Universe, the Justice League.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Man of steel is in the course of reborn procedure of old human-remote superheroes to make them closer. The intellectual legacy that Nolan built it in Dark knight episodes (and terminate it at last one!) now makes happen for Superman. It's admirable when we hear only twice ""Superman"" name during the movie that make us construe: just like Dark knight was a phoenix uprising from Batman's ash; Man of steel does same role for Superman character. I saw Nolan's spirit in every minutes of Man of steel.

You know Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink, where the premise is that the first thing you blurt out is likely to be accurate? Well, I discovered, somewhat to my own surprise, that the 1st 5 words out of my mouth were ""Too much blowing stuff up.""As a long-time comic-book fan, I really wanted to like this movie, but I can't give it any better than a 6. The things that drag it upward are all the things I liked about Spider-Man, the Dark Knight trilogy, and The Avengers. The main thing dragging it down was that it spent way too much of its 2:23 run time trying to be louder, more frenetic, and more destructive than the Transformers flicks. Some of the plot elements and dialog were a step or 2 up from Green Lantern, but that still doesn't raise them very high.The 3-D is a post-production conversion job and definitely not worth paying extra for. The main reason to see it in Imax is to get the benefit of the surround sound assaulting your eardrums for most of the pic.There's about 75 minutes of halfway decent movie in here. Too bad about all the stuffing.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was kinda surprised to see Kevin C in a movie ( don't know why). And especially his role of Superman's father. What I did not like was his overprotective/moral role to the young Superman - it is kinda cliché and useless in my opinion.

I think it's release date hurt the reception. The Dark Knight trilogy had concluded the year before and DC fans / moviegoers in general were still taking that in after a 8 year run. It set the stage for realism in comic book films, while Marvel was taking over with their lighter approach. If MOS was pushed back to 2018 or so, I think the desire and reception would have been better.In 2017, I saw Hanz Zimmer live in Dallas and it blew me away. I had to talk my wife into going initially, but she absolutely loved it. Still her favorite concert to this day. We both had our favorite sets, but both agreed the MOS set was phenomenal. Like Inception, that concert planted an idea: I need to watch MOS again. Bought the 4K blu-ray, turned out the lights, surround sound, no phone - fully committed.This movie absolutely pulled me in. Even though I'd seen it and knew how it ended, I'd forgotten the majority of it. The cast performance from top to bottom is excellent. Henry owned this role, Kevin Costner is the voice of reason, and Michael Shannon is a fantastic villian. Him screaming ""I will find him!!"" gives me chills. The cinematography with the blue saturation is beautiful, and the cgi is way ahead of its time. Add in that amazing score with an inspiring character arc - MOS is great. I watch it once a year and soak it in each time. Watch the behind the scenes if you can, it will show how much went into making this film.My 9/10 comes down to a single reason. The fight between Superman and Zod was slightly too long. I feel that it starts to wander when they're flying in the air toward the end of the fight. If that was trimmed up a bit or replaced with another type of combat, it would have been perfect imo.It took a few years and I had to revisit it, but MOS is now one of my favorite movies of all time.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The design of Krypton and the spaceships weird and surprising - nowadays must every spaceship look like some metallic-life form or bug?

I watched them in a whole new light after MOS. Superman: The Movie BluRay even with it's dated effects and cheeky character is just a better all round film. Not just as a superhero film but as a film itself. The cinematography and careful pacing are a real treat to the senses after watching MOS.Almost everything about this film was pathetic and under-served. It felt cheap, even the CGI was off in many scenes (no weight to the character, thought we'd seen the last of that in the old Hulk films but no it crops up here again - computer game cut scene quality, in fact an insult to cut scenes).Avoid it. The only redeeming feature is the lead actor playing superman with an understated 'realistic' vibe but he doesn't develop on character or personality on top of that due to the writing/direction.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Perhaps Zack Snyder should have taken a page out of Christopher Nolans (Batman Begins) book on how to reboot a franchise? ""Man of Steel"" is disjointed and fractured, you don't get time to feel anything for superman as there isn't time to get to know what he is all about. In my own opinion there is far too much information crammed into to short a time-frame, if you know nothing about superman then this movie will be fantastic for you.The worst part of this movie for me is the total lack of interaction between Clark Kent and Lois Lane, it is one of the fundamental building blocks of supermans story.""Man of Steel"" disjointed, fractured, confusing, compressed, unemotional, frustrating, lacklustre with glimpses of pure brilliance.If you want to see great super hero movies try the rebooted batman franchise or the Avengers series.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The opening scenes finally end, along with my hopes for this movie.The acting is pretty dang good, I will admit. But it could not save the movie from being what it is-a large buildup to one of the longest action scenes of your life. Honestly, they turned the movie into a contest to see who could destroy more buildings. It got so repetitive after the first few punches, that by the end you just want it to be over. And the way it actually does end is one of the stupidest things I have seen in a movie, leaving you wondering ""Why didn't that happen at the beginning of the fight..."" I have never been a huge Superman fanatic. I like him, but not enough to actually know much more than the basics. I felt this movie was geared for the hardcore fans, who know every fact about him. To be honest, I had no idea what was happening half the time in this movie, partly because of how chaotic it was, and partly because I know next to nothing about Superman himself. As we left the midnight premiere (one of my friends actually left early, due to how much he disliked it), I have never heard so many people say such bad things about a movie. The most common phrase was ""let-down"". I would frankly not recommend watching it, except for the opening scene and fantastic acting by Russell Crowe (as always).","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

You do this to us every time.I've just received information that Henry may or may not be our next Clark Kent. It's like super man 1978 all over again. You didn't leave us on a cliff hanger, you pretty much pushed us over the edge and left us lost at sea, drowning in agony wondering when the next rendition would be release. It's abusive and I just can't take it any more. Besides the facts, I think Henry Cavill did an impeccable job, i quite frank couldn't imagine another man of steel, but I guess just like Christopher Reeves, you will probably find another replacement, disgusting. Appallingly, diluting the tangibility of the brand. Imagine what Kal El would think of this abysmal twist of inconsistent depiction of his character. If he as anywhere out there, I am sure he trying to shoot laser beams at whoever is responsible for this. Otherwise, the fight scenes were epic, with a good balance of humour and suspense that kept me glued to the screen and awaiting the sequal, until i received the traumatic news of Henry's replacement.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

But I can easily say that it's my new favorite superhero movie. If you haven't already seen it you need to drop what you're doing and go see it. The action was more intense than anything I've ever seen, but at the same time wasn't overly graphic. It maintains Superman's code to be the hero who always tries to find the best in people and only fights to save the lives of innocent people. Each location was beautiful, and the CG was so well blended that it's easy to suspend belief. It's also the perfect film for Superman fans because there are a great many easter eggs spread throughout the movie. 10/10 Great movie.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Trust me when you first watch this movie you might have mixed thoughts but on your 2nd viewing you might appreciate it much more.I watch MARVEL movies with family for casual fun. I watch DC movies all alone by myself because they deal with real life struggles and teaches us to be full of hope even in the darkest moments.People usually go to movies to forget their struggles and don't want to be reminded of them, so they usually prefer lighter movies from MARVEL.This movie's cinematography,VFX, action,story,visuals will BLOW your mind and will definitely leave you feeling good.

I went in expecting to hate this movie thinking it was just another emo super hero movie that wasn't going to deliver. I saw it and overall I thought it was an enjoyable movie... I actually liked Jar El in a movie for a change. Was it overly dark, maybe a bit, but it was an enjoyable story where superman had a worthy adversary.... the plot didn't need kryptonite or make it feel like superman was holding back too much... The biggest issue I had was Jonathan Kent... he felt like the anti uncle Ben... he was there to be a downer to Clark up until a tornado took him away to that Oz beyond the stars. But as far as the villains go, I'd say I'm a big fan of Terrance Stamp particularly in the Zod role... but this Zod was enjoyable. Did it feel like it was trying to add preachier and deeper stuff not needed in a superman movie? maybe... but it was still a move you could eat popcorn while watching and not leave thinking... ""this was stupid"" granted I know quite a few out there did.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was lucky enough to experience Man of Steel yesterday at a special screening at LaFilmFest. And even though (or maybe because of) my expectations were beyond high, I was mildly disappointed. The entire movie had great CGI and eye candy, and the action was very consistent. The grand scale of the entire movie blew me away, along with the sharp score by Hans Zimmer and the sound mixing. But at times, the dialogue would completely lack subtlety and be predictable. Yes, there were good moralistic and utilitarian themes expressed near the beginning, but it lost it's traction and broke into a full blown action movie with no theme whatsoever. Now most of the actors, notably Henry Cavill's portrayal on the iconic hero, did a decent job, and yet no actor in the amazing cast truly expressed their characters. Many clichés were played across the action, such as the last-minute savior and the revealing of the villain's true form. Despite of Nolan and David Goyer writing the story and script, it lacked many fundamental elements in other Nolan movies. Which brings me to another point. I'd say Zack Snyder is a visual genius, but throughout this movie, all we see in constant racketeering of humanoid shapes and explosions that thicken your ears. The technique is obvious, but lacked much depth. Hans Zimmer's energetic score kept the movie going. The supporting characters are just god-awful. They are flat and do not develop in any way throughout the movie, nor do they have background stories or distinct personalities. Despite of all this, Man of Steel still holds up as a good movie, with thought and a drive to push forward","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","Man of Steel- Zack Snyder's Indulgent Direction Combined with David S. Goyer's Disconnected Script Gives Us a Charmless and Hopeless Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814705/?ref_=tt_urv","generationfilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22971631/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","Superman might be the iconic comic book hero that initiated the entire superhero wave after his initial arrival back in the 1930s, a time desperate for hope, justice, and truth, but a truly reflective take on the character's origin, pathos, and extraterrestrial challenges in the cinema has never been fully ventured quite possibly due to the potentially dated material but more likely having to do with a lack of understanding to what he means to us in our modern world. Even the lighthearted Richard Donner version in 1978 with all of its good intentions doesn't live up to the magnetism of the comic and it's usually wise not to even mention the cringe worthy Superman Returns from Bryan Singer who figuratively dropped a load of kryptonite on the poor unsuspecting hero. The latest addition in the canon Man of Steel comes from an odd combination of creative minds, including writer/producer Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins/The Dark Knight), screenwriter David S. Goyer (Dark City, Batman Begins), and director Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) all of whom attempt to ignite a newer, darker version of the Superman origin but inevitably become the film's own weakening kryptonite. Man of Steel is practically indistinguishable from your typical blockbuster variety where relentless action sequences have the destruction upped to the nth degree and narrative takes a back seat to the monstrous visuals, a quality to which director Zack Snyder is all too familiar. In all of Snyder's films from the light on story 300 to the unfortunate ruination of a graphic novel in Watchman plot substance and subtle characterization all get overshadowed by his visual palate, which is arguably his best quality and it continues in Man of Steel. However, despite the technically impressive sequences that also seem soulless there is also an apparent weakness that directly lies in Goyer's disjointed and arguably weak script that is devoid of the known charm, wit, and most importantly hope that is associated with the famed and beloved superhero. Overall Man of Steel becomes a heaping disappointment not only in its blatant disregard of the Superman canon, where the familiar seems bland and the unfamiliar becomes unwelcome, but also because the film's spectacle pummels its own substance into the ground with an outcome that feels disconnected, frenzied, and hopeless, which are qualities that shouldn't exist in a Superman film.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-zz; More reviews: generationfilm.net","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Without any spoilers, this is how it was for me: The non-linear storytelling is a nice format; though it's not particularly well done, it serves the purpose. The visual effects and overall CG are the best I have ever seen in any motion picture or video. Any motion picture so far, hands down. All the fights and flying scenes are hyper-real, and whenever lasers were involved, I found myself audibly gasping. However, after a little while, it tends to get a wee bit tedious. The relationships in the movie are not particularly well developed, and some people are stupid/helpless enough at times that you want to scream at them. -_- Especially unconvincing is the ""bond"" between Superman/Lois. Though there are no plot-holes per se, the story is fairly predictable, but then it is Superman after all. :) The dialogues serve their purpose but are OK at best. The score by Zimmer is excellent, though nothing new for him. My only main complaint was that this movie, in a way, compromised Superman's ideology of maintaining peace and order while stopping his villains; not once in any previous movie or graphic novel has he deliberately or otherwise caused this large a scale of random destruction. Sure, his enemies were overpowered and what not, but he should have been shown to try and be more cautious is all. Overall, quite a visual treat; some scenes could have been cut, but it's well worth the money either way.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is an imperfect Superman just trying his best in an imperfect world. It's also not yet a DCEU movie: it stands for itself and on its own, and in contrast to its sequel BvS, this movie is not burdened with exposition of a cinematic universe.We meet a Superman who is still learning how to use his powers for the greater good and is faced with situations and decisions that make him choose only the lesser evil. The entire world depicted here is fairly dark. This is not as child-friendly as Christopher Reeve's Superman and certainly not everyone's taste, but the tone is consistent and the movie stays true to itself.In contrast to the chaos that was Batman v Superman (2015), this movie is not 50% advertisement for a cinematic universe. It would have loved to see the story of Men of Steel progress on its own. Too bad they over-accelerated the sequels instead of giving the story and characters time to grow.One more thing: the movie is filmed with ""shaky cam"" for virtually every scene. For whatever good artistic reason that might be intentional, sometimes it's really annoying. And that's the worst I can say about this movie.Would watch again.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was definitely the most serious and realistic ( OMG I'm calling Superman realistic smh lol) take. This isn't an outright compliment,the seriousness did serve as both a and a con. One thing I did not miss was bozo the clown running around calling himself Lex Luthor. If and when this series tackles Lex I hope he's done more in the vane of Smallville and DCUs serious take.

Don't expect the Superman of 1978, but honestly does he have a place in our breakneck speed world? The core values will always have a place, and they still do here. Kal-El still saves as many humans as he can, still stays humble when he should, and still represents the best in us. But this time he does it with some spectacle. With some power and speed.

Each punch and move feeling weighted, not to talk about the accompanying level of destruction when such beings clash.The acting is beyond satisfactory, from the incredible physique Henry Cavil achieved to the convincing Michael Shannon; each actor did amazingly to embody the character and bring emotion to the screen.What this movie lacks is a proper plotline. The story feels at times stitched together; some scenes can come off as out of place or misplaced. The story and character choices are good, well thought-out but the execution of important/key scenes is poor. Again, not the story but the execution of key scenes.

If the driving factor of a plot lacks solidity or composition then the story will most surely feel unbelievable or ridiculous.It still is a good movie; the cinematography and visual CGI is unseen for 2013 but the lack of a proper plotline burdens the watching experience. I recommend watching it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I guess that the man in red and blue never quite appealed to me as much as the more flawed Batman. So I was vaguely aware that ""Man of Steel"" received a critical drubbing but no more than that.Now having seen the movie I have to say that the critics were right. The story feels weirdly incoherent with lots of action that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This is doubly true in the first thirty minutes when Krypton blows up (hardly a spoiler) but it remains true with every additional destroyed building.This might be fine if the characters were appealing and the dialogue meaningful but it's a fail there too. It all feels so wooden with long passages inserted just to explain what we're meant to be feeling. Where's the love?Still I appreciate what the filmmakers are trying to do. ""Man of Steel"" is much more a sci-fi movie than a Superman film with the whole premise of his appearance changing everything for humanity nicely set up. From that angle it's a decent flick but far from a great one.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The biggest complaint I've had from friends is that no kitties are saved, to that I say superman doesn't have to be light hearted all the time. He needs to provide hope and he does that in this film.

Henry Cavill was definitely the right choice to play the 'Man of Steel' and totally nails it in the role. All the other cast members are good, too, but it's Henry who carries the film. Yes, Man of Steel is darker than the average Marvel superhero film, yet not as dark as the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Plus, because Superman's story/powers are more 'fantastical' than Batman's, it has an 'Avengers feel' to some of the (many) action sequences.As a modern and darker reboot of the Superman legend, it definitely works and fans of the comic shouldn't be too disappointed with the direction it's heading. A lot of people weren't happy with the choice in director (Zack Snyder – 300, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead 2004), but he seemed to handle the big budget and the various – expected – action scenes. My only gripe was that a lot of the action felt quite computer generated. It would have been nice if it looked as gritty and real as the rest of the film was trying to be. But, overall, I'm looking forward to seeing how the franchise continues.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Anyway, we plopped in our seats with our 3D glasses and watched the film. When the action finally started in Smallville, I was like ""This... Is... HAPPENING!!"" The action was obviously more physical than any other movie I've ever seen. The 3D, however, didn't enhance the spectacle of violence galore, and I believe it could've done well without it. When I noticed that the soundtrack wouldn't include the original works from John Williams, I thought to myself, ""Will I miss that?"" NOBODY misses the old music score. The soundtrack is both beautiful and original thanks to Hans Zimmer. When the final credits rolled onto the screen, my friends and I got up from our seats and rolled out of the theater.

It would be quite challenging to name very many kids who have not imagined themselves as Superman at some point during that time. Numerous Superman re-boots have occurred in various media: comics, TV, movies, video games, toys, etc., and the bigger the fan, the more etched in mind what the Man of Steel should look and act like. Woe to the filmmaker who doesn't share that fan's vision.Enter director Zack Snyder, writer David S Goyer, and writer/producer Christopher Nolan. This triumvirate has been responsible for such comic based movie material as The Dark Knight franchise, 300, Watchmen, and Blade. Some of the criticisms of this most recent Superman presentation include a lack of fun, the absence of humor, no love story, too much backstory, an overabundance of action and CGI, and a hero that is much too serious ... and that's a list ignoring the outcry over the redesigned suit sans red briefs. As with anything, the closer to the heart, the less amenable to change folks become. At least no one is complaining about the lack of phone booths!This movie has quite the balance of visual effects and backstory. It's clearly designed to be the first in a series, and because of that, we get the foundation of Superman: the rare natural born baby on the planet Krypton - a planet speeding towards destruction. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) executes his plan to save his newborn son Kal-El by rocketing him off to Earth. While that's happening, General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages one of the most ill-timed coups ever ... he tries to seize control of the dying planet. This opening sequence is filled with some of the biggest, loudest effects of the whole movie. It's a jolting start that I wasn't particularly fond of, but it's obviously well done and with purpose. Kal-El lands on earth and becomes known as Clark Kent, adopted son of Kansas farmers played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. Most of Clark's childhood is glimpsed through flashbacks of specific events, and serves the purpose of giving us a taste, while not delaying the appearance of Superman ... though that name is only heard once (maybe twice). In an attempt to hide his powers, Clark becomes a drifter. However, it's impossible to keep your superhero powers secret when you rescue a group of oil rig workers by using your super strength. Enter Daily Planet super-reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She's good at her job and easily figures out the big secret. But rather than contact TMZ for a giant pay day, Lois understands that this may be something the world just isn't ready to hear. Wise lady. The relationship between Lois and Clark is rudely interrupted by the reappearance of General Zod and his right hand lady-warrior (Antje Traue). See, Zod thinks he can takeover Earth and re-establish his Krypton roots ... and Superman holds the key to his plan.If you are a Superman fan, all of this makes perfect sense. If not, I suspect this movie will not hold much interest for you. If you are a fan of the 1978 version with Christopher Reeve, I would encourage you to keep an open mind. While that version wallowed in frivolous whimsy, this one is a bit darker and more philosophical ... what you might expect from an alien with super powers. Still, the subtle humor abounds here if you keep your eyes open. LexCorp references appear along with little touches that can bring a smile (12th ranked Kansas Jayhawks football??). The acting is superb throughout. Henry Cavill was the runner-up to Daniel Craig for the James Bond role, but he immediately stakes his claim to the Man of Steel. His overall look and amazing physique leave little doubt that he is Superman, and as a bonus, he is plenty of reason for the ladies to purchase a ticket. Hans Zimmer makes no attempt to one-up John Williams' iconic score from the 1978 film, yet he makes his mark, especially during the action sequences. Be prepared as this one is heavy on the Sci-Fi angle, and there is also an interesting Jesus comparison that can be made (he is 33 years on Earth).Do the right thing has always been the recurring theme for Superman and this movie version helps us understand where the moral fiber was born ... the hint is in the Royals shirt Clark wears. In addition to a terrific Smallville set, we get Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, a role which will surely be expanded in the sequel. It's very interesting to see the Snyder, Goyer, Nolan vision, and if you are still clinging to 1978, you might ask yourself ... Why so serious?","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, without divulging information relevant to the storyline...I was pleasantly surprised to see the direction the movie took from the very beginning...doing what most movies do not - providing some much needed info about what happens up 'til this point.It is due to the lack of that fact that so many movies fail I think...they jump into a plot and a great deal of the viewers are lost as to what happened to the characters(s) that got them to this point.So if you are into a great story that is explained in better fashion than your regular movie does and with no shortage of action...you will like the ride I think.Throw in a handful of good actors and some ""under the radar"" ones and you have yourself a great movie.Bravo to the creators except for the title...I would think there would have been a lot of better ideas than what they gave.

I have waited, sometimes impatiently, for the time to finally come when I could see the movie. Last night was finally the night. Michael A. Lewis and I dressed in full costume as Superman and General Zod. That alone was a blast and I can't think of anyone else who I would have rather had that experience with, who would even consider doing it with me at our ages. We arrived at the 7 pm pre screening and I was a little disappointed in the turnout. The theatre was only about two thirds of the way full. I think that with all of the marketing for the movie they failed to capitalize on the pre screening. I monitor all of the Man of Steel web pages and I didn't even know about the pre screening until it was brought to my attention by Karen Lewis, if that tells you anything. We then proceeded to attend the midnight premiere at a different theatre. This crowd was a bit more like what I expected. They actually were forced to cancel another movies viewing to show Man of Steel on an additional screen because the demand was so high and sales were so strong.On to the movie review...Again, I had very high expectations for this movie given the cast and the director and production team and what I have come to expect from them individually. I must say, with as high as my expectations were, I was pleasantly surprised to see my expectations soared past. The movie screams of Zack Snyder's involvement (which is good, as I'm a Snyder fan). But it also has some things you won't expect. I will say that about 70% of the movie is going to be full of things you have never seen before. Anywhere. Ever. And it will blow your mind if you let it. The actors were stellar in their roles and the character development is some of the best I have ever seen in any movie, let alone the Superman franchise. Christopher Meloni was the big surprise for me as far as the cast goes. I didn't realize how integral his role would be and HE NAILED IT hard. General Zod is the primary ""villian"" in this movie and Michael Shannon made it his and made it amazing. He did a phenomenal job of humanizing the character to the point that you genuinely feel for his plight. Terrence Stamp was never able to do that in my opinion in the earlier incarnations of the franchise.I'm not going to go into too much detail about the plot revelations or all of the individual character development because I think that it's important for everyone to see this film for themselves. Even if you aren't a Superman fan, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I know of one ardent anti Superman friend who went to the midnight premiere and walked away a believer in the reboot and had nothing but glowing reviews.My final review is that the movie genuinely deserves a ten star rating on a one to ten scale, with ten being a superb cinema experience that can't be missed. If you go to see only one film this summer, this should be it. It has something for everyone regardless of your taste for Superman and has set the bar as high as I think that it could have. The movie has very little light profanity and simulated sci fi violence, but I don't think that should stop you from taking your kids to see it, as it is far less violence than most movies nowadays. Please see this movie. You'll thank me in the long run","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

With baby Kal El, his father (Russell Crowe) also sends the ""codex"", Krypton's genetic database. He sends the child to Earth, where hopefully a better life awaits. 30 years later, Kal-El - renamed Clark Kent - faces an existential crisis, just when fellow Kryptonians Zod and co catch up, intent on terraforming Earth and taking back the codex.If you're coming at this having seen Nolan's epic Dark Knight trilogy, that should give you a good taste of the present film's strengths and failures. What it doesn't prepare you for is an unfortunate mismatch between source material and treatment. Where the Dark Knight is an inherently troubled character whom you can imagine in a real- world environment, it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to shoehorn Clark Kent and his doppelgänger into a gritty environment. This Snyder, Nolan, Goyer and co attempt admirably in places, and watching young Clark go from one identity to the next every time a crisis forces him to use his powers is an interesting new spin on the character, Superman as a fugitive... sorry, not Superman: the Man of Steel. This is an important distinction, one very much sought by the creative trio, and one achieved through the deletion of many previous film adaptations' tropes: gone are the red underpants, but gone is also the silliness of the premise (the greatest hero on Earth hides behind a silly grin and glasses), and with it some of the conditioning that might help your suspension of disbelief, for with the ponderous tone and insistence on ""realism"" - forsaken where convenient - come plot contrivances that grate all the more: Lois Lane is always in the right or wrong place at the right time, something a more light-hearted film would have just presented at face value but this film feels compelled to justify, however flimsy the premise. Young Clark sacrifices a loved one to preserve a secret that, given previous scenes, should already be severely compromised. Etc.For those of us who know - and have loved - the Dark Knight series, the expected carry- overs from that franchise are all present: naturalistic camera-work, spectacle, and structural issues with the narrative. Unfortunately the latter weighs very heavily in this instance: anyone who's ever heard of Superman knows he comes from a doomed planet. Why force us to sit through a half-hour prologue there? This not only answers questions nobody particularly cared about, but creates a number of bizarre plot holes. Several fundamental character motivations also make very little sense in light of these scenes, such as sending the Man of Steel to save a world his very presence endangers...Again, these would all be minor niggles in a more light-hearted film, but as the creative trio have insisted and make clear every step of the way, we are meant to take this film very seriously, in all its bloated Christ-allegory glory. For the parallels exist and are layer on pretty thick, and if this doesn't make Clark Kent/Jor El hard to empathize with, then his indestructibility certainly will. The spectacle is amazing, almost to the point of becoming an experimental light and sound show, but the dramatic stakes are close to inexistent, what with the two main opponents being invincible. This means that by the third time Zod or Kal El get thrown through the supporting structure of a skyscraper, you'll be looking at your watch. Speaking of urban destruction, something Hollywood seems to think we will never have enough of, rather than be targeted to intimidate, as in the Dark Knight Rises, or grandiose and silly, as in the Avengers, the chaos in this film introduces jarring 9/11 parallels that further harm the logic of the story. How are we meant to cheer Kal El for throwing Zod through a building when the director spends ages insisting on the human suffering this creates? So many times, the film's schizophrenic desires to be both an action blockbuster and a serious drama cancel each other out.This is not Superman as you knew him, but that matters little. Is this ""Man of Steel"" up to the premise set by his makers, one consolidated by a brilliant, soulful first trailer? Sadly, most of the implicit promises made by the film in those trailers amount to very little: the madness of Michael Shannon's Zod is severely underused, and what few clips showed potential lack punch when played in their context; rather than give Kal El a beautiful home-world to yearn for and a tragic origin, the prologue only creates plot-holes and delays the real drama; the slight humor hinted at by the trailer's end is scarcer than you might imagine... Many have blasted this film for being so joyless, and that is a perfectly valid gripe, but then grittiness can be a virtue when we care about the characters, which is the film's most crushing shortcoming. This is something Avengers, and at the other end of the spectrum, the Dark Knight, got just right.Finally, one wonders how Man of Steel will live down mass critical appraisal now that its thunderous opening is behind it, and how well it will stand up to repeat viewing. It is brave and admirable in that it tried to take a cultural icon and transform it into something contemporary and relevant, let alone credible. That in the end it failed so dismally is more baffling than tragic.But this was all the Man of Steel. Thankfully we will always have the real Superman.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Three of the most anticipated movies of the year also caused the most Internet rampaging following their releases: STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (which I liked), IRON MAN 3 (which I really liked), and MAN OF STEEL. You see the pattern I'm establishing here? Yes, I liked this movie too. It's got a decent story, a nice update to the hero, and an excellent villain, and I was thoroughly entertained. MAN OF STEEL is the latest in a long lineage of Superman films that spans more than thirty years so there was a lot of hope and some high expectations for many people going in. From Zack Snyder (the director of 300 and WATCHMEN) and screenwriter David Goyer (the BLADE films and Nolan's BATMAN series) have brought us a new image of the legendary Kryptonian that seems to fit with today's more cynical sensibilities. A total reboot of the film series, the movie begins with Jor-El launching his son Kal from the doomed planet of Krypton while simultaneously ending an attempted coup from General Zod. Zod is captured and sent to the Phantom Zone, Krypton implodes, and Kal-El arrives on Earth. Flash forward thirty-three years, Kal-El (now Clark Kent) travels the world going from job to job on his never-ending search for clues to his past. Just as he discovers the truth behind his heritage, General Zod, now free from the Phantom Zone, arrives at Earth with his evil Kryptonian entourage and the desire for vengeance.This is not the Superman of previous film incarnations. In hopes of recreating the billion dollar ticket sales of Christopher Nolan's BATMAN series, this Superman is dark and brooding. Clark Kent is no longer a bumbling goof; he's a chiseled statue of a man who wanders from job to job in quiet contemplation, helping those in need before disappearing again. He's got a quiet charm, a strong sense of personal honor, and a desire to be the best man he can instilled by his human adoptive father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner, a nice treat). A massive tonal shift compared to all the previous films where Superman was the icon of ""truth, justice, and the American way"" with a wink and a smile. The same can be said of the new Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She couldn't be farther from Margot Kidder's portrayal. The new Lois is tough as nails without any of the manic energy. This is par for the course for MAN OF STEEL. It has none of the light-hearted humor we anticipate with these films, instead opting to take itself seriously. Which is fine, if a little jarring at first. It's interesting to see a serious take on the Superman mythos. In the original films, the world just sort of accepts Superman's presence without much of a response. Alien superhero who can fly and perform amazing superhuman feats? Oh, OK. In the new movie, it tries to give it a more realistic foundation. When evidence of super-powered aliens goes public, the government goes nuts and grabs the biggest guns it can find. Superman's first appearance before the world is proving he can be trusted, and General Zod gives him the opportunity to do just that.Zod (Michael Shannon) is the best part of this film. He is one intense dude and, even better, he's three-dimensional. Zod in SUPERMAN II was nothing more than a menacing face with superpowers. He wanted to dominate Earth for no other reason than his evil nature. In MAN OF STEEL, he is fulfilling his destiny. The Kryptons in the movie had adopted a form of population control in which children were genetically created and bred to fill a role in their society (which happened to be one of Jor-El's biggest complaints, as it eliminated free will). When Zod arrives at Earth, he has vengeance in mind, sure, but he's also continuing on his predestined path as a warrior and protector of Kryptonian society. He intends on recreating Earth in Kryton's image and using an item called the ""codex"" to begin repopulating the planet with his people. It just so happens that Jor-El sent the codex to Earth with Kal-El, so it provides even more reason for Zod to take out his El-related frustrations. He's a man with a purpose and he truly believes that eliminating the human life on the planet is in his people's best interest. Now that's an interest character.There seem to be three major complaints with MAN OF STEEL. The first is a spoiler from the end of the film. I'm not going to detail it here but you can find plenty of complaints about it scattered around the web. All I'm going to say is I support the movie's decision, I think it was done well, and I know what their intention in doing it was. I'm cool with it. The second is the fact that the movie contains some of the most blatant product placement I've ever seen in a film. IHOP, 7-Eleven, Sears, etc. Boom! Right there in your face. It was a little distracting. And finally, the violence. There is a lot of action in this film. More than all of the other Superman films combined. Not just simple hand-to-hand combat, we're talking epic level destruction. Metropolis and Smallville are left in near total ruin following the events of the film. This is what happens when super-powered individuals get into a scuffle, especially since one of them is new to the game and has never been in a fight. He doesn't have total control. He's just swinging wild and mean and hopes he wins. People would complain because Superman movies never had killer action scenes, because what sort of fight is Gene Hackman gonna put up. Well, here we go. Enough to cover all six movies. I dig it.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Emotionally powerful, Surprisingly deep and absolutely SUPER","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814148/?ref_=tt_urv","xamtaro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19392148/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2013","Said to be the second most recognisable symbol on the planet, Superman has for the longest time been a mainstay in comic books and animation across the globe. On the big screen however, he is a product of a cheesier time. Richard Donner created a magnificent fairy tale in 1978, Richard Lester showcased campy comedy (we will not speak of Sidney J Furie) and Bryan Singer gave a dramatic yet mellowed epilogue to Superman. Now Man Of Steel seeks to bring Superman out of the realm of fairy tales and into reality by looking at the man behind the symbol and what events in his life made him choose to become the much loved protector of mankind..Those coming expecting a ""superman"" movie are bound to be disappointed. There is a reason why the title is ""MAN of Steel"". It focuses on the humanity of Kal-El. ""Superman"" is the symbol, and we have no interest in such a symbol of perfection. Here is the story of Kal-El, with all his human imperfections, all his doubts, his inner conflicts of morality and choice. This is the tale of the man behind the symbol and in telling that tale, the production team makes Superman easy to relate to. Childhood ostracizing for being ""different"", choosing to do what is right over what is necessary, to listen to dad or to disobey, being put in a hopeless situation where any choice would have dire consequences. All these are things people go through everyday, and here Kal-El runs the gamut of truly human experiences writ large. This is not a ""Superman movie"" but a retelling of the events that makes Kal-El CHOOSE to become Superman, a symbol of truth and justice.What is immediately apparent in this movie, especially to those who had watched previous Superman films, is how the creators built upon feedback from fans. Previous movies were too talky and draggy, hence the absolutely brisk pace of this one. Previous movies had campy romance, a light hearted tone and cheesy plots, hence this one is dead serious, barely hints at romance and contains a deep story. Previous movies had feats of strength but disappointing action and no immediate physical equal to Superman, well this movie is just brimming with stunning action sequences and hyperpowered fights. The latter of course is the main draw for most action blockbuster fans here with Zack Snyder bringing his keen eye for comic book action to the forefront. Here, he eschews his usual slo-mo ramping and long pans for hyperkinetic hand-held filming with almost no slow motion at all. The resulting battles reflect clashes between beings blessed with superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability, giving their all and pounding the crap out of one another.Where Man of Steel truly shines however is not in its action but in the softer moments. The flashbacks where we see pivotal events in young Clark's past that affects the choices he makes in his present. The chemistry of the cast, particularly Henry Cavill as Kal-El, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russel Crowe as Jor-El, t cements the fathers/son relationship and makes for a good many emotionally powerful moments. All this is set to the awe inspiring soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Explosive at times yet poignant and pensive, Zimmer's score reflects a man, a stranger, struggling with the weight of the world on his shoulders. At points, the score adopts a haunting and alien sound evoking Kal-El's kryptonian heritage.For all it's worth, Man of Steel does feel a tad bit truncated. It feels like reading the study notes of classic literature insteadof reading the story itself. Plot threads are opened and resolved in what feels like minutes. Clark Kent's journey of self discovery across the globe suddenly segues into his quest to uncover an ancient kryptonian vessel, then all of a sudden he is fighting Zod. Lois Lane spends all of 10 minutes obsessing about her mysterious savior. There is a plot about how the world would react should they discover that an alien were hiding among them but we never see that. When Kal-El is surrendered to Zod it could have been a powerful ""Jesus is handed to the romans"" metaphor but it never feels that way since Kal-El is still largely unknown to the world. The plot feels like there was a lot more planned for this movie but was cut for time. It feels like watching the theatrical cut of Zack Snyder's Watchmen, only with the subsequent Director's cut and Ultimate cut was the full Watchmen story realised.But dig between the lines, and Man of Steel reveals itself to be a true thinker's movie. From the get go, we are faced with the question of nature vs nurture: does one's genetics determine one's course in life or is it one's upbringing? The moral ups and downs of eugenics leads into larger musings on moral philosophy: does the ends justify the means? Can survival of one come at the cost of another's life? And finally, the all famous ""free choice vs pre-determinism"" question seen in the Kal-El/Zod dichotomy.So is Man of Steel a good movie? Definitely. It is solid entertainment, it takes its comic book roots seriously instead of turning it into a comedy like what Marvel does, it ramps up the action yet finds the time to rope in some deep thinking themes. Is it a good ""Superman"" movie? highly questionable. It is not a ""Superman"" movie per se. Ultimately, one must remember that this is not a movie about the symbol of ""truth justice and the American way"" that is Superman. This is a story about a man. A man with the powers of a god, but ultimately still a man with all the trappings of his human upbringing. A man out to discover himself and his purpose in this world.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Clark Kent is a guy from the 1930's, at least his costume seems to belong to that era.So putting the guy in new clothes is one thing, the other is transporting the movie visuals and action in a temporary style that can compete with the latest Marvel universe blockbusters. So what is more obviously and a safe bet than stealing from every movie that fits somehow into the genre: Alien Invasion, INDEPENDENCE DAY, destroying the city: TRANSFORMERS, flying dragons: AVATAR, emotional flashbacks: GLADIATOR. Finally, the whole thing written by Nolan, gives you a - typical Nolan like - confusing and bloated pseudo intellectual story, of a flying Batman - Spider-man bastard thing saving the world of Gotham City or so.Obviously the whole thing was planed with military precision to be a financial success with the result, that Superman has lost his identity and charm which was probably unavoidable when you try to catapult a 80 year old concept into something fresh.Snyder bombards the audience with short emotional vs. action pieces without giving you enough time to reflect what kind of feelings he wants to transport. Like in a video game, there are always hints whats coming next so that the gamer/viewer does not get to frustrated with the many - Nolan like - boring lengthily dialogues.BTW some hints are quite hidden: the fuel tankers from the ""LexCorp""...The cast is quite good except Michael Shannon as Zod, who seems to be somehow rather hysterical than cool and mean. The score by Zimmer is bombastic. Overall the flick just o.k. with some bad moments.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

People who say this was a bad film clearly know nothing about film or Superman. Three popular points of criticism arose by the majority of people who saw this epic film. #1-destruction that Superman caused was unheroic; Snyder did a great job being loyal to the comics and the superman cartoons by showing mass amounts of destruction to the areas of where fights take place. #2-too much action clouded the plot; In reality, the heavy action actually made the film seem like a real superhero movie as we got to see superman grow into a better fighter with every fight. #3-no chemistry between Lois Lane and Clark Kent; the relationship is fairly obvious between the two characters it's just that an action scene is soon followed by their romantic scenes which clouds their heavy romance. Personally, I like it better that way so you leave the film thinking it's an action flick. Too many times in superhero movies, the plot is too focused on the romantic relationships and ends up making the movie less epic. Thor 2 would've been way better had it contained more action with Thor and less focus on Jane.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The rest of the movie is quite long and drawn out. The back story is of course, crucial, and you know that Marvel is going to make another movie after this. However, I hope that Batman vs. Superman doesn't move as slowly as this movie does. One other thing that disappointed me was that there was hardly any chemistry between Lois Lane and Clark Kent. They do share a kiss and fall in love, but the scene feels so awkward and forced, and during the rest of the movie you'd be content to believe they were just friends and that there was no attraction at all. The one saving grace is that Henry Cavill is gorgeous and he makes for amazing eye candy. But as a superhero movie, it's quite slow and for how long it is, it can be a drag to get though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Our all time favorite superhero returns to the BIG screen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814488/?ref_=tt_urv","BallerinaWick","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33944761/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2013","*****THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***** For all the comic and movie lovers around the world perhaps Superman happens to be one of the all time favorite superhero's of all time. We have tried to imitate him by tying a towel around our shoulders, we have worn T-shirts with the famous 'S' symbol on it, we have action figures of him, and we use his name in quotes, tag-lines and what not. After a long wait the ""MAN OF STEEL"" returns to the big screen in a gigantic way. Warner brothers, DC comics and the Director 'Zack Snyder' and his team had a humongous pressure and responsibility on their shoulders to RE-BOOOT the Superman franchise. So to ensure they don't blow this out of proportion they got the perfect technician on board 'Sir Chris Nolan' as one of the writers of the movie, which was a good move. I liked this Superman movie comparing to others because it provides background information on Superman's origin, his parents, why he lands on earth, his childhood, how does he finds about his power, his fears, all in a structured way. I think none of the earlier Superman movies did that. I also found out his real Krypton name which I didn't know before. All I can say is you would thoroughly enjoy the movie from start to end, so go for it and take the flight with the 'MAN OF STEEL' and watch him fight for his loved ones. I give this movie a 9/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It gave Man of Steel more of the needed time to establish the moral person behind Kal-El. And, those efforts at making Kal-el humane, and at exploring his psyche have bear fruit. In later films, DC has tried to do it without the collaboration of S. Goyer and Nolan, but unfortunately, the two main writers of The Dark Knight Trilogy don't seem to be replaceable.The huge problem of this film lies within the climax. That climax is a total rip-off of Roland Emmerich's work. People are running, Metropolis is being destroyed by a giant spaceship, and Superman is bashing many, many, many buildings, going into space, destroying satellites, and returning on earth to destroy more buildings. One of the worst climax of the 2010s.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Incredible intro on Krypton with superb concepts on technology, society, and design. I love all the special effects related to Krypton. Solid score with very deep bass. Nice explosive action. Well done 3D, if not necessary for enjoyment. Interesting story. The making of superman is well handled. You can understand how came to be how he is. Lois Lane is finally a real character with nice depth and a good role in the tale, well incorporated within the story. Excellent choices of mothers and fathers. Zod is magnificent and really annoying. Nice acting.The actors. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Diane Lane are just perfect for their role. On the other hand, Henry Cavill was better at acting Kent before he became Superman, although I have to hand it to him for not making the stalwart figure dull and boring.The bad. When the explanation is given to the child, it is done too quickly. It's just off by a bit, but with a little better timing, they would have pulled it off. Lousy take on the breathing and the atmospheric conditions. Dull way to handle super being versus super being. The ugly. Just a few token shots are given to the nations outside the US. It would have been better just not to talk about them.The result. Excellent entertainment. You should see it, if super heroes do not bore you. A must see on IMAX for the image, but the sound as well.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A loud, deafening cacophony of ""meh""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2823336/?ref_=tt_urv","Jeremy_Urquhart","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2013","And so the disappointing year in movies that has been 2013 so far continues with Man of Steel. This was one of the year's most anticipated movies, and with good reason. Movie-goers were bombarded by trailers that promised epic action right alongside an intimate and moving character study/ origin story. Zack Snyder had proved he was capable of making of making good superhero movies with 2009's Watchmen, and Christopher Nolan's involvement as producer/ co- writer was promising, seeing as he was behind three recent Batman films that were all of very high quality. Add to that the fact that the cast was full of well-known, talented actors, and it's no wonder excitement was so high for this movie.I guess it all ended up sounding to good to be true. This film tries to be so many different things at once, and this leads to a number of problems that I personally found very hard to overlook. I think most people are going to find the jumps between scenes in this movie very jarring. We often go from overblown action scene to quiet, drawn out character moment without any warning whatsoever. Watching this movie sometimes feels like riding a malfunctioning roller- coaster- you might think it's fun, and you might even have a little bit of fun, but you'll be concerned the whole time because you never really know where the damn thing's going. I'm all for surprises and a lack of predictability in movies, but tonally it needs to be consistent, and changes between scenes have to feel smooth and comfortable. Otherwise the movie just ends up feeling vague, and this makes it hard to really get into the film's events. When scenes aren't transitioning awkwardly into other scenes, they're usually dragged out for too long. This movie makes both the dialogue scenes and the action scenes fairly boring at times, which is kind of crazy when you think about it. The middle third of the movie is quite uninvolving, filled with flashbacks happening that come out of nowhere, and painfully drawn out and repetitive monologues about ""destiny"" and ""what it means to be a hero"" and so on. Then we get to the final act of the film, which involves so much senseless and repetitive fighting and destruction that what should be a grand and exciting finale becomes tedious and dull to watch. The special effects are quite amazing, but they do start to overstay their welcome after a while. There's only so many times we can see a building fall down, Superman punch someone, a vehicle explode, or a bad guy throw Superman through a building before it gets old.The writing's pretty off too. As mentioned before, the story doesn't flow too well and the film as a whole never really finds its groove, awkwardly transitioning between a disaster movie, an origin story, an alien invasion movie, a superhero film, and even a coming of age movie (sort of). The dialogue leaves a lot to be desired as well, with a lot of unnatural sounding dialogue and quite a few attempts at humour that fall flat.But it's not all terrible though. As mentioned before, the special effects are stunning, as are the action scenes before they become tiresome. Hans Zimmer delivers another effective score as well. Performances are decent too, particularly Crowe and Costner; in fact, I enjoyed the scenes with these actors in them the most. Russel Crowe's kind of the star of this movie for the first fifteen minutes in an opening sequence that depicts the destruction of Superman's home planet Krypton, and honestly, I would've much rather watched a movie exclusively about the fall and destruction of this planet than the muddled, occasionally very dull movie we actually got. Also, sequels are set up, which could always be good if done right. I'm not holding my breath in excitement, but I will remain somewhat open to the idea that this (eventual) franchise can redeem itself. I didn't hate this movie, and there is stuff here that can be enjoyed, but I ultimately still left the theatre very disappointed, mainly because I felt that this film showed almost all the major problems of mediocre big budget Hollywood action blockbusters these days. - Predictable storyline that plays it safe, and contains very few legitimately unexpected moments? Check. - An emphasis on special effects and action instead of having exciting action scenarios containing likable, relatable, well-written characters? Check. - Loud noises and a ridiculous number of explosions? Check. - Very little emotional or intellectually stimulating material? Check. - Almost nothing to make the audience and/or future generations feel like actually remembering the film? Check.These big budget Hollywood films need to evolve, primarily because they really are starting to become stale. I want to go to a movie and feel like I'm seeing something that was either unique, or made by people who were clearly passionate about what they were making. Or, ideally, both. I want to be moved by movies. I want to be surprised by movies. I want movies to imbed themselves in my mind and stay there for days to the point where I just can't stop thinking about them. I want movies to take risks. I want movies to be made in a way that they'll appeal to future generations.I want huge summer movies like Man of Steel to actually be exciting again.Don't you as well?","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

The movie is as solid as the title. The acting and directing, and plot was flawless. The actors where unknown, but the Superman character was believable, while the Lois character was likable but feisty. The directing was fast paced, but slow in spots, mostly flashbacks for character and plot development. There is a biblical themed sub plots: The Clark character living on the earth but not of it. One willing to sacrifice for mankind. There are beings out there which hate and will destroy mankind. A strong story of understanding, sacrifice, and living by one's beliefs. Man of Steel is a strong eight out of ten.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

It has it all except trying to write a better screenplay. Never the less the movie is still is fun to watch and the kid will love it.Don't want to get into much detail of the origin of Superman because more or less people already knew it. The story itself has great potential but somehow they didn't manage to put that well into the screenplay and all you have is a much underdeveloped characters and many scenes skip too fast that you hardly feel for the character.I must say the casting of Henry Cavill is superb. This role serves him well and he did a good job with it (A lot better than that pretty face in Superman Returns). Michael Shannon as General Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El was acceptable, but other than that was just not good enough. Even Amy Adams – she look so old and sloppy here (her character is so dreadful).The reason I went to see this movie was it is directed by Zack Snyder. I enjoy most of his work. And this Superman was leaning toward the good side (though not by much). What he did here was pretty good – cool villains with cool armor/ better Superman outfit / high amount of action to enjoy/ and great casting of a real looking Super of a man.Anyway I don't think this really add anything new to the franchise. If you have seen Smallville or other superman you probably have already seen it only this time it was a much better production. I think it will do great once it come out in DVD cause it doesn't matter if you see this or not.Rating: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Maybe it was seeing Chris Nolans name (the master behind the Dark Knight trilogy). Or maybe it was seeing that Zack Snyder would direct (who already had success in both Watchmen and 300). Or far more likely it was seeing the beautiful tone of a trailer showing shots that demonstrated that the film was going to go to the heart of Superman's character. The film lives up to this in every sense demonstrating a truly real character emerge from the comic books on screen. I'll say now that those who may have heard in reviews that the fight scenes are no different to Transformers, these people are strongly mistaken. Whilst Transformers acts as nothing more than two cars bashing in to each other like rocks being put in a blender, with each hit thrown and each battle started we witness sheer emotion and deep reasoning for each fight. Be it Superman's contrast to his opposite fighters or the light speed fights that really emphasise the man of steels speed and strength better than ever before on screen, Snyder goes all out to make sure these fight scenes are what the man of steel deserves. Another fantastic part of the film is that whilst the film is centred on Superman, the film does not ignore any of the supporting roles that make the Superman. Be it through emotional heart breaking lines from both Superman's dads be it Crowes inspirational speeches like ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards"" or Costners heart breaking lines like ""You are my son"" the writers go all out to give every character the sentiment they need. This film stands as a shining example of when everything just goes right in Hollywood. Where every element ranging from the beautiful music inspiring both hope and fear, beautiful dialogue that shall transcend our lifetimes and shots so moving they could bring a grown man to tears. (What me? No, I meant the guy next to me. I don't cry at films, I'm a man! A superman! Heh. Oh, sorry should get back to the review.) It's when these elements mix so beautifully that you can truly see in to the depths of such a complex character better than any film has before it, placing this bigger than earth character in to our world in a heroic and beautiful style. It is this beauty that ensures me that the DC Universe building up to the likes of the Justice League can be successfully started from this film.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I've spent those long hours in line waiting for the midnight premiere of Spiderman or avoiding any social networking until I was able to see the newest superhero film, in fear that someone might ruin it for me. With that said, I was a little disappointed with the Superman. I'll admit it, once I saw Christoper Nolan as a producer I immediately associated this film with the Dark Knight. While Superman did share the dark/gloomy but bad-ass tone that the Dark Knight has, to rush to compare them was a mistake. I think I was hoping for a more quote-ready film or to feel a stronger connection to Superman. Also, some scenes seemed rushed, while others were phenomenal. To be honest, I'm not sure what I was looking for but I know I didn't leave the film feeling completely satisfied.But that didn't stop me from going to see it a second time ;)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And to be honest, it's never been the most important or integral part of the world's first comic book superhero. Of late, the men of steel's defining features have mostly been the cape, the jaw line, and of course his unique style in underwear. But for this instalment, its all about his origin. Who he is as a character suddenly has less to do with his fashion sense as much as his heritage, the delicate balance he represents between two worlds, and the fact that he is, after all, an alien. And all of a sudden he begins to be less of a gaudy gimmick and once more a character you can invest in, relatable because of his small town upbringing in Kansas, and supportable because of the opportunity for hope he represents. To go into more detail would spoil the film for those who have yet to see it, but suffice to say kal-el's very existence is a source of hope and contention in and of itself. The use of a main character as a macguffin is a shrewd and unusual one, and a defining feature of the film. A Hero as multi-faceted as Henry Cavill's depiction of Kal-el deserves an equal villain. It is a tribute to Cavill's acting and of the character of Kal-el that Michael Shannon's brutish and driven General Zod struggles to keep up with the hero in terms of character. Though not as iconic as the hero of krypton, the good general enjoys a recurring part in the Superman mythos, first appearing in film portrayed by Terence Stamp in Richard Donner's Superman II. Shannon's version takes more emphasis from the status of General, being a more militaristic and brutal commander, seeing Krypton as the more ""evolved"" species and thus deserving to colonise the Earth than humans. The principles of evolution, divine right and singular vision of purpose define Zod, the idealism of a zealot driving him repeatedly into conflict with both members of the el family, and it is never clarified whether he genuinely believes in his cause, or simply employs it as affront to cover his barely concealed bloodlust. Although the majority of the film takes place on earth, krypton and its remnants, both technological and living are the focus of the plot. On an aesthetic level, this gives director Zack Snyder artistic free reign to go more or less completely over the top in terms of set design. The opening 20 or so opening minutes on Krypton are an unrelenting sensory assault, bombarding the audience's eyeballs from the logos onwards, as we witness the political and scientific systems of an alien world with a civil war and subsequent apocalypse raging in the background. After the intoxicating rush through a society whose doom is made clear from the very beginning, the visuals step down a pace, becoming more introspective on the details of a more washed out planet earth, causing plenty of artistic possibilities of showing the alien aesthetics infringing on Earth. Having actually seen in some depth the society from which the krypton ships, technology and weapons originate, the juxtaposition of krypton onto earth feels less like a b-movie alien invasion, and more like a jarring clash of two very different cultures. That said, Zack Snyder does channel 50s –era invasion movies at certain points, as well as disaster movies, military conspiracies, and the bonkers apocalyptic imagery that snuck into some of his other prominent works such as Sucker Punch and 300. The mix of genres actually works to the movies benefit, the only issue being when Snyder occasionally starts to go too overboard with the death and explosions. The movie's climax feels a little strained due to the sheer scale of property damage, and you're left wondering whether the director is constantly challenging himself to see how many buildings he can blow up per shot. Perhaps it would be better if the crew gave him less coffee before filming? Whatever the reason, there are certain points where the viewer's personal preference for Snyder's work may influence their opinion more than the story. In any case, the sheer tonnage of destruction may lead to some viewers needing a lie down afterwards. While he can go overboard, the wanton destruction does finally bring justice to the super powered smack downs we've grown to expect from a summer superhero blockbuster. Amid the ethnic morality behind alien cultures and emotional moments, there are lots of pretty explosions to keep your attention from slipping. All in all, Man of Steel is definitely worth seeing. The beauty of a reboot is the ability for new fans that may not be previously familiar with the Superman mythos to be introduced in a newer, shinier way than the fans of yesteryear. For newbies, this is a sleek, glossy sci-fi summer epic, with some serious emotional characters, and a beautiful visual aesthetic. For those who have been fans since the beginning, I would argue this film manages to take a fresh look at a beloved icon, and manages to pay homage to the central ideals of the character, of hope and leading through inspiration with the additional promise of taking the hero in new and exciting directions. 4.5/5","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I loved Christopher Nolan's interpretation of Batman, even if the third film was pretty shaky. So when I discovered Zack Snyder was directing this film, I was nervous. Having never seen 300, I had only to judge the director on what I knew, which was watchmen and sucker punch, being decent and an incredible mess, respectively. Despite this I went into it with relatively high hopes because I had discovered Nolan was one of the producers. And the result was... Odd.The movie, as it should, took itself incredibly seriously, delving into the mythology of superman like has never been done on the silver screen. The casting, for the most part was well done Cavill was the obvious choice for the titular character, having decent acting chops and a self righteous demeanor. most of the other actors were good as well, highlights being Shannon's Zod and Crowes' loving Jor-El (glad he isn't mad the whole time like in Les miserable). the progression of Clark Kent felt relatively natural and when Clark first takes fight, we are given the most magnificent view, having some of the most beautiful cgi I have seen. AND THE SCORE!!!! Hans Zimmer absolutely outdid himself in this film, giving us a modern spin on the theme by john Williams.With all the films pros, there are WAYYYYY too many flaws, mostly on the fault of the director. the editing in this movie I absolutely abysmal, sending us from watching superman having a heated discussion with the general to an intimate scene between Clark and Lois. also Clark and Lois' relationship felt so forced I could have walked out of the theater just on that account. the audio was absolutely all over the place on this film, sounding like a cannon every time superman flies by, which is a lot! also, although Zimmer's score in this film is one of his best, Snyder just is just so overwhelmed with this terrific score that he doesn't even know what to do with it, sometimes just throwing it in places where it makes no sense to the situation at hand at all, making it sound like a silent film that has random music overlaid on top just to appease high schoolers who know nothing of films without sound. Some of the acting is way over the top, the perfect example of this is, obviously, Lois, who has one of the biggest examples of female dominance in film history. She acts like the classic no nonsense business woman, but yet she allows herself to be swept off by superman on a whim. here's a hint, if you want us to respect your character, Don't FALL FOR EVERY DUDE IN A RED CAPE!!!! This movie could have great had it been put under the great directors of our generation (NOLAN!!!!!) But,, alas It falls short of being a good movie and settles for just being decent. lets just hope Snyder doesn't screw up the next one.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's the best SUPERMAN movie ever !!!! No superhero movie can even dare to come against ""MAN OF STEEL"". Superman really kicks ass compared to any other previous installments of this franchise.... Henry Cavill really does justice to the role of SUPPY.... Michael Shannon is the best GENERAL ZOD ever.... Russel Crowe suits his role of Zor-El very well.... Amy Adams (Lois Lane)looks lovely and plays her part nicely.... The rest of the cast including Diane Lane (Martha Kent), Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent), etc. play their limited roles very well too. The action is mind blowing in this movie, as basically it's a very dark, action oriented Superman movie compared to the last installments which were quite lighter in tone and action was also limited. So if you want Suppy to really beat the hell out of his enemies then you won't be disappointed, as that is what he does in this movie. The flashback scenes were nicely done in this movie too.So I can easily say that if you miss this movie in a theater near you, then you'll definitely miss the chance of a lifetime, as this movie can be enjoyed by both hardcore Superman fans as well as non-fans who like a very well made sci-fi movie with lots of action and special effects.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Another reboot of Superman, tackling his origins on Krypton, his adaptation to Earth's environment and protecting humanity from the sinister General Zod. Let's tackle the many negatives that are unfortunately ever present. The script is full of exposition, it's like being spoon fed constantly. Nearly every dialogue is explaining something. This film introduces what I call ""Lois Lane Syndrome"", where a supporting character is in every pivotal scene as a plot convenience. Lois. Lane. Is. Everywhere. Yes, Amy Adams is the best actress here but yikes c'mon...! Henry Cavill's acting is questionable, obviously he's transformed into the role (an absolute beefcake!), just rather monotonous. Multiple product placements and company promotions. Lastly, a rather slow second act that doesn't marinate well with the exciting first and third act. Apart from those points, I absolutely find this to be the definition of a popcorn blockbuster. Visually arresting, the technology used on Krypton was imaginative and innovative. Michael Shannon's performance was viciously savage and chews up every scene he is in. Slight philosophical exploration on Gods and humanity, nothing too heavy which suited the darkly themed story. The whole of the third act is so excessively destructive that I found myself in awe...strange I know. Buildings falling, planes crashing and fiery explosions. Just the sound of the World Engine powering down on Metropolis gives me the tinkles. Trust me, on a surround sound your neighbours will knock on your door asking ""was there an earthquake?"" (True story...). The musical score is euphorically epic, as to be expected. Zack Snyder's visual directing style really suits the superhero genre. Look, it's not perfect in fact far from it. A slight guilty pleasure for me, I find it madly entertaining with fantastic visual effects and a decent antagonist.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Hans Zimmer's score is excellent. The cape looks great. The CGI is good and the first battle is well choreographed. The movie introduces a powerful threat I, not being versed in Superman lore, was interested to see. The acting is, for the most part, decent. So one could safely leave the theater thinking it was a good superhero film, that is until they go home, undress, get into bed, and look up at the ceiling. Then as the movie begins to sink in, they roll their eyes and mutter with disgust ""Snyder..."" What am I getting at? This is a movie that is one third great, two thirds mediocre. There is some strange dialogue and acting that is hilariously bad. Superman is far more careless and destructive than he ought to be. The final battle is boring, dumb action. The story telling is disjointed and incoherent, as it constantly flashes back to random parts of Clark's life. Superman and Lois are also not particularly memorable, and Zod is busy acting like a ham most of the time. Jonathan Kent's scenes are by far the worst as his actor gives emotionless deliveries spewing words like ""the world is not ready"" that really hold no meaning here and were shoved in simply to invoke a cheap sense of drama. The infamous Tornado scene is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.But at least Faora is awesome.

Snyder laid down the backstory very well, with his opening scene of Krypton lasting much longer than the original superman showcasing the world. The setting and the details of Krypton were done very well but as soon as superman lands on earth, the style of the film changes rapidly and a lot of flashback and quick editing made it abit more flustered. I will admit that Snyder pulled it off but he added too many things to the film and the editing seemed to cut details. The film was shot very much like prometheus and it felt very real but at times I thought the shaky-cam was a little annoying but one thing that the film didn't lack was the action and acting. There is plenty of action towards the end of the film but it was very quick and flashy and left me a little unsatisfied but the acting and casting was very good. Cavill plays superman so well, adding in a very ""human"" feel, Adams as Lois is very likable and Shannon is amazing as Zod. However I felt that they didn't show enough of Clark's ""Earth parents"" as Costners character as Jonathan Kent was only seen in a series of flashbacks but I felt should have been used more. Crowe is fairly prominent in the film and like in the original, appears as a guide for superman. The costumes and designs were very cool, even down to supermans boots and of course the music score was immense and epic. However I think people may dislike the fast pace of the film and may have preferred if it was taken more slowly with fewer plot devices as it starts to become a transformers film with the various fight scenes and endless explosions! But it does have a decent plot and gives enough action to make it into an enjoyable film. I would say that Man of Steel has all the action that Superman returns lacked and a better plot but its flow at times is difficult to follow.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A modern Superman.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2825047/?ref_=tt_urv","abryan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3811301/?ref_=tt_urv","4 July 2013","To be fair, making a movie about Superman you are never going to please everybody all of the time. The die-hard comic fans will have very specific expectations of the film. Fans of the older Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve incarnation will have differing expectations. So to make a film like this, you'll always be stuck between a rock and a hard place. So to say this movie is bad is just wrong, because it's not. Fans of the comics or the Reeve versions should maybe not go see this movie. It's a Superman for the modern age. Yes it's loud. Yes there is a lot of fast action sequences. Yes the original storyline has been remixed and revamped. And yes, there is a lot of CGI in the movie. So what. It works. People who bang on about the use of CGI in movies; yes I'll agree there are some bad uses of the technology out there. But not in this film. Besides, what would you prefer? A return to rubber monsters, dodgy animatronics and the use of models to simulate everything. I feel people that moan about the use of CGI think you just bang in a few parameters into the sausage machine and hay presto, you have a full blown complex CGI scene fully rendered at the other end. This is not the case, I should know. The process of producing CGI, GOOD CGI, take a lot of time and a lot of artistic and technical knowhow. And in a lot of cases, takes just as long as a more traditional method. So, the bottom line with Man of Steel is this: It's a great movie. Very exciting. Yeah, it's no Shakespeare or Dickens play, but if you're going excepting that, you are stupid. If you love the comics or the Christopher Reeve version, maybe think about not going to see this one. And if you don't like CGI, Super hero, Science fiction or action movies, then don't go see this movie and then moan about how crap you thought it was afterwards. That's like punching yourself in the face and then complaining about how painful it is. Please!Man of Steel. Great movie, would recommend.. with the above provisos.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

In poetic fashion, the main villain, Bill, narrates why Superman is unlike any other superhero: Every superhero wears a costume or a powered suit that enables them to become invincible. On the other hand, Superman disguises himself as Clark Kent. Clark Kent is the costume. This costume blends in with human frailties of doubt, despair, weakness and cowardice. At the time, Tarantino had no way of knowing what influence that philosophy would have on the mythology behind the most iconic superhero in pop culture. If Tarantino's philosophy is merely an iceberg of thought, the ethos in MAN OF STEEL is an entire glacier by comparison. Penned by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, scripters behind THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, the mythology here is taken very seriously right from the opening scene on Krypton. Kal is born to Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe), despite age old Kryptonian laws that forbid natural conception. The birth takes place during Krypton's crisis as a doomed planet, alongside a political uprising led by General Zod (Michael Shannon). As the last son of Krypton, Kal, son of the House of El, is dispatched to Earth where he must fulfill the aspirations of his parents while upholding the nobility of his alien race. In narrating his upbringing on Earth, director Zack Snyder pans back and forth between the adult Kal-El (Henry Cavill) and specific moments during his childhood. Through short flashbacks, we see his parents' prophesies materialise as Kal-El comes to terms with powers beyond his own comprehension, even as he is rendered an outcast amongst humans. But struggling through an imploding identity crises, his values of integrity and compassion are installed by his adoptive human parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). These values are put to the test when Zod invades Earth with no greater goal than total annihilation of the human race.Before I get to some of the film's glaring faults, let me just say that MAN OF STEEL is a respectable attempt as an origins story. Hordes of Superman fans disappointed by Brian Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) will be pleased to find Snyder's version meatier without many of the bone fragments found in the indigestible predecessor. Running at 143 minutes, Snyder appears to be in no rush to have our caped crusader perform his supersonic duties to save mankind. Instead, there are detailed plot arch's re-written for this movie that makes us want to care enough for another Superman adventure despite the failed 2006 debacle. This gives us a lot to mull over because viewers as well as the mythology are given a second chance to connect, and herein lies the precise reason why this 2013 reboot is necessary. How this works out is a unique feat in itself because for the first time since the 1978 original, the story stays true to its sci-fi myth (if you overlook some excess use of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo) rather than the recent trend in bombastic action fantasy. Although this may not measure up to present day expectations, purists have reason to believe that this is not a halfhearted attempt at reviving the Superman Saga. Is MAN OF STEEL the film of the year? On a subjective level I would have liked to think so. Then again, I would be lying if I say this film is without technical problems. Snyder's shaky camera work is an assault on the senses, especially when viewing this film in 3D. And while the story does have a dark premise I didn't get why Snyder had to tone down the color palate, leaving the viewer between thirty shades of grey and twenty shades of blue. On that note, the Zod squad is almost monochromatic but at least their armor has a lot more visual spunk over Tony Stark's tin can. In giving a new spin to the word 'Blockbuster', action scenes are plenty and mostly bloodless. But while Snyder restrains his penchant for slow-motion scenes, there is an exposition on battle sequences, in addition to fight scenes that become repetitive. All considered, I simply did not feel the 'wow factor' despite emotional moments amplified by Hans Zimmer's background score. What the makers got right is the casting, including heart-tugging performances by Costner and Lane. And taking over the titular mantle from Brandon Routh, British actor Cavill's Kent is a near perfect recluse opposite Amy Adams' Louis Lane – a livewire reporter who becomes Kent's eventual love interest. I say 'eventual' because their chemistry is virtually nonexistent until the very end. Now that a spark is ignited, there is always hope that the sequel to this prequel can go only one way, and that is up, up and away!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

People who like it praise it as one of the best superhero movies ever, while people who hate it can keep making hundreds of jokes about how ridiculous it is. Personally, I find myself agree and disagree with both sides.The movie can be separated into two parts, the first is about Clark Kent's origin, and his journey before taking on the cape, and the second is when General Zod attacks and fighting ensues. The first part is pretty good. It takes the familiar Superman's origin story, and put some twists on it, which not only make it much less boring, but also provide a significantly good insight into Clark Kent's personalities and everyday struggles. The Clark Kent of this movie is not portrayed as the flawless heroic icon that he usually is, but rather as a brave and responsible but very confused and inexperienced young man. That's why he makes plenty of fatal mistakes, which make him a lot more human, likable and easy to relate to, instead of predictable and boring like the old Superman that we're used to. I find that a lot of criticism for the movie comes from people who simply can't understand this side of the character. They seem to expect the perfect hero like usual and can't look past the action to see the man behind it.Then comes the second part, which is probably not bad if you're a die-hard action fan, but I myself think is quite dull. The action in this part tends to drag out too much at a constantly fast pace that soon becomes very frustrating, especially when the Kryptonians' fighting style here doesn't involve beautiful, eye-catching techniques but usually just flying around at high speed, punching, and throwing stuff at each other.Other than that, the cast are all good, especially Henry Cavill and Kevin Costner, and the visuals is terrific, as you would expect from a movie by Zack Snyder. I considered 'Man of Steel' a quite admirable and somewhat successful effort to update Superman. Although it's not perfect, it accomplished what it set out to do: making Superman much more interesting and memorable, and opening up a lot of possibilities for future sequels.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And Man of Steel does not disappoint.It is a retake on the world of superman,his birth,story and him finding a place for himself in our world. Honestly given the backdrop I expected the story to be kind of slow in the start. But the manner in which it was told i did not find it so at all. I was gripped from the very beginning. Beautiful story telling.The acting in general is superlative.Henry Cavill fit perfectly into the shoes of Superman.Almost as if he was born to play this role. He has that unique mix of handsome yet vulnerable persona. Amy Adams is not exactly someone you can call hot but the role did not require her to be.She was charming and had a pleasant affect. Michael Zannon as general Zod was a pretty intriguing antagonist.Russel Crowe as Superman's father was superb as well and had a look almost reminiscent of gladiator. It was nice catching Laurence Fishburne as well. The support cast does a decent job too.The direction by Zack Snyder is great.The dialogs are smooth and stay true to the plot while capturing the essence of characters. The character development for each character is brilliant,one of the most important things in a film. All the characters are given enough space in the movie. And you end up caring for the characters which is always a good thing. The story is pretty straight forward and I think deliberately told in a fashion that is very easy to pick which makes it more universally appealing. The background score is apropos to the theme and adds another dimension to the movie. The pace of the film is quick enough to keep you interested all the time. The cinematography is pretty aesthetically pleasing. The superman costume is just kick-ass. Now for the action. I think it is one of the best action movies i have seen. I am in general sceptical towards action, particularly when it gets all jarring and blurry .But with superman it does not. The action seems very well executed , genuine and simple enough to follow while entertaining at the same time.Some of the scenes are like ZOMG Mind blowing. And I am not even going to get into the amount of effort that must have gone in. The CGI looks authentic and nothing in any frame ever felt artificial.I think Krypton was captured beautifully and uniquely.Let's see the flipside. I did get IMaxed(kinda overrated experience for me) and while the feel was good the 3-d is kinda non-existent. There are few questionable plot holes and there are few times when you think really? But i guess some of the things are pretty inescapable. Maybe they could have shown Superman to be conflicted while choosing sides. Then again that's how Superman is. Ah, screw it who wants to find faults with such a legendary movie. Some people complain 'Man of Steel' was long and slightly slow, I did not find it to be so. It is already belting the box office and 'Man of Steel 2' has been announced which is great for the franchise and us fans. Above all I think this is a very honest and genuine movie which never tries to be pretentious, and boy does it deliver. 'Man of Steel' is a movie you CANNOT miss. One more thing to your bucket list. Have a blast.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Still, for those who are looking for some dizzying action sequences, this is your movie. The hand-to-hand combat was awesome, but it was certainly on a scale of sensory overload (I would not have liked to have even thought about seeing this in 3-D because of this fact). And overall, the relational aspects made a lot of the characters (even the ones from Earth) seem flat and not very human.
But yeah, if you're looking for a summer action flick, this is your best bet.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The visuals and action scenes are the best I have ever seen, even more so that the Avengers which was surprising. It seems that most of the critics are judging way too harshly, I think Clark Kent's character was explored appropriately and was a balanced movie in general. It is a must see movie for all audiences, especially if your a comic book fan and even more so if you like superman as much as I do, personally this has the potential to be one of the best movies of the summer and possibly of the year.

It is a mark of generations of newborn people in all over the world. The Man of Steel is our symbol not only of hope and humanity, but also our inner voice which tells us that we CAN do anything when we really want it. It is not a coincidence that this is my first review on this website after so many years of watching, reading and rating movies. It is a purposeful act of self establishment. And as a fan of Superman I shall judge ""Man of Steel"" with my heart. Not as a critic, measuring the views and income of this movie. Not as an film adorer, putting the film characteristics above the content of the particular movie. Yes, I am a true follower of Superman since his origin so many years ago, when the superpowers and the heroism were common more to gods or real people, than to imaginary characters. Our society has come to an age in which our ideals are embodied in new personalities - the superheroes. We are proud to prove and we do not fear to admit that we love superheroes. No matter how alien or imaginary they are. And on this pantheon of great new legends there is the ""Grand Daddy"" of them all - Superman. The alien who lost all which he had even before he realized it. The man of steel who is like a god compared to the humans, but is at the same time afraid of showing himself to the public. This man has been brought to life again by Zach Snyder this year. It has been long time since the first footage of this movie was presented to us. And now I've finally seen it. But is it the real, shining, bright example which we needed to see not only as a moviegoers, but as a contemporary society? I'm trying to find the right words to approach what I saw without being too long. But I fail. Mr. Snyder, Mr. Goyer, why was General Zod your best character in this production? Why has this good original material which you had been turned into scattered and predictable character design and plot? I'm not mad at what you did, but at how you did it. With all the creative power which you have (Mr. Snyder I even liked your ""Sucker punch"", it was whole and finished), this is at least on 60% of what you could have brought to our senses. You had every fan of Superman at the beginning of the movie. With the wonderful soundtrack of this movie you had all the power to capture us forever. And you had a good cast too. Why did the Man of Steel look so shallow? Why didn't I feel his internal pain from the beginning? Why was I distracted by the elaborate Kpypton world when after that you cut the umbilical cord with such a huge time gap. And the growth of Kal-El was presented in a shortcut way which left us emotionally distanced from Superman. Clark's endeavors were not a journey, but rather a given result. His discoveries of his origin were ""ready"", not processed, doubted, discussed. And why did you make Louis Lane's character so superficial and following? Did you forget your work on ""Watchmen"", on ""300""'s characters? Where was the Script writer when the Kent family evolved together as a family? We get to see only 4-5 steps of growing as an alien on Earth and receiving the warmth and moral of a hardworking family. I think that if we got to see more of Jonathan and Martha as human beings we will be much more addicted to Clark's internal moral codes. Which is ultimately our own human moral values bible. I loved the thought that Clark is Superman ONLY on earth and due to our planet's conditions. And that he is Superman only because of the instilled consciousness by Jonathan and Martha. I respect your back story about his genes from Jor-El. And about the sad story of Krypton. I enjoyed Jor-El's extended presence in the film. But was he the main motivator of Clark's actions? How is it possible that General Zod and his subordinates evoke my sympathy more than Clark and the earthlings? In the third and final fight when Zod lost everything Michael Shannon acts perfectly. Even the non-fans at the theater were touched by this monster alien. And I felt really unsatisfied, because Clark was superficial and his actions were expected. And in the end he was embraced by Louis as a child. Is Superman always the hopeful child to you? I truly respect your new point of view, Mr. Snyder. You and your team did put a lot of work in this project. But please when you do the sequel remember that Superman is like no other epic hero. He is the HEART of our pantheon of heroes. He is the center of all branches and roots. He is not the peak, he is the base. Let him grow slower and more in contradictory details. Don't just rush him into adventure and action. And if you let him live more in between other humans, we will feel at ease more around this alien. Yes, I know that this movie is good and well-thought. You will say that. And it is true, I liked it overall. But this comes more from the fact that Superman is our hero, our legend, our shining star after which we will live our lives in attempts to do the right thing for ourselves, for our families, for our society and for the future of all things in the never ending flow of time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I exactly remember how confused I was when I left the cinema. I had a lot of mixed feelings about the whole.
I was disgusted by the ending and all of the fighting scenes made me feel awkward, unable to see what is happening. Back in 2013 I Had no clue what the movie is about and why they tried to do something like this in this way.After a year or two I have decided to give it another try. I wanted to watch it one more time to see if all the feelings I had after watchin git the first time where valid.I watched it home DVD, alone, just me and the Man of Steel. I don't remember that ever before any film made on me so much impression before. Especially after the second watch.
I stopped being confused and enjoyed it. I simply Watched it. Enjoyed all the work put in creation of this one of a kind superhero movie. The movie where they Show and don't tell many things. It is not a difficult movie to watch. Rather touches you here and there on its way. Makes me think about my past, my present and maybe even the future.Making long story short. This is way the best superhero movie there can be. Thank you for making it happen.PS: i don't know if anyone noticed. How the Man of Steel actor reminds the Superman actor from the 90s versions. There are some particular moments in the movie where the similarity is more visible.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Indeed, I was hoping from the trailer that this would be the best Superman movie of all time, but I have to rate it 4th, after the two Donner films (Superman, and Superman II) and the sadly underrated but wonderfully moving ""Superman Returns"", a film that had tremendous heart and soul, great character development, a little humor and plenty of CGI action to show off Supes' power and humanity, without the overblown audio, shaky camera, quick zoom and refocus, lens flare, extreme-close-ups, twirling camera cuts and other tricks that made MOS' action scenes dizzying (in a bad way), hard to follow and left me with a headache. And I have to say, this movie was really hurt by the omission of the wonderfully iconic John Williams Superman theme. Instead, we got plenty of product placement ads. I'm sure the studio will be pleased with the money it will make, but this film failed to deliver an emotional punch and in the end, wasn't very ""super"".","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

It doesn't matter how good (or overpaid) the cast is, if the script and editing is this poor, all they've done is wasted the whole budget. I like to watch films that leave me with something to ponder, films which inspire, films which are clever, with plots that hold together under reasonable scrutiny. They really should have just taken some of the better elements from the comics rather than writing the most improbable, ridiculous, storyline they could come up with. This was just a waste of time (for me to watch) and seems to illustrate something I've noticed is becoming true: the bigger the budget, the bigger the (likelihood of) failure.

I must say I am not disappointed. There is nothing wrong in the movie. Acting was good by all the actors, action scenes are terrific and breathtaking and the score was fantastic, but it lacks the magic touch of the directors like James Cameron or Peter Jackson.Zack Synder does a commendable job in making this movie. Without getting much into the plot, I would just like to state the things I liked about this movie. The opening scene is great and Krypton was shown beautifully. But the story telling is so fast, it hardly gives you time to breathe. Everything moves with a fast pace. The father-son relationship between Henry Cavill and Kevin Costner is nicely depicted and are probably the only scenes which capture the emotions of the movie. In the early part of becoming Superman, Henry travels a lot to find about out his origin. After finding his origin, he finally decides to take his responsibility as a superhero to the people of Earth in the fight against the enemy general Zod. Thereby follows an apocalyptic battle between Superman and Zod and his evil Kyptonic forces.First of all, talking about the fight, I have never seen this magnitude of destruction in any other superhero movie. The special effects are gorgeous and battle scenes are absolutely brilliant. The way he flies across the world is spectacular. The strength of Superman is visible in the action scenes. But the movie it is not so beautiful. Here's why I say this: after watching the action for a while, I feel that the human aspect completely vanishes. It seemed as if lifeless objects are fighting with no sense and feelings. In Man of steel, everything is so fast, sometimes you can't judge who fighting against whom and subsequently you lose interest. Here, action means destroying buildings and burning a city which literally turns into a graveyard. Hence it loses focus and interest. Even if Superman is referred as a God by Jor-El, God would have fought beautifully instead of just destroying everything. In the movies like Avatar, the Avengers or Lord of the Rings, the story builds towards the final scene which is depicted nicely. Emotion in the story builds in these movies and ultimately final battle commences. Man of Steel barely has any emotional movement and it fails to portray whatever is present. Nevertheless, the CGI is beautifully done, especially the picturization of the world engine and Superman fighting it. The movie also was not that much colorful and I assume the director wanted to make it more of a darker one. Story telling was good but not the best. Music and score of the movie is good. Actually, the music amplifies and intensifies the action sequences making it an awesome experience for the first time viewers.In general, I give thumbs up to Man of Steel for its highly digital and kick-ass visual effects and the musical score. The acting was OK. I liked the movie, but I would probably skip it watching for a second time.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The most recent incarnation, Superman Returns, had a generally positive reception from audiences and critics, but did take some criticism for its lack of action and somewhat overly emotional feel. Man of Steel has fixed most of its predecessor's flaws, though not without introducing some of its own.As a full on reboot, Man of Steel takes us all the way back to the beginning, to the birth of Kal-EL, General Zod's rebellion, and the destruction of Krypton. Then we flash forward to meet the adult Clark Kent, fully powered and saving lives when no one else can, but not yet ready to reveal himself to the world. But he may not have a choice when General Zod and followers arrive on earth, bent on capturing him and building a new Krypton, no matter the cost to humanity.Man of Steel certainly delivers on the action. The super powered brawls are fast paced, intense, and literally high flying, with the massive devastation they leave behind driving home the sheer power of the combatants. The effects are also quite impressive, especially the gravity weapon at the end.The movie does a very good job developing the title character. Instead of making us sit through his life story before the action starts, Man of Steel presents his life on earth in a series of flashbacks, taking us back to key moments when they're most relevant. Unfortunately the other characters, particularly Lois and Zod, weren't developed as much as they could or should have been. I would also have liked to know more about Zod and his followers' philosophy. At one point his second in command tells Superman that their lack of morality gives them an 'evolutionary advantage', but this idea isn't pursued any further.The casting is generally very good. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner bring dignity and down to earth wisdom in their roles as Superman's Kryptonian and human fathers. Henry Cavill makes a passable Superman. He's not the most expressive actor, and at times his relative inexperience shows, but he mostly carries his lines well and avoids coming off as wooden. And he's certainly got the right physique for the role. Michael Shannon is suitably menacing and extremely hate-able as Zod. And the choice of Amy Adams as Lois Lane is almost inspired, her irrepressible energy making her perfect as a hard nosed, won't take no for an answer reporter. My only qualm is that it might have been nice if they'd taken the effort to dye her hair black.Man of Steel is no masterpiece, but it is a solid summer blockbuster. It delivers on the action, and has improved on the pacing and tone Superman Returns, even if it's sacrificed a fair amount of depth and humor in the process. It may not be a great movie, but it's a good one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Oh, it was so boring hearing about them kryptonite again and again.Above all, it was slow and dull, there was hardly any excitement watching this all along. A superhero movie should always be watched with great excitement as to ""what will happen next"" ""oh, wow, that was too good"". Additionally, there was almost no romantic story in it. People were not even looking upto the great heroic acts of the superman - I mean hardly any such scenes were shown.I believe every superhero movie should come with great dialogues and at last a memorable morale. This movie surely missed all of these.Somehow, it was not up to the mark. Both the script and direction were not very strong, I would rather say.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","143 Minutes of Mostly Backstory","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3643191/?ref_=tt_urv","byStevenRamirez","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2635045/?ref_=tt_urv","20 February 2017","(June 2013.) If you watch the 'Man of Steel' trailer you do get a sense that this thing is going to rock. In fact, it's going to be the best 110 minutes you ever spent. What you end up with, though, is a full bladder and 143 minutes of mostly backstory. Ouch! And don't get me wrong—I love Russell Crowe. But seriously, they could have made a prequel starring Michael Shannon and him, and called it 'Krypton.'Some scenes just didn't make any sense. Here's Clark Kent as a kid, confused and frightened by his X-ray vision and super-sharp hearing. So he tears out of the classroom and hides in a storage closet. Now the teacher shows up—as well as the entire class! What is this, a field trip? Here's another one. The guy flies around at like a million miles an hour, right? But no matter where he goes, Lois Lane is there. What, did she commandeer the transporter from 'Star Trek'?And how about this? There's a moment toward the end when General Zod makes a big speech intended to evoke sympathy, I guess, which explains in plain English what drives his behavior. Excuse me but we got that in the first few minutes of the movie. He's devoted to Krypton and will do anything to protect its future. Check! Do we really need the stupid on-the-nose speech?And while we're at it, why is Superman so frickin' moody all the time? Honestly this thing was just begging for a Lex Luthor as portrayed by Danny DeVito. Or Joe Pesci. Oh and don't let me forget. Superman can't breathe on General Zod's spaceship—he even gets a nosebleed. But he has no problem in space.Okay, so I didn't see this movie in 3D. We would've had to wait another hour-and-a- half. Best decision I ever made by the way. After that third act, I was exhausted! These guys don't know the meaning of excess. I mean, how many times do I need to see cars flying and spinning. And how about Superman and General Zod hurtling through buildings—through walls and windows—until the buildings are literally cut in two? It was fun the first time—not the fifteenth.And here's something I really didn't get. Superman, General Zod and his minions are stronger on earth because of differences in gravity or whatever. But with the beating they're taking, how come their costumes don't fall apart? Who made these things, Edna Mode? I mean, if I had just flown two hundred miles an hour through several steel, concrete and glass buildings, wouldn't my cape at least get a snag?Superman is boring, no question. And Clark Kent, the reporter, doesn't come into the picture until the epilogue. Maybe he'll be clumsy and charming like Christopher Reeve in the next one. Or maybe we'll just get more spinning cars and people breathing in space without oxygen.I give it a C+. Go see it, though. But if you suffer from motion sickness, bring a barf bag. Or close your eyes for the last thirty minutes. It's like being inside the Zipper with the Joker at the controls.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But let me start with a few positives. The actors are generally good, and it is not their fault that the film fails. The visual design is pretty awesome as well. BUT, the entire story and the build-up of it completely fails, and was comical at best. Which reminds me that there also, aren't the smallest bit of humor in the entire movie. The old and previous Superman films had a great sense of humor, both in the Superman role and villains like Lex Luthor. This movie is devout of any laughs, other than the unintentional. The story, taken out of the film, could be a great alternative story to the usual Superman films, but it is horribly executed. Might be the director, might be the editing or the story structure. But the director should be better, based on his credentials. Every character in the movie is not build up in any way. Superman, maybe slightly, but less that the father, Kevin Costner, which is the best performance in the film. You lack empathy for all of them, maybe until Zod's facade starts to crumble, and he reveals that he is made and born to do his job, protect Krypton and its people, which is why he does everything he does. This is essentially the best part of the movie, cause it plays on the actual story, that Krypton was degenerate and controlled in a bad way. The government had ruined the society with its control. But this great side of the story is totally underplayed. I could keep going, but it will ruin another day of mine, if I don't stop. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!!!","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

There were massive expectations on the film as there always will be with superman and i think they have really pulled it out of the bag. first of all the producer and director coupling of Nolan and Snyder was one that was made in heaven wasn't it? Nolan having the epic story telling and super hero experience from the bat man trilogy and Synder having the special effect and fight scene knowledge from 300 and further super hero experience from watchmen it was never going to fail. Although i was slightly surprised by what i would call a rather chaotic narrative which seemed to jump back and forth and if you were not concentrating it would lose you. Henry Cavill made superman everything i wanted it to be. And there were also praiseworthy performances from Amy Adams and as always the magnificent Russel Crowe.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story is more serious and asks the question of ""will I be accepted into this world or be feared?"" While I like the new take on the Superman origin story and how uniquely it's told, I found the script to be rather weak. The character moments are scarce, everything feels a bit rushed, and the dialogue comes off as super cheesy almost to the point where I was cringing. However, I am a huge fan of how this film is directed. Zack Snyder does an awesome job with what he has. The action sequences are choreographed amazingly, quit possibly the best action all year. Camera work in this film is really well done and the editing is spot on. There are some really inventive shots and the final fight sequence with Zod is riveting.The actors do a fine job with their characters. However, no one really stands out aside from Henry Cavill as Superman. While he's no Christopher Reeve, I really like his take on the character. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is decent, but the way the character is written is kind of weak as I never really cared for her and she came off as a bit forced. Michael Shannon is pretty good as Zod, but the character could have used more screen time. Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast is solid and play their roles well.Visual effects in this film are top-notch. From Kypton to Earth, everything from a visual standpoint is breathtaking. I've always been a fan of Zack Snyder's visual style in film and here he's put them to great use. The score on the other hand is okay. While it's great in the film, it's rather loud and forgettable.Overall, ""Man of Steel"" is a solid piece of cinema and it has me pumped for more Superman movies as well as a potential Justice League film. However, it does fall short in the story department. I felt like I was going from one ride to the next without having a chance to breath. The film has some interesting things to say, but only on a few occasions does it take the time to say it and even then not very clearly. On the bright side though, we get the most action packed Superman movie and quit possibly superhero movie of all time. There's a lot of fun to be had, but if you're looking for something deeper and thought provoking this isn't the place. I give it 3.5/5, weak story that is made better with great action, stunning visual effects, and fantastic direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some of them considers this movie great, some debunks the movie overloaded with effect rumble. I think that Man of Steel is at least great, maybe even awesome reboot of Superman saga. I can't deny that the effects grow quite epic at the end of the movie, but then again - so what? You can find many similarities with Batman movies, but that is quite clear with Christopher Nolan on the background: the one who rebooted Batman so well. Henry Cavill is a gret choice for role of Superman, not just because a great body of his, he looks quite hot in his tight Superman outfit. Luckily they have renewed Supermans outfit and he doesn't have to wear those ugly red underpants anymore. Russel Crowe is a good choice for Jor El and Kevin Costner fits in his role as a Clark's foster father. Michael Shannon is great as a psychotic general Zod. Movie looks great as so many other Zack Snyder movie. Effets are great to watch and that emphazises effect rumble at the end part of the movie. Scenery at planet Krypton looks fantastic in the beginning of the movie. This is quite great rebooting and can't wait to see the sequel which is already announced with Zack Snyder directing it. Definitely worth of price of a movie ticket.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The plot especially pre-action felt disjointed , rushed and crammed. Emotions were not allowed to build up and sustained . The setting ,cinematography ,casting etc. were good but somehow the non action scenes were lacking in emotional depth. I couldn't get invested in the story as much as I wanted to. A little longer treatment was required to get the build that the makers were hoping for.The romance between Lois and Clark felt fake. Also some of the situations involving Lois appeared ridiculous as they felt forced to contain her presence.But all is forgotten when the action starts.It is relentless , epic , thunderous .

Going into it I was excited to see what Snyder could do with Superman, after all 300 and Watchmen were great and even Suckerpunch was decent considering who the lead was.Snyder showed he knows how to film great action. Despite the characters moving at insane speeds, he still lets the audience see what is happening (unlike transformers) and man is it fun. The fights are fun and exciting and everyone should watch the movie for them if nothing else.The three leads are excellent as well. Superman, of course, does a good job of exploring the internal conflict that so often plagues superheroes. What is the right thing to do with all this power? Lois is an intelligent investigative reporter who brings a more proactive roll to the character. Finally Zod is a wonderful villain, showing depth of character as well as forcing the viewer to feel some empathy for him. You can't quite bring yourself to hate him, even if you do know he needs to be stopped.Now for the problems. Side characters should be just that, side characters. The story does not need to bend over backwards to give Perry White moments of glory. In addition there were several scenes that appeared to try to follow Nolan's example of having characters do wildly idiotic things in order to let the plot get to where it needed to.Finally, there were a few scenes that tried to seem more over the top in order to deliver more drama which actually diminished the overall effect. What should have been the most moving scene in the movie, for instance, was laughable rather than heartfelt because the writers apparently forgot how to make a good script momentarily.I thought it was well worth a watch. It is comparable to Batman Begins in that some people will love it but the rest of us won't particularly care unless the follow up can really blow us away. It was disappointing how much potential the script had yet the writers seemed to get lazy a little too often which took away from the overall experience.It was enjoyable but it was no Avengers and certainly was no Dark Knight.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Superman film that isn't quite ""super""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2831509/?ref_=tt_urv","rparham","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0637916/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2013","With box-office success and near universal acclaim of the recent Dark Knight reboot trilogy of films featuring Batman, it's not surprising that Warner Bros. would hand the reins of their other major tentpole superhero, Superman, to Christopher Nolan, the co-writer and director of the Dark Knight films. Nolan elected to serve as a producer and story writer, not director, for the film that has emerged, Man of Steel, and it's uncertain how much involvement he had, but one thing is certain, Man of Steel will most likely not have the lasting impact of the Dark Knight films. Directed by Zack Snyder and written by David Goyer, Man of Steel is very much a mixed bag, dealing in some interesting material concerning Superman's place in the modern world and in America today, but a lot of the film's strength is undercut by its later section, where it devolves into a seemingly endless string of overwrought action sequences that sap most of the entertainment out of the proceedings.The film revisits Superman's origin in it's opening scenes: Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara (Ayelet Zuer) give birth to Kal-El, the first natural birth the planet of Krypton has seen in over a millenia, where the population is engineered, not born through standard procreation. Kal-El's birth comes on the cusp of Krypton being destroyed by it's population over harvesting the planet's natural resources. At the same time, Krypton's military leader, General Zod (Michael Shannon), has decided to engage in a coup to wrestle control of the planet from it's leaders that Zod views as inept. Zod is put down, but not before Jor-El launches his son for Earth to escape Krypton's fate.On Earth, Kal-El is raised by a Kansas farmer and his wife, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, respectively). Jonathan tries to convince Kal-El, named Clark Kent, to keep his powers hidden from the world for fear of how the populace of Earth would react to knowing that an alien was in their midst. Clark grows up (portrayed by Henry Cavill as an adult) and begins wandering the world, uncertain of his place, but also managing to occasionally tip his hard regarding his abilities. Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) begins investigating the stories of Clark following an encounter with him at a dig site of an ancient alien ship that had arrived from Krypton many centuries earlier. On board that ship, Clark discovers the truth about his past from a projection of his father, and he dons his familiar blue and red suit. As Lois begins to close in on Clark's identity, an alien object appears in orbit and turns out to be General Zod and his followers who have managed to survive Krypton's destruction and come to Earth with plans to change the planet, plans that Clark has every intention of stopping.While Man of Steel does find itself in the unenviable position of revisiting the origin of Superman, Goyer and Snyder do a decent job of not repeating the same path as the original 1978 Superman film. Instead, following the prologue on Krypton, much of the material of Superman's formative years is presented in flashback after Clark has already reached maturity. To their credit, this decision makes the narrative a little more unpredictable. The flashbacks actually provide some of Man of Steel's best moments, as the characters of Jonathan and Martha Kent are given some of the strongest emotional material to work with for the film. Several of the scenes in which Clark finally discovers more about his past from the projection of his father are also engaging as we see Clark learn his past and begin to try to embrace who he is.However, as Man of Steel progresses, it fails to really dive into it's most interesting aspects with any depth. The film introduces the concept that, unlike most previous versions of the Superman story, the revelation of an otherworldly being living amongst us with super powers would not be welcomed with open arms, but distrust and fear. This approach, and Clark's isolation because of it, are ideas pregnant with possibility, but Man of Steel doesn't do a lot with them. Instead, once Zod and his minions are on Earth, Man of Steel transforms into wall to wall carnage, as we witness Clark and Zod face off in a number of environs where cities, trains, small towns, vehicles, you name it are decimated in an unending orgy of action that quickly wears out it's welcome. No one expects a super hero film to be without action, but Man of Steel cranks everything up to 11 and squelches the narrative underneath.Most of the characters suffer as a result of Man of Steel's transition to full-bore action film. Lois Lane is presented as a modern investigative reporter who begins to develop some affection for Clark as she unravels his past, but her relationship with him is largely stillborn, resulting in little emotional involvement to their growing affection. Michael Shannon's Zod has some interesting elements to his backstory, but he isn't fleshed out enough for us to really work up any significant distaste for him. Henry Cavill gives a good performance as Clark, and if given more opportunity to delve into the character in future films, he may prove a strong presence, but here there are only hints to some of the potential of this version of Superman. Almost all the other supporting characters aren't given enough screen time to be anything more than passing faces for the most part.It would be inaccurate to describe Man of Steel as a failure, there is good material here, the film simply transforms into too much action and not enough of anything else to truly soar. If Man of Steel is successful enough for a second film, with any luck the filmmakers will learn from their mistakes and create a truly stellar Superman film.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

DC has achieved a goal that when first announced, made audiences cringe at the habitualness of it all: they managed to reintroduce Superman as a new movie franchise. Man of Steel, directed by Zach Snyder and produced by the Dark Knight's director Christopher Nolan, retells the forever popular tale of Clark Kent, the last son of Krypton, and his journey of discovering who he is and who he will become: the red caped Superman.What this movie does, which 2006's Superman Returns failed to do, is establish a modern version of the famed hero. While the first film attempted to be a somewhat fifth sequel to the first four from the late seventies and eighties, Warner Brothers dared to start from the very beginning, with Kal-El's origin. This was a major risk for the company to do, especially after many complaints from fans about ANOTHER origin story, and it being about the hero of all heroes. However, just like there was an outcry then acceptance over The Amazing Spider-Man, Man of Steel has gained the general approval rapidly within its opening weekend.The success of this movie lies in many aspects; you can't just choose anyone to be a part of something as massive as the United States' most popular myth. Choosing a new face to don the cape (Henry Cavill) was a wise choice, and mixing him in with movie pros (Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane . . . just to name a few) was an even better choice; combining the old with the new. This strategy, likewise, works miraculously with the story almost everyone in the world knows. While the expectation of the average Man of Steel attendee is to fall asleep during the first thirty or so minutes of the movie where they explain how Clark came to Earth, that said attendee will be very surprised as they're proved completely wrong. From details about Krypton (in this film it is more of a dessert landscape than a white tundra as shown in the '78 movie) to new facts about Clark's early work (who knew he was a fisherman?), these new bits of information that though seem minuscule, add up to give more of an explanation as to why Superman is the way he is.Even though Christopher Nolan was not the director, his presence was very evident in the Man of Steel. The use of a non-linear timeline, much like what is seen in Batman Begins, causes the feeling of being on a roller coaster, one which you do not recover from until the first hour of the movie is done. After this confusing backward and forward motion, drawn-out scenes of extreme destruction (ten times worse than all three Transformers movies combined) to Smallville and Metropolis becomes tedious and wearisome. The time that was used to show this could have been used in a more beneficial way, for example, establishing the adult Clark Kent better.Even with the changes to the story and the unnecessary excess of violence, the traditional tale stays true to what we all are so familiar with while also answering a few questions that have plagued fans for years. This healthy balance makes the film enjoyable, while also bringing a fresh take to the Superman mythos.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The hype couldn't let me resist from watching it. I have watched all the superman movies till this day and read a few comic books too. I would definitely say that 1978 version has better story than this. The character development and script is okay. Henry Cavill makes a great Superman but not expected Clark Kent. The one thing that stole the show is action,Special effects,splendid visuals and Digital animation all in 3D. It was a pretty good experience to watch the modified Krypton and superman powers in Perfect effects and 3D. Now waiting for the sequel ,hoping it would get better.

After going through a lot of the reviews posted on this recently, I get the trend - you hate this movie even a bit and you have 20% of the audience disagreeing; you love it and 80% agrees with you. While I'm not at the end of either side as my score illustrates, I do believe the movie is slightly disappointing.This being a Superman movie and the board being filled with Superman fans, lets not even discuss the plot. Instead, I'll straightaway get to the points. To begin with, here's what I liked about the movie: Action & Effects: As much as the critics will bash it, I'll admit the action in the movie is simply spectacular, very literally of epic proportions and quite out of this world. In fact the trailer of this movie has more action than the whole of Superman Returns and the trailer contains only about 5 - 10% of the action. The best scenes are in the end when you see Superman flying at breakneck speed and slamming Zod - intensely gratifying. Story & Script (If I understand the term Script correctly): Nolan and Goyer wrote and conceived the story together with Goyer then writing the screenplay. I must admit that this is definitely a very unique take on Superman, the likes of which we've never seen in any Superman movie or comic. The ideas presented are interesting and one plot point gradually leads into the next instead of scenes being forced. And the ending is simply brilliant. Performances: Shannon as Zod is exceptional. Cavill as Superman is also intense. And both the fathers add their unique paternal touches. Everyone else plays their part convincingly. Score: Hans Zimmer. That epic score running in the battles scenes. It doesn't get any bigger and better. Enough said.Now, onto the dislikes: Zack Snyder: I seriously didn't like his direction. He overuses Zimmer's score, inserts random flashbacks and focuses much more on action when instead he could have given time to characters like the Kents, Perry and Lois (though she does get a lot to do). Although the story had the world ""reacting realistically"" to Superman's arrival, we rarely get those moments save one or two shots of people staring in the sky reminiscent of standard disaster flicks - meaning, nothing different. I guess Nolan in the chair could have made a huge difference. Cinematography: The hand-held work, while good enough in the action scenes, totally sucked during character interactions. I mean, when Jonathan is talking to kid Clark, the camera shakes so much to make it ""seem real"" that it looks like those scenes were shot with a Galaxy SIII with stabilization turned off. I doubt shaking the camera that much was the best way to achieve realism with the 3D making it even worse. Steady camera shots focusing on the actors could have a more powerful effect if not more. Miscellaneous: Characters rarely get beyond a point (lets hope there's more of that in the sequel). The only exception is Zod who is far far better than what he was in Superman II - and yup, you actually empathize with him. The first meeting of Lois and Clark is not what people would expect and hope for (yet seems to be the only way to progress the story forward it seems). The ""realistic"" portrayal they were so talking about seems completely lacking as well.So many hits and yet so many misses. While Man Of Steel is certainly a good movie, it was destined for greatness which it never manages to fully achieves. This, and not the movie, is the reason for my disappointment. Nevertheless, it certainly deserves a watch on the big screen. The action alone is worth it.Score: 6.5 / 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Gets so much right, and then so much more wrong","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2826952/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieAddict2016","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1173088/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2013","To paraphrase another iconic comic book character, Christopher Nolan's Batman movies changed everything. Afterward, there was no turning back. Their darker, more ""realistic"" spin in a post-9/11 world connected with audiences and revolutionized genre filmmaking. Perhaps this is why Bryan Singer's bubblegum homage to Richard Donner inherent in the more idealistic ""Superman Returns"" never really flew -- truth be told, though, it wasn't nearly as terrible a movie as the fanboys would lead you to believe, and got a lot of things right with Superman and the universe. But Warner Bros. wasn't satisfied with its $400 mil box office and thought it could have done better, and, after a long gestation period in Hollywood terms, they decided to reboot the franchise. The key words here being in a darker, more realistic manner. They even got Nolan to sign on as an in-name-only producer.Zack Snyder tries desperately to ape Nolan's style, while still maintaining some of his own trademarks. Gone is his usual over-emphasis on slow-motion theatrics, but kept intact is the tendency to have moments of brilliance padded out with long stretches of mediocrity.So much of ""Man of Steel"" is right. They somewhat successfully manage to update Clark Kent, an ostensibly outdated character, by focusing on his struggles: the X-ray vision and superhuman powers are treated more as a plight, rather than a joyous revelation, and we see flashbacks of his childhood with parents Kevin Costner and Diane Lane that mostly do a good job of highlighting the downside of these gifts, and the influence his human parents had on his upbringing. Some of this is almost beautifully well done, and Snyder gets so close to pinpointing the human core necessary to make this character relatable to human audiences.But then there's the typical bloating. Twenty or thirty minutes of Russell Crowe prologue that is just a big, long excuse to show off their $200 + mil budget. The Krypton scenes look pretty, but they ramble on endlessly, and the interplanetary government stuff reeks of George Lucas' attempts to make such boring crap entertaining in the Star Wars prequels. The costumes, the dialogue -- all uniformly terrible. Took me right out of the movie before it even got started.Crowe, you start to feel, is only in the movie because he is Russell Crowe. Brando's scenes in the original Superman (and Brando was a bigger star than Crowe was today) were more restrained and vital to the storyline. A solid 20 minutes could have been cut from the film to make it tighter and leaner, and the plot -- which really services the movie less than Snyder seems to think -- wouldn't have been faulted any more for omitting them.For a 2.5 hour movie, the Lois Lane/Clark Kent relationship is surprisingly muddled and the two leads share no chemistry, but that may be because the film never affords them the opportunity. Amy Adams is incredibly gifted as an actress, but she's constantly running around in a hurried fashion whenever we see her, already closing in on Clark's identity (err, Superman's) as the film begins. They seem to take a liking to each other out of necessity rather than for any organic reason. Perhaps the studio wanted less character development because Singer's film was faulted for placing TOO much of an emphasis on Lois and Clark, but honestly, this is a glaring issue with the movie, because it expects us to care about their relationship towards the end. The first hour of the movie gets a lot right, but when it spirals downward into a cacophony of endless, cartoon violence in the last hour and a half, it just falls apart chaotically. One car explodes after the other. Buildings are razed. The damage is in the billions of dollars. But here's the problem: the characters turn into invincible caricatures. Nolan's films worked when there was violent conflict because we believed the characters were mortal. There don't seem to be any defined limits on the strengths and weaknesses of these Kryptonians. They toss about through the air endlessly, smashing each other into one object after the other, and not very convincingly (the special effects become increasingly sloppy). The noise becomes deafening and the visuals tiresome. Snyder gets all of this wrong and it completely derails his film.Superhero mayhem can work. I'm not a huge fan of Joss Wheden but he managed to pull it off in The Avengers' climactic finale, and you could comprehend what the hell was happening on screen in his movie. In stark contrast, Snyder's whip-fast editing, random ultra-close-zoom shots and generally endless mayhem on screen just completely asphyxiate the film's drama and heart. It's a shame, because for the first hour or so he gets quite a lot right. Then it all falls victim to his usual excesses. Audiences often aren't looking for more in their summer blockbusters, so of course the film is doing well financially. But in the long run it won't be considered in the same breath as the superior films it has been overly influenced by, and Snyder bears most of the blame for that.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

It set a great tone, murky and dark in all the right places, while also offering a good sense of comedy, at least in the first half. While it could easily be argued that the movie's run time was far too long, it still used what time it took wisely in both back story and character development. That is to say, when it's not blowing up everything in sight along the way. The action sequences were very well put together, though some of them could have used some toning down. Overall, it brought a new light of hope for the Superman franchise that Superman Returns missed, and could help rebuild the damage that Lester did back in the 70's with his cinematic atrocities. The characters were very well kept with their roles (with Fishburne making a surprising appearance) and I cannot wait for a sequel to show itself in the next three years. Definitely a proud addition to the DC film collection.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

His earthly father sacrificed more then he did.This might be the quintessential problem with superman; how can he be thoroughly challenged when he's impervious to harm? Batman was broken, outcast, had to deal with real loss. Compared to that, Superman seems like the uptown kid, taking a stroll in the ghetto, smiling down on the unfortunate.Take this movie as a Zack Snyder movie, not a Christopher Nolan one and go to see quality action.

But what is the use if the viewer spends 90 minutes wondering what is happening and where this is going. Whilst it is noble and even advisable to show a superhero with weakness, the way it is done, it was essentially overdone.

"8","/10","While it lacks the fun and magic of Christopher Reeve's Superman, Man of Steel is an excellent Superhero Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5393641/?ref_=tt_urv","zanghi_james","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87141826/?ref_=tt_urv","9 January 2020","Man of Steel is an interesting and refreshing take on the Superman mythos, and appropriately, it is the first film of the DC Extended Cinematic Universe. It might not be as fun as Christopher Reeve or George Reeves' takes on Superman, and it certainly is one of the darker Superhero films, but there are a lot of great scenes and iconic shots, which is sort of a trademark for Zack Snyder with his superhero films.Also, I love Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's score. It would be hard to imagine the light and heroic feel of the John Williams' 'Superman' Theme from Christopher Reeve's films playing in a lot of scenes like the Smallville Skirmish or the Battle of Metropolis, and especially Zod and Superman's violent fight at the end.The movie does have a slow start, even with the opening sequence on Krypton and the Oil Rig sequence, but once the action truly starts, it doesn't let up at all. I had the good fortune to see this in the theaters with my dad, and the Theater's surround sound certainly helped the soundtrack and the sound effects of the explosions.There are some points I wasn't impressed with. Mainly, there was the similarity in style to Christopher Nolan's style of filming and editing, but also I found the cinematography effects a little weird. There was a bit of lens flare which made me think I was watching a J.J. Abrams Star Trek film occasionally, and also at some points in the action scenes, the camera zooms in to certain points of action with extreme abruptness. Also, portraying Superman more darker and broody like Batman was in the Dark Knight Trilogy is borderline sacrilege.Despite these minor and major problems with the story and cinematography and editing, I really enjoyed this film. I hope Henry Cavill reprises his performance as Superman in another film, preferably as a more nicer Superman, because he is almost as good as Christopher Reeve.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I can not agree with this in any way. There's nothing remotely close to the old Superman movies or even the most of the comics. This movie is just one big CGI compilation with way to much action and explosions that must have killed more civilians than than Superman could ever save. There's not even the slightest little rescue of a simple citizen and the one explosion after the other just becomes to much topped of with angry screaming villains.I'm sorry if I have ruined someones day with this review but really, true Superman fans can not and will not like this movie and Mr. Snyder just lost a fan. You can not direct if you can not bring out the true feeling in a movie. And making a new version of a movie series that is cult and totally revert that to just another ""explosive CGI without a real plot"" movie is the sign to quit the businesses. Really, I'm sorry. I have nothing good to say about this movie, the director or the writers.Last words: This movie feels more like one of those B movies you see released before a big release with similar name.Best regards - A true Superman fan for 22 years.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Perhaps the biggest appeal is that it gives us a chance to see what life would be like if we, as a species, had a guardian angel watching over and protecting us. If Zack Snyder's Man Of Steel is anything to go by, it may not be as rosy as you might think, but it sure will look amazing.But how do you introduce the character of Superman to the iPad and Facebook generation whilst retaining that which made him so popular in the first place? How do you tell an age-old origin story without making it feel like a pointless retread? Well, thankfully, Man Of Steel avoids that potential pitfall thanks to some clever plot pacing and outstanding action set pieces. A fantastic opening on Superman's home planet of Krypton provides just enough backstory and exposition before the movie jumps forward 30 years to show Clark/Superman working on an oil rig. It then jumps back and forth as it gives us glimpses of Clark's upbringing. It was a brave decision to tell the story non-chronologically, but it works. With Superman's origins already well known, there could have been a sense of deja vu had Snyder told the story in a conventional way but this keeps it feeling fresh and exciting.The second half of the movie deals with Superman's attempts to prevent the misguided General Zod from destroying Earth and rebuilding Krypton in its place. It's fairly standard comic book fare and gives Snyder the chance to wow us with some awe inspiring action scenes. You will marvel at Superman's first flight, his epic tussle with two of Zod's henchmen and his final fight with the man himself. This is truly the first Superman movie where he actually feels super.After the disappointment of Superman Returns in 2006, Zack Snyder has brought the character back with a bang. An abundance of action, a clever and interesting take on the origin, fantastic acting from all involved and a Hans Zimmer score which rivals John Williams iconic tune, all contribute to make Man Of Steel an absolute triumph.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The biggest issue I have is with how it looks. The abundant effects get obnoxious and the constant gray look is incredibly boring. There is no color contrast.

Then as fashion dictates there's the need for over doing the computer effects etc, which makes you feel like you're watching a kids play-station game.

This story is certainly based on the history of Superman we all know. But it's been modernized - big time. So just brace yourself for this update, and you can enjoy this story.The number of coincidences in the plot were annoying. Sometimes inconvenient loose ends are simply dropped and ignored (but try as I might, I couldn't forget them). And the shaky cam, while improved here, in my opinion, was still overused and over-the-top.Unlike the 1977 movie where Reeves follows a straight path from Krypton, to farm boy, to hero, this Superman meanders. He struggles to figure out where to go, how to live his life, etc. I think this is why other reviews call the story line a ""mess."" But it's intentional. He's an outcast, in hiding, without an instruction manual. So his story is directionless and confused, for a long time. That's the real story arc of this movie. It's Clark Kent figuring out - what next? I was thoroughly entertained, thanks to the warning to clear my mind of expectations.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Superman Returns attempted to create a not-quite direct sequel to Superman II and unfortunately, and somewhat inexplicably, failed. Out of the ashes of that project comes the reboot, or what happens to films when they have an iconic character or storyline that could make Hollywood a lot of money, but a sequel for whatever reason is out of the question.First, the pros - Cavill is quite possibly the best actor to don the cape. This does not mean he is the best Superman by any means...that title belongs to Reeves if only for the fact that his innocent charm makes up for his lack of acting capabilities. Zod is the greatest villain in the earlier films. Michael Shannon does an okay job with the character, but he is not as fearsome as Terence Stamp. Still, he brings some humanity to the role of Zod that was lacking before, but unfortunately we only catch a glimpse of that humanity, and by then our patience has worn thin. The story is good, and the narration is pretty good. I was not bored...until the last half hour or so, which brings me to the cons.Apparently, for a film to be considered epic, it must be of epic length. This is fine, as long as there is no filler. For this film, I am actually hoping for a Director's Cut that takes stuff out rather than puts stuff back in. The final half hour of this film could have been removed without losing anything. It was unnecessary, and even anti-climactic. The action sequence at the end inspired only nausea for this reviewer, and a sense of relief when it finally ended.Next - Lois Lane. Superman films have struggled with the character of Lois Lane now that Margot Kidder is out of the picture. Amy Adams is a good actress in her own right, and I feel like she could have been good in this film, but was given little opportunity to do so. Plus, I really don't like what they did with the story of Lois and Superman. There was a certain humorous arc that was present in Superman I, II, and Superman Returns that is absent in this film and which will be absent in all subsequent films.All that being said, this film is worth watching in theaters. It is immensely entertaining, has a great cast, and is in the hands of a capable albeit over-indulgent director. I hope they do a sequel, and I hope, as it was with the original series (again, in my humblest of opinions), that the sequel is even better than this one. There is obvious room for improvement, but I believe that the filmmakers have accomplished their goal of introducing Superman to the 21st century audience. Now that he's here, the challenge is keeping him here.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This word means so many different things to so many people. Everyone has their own version of what superman should be like. A lot of us grew up with Christopher Reeves. Others have never had a Superman to picture. The former are probably angry that this new superman is the first superman that a whole generation are being introduced to.Why? Maybe because this Superman isn't as clean cut as Reeve's version. But there are 2 flaws here: 1) Reeve's Superman is from a different era 2) You shouldn't even compare. We all loved Reeves but this is a new take on the Man of Steel. Nolan asks how would a man who learns he's from another planet actually act if it was true? Would he be as clean cut as Reeve's portrayal - probably not. We'd like to think he'd try, but the truth is that it would be a very rocky road for that person. They're at a point where they can take over the world or choose instead to help it. And it points back to a simple truth - we are heavily influenced by our upbringing, which rings home in Nolan's version. Some people are annoyed at the violence and amount of people who die in this movie. But the point again Nolan makes is that if there was a Superman on earth a lot of his battles would end in destruction. Unavoidable. And civilian casualties would be inevitable. Superman is only 1 man. And couldn't possibly save everyone. But what is hammered home here is that he would save those he could. However there would always be Victims. And a lot of people hate this truth and therefore don't like the movie. Understandable. Superman is a fantasy. A chance to believe a hero can save everyone. No matter how unbelievable. Why superheroes were invented. Nolan likes to look at the realistic side though of these characters. So if you want to see a realistic take on Superman go see this film. If you have an ideal Superman already in your head, this film will probably annoy you. I loved the realism. I loved that Superman wasn't perfect. And maybe even made choices at the end that he'll regret later. But that's my preferred version (at the moment) of the Man of Steel. Flawed but trying his best to make the right choices based on what he learned from his parents. And isn't that what we all spend our life trying to do?","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

His Mom Martha played by the lovingly wise Diane Lane, says, ""Then make it small"" This is ironic coming from the boy, who grows into Superman. Zack Snyder's reinvention of the Superman mythology in ""Man of Steel"" is awesome. It is and not necessarily for the obvious. Yes, the movie is infused with visually striking images, in the epic struggle of good against evil. In the mesmerizing story and screenplay by Writer David S. Goyer and Writer/Producer Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight"" movies), Clark's true power sources not so much from his physical prowess, rather from the love of family.Clark becomes the man, who changes the world, from the love of his two Fathers, Jor-El played by Russell Crowe and Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Costner in his best supporting role in years. Their gravitas and authentic belief in their son be it by blood or choice, distinguishes ""Man of Steel"". Perhaps fittingly, ""Man of Steel"" opened on Father's Day Weekend. For Goyer and Nolan, Clark or Kal-El is Superman, not the other way around, and that is the profound difference. They also construct a hysterical joke about the title Superman. In a flashback on the Kansas Farm, Costner's Jonathan tells teenage Clark (sensitive Dylan Sprayberry), ""You have to decide what kind of man you are going to be."" Destiny lies in choice.Henry Cavill is amazing as Clark and Kal-El. He is ridiculously handsome with high cheekbones and heroic jaw line. His rock hard body is chiseled and shredded with or without the suit. He is charismatic without many lines. I had read reviews that label Cavill and the movie as overly dour. Perhaps overstated. Cavill has genuine commanding presence, and displays touching doubt and humor. He is wryly funny as he explains to Amy Adams's Lois Lane that the symbol on his chest means Hope on his planet. He and Costner are deeply moving in Clark's defining moment in the Smallville storm.It is surprising when Cavill finally dons the iconic and in this case also recreated Suit in ""Man of Steel"". In this story bearded Clark (Cavill) is a wanderer, kind of like John Rambo, helping people and discovering his destiny. This is not your Father's Superman. This narrative affinity is distinctly Nolan as with Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"". Cavill is poignantly enrolling as Clark struggles to harness and disguise his power.I have to digress. But how does Superman shave? Kryptonite Fusion blade? No Kryptonite in ""Man of Steel"". The choice by Snyder and company is the right one. ""Man of Steel"" is really about the power of love and cost of sacrifice. That element would have been a narrative distraction. This streamlined retelling is puzzling at first, though ultimately sublime.Much of the prelude resumes on the dying home world Krypton that orbits its Red Sun which has a ""Matrix"" and ""Star Trek"" like visual vibe. Benevolent Scientist Jor-El (Crowe at his noble best) warns the Council of Krypton's demise—aftermath of their own brazen irresponsibility. Simultaneously, evil General Zod (menacing Michael Shannon) and his warriors mount a coup to restore Krypton's greatness. Refreshingly, Crowe's Jor-El is a kick-ass hero warrior as well. His son Kal-El is the first natural birth in centuries, having his own choice in uncovering his destiny. Jor-El and Lara scheme to send Kal-El to Earth for salvation. With the Yellow Sun, and other attributes Kal-El would be a god among Men, or rather a Messiah. This was always a captivating metaphor of the Superman story. However, tragedy befalls the House of El. Zod and his Minions are banished to the Phantom Zone for centuries, not before declaring his vengeance.Amy Adams is perfection as Lois Lane, brilliantly cast. This time around she is the determined Pulitzer Prize Winning Report, searching for the enigmatic Good Samaritan Clark. The twist works, because being fooled by the mild mannered glasses is utterly moronic. As Lois, Adams is strong and beautiful yet vulnerable. She and Cavill have a visceral chemistry, whimsically touching.The last 45 minutes of ""Man of Steel"" is riveting, visually unrelenting chaos, with Hans Zimmer's hammering score. Explosions startle and rubble rains everywhere. You can practically feel the Dolby impact as Kal-El and Zod exchange punishing blows. Along the way we encounter some weird story glitches. Zod was bread and trained to be the deadly warrior; however, Kal-El predictably holds his own. Gorgeous and scary Antje Traue really schools Kal-El with some Kryptonian martial arts. Snyder is often baffling in the coherent strength scale of his hero and villains, but oh well. He does make the flying look cool. The rest of the supporting cast is stellar particularly, Laurence Fishburne as scene stealing Perry White and Chris Meloni as brave Col. Hardy.""Man of Steel"" soars in this hero's journey, wondrous re-visioning by Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan. Henry Cavill is amazing. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are awesome in the story of Fathers' love for their son. ""Man of Steel"" is awesome as well.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

However, this movie was way too long for it's story(1/3 of the scenes in 143 minutes were very unnecessary). This is not the first time I felt this way about Zack Snyder movie. Zack Snyder is amazing director with very unique sense of graphics and shots, but he is not a good storyteller to keep audience interested throughout his movie. Every single one of his movies feels like he doesn't know where to cut the scenes(he always drags the scenes and stories beyond necessity). It would be much better if the movie was shorter and faster because this movie did have great story and scenes, but Zack Snyder's slow storytelling gave this movie some setbacks. So when you walk in the theater, you shouldn't expect anything other than another Zack Snyder movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For a new younger audience however I am sure many will love this film as it provides some great looking scenes and action moments. Essentially this is Superman 1 and 2 rolled into 1 with a few minor differences. The story telling early on is very good and provides good depth into Superman as well as good back story of Krypton, his family and General Zod. There is also a decent back story with regards to Kents life growing up at school and at home with his family e.t.cThe main differences between this film and the originals is the fact that Kent does not make his move to Metropolis and his job as a reporter until the very end of the film. This means much of the action takes part outside of the city. For the first instalment of this revamp it was very good but I want to see something new in the Superman story. The great thing is that we have a very good leading man in Henry Cavill who goes from rugged Kent to smart Kent with lots of the man of steel in between. I look forward to the next instalment as this one kind of fell flat for me as it was entirely predictable and a lot like Deja vu in many scenes. But at the same time I really enjoyed the more gritty side to the story in the earlier sections of the film. 7/10 x","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can honestly say i felt similar coming out of the theatre after watching this as i did watching Pacific Rim even though they were completely different stories and this movie was miles ahead compared to Pacific Rim.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the movie does misfire at times, it is a good, solid piece of the DC universe. Of course, we must go through the origin story since this is an official reboot. So we have to learn of Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and General Zod (Michael Shannon), the plot to overthrow the planet, the exile of Zod and his cohorts, and the escape of Kal-El to Earth. The story continues as the Kents adopt the boy and watch him grow up. Straying from the story, Clark (Henry Cavill) is a loner, realizing his abilities and identity make him an outsider. He does good deeds, moves on, does some more incredible good deeds, and moves on. He eventually discovers his father's spaceship. Also discovering the ship is a young Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who has been following the trail of mysterious good deeds. It is then, she discovers the lonely Superman. As he reveals himself to the world, it does not know what to do with him – especially the U.S. military. All that changes when Zod escapes and returns to Earth. Now, they must trust the incredible alien. A few problems do exist in the story. The beginning is laden with a complex plot addition that seems irrelevant to the rest of the story. It does allow for Zod to have a slight motivation, but it is negligible to the story's end, and it drags it down a little long. Second, the end battle is drawn out a bit too long, overdosing on the destruction and mayhem of a real fight between the last two survivors of Kyrpton. However, this is the greatest aspect in this particular version of Superman: a gritty realism in both characters and situations. It really gets going as Clark goes through changes, discovering his super- hearing and super-sight at a young age and not knowing how to deal with them. This keeps him as an outsider and a loner. Another scene has him deal with a rowdy restaurant patron who pours beer over Clark's head. When he discovers flight, Superman must learn to control it, and eventually finds it exhilarating. One of the best scenes is when he circles half the globe and then ascends to the edge of space. Then comes the burden of being Superman: defending the people of Earth from Zod. This is a lonely life that keeps him isolated. And his super powers cannot shield him from emotional trauma and his own fear of rejection. The characters of Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) are stellar, giving a sense of worry and love for their adopted son. Many people are going to want to compare this one to the original Superman starring Christopher Reeve. True, it is a classic, especially with the more difficult special effects needed at that time. Also, Reeve played the roles of Clark and Superman as opposites: Clark the bumbling, inept fool, and Superman as the confident, strong type. Henry Cavill, gives a more quiet performance, giving us emotion on both sides of his identity. He does struggle with who he is, while Reeve only struggles as Clark. Margo Kidder gave us a strong Lois, but she was still ditzy. Amy Adams is strong and passionate, but needs coaching on restraint from Perry White. Also, Laurence Fishburne is a strong, wise, and reserved Perry White. Simply put: the older version was for kids, Man of Steel is for the adults that want to see realism in our heroes – even the imagined ones like Superman. We all have to reconcile seeing our parents, and our heroes as real, fallible human beings. In this case, Man of Steel, is about a Superman who may have steel-like skin, but has a fragile soul like the rest of us.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie is not a typical marvel movie (which I am not condemning) but rather it is trying to take a new take on superhero's and classic stories through camera work, soundtrack, and showing the superhero world isn't black and white. The movies visuals are interesting and personally I liked them but I see how the shaking camera style is not for all. The character development was not ordinary but through flash backs showing Clark grow over the years and the plot is showing the out come of his growth.

From the outset the setting of Krypton is just bizarre. The film sets itself out in a an extremely space odyssey esque version of sci fi that if not for a extremely strange S logo on jor els outfit is utterly unrecognisable as a Superman film.Indeed, the strange setting is more similar to the lizard running scene featuring Ewan Mcgregors Obi Wan Kenobi, or Avatar than any semblance of a recognisable DC superhero.Onto the main thrust of the movie itself, you can see what Zac Snyder has tried to do in moving so drastically away from the Richard Donner stylisation of Superman and the subsequent utterly awful and boring Superman Returns,Unfortunately in doing so it has moved the character and setting just too far away from any expectations or previous character base to be able to establish any suspension of belief and thus emotional attachment to the characters.Obviously the agenda from Snyder was to make such drastic changes and to create a universe through his own process that no one else would be able to mould the upcoming justice league series other than him.The castings were, well, erratic. Some choices were clearly made just because they could. Im not going to base my amusement of Lawrence Fishbourne being cast as Perry White on a racial viewpoint because as an actor fishbourne performs admirably but it does raise the question was he cast in order to simply raise the clear message that this is not going to be anywhere close to your dads superman?Cavill as superman is an interesting choice and he has plainly made a superhuman effort to present a far more muscular superman than has ever been shown on the big screen before. However, as an avid superman fan I found it hard not to notice the fact that the guy has curly, almost afro esque hair that is deeply out of place on superman.As for the new suit, it is terrible. Nowhere near any kind of recognisable material from anywhere in the DC universe. And further in the film it turns out to actually be 'super underwear' that raises all kinds of questions that are probably best left alone.......Amy Adams as Lois Lane was probably the equal best Lois alongside Teri Hatcher from the 90's series Lois and Clark.I have never been a fan of the casting of Margot Kidder in the original movies, and Kate Bosworth was a terrible casting choice in Superman Returns.The sad fact however you look at it is Adams may well end up with the dubious title of best of a bad bunch.All in all the film ends up being a special effect bonanza which rather than improving the film, actually winds up with too much debris and destruction to be able to follow the plot (such as it is) it feels as though the director has thrown everything and the kitchen sink in so as to make most use of technology available.Michael Shannon as Zod was good, but this is to be expected as he rarely fails to deliver a believable performance.Hopefully the development of the Justice league series will improve as sadly Man of Steel was only an adequate springboard that could have been so much better. It seems apparent that the choice of director here was the wrong one and this may well prove to be a deciding factor in the upcoming struggle between marvels Avengers series and the Justice League.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Everyone unfamiliar with the lore of Superman, the super hero type movies can be a lame critic and say what ever negative they want! FANS pay the money, critics Don't! And FANS are right! Don't listen to the few critics, listen to the FANS!2)skip the 3D and watch the Imax 2D version if you have the choice, more enjoyable in many ways, not tiring for your eyes (specially if you where already glasses), and you miss nothing special.3)the Man of Steel is what everyone TRUE fan ever wanted for Superman! An Unbound Superman, a Superman scratching barely his power Limits and still be powerful, a SUPER-man that is no lame, week, trying to hard to pick up a car, but can travel to other planets! This movie after the 2nd half, thanks to Director Zack Snyder Delivers that POWER feeling! Be ready for some really goosebumps!4)Zack Snyder as Director, working with a Single Camera, makes this movie Super Realistic, even thought we are talking about Aliens that are so powerful we cant even imagine! The effects are AMAZING, the transaction from ""real to CGI"" fantastic, it feels like you are there! It feels like all the powerful moments you had in mind as a kid or not, reading the comics, are coming now to life!5)Sad to the level it had to be, love and romantic to the level it had to be, this movies is about Man of Steel, he is here to remind us of our Humanity! That feeling, that we are not ""alone in the universe"", the fear of some people, the admiration from others, the trust as well, are nicely presented in a realistic way that Nolan created with his ""Story"" as a Writer.I have seen it already 3 times and going for at least other 2 this weekend, and 100% get the BlueRay version.Its like Zack Snyder said, ""imagine there was no other superman films before that!""Superman was not ""re-born"" with Man of Steel, Superman was BORN NOW!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

If we are there to watch the movie, we already know about the beginnings, likely with more detail than the director and screen writer.

"","","A unique treat!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812760/?ref_=tt_urv","manuscriptna","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24123130/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","To start, watch out for the first period of the film, set on Krypton. It's full of sci-fi and comic eye-candy.It was great that Christopher Nolan chose a darker hero for his superhero debut. Given that he'd been directing such-themed movies (Memento, The Following, Inception), wouldn't it follow that the Man of Steel himself would take on a darker tone? While in a few ways it did, Zack Snyder's fantastic vision (as per usual) and Zimmer's cold, bright score helped breathe a different life into DC Comics' newest film feature.While I'm familiar with only some films (and none of the comics) with Superman, I will say I enjoyed this one most. It is a wonderful, emotionally-involved origin story that leads you through the development of this Man of Steel quite well. Henry Cavill plays an extraordinary man learning what it means to be a hero. I appreciated seeing his normal human attitude shine through. After all, he grew up knowing no other way to act.Amy Adams as Lois Lane didn't fit as I hoped, though she did fair. The Daily Planet group did well, but were slightly off-putting. I'm hoping they do more in future films, if they appear. Michael Shannon's was my favorite performance: a near-emotionless (yet obsessed) general with a greater good in mind, and nothing will stay in his way. The climax of the story was just as it should have been.Here are a few ways Nolan's darker presence have seeped in. Krypton is seen as a plague, destroying to survive, but I won't go further into that. The threats in Man of Steel are very real, and have dire effects. This isn't Avengers. People die, destruction reigns. That said, the violence isn't blatant, but does happen. On that note, there is some language and frightening/intense scenes, but nothing more to worry about. I highly appreciate the lack of inappropriate material in this film.In conclusion, Man of Steel has not let much in the past explicitly define it. A unique costume, altered chronology, real terror and threats, character accuracy and development, and more are all defined by this film more than the previous ones (or other superhero films). I recommend it to all fans and newcomers.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Amy Adams was the female lead ... we spent nearly $50 on movie, drink and popcorn... wife nearly fell asleep during the battle/fight scenes. On the positive side, Zack Snyder and the writers did an excellent job of re-telling this classing comic book tale with a new twist. Overall it looks stunning. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams have a passably convincing chemistry. Russel Crow does an excellent job with what he had to work with. Now for the negative ... The movie is a long slog ... the time spent on special effects and battle scenes could have easily been cut in half, while more time could have been spent developing the plot ... starting with the opening scenes on Krypton. Its a mixed bag - they don't make Jor-El's people ""alien"" enough in my opinion. The warrior class is like Necromongers from Chronicles of Riddick while the ruling class look like the Vulcans from Star Trek. There's also a somewhat Star Wars Episode I feel about the opening scenes. The language everybody uses is just way too ... ""American"" especially Shannon's General Zod character - I wish he brought the kind of edge Antje Traue brought to her Faora-Ul character.Its a good reboot to the franchise ... but not worthy of some of the praise it's received. Too many recycled bits and pieces from other recent sci-fi movies, with a look that didn't necessarily match it's language.It's like meeting a Brazilian supermodel with a mid-western American accent. Its like some je ne sais quoi was missing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is amazing in so many ways I lost count. The feel of the movie, the epic action and fight scenes, the FX look outstanding, the Casting is great, the movie is full of Easter eggs, EXPLOSIONS, it puts you in the shoes of Superman and The movie itself will give you at least five goosebumps.There are six reasons why some people didn't like this movie.1. They are weak and can't handle all this destruction. 2. They are too attached to the comic they forgot what would a real man with super powers would do. 3. They can't handle the fact that Superman can't actually fly everywhere every second saving thousands of people from dying all at once. 4. They do not understand the meaning of ""movie"" 5. Other comic fanboys hating on this movie. 6. You know how many idiots are in this world.Honestly, this movie is almost perfect. I can't think of any flaws except for one: Lois Lane appears in one scene that you can't explain how she got there. That's it!Everything in this movie is great, any NORMAL human being would understand that.

"4","/10","A lackluster exploration of comic book lore, devoid of heart, humor, depth, personality, conviction, and consistency.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2824901/?ref_=tt_urv","dylanedwards1406","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44778590/?ref_=tt_urv","3 July 2013","Perhaps the most daunting task that comes with writing a story set in a surreal and fantastical world is balancing the equilibrium of pseudo-sophistication and uncanny self-awareness. This is a task that inherently requires much care and cleverness. I found Superman's latest theatrical treatment to be a lackluster exploration of comic book lore, devoid of heart, humor, depth, personality, conviction, and consistency. It seems to aim it's appeal at the portion of the audience who simply want to see the visual representation of characters and settings from the Superman mythology thrown onto the big screen for the sake of seeing themon the big screen. In fact, if it weren't for the size of the IMAX screen that I viewed this movie upon, my attention would have all but evaporated during the film. On the other hand, the pretentious length and overwhelming sensory assault of the climactic action sequence completely exhausted my attention for what was happening to whom and/or what on the screen. Paradox at its finest. From viewing the trailers released for this film, I was under the impression that Man of Steel was to be a coming-of-age story. This expectation was squelched by the time I could see where the story was going, but I will elaborate on that later. Dialogue from the trailer between a youthful Clark Kent and his father, played by Kevin Costner, hinted at the possibility of further exploration of Superman's place in society as a supernatural figure. ""You have to keep this side of yourself a secret,"" Clark's father explains. ""I have to believe that you were sent here for a reason."" Through Clark's upbringing, he is instilled with the ethic that society is not yet capable of embracing, tolerating, or appreciating his true self, but that he has a greater purpose that cannot possibly be imagined. Until the appropriate time (e.g. a CG apocalypse consisting of invaders from his home world wreaking havoc on Earth), it is the safe and smart decision for Clark to exercise restraint in his special abilities, even if it means not acting in situations where his powers could benefit or even save the lives of others. This conflict of self-discipline versus compassion and human impulse could make for a convicting character arch. Unfortunately, the writing is far too incompetent for any empathy to be evoked from viewers as the motivations of Superman's character are cheated from the first frame of his reveal sequence; a reveal sequence that occurs BEFORE the implied ""appropriate time"" for Superman to exercise his powers in the presence of others. What makes this cheat even worse is that through a flashback sequence that occurs later in the film, we see our main character make a difficult choice during a time when his ethics are tested by a tragic scenario. He chooses to honor his ethics rather than act on impulse. But as viewers, we know that he is willing to compromise his ethics during less dire circumstances. This blatant inconsistency with no justification causes the viewer to lose any understanding or respect that they might have had for the character as well as the script. Those brief clips of dialogue between Clark and his earthly father in the trailer are about all we get as far as character development goes. There are some great casting choices here and the actors perform exceptionally well considering what they are given to work with. Unfortunately, most of these characters are missed opportunities. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is shamefully sidelined after a tease of an entrance for her character. Her first few lines suggest that her character is strong-willed, clever, ambitious, and well deserving of our attention (as well as more screen time). However, as the story progresses, she is diminished to the typical damsel in distress and doesn't even share a convincing romance with our hero. Every sequence throughout the movie exists purely as build-up for the third act: a prolonged, cliché, tiresome action sequence. Perhaps this scene would have held my attention if there had been some sort of humor interjected. I've seen so many CGI cities zapped by aliens that I've become desensitized to the whole visual spectacle by now. Audiences need another dynamic besides the boom factor in order to latch onto scenes like this. A few more laughs would have serviced this segment of the movie well. The only part that I found myself laughing at during the entire movie was a brief moment where Superman can be seen flying in the air, smashing through columns of a parking deck causing it to crumble to the ground. This parking deck was hardly an obstruction to his flight pattern. Superman must have just figured that because the bad guys were busy leveling the rest of the city in the background, one little parking deck wouldn't be missed by anyone. Of course, I have to believe that this comedy was unintentional, which brings us to the second greatest flaw of the movie (the first being the aforementioned character inconsistency): this film takes itself way too seriously. The tone and direction of this film can be summed up in one scene. In the beginning of the final action sequence, we see two characters fighting, throwing each other through buildings and spewing cliché dialogue. In one moment, a character is plummeted through the ceiling of an I Hop restaurant. Any other movie in the Superhero genre would have used this awkward choice of a set to a humorous advantage. But here, we don't get a punch line, just more ""you underestimate my power""-esque lines. Gripping...I say skip this one.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I grew up with cartoons in the 1960's and 1970's and leaned more to DC Comics than Marvel, but even I had to say that up to the BATMAN re- boot with the Nolan Trilogy, Marvel films were better action and better stories. But MAN OF STEEL comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam, it is certainly a home run.Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the Superman storyline, while still allowing for character development, action, and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology. Henry Cavill (Superman/Clark Kent), Amy Adams (Lois Lane; she had an appearance as a villain in ""SMALLVILLE""), Michael Shannon (Zod), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent) all give great appearances in their roles, big or small. Russell Crowe is a fantastic and very believable Jor-El; let's hope they can re-utilise him in future DC Comics/SUPEMAN/Justice League sequels.MOS is a unique film compared to previous Superman story lines. From the 1951 ""ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN"" through the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's to the 1978 SUPERMAN film with Christopher Reeve to the recent SMALLVILLE TV series, every showing of Superman has shown Superman advancing in chronological order, usually from birth/his appearance on Earth. But MOS took a different tack which makes the film very interesting, where series of flashbacks (like dream sequences) from Clark's time on Earth are interspersed with the main storyline. So you see a very young Clark in school, an adolescent Clark saving a school bus, an early-20's Clark working at a bar, Clark on a fishing vessel, and the death of Jonathan Kent (great performance by Kevin Costner) at different times in the film, seemingly popping up at random. It accentuates the importance of these events in the younger Clark's life and tells the story of his time on Earth in a different perspective. The ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the Last Son Of Krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the Superman mythology (which is probably most of us). Very well done !!As for the movie itself: Jor-El and Zod's relationship is dramatic and a new twist on Zod's megalomania; it is too bad they couldn't explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies (perhaps in a sequel?). I have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with Jor-El/Zod and the rest of Krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline. The darker tone of MOS would have lent itself more to such a story (more so than the Kryptonian Council scenes at the beginning of the 1978 SUPERMAN movie). Pay attention to the difference in Clark's tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to Jonathan Kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer, and later in the movie when he goes after Zod for 'threatening his mother.'Lois Lane's relationship to Superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of Superman. Another positive; the writers and producers stayed true to the basic Superman story arc but knew they needed a few 'changeups' to make this different to captivate the audience, besides the darker tone. Perry White's character is much less interesting (and funny) than Jackie Cooper's portrayal in the 1978 film. But if Lawrence Fishburne is OK with it, who am I to complain ?The ending has plenty of action, and the complaints by some that there is too much rock- 'em-sock-'em action is a bit off base. This isn't the BATMAN trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective, you are talking about super-powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably 1 trillion-fold by the power of Earth's Sun. The complaint about SUPERMAN RETURNS was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow-up. That isn't the case in MOS. Even little things are accentuated, as this film pays attention to detail: check out Clark's eyes when he helps heals Lois' injury. Nice touch !""MAN OF STEEL"" is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the 1978 movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's. Some have commented that the ticket sales for MOS were disappointing, but it is possible that the SMALLVILLE TV series (ended 2011) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) both dampened any pent-up demand for a successful and new version of the story. BATMAN BEGINS was 8 years after the final George Clooney semi-camp Batman movie but the Nolan Trilogy didn't kick into high gear until THE DARK KNIGHT hit in 2008. MOS did better than BATMAN BEGINS by almost 50%. When THE DARK KNIGHT followed up BATMAN BEGINS 3 years later it more than doubled the earlier film. One wonders if there was a Superman-only follow-up (instead of the rumoured Batman-Superman ""Justice League"" hookup) if it could springboard on the first film's success and reach the levels of the 2nd and 3rd films in the Nolan Trilogy. Looks like we'll never know, so let's hope Ben Affleck and the scriptwriters don't screw up the successor to MAN OF STEEL.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm also not a huge fan of Zack Snyder's stuff lately. Still, I was pleasantly surprised at how well-paced and orchestrated the film felt.There were a couple of moments in the film that seemed logically dubious, and a good chunk of the performing felt a little subdued (if your planet is about to explode and you're launching your baby into space I'd imagine you'd be an emotional mess). I wish there had been more, and maybe it's a positive sign that I'm left wishing I could have seen more of the characters and how they respond to the chaos that erupts. On average, though, the cast was great and engaging. Some elements were certainly disturbing, mainly because some of the aftermath looks like the aftermath of the WTC collapse. That's a pretty cold thing to show, especially in conjunction with falling buildings. This is just the ugly collision of realism and an all-out war to prevent xenocide. Although another viewing might expose problems, the scale of destruction in the third act seems unavoidable. Zod sees Earth residents as insignificant and unworthy of second thought. Then you've got, in effect, 4 supermen fighting, plus an armory on both the Earth and Krypton sides. Once it was set up that Zod wanted a new Krypton, destruction became unavoidable. Superman also can't be everywhere at once, he has to do anything and everything to take out Zod. All things considered, the filmmakers had to choose between a story that was logically sound and something more cartoonish that would be more in line with how people saw Superman. They went with the former. That said, the end of the final fight between Superman and Zod may have been redundantly sour. We already know he can't protect everyone, we just saw Metropolis get torn apart.Some things are easy to predict: The combination of David Goyer, Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder is a solid one, and the Goyer/Nolan dynamic is easy to see. That tells you going in that it'll be a very gritty spectacle, emotionally charged and with very little humor. Which does work pretty well. I do wish there was a smaller cast and more room for the actors to perform, but the film takes a huge cast and, like, half of the VFX industry, and manages to be pretty enjoyable. Enough so that I kind of want to watch it again. Hopefully the next film will let us get closer to the characters, find some room for optimism, and never put high-heels on Wonder Woman's costume.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Man of Steel- 5 Category Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814230/?ref_=tt_urv","nathan-276","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8052436/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","It is my firm belief that the overall quality of a film can be determined by its effectiveness in 5 categories: Screenplay/Plot, Directing, Acting, Cinematography/Visual/Sound Effects, and Score/Soundtrack. Too often do we ignore the greatness a film has in one aspect because of the poorness it may have in another.I try to be as vague as I can with my reviews, to avoid spoilers of any kind, while still being informative as to what I found good and poor within a film. Here's my take on Man of Steel.Screenplay/Plot 7/10 It was clear from the get-go whose movie this was, this is not a Christopher Nolan film and clearly a Zack Snyder film. Action, Action, Action. The action is almost mind-numbing at points but yet it was well done and very entertaining. Nothing about the script was thought provoking or surprising, but its fluidity was superb and still a great upbringing film for the Superman. My favorite aspect of the screenplay was how General Zod was handled. You could almost sympathize with him, or at least understand why he was doing what he was doing. That's a testament to reality in a sense because pure evil does not virtually exist, if you researched some of the seemingly most sinister people in the world they almost all have relatively logical reasons to why they were doing what they were doing, I loved it. Directing 6/10 Like I said, this a Zack Snyder film. I have yet to be blown away by this guy's directing chops, yet I have yet to be completely disappointing. There are some great shots in this film, like when Superman first appears in his suit, and some of the ending action sequences. Nothing was really special about it though. Often, because of the angles used, it was hard to see exactly what was happening. Zack also made a habit out of doing multiple zoom in shots on one thing, I found that annoying, but for the most part he did a good job.Acting 6/10 The acting was solid. Everyone was cast well and did good for what they were given. Amy Adams often felt wooden, but I think that was more a testament to her script rather than her ability because she's usually marvelous. Same with Russell Crowe, he felt wooden and lifeless rather than strong and endearing. The stand out here was clearly Michael Shannon. He was bloody fantastic and made the movie better on his own.Cinematography/Visual Effects/ Sound Effects 9/10 This film was stunning. It was absolutely beautiful and the effects were amazing. Judging from the budget, this really shouldn't surprise people.Score/Soundtrack 8/10 Great score that just had Superman written all over it. Really powerful and uplifting stuff, though the main theme was slightly overused.Overall, don't go into this film expecting vintage Nolan because you are not going to get it. Don't go into this assuming it will be just as good if not better than the Dark Knight trilogy. It just isn't, it has potential to get there considering how much better the 2nd and 3rd film of The Dark Knight trilogy was compared to the first. Go into this film expecting a solidly entertaining Superman action fest and you'll get your money's worth, regardless of what the critics may say, it was still a great movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wanna let everyone decide.In a nutshell, this is another film that you'll either hate it or love it. For the background the film use Nolan's name to gain attention which basically mean we can expect something totally fresh like what he did for Batman. For those who experienced Nolan's Batman you can clearly tell that this film will be ""different"" even Snyder is the actual director.From the trailer, everyone should ""sense"" the very different point of view between superman as we remember and this man of steel. So the story supposes to be new, to be fresh and to be retold in a different world. And I think it is good because it makes zero sense to remake the same movie over and over again. If you look for superman film, the old good films are still out there. And you don't need to worry. I'm not here to convince this is better version of a guy that can fly. If you wanna watch this film, please watch it for its own sake or for its own right. Leave your superman out of the room. And later decide it for yourself if you like it or not.Oh... one last thing, even this is sci-fi movie, it doesn't mean it has to be scientifically accurate. I read some reviews, and they said it is scientifically wrong at some point. Err.. guys this is not a space academic class so be the watcher, don't be the teacher.Hope this can make your chance of enjoying the film increase because it makes zero sense to pay for a disappointment.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

After the Batman series, I thought Mr. Nolan had this one worked out as well. Although he's not directing this one, I thought, as he played a part in the making, this one is going to be big. Going to the movies with this premise, I was kind of disappointed. The movie itself is, let's say OK, but never reached the excellence of The Dark Knight.Generally speaking, this movie is darker than all other Superman movies. It gives you a new angle of Superman and all the happenings that lead to the fact, that Clark Kent decided to become the Man of Steel. A great and easy to follow story.I'm not trying to say that this is a bad movie. It's by far the best superman movie I've seen. But in my head, it had to be better, since I compared it to The Dark Knight. It might not be fair to draw that line, but well.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This new origin story tells of the tale of two movies. The first half is a character story which is effectively told with the use of flashbacks, while the final half is just explosion after explosion after explosion. Not to say it was bad, but the long-running action sequences (and rather impressive ones), were really loud and the non-stop action will be bound to give you headaches, especially in a movie theater setting.Zach Snyder's Superman film talks about how Superman came to Earth after Krypton was destroyed, how he struggled as a boy to control his powers and keep them as a secret, and to present time where he faces the nefarious General Zod who wants to turn Earth into a new Krypton.The acting is actually really good. Henry Cavill did impress me as Superman/Clark Kent and is leagues better than Brandon Routh. Michael Shannon was mean and great as Zod, despite the fact you can understand the reasons for wanting to destroy Earth. Amy Adams was good as Lois Lane, but I don't know if I can truly connect with her character in this movie. Kevin Costner probably had the best role as Jonathan Kent and as the man who gives Clark advice on how to grow up. We also get some good performances by Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, and Diane Lane.Overall, Man of Steel is ultimately a visually-spectacular, CGI-loaded reboot of one of the most iconic superheroes of all time. It could have used some more substance, but then again people complained that 2006's Superman Returns had no action sequences, hence this film having many. I will admit that they are well-done and often breath-taking. But is having too much of this action a good thing? Perhaps, though it did grow a little old and loud after awhile. But nothing wrong with that. I rate this film 8/10.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder, the director, has brought out to the viewers some of the most magnificent films of Hollywood in the recent years. So is this one. You probably haven't seen a Superhero movie like this. The screenplay and the musical background, keeps you tight and involved all throughout. The villain, General Zod and Co., at some times seem domineering over Superman, but in the end, he unleashes all his powers and defeats Zod. This particular work of Snyder has, perhaps, the most devastating disastrous, epic scenes. Buildings collapsing, Earth becoming weak, but Superman seems to come from nowhere to protect Humanity. Despite a few glitches, the movie made a little over 110 million dollars on the opening day. And I think that's quite enough to describe the craze for the Man Of Steel. Watching it in 3D cinema is certainly a magical experience. But if you've missed it somehow, do not miss the Full HD,i.e., 1080p version. A true Superhero fan's blender choice!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The characters are so well cast and so believable that you genuinely feel their emotions and the gravity of the story. The action scenes are powerful and spectacular. The story is one that we all know but is so well depicted in this movie that you feel you are discovering it for the first time.The characters in the film are portrayed in a very true to form way with regards to our previous knowledge of them, meaning that comic book and 'old' movie fans will be very happy. The superman costume in this version of the story is one of the best so far, and the intelligent armor of the other Kryptonians is very well conceptualized.Henry Cavill played the part of Superman so convincingly that it would be very difficult to watch him in anything else without thinking of him as Superman. The strong sense of justice and nobility that is synonymous with our idea of Superman comes through valiantly along with that confident humor that humanizes the character of Superman.The movie does an excellent job of filling in the details of the story, focusing more on the origins and the coming of Superman as we know him. It leaves the viewer with the strongest desire to see what happens next...Very freaking cool movie!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, the film, in my opinion was a huge let down. It was just a platform for huge explosions, loud bangs and phoney CGI.It seems as though the art of special effects has regressed since the introduction of CGI and as a result, this film looked utterly fake. As an example, take anything by Spielberg (ET, Close Encounters) - great, realistic special effects. Whereas, Man of Steel relied heavily on CGI and, in comparison, was pure garbage! The sorry thing is, up until a certain point, this was a fairly decent film. The actors did a good job and the story was interesting. Then midway through, it just got silly. The fight scenes were too fast and too phoney, there were too many daft, big explosions (yay!!) and, as previously mentioned, there was a glut of phoney CGI. I'm aware that Superman is, fundamentally, a children's film so, no doubt, this film appealed to the 10 year olds it was aimed at. But to anybody of who appreciates the art of decent visual effects, it is a let down. The Superman films starring Christopher Reeve, whilst slightly lacking in certain special effects, had more of a human touch and, as such, are far superior.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I've always struggled to feel any sort of sympathy, interest and most importantly any sense of jeopardy for the caped crusader. He's indestructible. He's nice, and, let's face it he's a bit, well boring.All that being said, I went in with my curiosity piqued by a deliberately oblique trailer - all out of focus flashback shots and plinky-plonky soundtrack. For sure Hack Snyder's (see what I did there?) name is in the director's chair but you never know eh?Well, I guess you do. A frustrating experience all round. A totally redundant prologue drenched in sub Star Trek CGI which involves Russell Crowe trying to keep a straight face undoes any sense of mystery from the off. Let's not go into the final act which involves our hero and General (snigger) Zod punching buildings in the face for about half an hour..In between this CGI sandwich there is much to like in terms of the origins/ growing pains/ flashback side of things. Michael Shannon camps it up as the baddie. Amy Adams does a feisty Lois Lane. Kevin Costner plays it charmingly straight and Henry Cavill looks er super in a slightly teak kind of way. However, all the interesting stuff gets crushed under-foot by the CGI money-shot effects, non-jeopardy battles A missed opportunity to do something genuinely interesting.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Although decent, it fell short of its hype. It boasts a better re-telling of Supermans background, including a superb beginning to the movie. Also there is undeniably amazing effects here with more destruction than you could imagine. However, the action sequences became boring very quickly. Smashing through walls and getting up again was soon dull and disinteresting. This was not aided by a terribly casted villain who's given cheesy lines. Henry Cavill wasn't much better, obviously cast for his good looks, buff body and constant frown. There was a sense of grand scale but never did it feel remotely threatening or tense. In fact, for the most part it was emotionless but for his relationship with his two sets of parents.

I didn't go see it in theaters and one day I finally said, ""Alright, let's do it..."" Now before someone says I was already giving it a bad grade from the start, I did the same thing with all Harry Potter movies (literally after all were released I said on a Friday night, ""K, let's do it."" and was quite happy with the entire weekend spend on it). Such was not the case from this pile.Within the first 10 minutes I was wondering what the hell was going on, what timeline I was in during the movie, and why Gladiator was doing what he was doing. I literally had to go to IMDb 10-15 minutes in to read the synopsis because I was clueless as to what I was watching. Was I watching Thor meets Chronicle of Riddick meets Clash of Titans? Whatever...So some random planet launches some super kid to Earth. NOBODY outside of a random couple are aware of a spaceship coming into orbit and somehow those two move this giant machine into a cellar in a barn with nobody noticing. Wow. Why is this such a big point? Because the entire movie his 'dad' played by Tin Cup are telling him to not show off his powers and be as quiet as possible. This makes absolutely zero sense because he stops an oil rig from collapsing with his arms, destroys a semi truck with several giant trees/poles in a parking lot, among other things. But everyone forgets in stupid land, so why his dad is saying all this crap is beyond me.Meanwhile, all this is happening while they keep switching between Superman acting like rogue (from x-men) trying to hide out and his kid life. So at this point I have ZERO idea of where I am timeline wise in the film. I was half expecting the directors to just all of the sudden have Superman as a 249,921 old man dying in his bed towards the end of the film. Would've made sense at that point.Regardless, at some point Superman finds a ship that his parents (or someone) sent there, and we find out this ship has been in the ice for 18,000 years. Nevermind how someone trying to hide his identity with fake names gets to be part of a military operation investigating this ship. Either way, he gets in the ship and then his dad's conscience is talking to him? Wait, Superman was born like 30-40 years ago, so how could a ship crashed 18,000 years ago foresee this? Did I miss a crazy time warp somewhere in there? The only explanation is he grew at an incredibly slow rate or his travel to Earth took 18,000 years and he was comatose as a baby the entire ride.Wait, if they shipped him to Earth, why couldn't the parents go again? If a giant ship crash landed on Earth 18,000 years ago, why couldn't the parents just be on that ship with the kid? Whatever, I finally turned this off 1/3 of the way through because I understood absolutely nothing that was going on in the film. When Tin Cup finally dies because he wants Superman not to expose himself I was just done. I did fastforward through some end parts and saw Superman throwing people through walls which could probably kill thousands yet whatever. The movie finally realizes this and has Superman stop some other dork trying to eye fry (lol) a family.... somehow holding this villain's head stops his eyes from simply LOOKING at the family.Everything is so rushed in an attempt to create crazy FX scenes that you stop caring. 7.4? Are you out of your mind (referring to most of the public)? I guess all good movies take anymore is ridiculous $s thrown at big on screen 'asplosions' and FWAAAA moments.Complete trash of a film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I know this film is being billed as a 'reboot' of the original 1980's 'Superman', and although it has been quite some time since I've watched that film, I do remember a sense of comedy present that I felt was simply missing this time around. It is though still a generally entertaining film, and Amy Adams played the 'Lois Lane' lead convincingly enough.

This unfortunately isn't uncommon in movies, but I find that by turning on the closed-captioning I can help alleviate this somewhat. With this movie however, the closed-captioning is out of sync with the dialogue, by at least a second, perhaps more. So your eyes are constantly seeing the next line of dialogue, before it's spoken by the actor.As far as the story and the actors, Amy Adams is hard not to like and Henry Cavil plays the role with a conflicted, brooding angle that is believable and gritty. There's a lot to like about this movie. Just don't turn on the closed-captioning.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a pretty good movie, but I don't think they spent enough money on all the explosions. At the beginning of the movie, on Krypton, Russell Crowe mumbles about the planet being ready to explode. But then they only spend about ten minutes showing the planet Krypton explode! I wanted a solid hour of explosions, with no dialog or plot to distract me from the excitement of watching the planet blow up.Later in the movie, Superman gets in a big fist fight with a bunch of evil Kryptonians in his hometown of Smallville, Kansas. And they smash a lot of buildings. But they don't smash all of them! I wanted to see more buildings get smashed, and catch on fire, and see more of how the debris is all shattered and black smoke is pouring out everywhere. I mean, they did a ten minute sequence here, but I wanted four hours of nothing but explosions! Oh, and it was really cool when General Zod's evil minions take on the helicopters and smash them in with their bare fists. But couldn't they have destroyed the whole United States Air Force? Couldn't we have seen sixteen hours of footage of nothing but airplanes blowing up? And why weren't the explosions noisier? I wanted more explosions! It was worse when they moved the fight to New York City. Superman throws General Zod through a few buildings, but not enough! Why couldn't he just drag General Zod face down across fifty city blocks of pavement? Why wasn't it noisier? Why didn't more stuff blow up? Amy Adams is really cute as Lois Lane. But she's not nearly as funny and perky here as she was in NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM II: Battle of The Smithstonian. I think it's because having a cute, pretty Lois Lane would distract Superman from finding his parents. And stopping General Zod. And watching all the cool explosions.To sum up, then, I would say that MAN OF STEEL is a good superhero picture -- but there were not enough explosions!","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

I was so hoped for it since all the trailers got me so excited. I thought that this new interpretation was going to be the superman reboot that fans need it on par with Chris Nolans Dark Knight trilogy. And when finally saw this film, I was so wrong. Man of Steel to me was a cliché sci-fi disaster flick. It had a lot of potential. (Positive) The visual effects were AMAZING!!! Music was really good and has the ability to get true emotion out of you. I thought the cast and crew were a great choice but we're the film goes wrong is in the writing in the story. (Negative) Many of the characters in the film are underdeveloped or bland and you really don't get to know them very well. And I personally think this film ignores the comic book superman for the most part. I understand that this is a different interpretation but what made superman into a hero in the comics was that he cared for humanity. It was the people. Man of Steel misses the point of the character COMPLETELY!!! Throughout the film, superman is reckless in his fighting and doesn't really hesitate to help anyone in danger and while he did on occasion, it wasn't consistent. And I think it's safe to say that Man of Steel finally reaches a point were it gets boring. The fight scenes take a big chunk of the film that drag on and on and on. (This is a long film guys) I was tapping my foot in theaters waiting for it to all end and what made it worse was all the shaking camera mixed with the 3D effects which gave me a headache.Conclusion: If Man of Steel had been more focused with its characters other then it's fight scenes, then I think it could've been better film. I won't force anyone who like this film to change their opinions since they may find it entertaining, but for me Man of Steel is just one big let down.To sum it all up, on Supermans world, the ""S"" stood for hope, but on my world the ""S"" stands for SUCKS!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't listen to the negative reviews if you're a fan. I also get the feeling that a lot of the negative reviewers are only doing so in order to maintain an ""indie"" image. ""Oh, looks like this is going to be loved by the public because it's so epic... I better say it's crap so I don't look mainstream, and that I'm unique and don't share the views of everyone else, and hence I don't bow to peer pressure. I'm going to look like such a badass."" They then proceed to nitpick tiny flaws and blow them out of proportion, and compare it to standards that are irrelevant and which the film didn't strive towards. So what if it doesn't have humour? It wasn't trying to be funny, the movie is about his inner struggle and turmoil, which isn't really a laughing matter. Was anyone laughing in Schindler's List? So what if the secondary characters aren't as well developed, this movie is about SUPERMAN, not Superman et.al. Sure, they could have been improved, but that can be left for sequels, the purpose of this movie was to establish an origin, and it did that splendidly. Maybe now that he has found his calling and is no longer in such doubt about himself, he can lighten up a bit? I think what every fan really wanted was to see his potential at kicking ass, and in that respect the movie delivered majestically. Critics can be so stupid. /rantSo anyways, watch this with an open mind, don't compare it to the Reeve's movies, and get rid of all your pre- conceived notions. This movie is telling the story in a way that's never been done before on the big screen, and as much I loved the old movies (even Superman Returns), I'm thankful for that because it's a realistic, relatable side of him we haven't seen before. The story is focused and NOT convoluted for once, and although it does have a few unexpected twists, some might find it predictable, but it's good nonetheless. As for the acting, Henry really embodies Superman, and Amy Adams is a kickass Lois Lane, which is a nice departure from the clutsy damsel in distress which has been shown in the past. Kevin Costner was a standout father figure with the limited screen time he has, and he makes an emotional connection with Clark and the audience. Russell Crowe shines as always as Jor-El and Michael Shannon's trademark maniacal rage makes an appearance as the formidable Zod. Diane Lane is a great motherly mother, but a standout is the beautiful new-comer Antje Traue as the cold, ruthless Faora. One last thing I have to mention is Hans Zimmer's amazing score, which accompanied the film and helped give it emotional resonance, and I guess it's an important cast member in its own right. P.S: it has the most amazing action I've EVER seen! I used to think The Avengers had amazing action, but it pales in comparison to this one! I was literally crying with joy at the awesomeness.P.P.S: You have to watch this! With as many people as you can, and as many times as you can, because we need this to be a success so we can get sequels and a Justice League movie. :D","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

The director has taken the Superman legend and kick started the whole franchise taking a more serious attitude and removing the camp element and rose tinted edges that have been the backdrop to the last film and the popular television series.So here we have Superman taking on arch villain General Zod. We have the whole back story of Superman and so on, but with quality actors such as Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner in tow, it's not a drudgery. Our new lead in particular fits the role well as the hero coming to terms with the burden of his powers. Our lead villain matches him. The world is being introduced to this ""Superman"" and our hero is trying to discover who he really is and so on. You could say it's the Superman equivalent of ""Batman Begins"".The film though can sacrifice dialogue and storyline for action, but it doesn't really devalue the film. Good direction and camera photography help, and the settings are just mouth watering.One thing that can get on your goat can be the amount of effects. It's an avalanche of action scenes and special effects. They are very good but a little break can be good. Some parts can be quite standard comic book movie like also, but in fairness not everything can be wholly original. This doesn't devalue the film but doesn't make it necessarily stand out again.It's a good film. A very good film which will wet the appetite for the sequels to come.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And...he has lived up to his reputation of being erratic. With every minute of the movie passing by, a movie buff needs little effort in seeing him huffing and puffing through it. How do I put it, it was like,he had little idea about how to put the story in (the story's extent was a little too much for him to handle or what), and he decides to split it and sow it all over the first half of the movie. It requires enough discretion to extrapolate how it was meant originally when it flowed through Nolan and Goyer duo's ink. It seemed as there are two approaches to the making of the movie,writer's and director's and not quite blending in through the journey. They blended like an alloy, not as compound though. The movie started perfectly, the story being told with the needful action. Then came the critical part of introducing people to the man of steel. Every hero in DC world lives with an ideal. It's the choice, the self realization, the compassion, the pillars on which the crux of the superheroes is built. As the leader of the justice league, the man of steel poses no exception, in fact he is the example. They have shown several anecdotes from Clark Kent's childhood and youth trying to stress these points, but they do not cast as much impression as needed for the viewer to be in sync with the activities of his alter ego, which follow. May be I am addicted to the Nolan way, but even then that's where I think the director was just beating around the bush, and did not hit the spot, quite right.About the actors, Henry Cavill is a mixed bag. He is perfect as superman, jumpy as Clark Kent. Russell Crowe, I don't think needs any direction. He played Jor-El, to the maximum. It was pretty imminent whatever were Jor-El's dialogues were Nolan's words, and they were precious, every syllable. The rest of the cast was mediocre, nothing to remember after 123rd minute. Laurence Fishburne was wasted in his role. In the close proximity of earth shattering fights, he managed to be alive. Just because he is a renowned actor, you keep him alive, that's something Marvel would do. Not for one bit, such things are expected from WB-DC team. Did they run out of budget to ensemble a better cast or what? I don't know .Speaking of budget, it looks like Snyder was given a license to spend the money and he did, all of it, $225m in the technical department. But I must say, it's well spent, every penny of it in making a visual spectacle. For me it was my first IMAX 3D experience, and I enjoyed the 3D every bit. This has to be one of the best non-animated 3D action movies in the superhero genre. Also I love the change they have made to the logo, it gives superman the appropriate makeover.Hans Zimmer has given an awesome score, that saves the action scenes from becoming high and dry, and brings in the needed intensity. I did miss Wally Pfister with the camera. But he comes in with the Nolan package and not the Snyder package. I would advise goers to not expect for Nolan brilliance in any department. For example there are a few scenes which have no action nor are shot on a wobbly footing, but look like shot with handy-cam, for unfathomable reasons.The action in the movie has lived up to the expectation. Each action sequence is crafted with enough intricacy. Especially mentionable, the duel with his enemy ,the catch of the falling Lois Lane, which has become one of the famous scenes in comics' story, is re-mastered and modernized, and literally every flight of superman, be it on earth or in space was heart racing and jaw dropping. It really feels like Snyder's heart lies in action, and he doesn't disappoint one bit. .In all, a booming reboot, must watch.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

And even if you memorize them, you can easily mix up their deeds and environments. Superman is, of course, the best known, but in spite of this, I expected a kind of new approach, a new level. True, its special effects are smooth and state-of-the-art, but they fill out too large part of the movie, creating the feeling of perfunctory script and trivial solutions. Even for a comic, there are too many goofs and unreal scenes, and Henry Cavill as Superman / Clark Kent is not a due opponent to Michael Shannon as General Dru-Zod whose performance is probably the strongest in this movie. Smaller, yet good accomplishments are provided by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El; even Amy Adams, who is generally a good and distinguishing actress, is depicting Lois Lane too ordinarily.Thus, Man of Steel did not impress me much, although I am aware of not belonging to the main target audience... I find e.g. Iron Man movies much more interesting, obviously due to more versatile protagonist performances.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This would make us believe that filmmakers and studios adapting comic books into films would strive for the excellence Warner Bros. and Legendary were able to achieve with Nolan. But, unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. With the less then stellar ""The Avengers"" and an immensely disappointing ""Iron Man 3"" it looked like Nolan really was just a fluke. And then there came ""Man of Steel"". The tiniest bit slow in the beginning, the David Goyer-scribed, Zack Snyder-helmed re- imagining delivers, exponentially. With a visual style to put up against that director of ""300"" (hahaha...oh, wait) and a clear cut image of what he wants the final feel to be, Snyder is able to grip audiences within every fight scene, every ""Oh my God"" VFX sequence, and then flip your emotions upside down with the realization that sacrifice is necessary. Working with a script like Goyer's would make that fairly easy, I'd believe. Morals, foreshadowing and those good 'ol witty one liners, Goyer is able to prove that he's just as deep and thoughtful a writer on his own (although, there are some obvious little moments crafted and refined by Mr. Nolan himself, in there). But, a good film can't be a good film without that final BAM, delivered in whole by Hans Zimmer. With a feel that's somewhere between Inception's horn blazing and snare- ripping, to The Dark Knight's deep woodwind and piano solo's, Zimmer delivers a score to even rival that of his themes in ""Batman Begins"". Mixing in an impressive amount of drums and adding to that with a consistent electronic feel, Zimmer does it again.But can ""Man of Steel"" change the next generation of films? Or is it, like Nolan's trilogy, just another fluke? All I can say is, it's an Ideal for us to strive towards.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

How much better would it have been for Clark to be bullied through school and then rescue his bullier from the bus ? We would have cared more . Halfway through the movie I realized , well ... I was bored ! How many times can someone be thrown through 5 buildings before you start to get weary ? Why all the destruction ? Buildings collapsing every minute did not make me feel threatened . A building is exactly that . A building . It's destruction evokes no emotional response . Louis Lane in a car being buried alive from an earthquake . That evokes an emotional response ! Where was the charm ? The humour ? 2 hours 20 minutes in the female soldier cracked a joke . Which wasn't even that funny . So why all the praise ?

At times, the destruction made by Superman and Zod is very high. The scene where Clark attacks Zod for threatening his mother is awesome. Once again the cameo of Kevin Costner is superb.

Directed by Zack Snyder, the film is a mixed bag of great visuals and action sequences, but flawed script and pacing.Despite this it's actually quite a good film that maybe doesn't get the credit it deserves.The film's visuals are truly breathtaking, with Snyder's eye for detail and epic scale evident throughout. From the Kryptonian world to the action sequences, every frame of ""Man of Steel"" is a work of art. The use of slow-motion and CGI-enhanced environments may not be to everyone's liking, but it certainly gives the film a unique look and feel.Henry Cavill was a good choice to play Superman, as he looks the part and brings a commanding presence to the role. However, the screenplay doesn't always allow him to fully shine. He's often saddled with a darker, brooding persona that doesn't entirely work. Cavill has the physicality and charm required to make the character work, he's a bit wooden at times but has the potential to be a very good superman but unfortunately, the script doesn't always allow him to showcase these attributes.Snyder's background as a visual director is evident in ""Man of Steel,"" but his weaknesses in storytelling and character development also show through. While the film is strong in terms of action and spectacle, it falls short in terms of coherent storytelling and character arcs. Snyder's previous films, such as ""300"" and ""Watchmen,"" were more focused on style than substance, and it shows in ""Man of Steel.""This approach may have worked for an alien invasion movie, but it's not necessarily what a Superman film should be. The character is known for his humanity, optimism, and idealism, which are not always on display in ""Man of Steel."" While Snyder's take on the character is interesting, it doesn't always feel like Superman. This lack of connection with the source material is likely one reason why the film underperformed at the box office and failed to kickstart the DC Extended Universe in the way that Warner Bros. Had hoped.The editing and music in ""Man of Steel"" are also noteworthy. The pacing can be a bit uneven at times and scenes are rushed and things seem like they were cut down to more the film along, but the film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is excellent. It perfectly captures the epic and emotional moments of the film, it's no John Williams score but the music works for this version of the character.With Its stunning visuals, solid cast, and epic action sequences make it an enjoyable experience. However, the flaws in its storytelling and character development prevent it from reaching its full potential.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The new reboot, directed by Zack Snyder and produced by Christopher Nolan, is a mostly somber affair – which shouldn't really be surprising if you think about it, given that neither is known for his lightness of touch. Both, in fact, take their comic book culture very seriously. So don't expect a quick dash into the phone booth, or a cat that needs rescuing from a tree. No! Our hero doesn't even put on the suit until well over an hour into the movie.The film's overlong prologue sees Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) face off against General Zod (Michael Shannon) on Krypton. Their planet is on the verge of destruction, and Jor-El dispatches his infant son Kal-El to Earth, narrowly avoiding the clutches of Zod, who vows revenge even as he takes Jor-El's life. Far from dazzling us with its Avatar like beasts and otherworldly production design, this early sequence is weighed down by some incoherent babble about a Kryptonian codex.The next time we meet our protagonist, he's a grown man. Clark Kent, played with admirable earnestness by Henry Cavill, is first seen making a rescue from a flaming oil rig at sea. What follow are a handful of moving flashbacks to his troubled childhood and his adolescent years where he struggles to come to terms with his special powers, even as his adoptive father (Kevin Costner) advises him to keep a lid on them because he believes the world isn't ready for it.Back in the present day, Clark is a drifter whose powers prove hard to hide, because people invariably get themselves into trouble, and he can't stop himself from helping them. It doesn't take long for Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) to discover his secret. But before she can go public with her story, along comes Zod with a cunning plan to turn Earth into the new Krypton. That's the cue for a roughly 40-minute action finale in which Superman and Zod have a go at each other, virtually crumbling an entire city, and turning you deaf in the process.What anchors this noisy, humorless film are some terrific performances by its cast. Russell Crowe plays Jor-El like the ghost of Hamlet's father, showing up every now and then to dispense valuable life lessons to his grown-up son. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark's Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, bring warmth and depth to the story. Meanwhile, Amy Adams is a very different Lois Lane to the Margot Kidder version, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who can hardly be fooled by thick-rimmed glasses and a side parting. Her Lois is Superman's emotional equivalent, and Adams brings both heart and smarts to the part.As Superman's nemesis, Michael Shannon makes a credible Zod, his motives rooted in the real and the relatable, rather than just being another villain with a plan to take over the world. Playing Superman himself, although he's never once referred to by that name in this film, Henry Cavill brings his chiseled good looks and an inherent charisma to the role. Cavill isn't required to flex his comic chops here (perhaps in the sequel?) but he doesn't once trip as the brooding lost boy.Man of Steel leans more towards Nolan's angsty Dark Knight movies than Marvel's playful Avengers. Yet it doesn't have the great ideas of that Batman trilogy. What it does have – despite all its shortcomings – is genuine awe and wonder in the bits where Superman takes flight. For those portions, for the charming new leading man, and some solid special effects, it's worth a watch.I'm going with seven ratings for Man of Steel. A little fun, a little lightness couldn't have hurt.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have a simple take on them. If they don't occur to me when I'm watching the film, then they're of no relevance.If a movie interests me, grabs my attention and entertains me, then I simply won't notice them as the film has me hooked. On later reflection, if I suddenly realise the implausibility of one or several scenarios, I'll shrug my shoulders, think it didn't bother me at the time so why should it now? I imagine that along with most people, it's only when a film is dull and fails to engage, that I sit in a theatre and shake my head at ridiculous developments.Man of Steel is riddled with plot-holes. Machine gun riddled. It has more holes than the Japanese flag following the Battle of Iwo Jima. You could plough a tractor through its holes. But I failed to think of one of them as I sat enjoying its good story telling.Actually, come to think of it, I did spot one very early on in the piece but quickly forgot about it. Jor –El, Superman's father played with good pitch by Russell Crowe, is in the throes of getting his infant son off the doomed planet Krypton. He dives into the sea, swims down a water channel through a glacier into a chamber holding the Codex – a skull-like object which holds the DNA of one billion Kryptonites (or is it Kryptonians?) He makes off with it. Straight away it struck me that there was very little security surrounding this recorder of Krypton life – no barbed wire, no infra-red rays, no unbreakable glass surround – not even a couple of minimum wage Group 4 Security guards. I imagine Sir Don Bradman's bat and baggy green cap has greater security at the Bowral Museum in Australia's outback than Krypton's biological memory.So with the Codex, Kal-El/Superman – soon to be Clark Kent, is jettisoned toward Planet Earth in a space-age Moses basket and the adventures begin.Being the first film in this re-boot of the Superman franchise, it is clearly required to spend some time setting up its characters and establishing its identity. But it does this not at the expense of moving the story along and never gets bogged down in background detail.On current evidence, the injection of humour is not high on the producers' agenda. And why should it be? Those behind this franchise appear to have confidence in their project and are not embarrassed to be telling the tale of Superman, despite a reluctance to name him so – even the 'S' symbol on his suit is explained as the Krypton for hope. The need for Roger Moore 007 one liners with a wink to the camera is not to be their style. The film in concept bears much similarity to the most recent Batman series, undoubtedly the influence of British film maker Christopher Nolan who was the driving force behind Batman and was instrumental in the development of this re-vamped Superman. Despite the lack of jokes, it never becomes pompous or overblown in its own importance.Henry Cavill who up till now is probably only best known for the roles he nearly but didn't quite secure – James Bond, Edward Cullen – seizes his opportunity and excels in the lead role, exuding boyish charm as the young Clark and square-jawed determination as the cape wearing super hero.Overall, the cast was effective although Michael Shannon as chief villain General Zod is slightly underwhelming and I would have liked to see Amy Adams display greater gravitas as Lois Lane – she was just a bit too demure to be convincing as a hard-nosed investigative journalist. Hopefully she'll raise her game for the sequels.The action scenes and CGI were impressive – I saw the film in 2D and, as with The Great Gatsby, a few shots were a little askew betraying its dual format.One more feature of the film is its religious symbolism – there's probably more Christian allegory than any film since The Narnia Chronicles. Russell Crowe is shown mostly as the spirit of Jor-El, living on after his physical death; Clark Kent refers to his '33 years on this planet' - 33 being the number of years it is widely believed Christ was on earth; General Zod appears to be an incarnation of Satan – his battles with Superman determining whether good or evil will triumph over the world. And the most blatant example was Jor-El on a spacecraft imploring Kal-El to return to earth with the words 'You can save them son, you can save them all' at which point Superman holds his arms out as if being crucified and falls through space down to the blue planet below. Had I paid more attention in Sunday School all those years ago, I could probably have picked up further visual metaphor. The film does not preach and I doubt this aspect will impinge on the enjoyment of card-carrying agnostics.The film is a marvellous start and I hope the sequels will expand and develop.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

After Batman: The Dark Knight this is the second best superhero movie I've ever watched. This is not a pop movie, Superman saga greatly and very deeply analyzed and produced in this film. It has an epic, literature understanding which will give you goosebumps while you watch it. Do not expect a funny, pop movie, instead you will welcome a perfect psychological digging effort covered with a precise and delicious action scenes. Unlike other superhero movies, classical propagandist American patriotism is very limited in this production which gave back Superman the mission of savior of all humanity not only an American symbol. You will have the chance to watch the real potential of a superhero with a great detail of satisfying action scenes. Especially the acting of the whole crew is perfect. There is not a bit of an overacting in any of the characters. I loved it for sure and strongly recommend you to watch this movie.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I did not hate the character, but I was indifferent to him - how could I care about someone who can't get hurt, can't die, can hardly be traumatized? The comic book Superman is basically a God, and that is not relatable in any way.Now with this new movie, under the helm of Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan, they set out to rectify this - and did it with flying colors.You can clearly see that it is a Snyder movie - he understands perfectly how to use CGI to create splendid action scenes; but Nolan's presence is not passable either, since you can clearly see his influence in the character and flashback scenes.The movie starts out brilliantly - just a few company logos, and then you witness Kal-El's birth, which is very well done. The next 20 minutes or so are owned by Russell Crowe (as Jor-El) who is the closest you can get to a superhero on his own planet.We are then introduced to General Zod (played by Michael Shannon) who establishes himself as a threat right away - a pretty hard thing to do when you witness how bad-ass Antje Traue is while playing Faora-Ul. She kicked ass left and right, and got things done.After the Krypton part of the movie, we are then introduced to Clark Kent, wonderfully played by Henry Cavill - his performance exceeds that of Christopher Reeves in my eyes. While Reeves was a good Clark Kent, he was a passable Superman - maybe it was due to the technological limitations of that age, but we never saw the Man of Steel fight anything major (or fight at all). Well, not until now at least.This movie is filled with bombastic action, which can get tiresome after a while but is still a joy to watch, and we finally get to see Superman kick some ass (and get his ass handed to him equally).I cannot think of a better director who could've made this movie - the Snyder/Nolan combo was perfect for what they were trying to get across, which is a tale of a boy of two worlds, who is forced to make certain choices along his journey to discover himself.Worth mentioning are also Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, who acted solidly despite his short screen-time, and Amy Adams who I believe was the perfect choice for Lois Lane.And who can forget Hans Zimmer and his epic compositions, ranging from the subtle piano songs which pick at your heart-strings, to the loud and enthralling action set-pieces.The only thing that bothered me was the 3D, which was passable but got confusing after a few action scenes or so.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, and I must make a note: I cannot understand, no matter how hard I try, why the critics tore this movie to pieces - the only reasonable point I could see was the presence of too many action scenes; but then again, it is the first time we ever see a live-action Superman kick ass left and right, and I believe they were justified in making up for the lack of action of the previous movies.So far it is the best action movie of 2013, which has managed to make me love Superman.9.5/10","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

(Chiasmus Warning) Amid liking ""Hulk"" and the Star Wars prequels, I may not be the one to ask if a movie's CGI is excessive ore even good, but it worked splendidly and convincingly for me. I have to wonder if it's just an adjustment for the uninitiated to see more elaborate Kryptonian settings or images, because this film's props of such felt very familiar in light of what I've seen in the comics and on more recent Supes cartoons. I think about the Kryptonian v. Kryptonian fight scenes that do go for an extended period, realizing that such would be the norm for beings who can both give and take a lot of punishment. I tend to think on how long and drawn the Supes v. Darkseid fight lasted in the animated feature ""Apokolips"" based on the Superman/Batman comic mini-series. It had over a dozen cases of a big uppercut that sent the opponent flying for miles. So this was nothing new either, and the movements of these fights made the battles completely epic and adrenalizing.What I loved so much about the 1978 Superman movie was the back-story, showing how much of an influence Jonathan and Martha Kent were on their special adopted son, and this film succeeded in upping the ante on that aspect, seeing Clark develop mentally and emotionally, while struggling to adapt to his incredible abilities. Prior to that we get the obligatory sequence involving Jor-El's facing his planet's destruction, and giving his all to seeing the preservation of his son's life. This too was a major upgrade. Then comes Kal El's pivotal moment when he masters all of his powers, followed by the arrival of General Zod, who created such havoc in his home world to offer the same to earth with hyper-megalomania, and the movie truly shines in creating some major conflict for our hero at this juncture, and Kal El (who, thankfully, does get properly acknowledged as 'Superman' during the movie's run, just won't say where) shows that he's got all the heart and will to meet the challenge head-on.I saw no slouching by anybody in the cast. I was amazed at Henry Cavill, and how he was completely spot-on in showing his emotions during his many close-ups, he was extremely convincing as both a man struggling to find his place in the world, and a man with a sense of priority in protecting the world he had still come to love. Russell Crowe played Jor-El to the hilt as the wise Kryptonian patriarch, with his world's best interests at heart, and all the heart to help see to earth's defense. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane ably played Clark's adoptive parents, selfless and compassionate. Amy Adams was a wonderful Lois Lane, accomplishing that daunting task of coming off as a hard-working researcher without appearing to be too snoopy. My favorite kind of villain is the megalomaniacal kind, and we get that in spades from Michael Shannon as Zod, who you have to look upon with both disdain and sympathy. Laurence Fishburne's Perry White, Christopher Meloni's Colonel Hardy, Antje Traue's Faora-Ul, and on and on--were all great in their respective roles.There is a bit of a problem with so many (mainly in Smallville) who are presumably privy to Clark's secret, but for all the scope the entire movie offered, it was worth overlooking. I liked ""Superman Returns"", just didn't love it for the fact that the action was so understated at a point where so many people were hungry for Superman to deliver on the action after being gone for nineteen years, and after not having been a very strong movie about the Man of Steel since 1980. This one suddenly made that wait worthwhile. It was incredible!","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I don't wear glasses, however, and I wasn't shot from the nether regions of space from a splodin' planet. I guess at this point I'm rambling which reminds me of the movie's random crash course of a story. We start with explosions on Krypton. Then we move to explosions on Earth. Then the grand finale is MORE explosions on Earth.Sure there is a diddy about some civil war on Krypton and an attempt is made to complexify our villain but it doesn't do much for me other than stack more time into this dragging movie.The most powerful moment for me is when Clark has an opportunity to abuse his supernatural strength on an abusive jerk, but shows restraint. The theme that we all make choices about who we are is powerful. What will you do with your abilities? Other than that I was not impressed in any long lasting way. For me, it is a one time watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

His films tend to have weak characters, and messy story lines. However, his visuals are fantastic. In fact, he might be one of the best visual directors working today. All his films are beautifully shot, and are a treat to look at. Man Of Steel is no exception. Watching Superman take off from the ground, soaring through the sky, and cracking the earths sound barrier is as epic as it sounds. I don't think Henry Cavil's Superman is as good as Chrisopher Reeve's portrayal of the character, but he certainly gives an exceptional performance. The rest of the cast is also decent. My main problems with the film are mostly due to the villain, General Zod. His story arc, and motivations are incredibly cliché, and sometimes ridiculous. And his fight scenes with Superman are FAR too destructive. I'm almost positive that Superman kills more than he actually saves in this film. But regardless of the films flaws, I do think Man Of Steel is one of Snyder's most underrated films. The visuals are fantastic, the acting is decent, the story is interesting and the score is beautiful. Definitely give this one a watch if you're a fan of the character.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Filled with excellent direction,a great cast and amazing special effects,Man Of Steel is a great Superhero film that is worth your time.Man Of Steel tells the story of Clark Kent(Henry Cavill),a young man who discovers that he is an alien from the destroyed planet Krypton and has super human size and strength and uses his powers to help the human beings on earth. Clark soon finds out that the earth is going to be invaded by General Zod(Michael Shannon),an evil leader from Krypton. With the help of Newspaper reporter Lois Lane(Amy Adams),Clark now has to figure out how to destroy General Zod and save Earth.Man Of Steel is an excellent Superhero film that reinvents and many way relaunches American and Comic icon Superman. After the brilliance of Superman:The Movie and it's excellent sequel Superman II,the franchise fell apart after the sequels Superman III and Superman IV:The Quest For Peace were released. Bryan Singer's Superman Returns while a good movie received a lukewarm reception from fans. Now,outcomes Man Of Steel a film directed by Zack Snyder(300,Watchmen)and produced by Christopher Nolan(The Dark Knight Trilogy)which chooses to re-tell the story of Superman and giving us the best Superman film since Superman:The Movie and Superman II. Man Of Steel is an amazing Superhero film that will have you glued to the screen from beginning to end a film that works as a Superhero film,an Action film,disaster film,origin story and a great character study and if you are a fan of Superman you will love this film. What is great about Man Of Steel is the way the film tells story with the film and the Superman character because while Man Of Steel is basically giving viewers the very same origin story as Superman:The Movie the origin in this film told in a much darker and serious tone then in the other Superman films taking away the humor and light tone that is often associated with Superman and does with this film what Christopher Nolan did with The Dark Knight Trilogy whether it's in the photography or visual style and know many critics have panned the film for being dark and lack of Humor(although MOS has some Humor) but I like that the film gives us a different take on Superman. The Clark Kent/Superman character in this film is a lot different from the other portrayal in other Superman films because Kent in this film is dark, complex,gritty and has issues whether it's dealing with his powers,his parents or trying figure out who he really is and why he is on earth and the way the Clark Kent character is shown is powerful,sad and unforgettable. In MOS Clark is given an darkness and sadness showing that while Clark has great strength and power Clark isn't always proud to use it because the thing is Clark Kent/Superhero only uses the power when he needs to use it and this is one of things that gives MOS great depth. I also loved how Lois Lane was portrayed in the film because while she does scream and get into trouble she is still tough and can handle herself. The relationship between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois is real and honest you as the viewer feel that the two like and respect each other. The film at 2 hours and 24 minutes moves at a great pace and wonderful Action and character driven dialog. The Action and fight scenes in MOS is amazing and are truly breathtaking with each scene becoming much more intense and your jaw drops with each Action scene with the great special effects and fights that seem like they will go on forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and if you love the character Superman or are viewing this film the ending is a great cap off and put smiles on viewers faces.The cast does wonderful jobs in their roles. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El,with Cavill bringing depth,grit and toughness to the role. Amy Adams is great as Lois Lane showing toughness and beauty in the performance with Adams also having great chemistry with Cavill. Michael Shannon is brilliant as General Zod,with Shannon stealing every scene he's in. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are fantastic and sympathetic as Martha and Jonathan Kent,Clark adoptive parents. Russell Crowe is wonderful as Jor-El,Clark's real father. Laurence Fishburne(Perry White),Harry Lennix(General Swanwick),Antjie Traue(Faora-Ul),Ayelet Zurer(Lara Lor-Van),Richard Schiff(Dr.Emil Hamiliton)and Christopher Meloni(Colonel Nathan Hardy)give good performances as well.The direction by Zack Snyder is excellent,with Snyder using great angles and wide shots and giving the film a great visual style while doing a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Great job,Snyder.The score by Hans Zimmer is incredible,powerful and intense and matches the tone of this film. Wonderful score,Zimmer.In final word,if you love Superman,Zack Snyder,Christopher Nolan,Action films,Superhero films or Comic Book films,I highly suggest you see Man Of Steel,a great Superhero/Action film that will blow you away. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I suppose the critics feel that a Superman movie, with an extraterrestrial being that can literally lift an entire skyscraper, shouldn't have action in it. I suppose that the poorly scripted Christopher Reeves, Gene Hackman movies are how a Superman movie should be. Maybe Christopher Reeves is the greatest Superman of all time. Maybe Gene Hackman is the greatest villain of all time. Or maybe not...Frankly, I was and am forever disappointed in those movies. Where is the awe? Where is the shock?The awe that is present seeing someone flying overhead at supersonic speed.The shock that an alien being with super strength, speed, senses, the ability to shoot heat lasers from his eyes, and the ability to fly at super-sonic speeds, had unknowingly lived amongst us for more than two decades.I feel the Man of Steel captures this. I don't think that if there were a Superhuman being living amongst us we would be jumping for joy and joking about it like it were a game. We would be awed, shocked, and probably scared to death.I'm a fan of Henry Cavill (Superman) and Amy Adams' (Lois Lane) portrayal of their characters. The critics were wrong, in my opinion; Cavil and Adams had good chemistry, much better than Reeves and Margot Kidder. I'm particularly fond of Michael Shannon's (General Zod) character in the movie. General Zod is a Kryptonian (Same race as Superman), which means he is theoretically as strong as Superman. We haven't seen a villain who could stand toe-to-toe with the Man of Steel until now.The best advice, if you haven't seen it yet, watch it. Keep in mind that it will be vastly different that the prior Superman movies. Also know that the movie takes a much more serious tone so don't expect a great deal of comic relief.It's about time! This is by far the best Superman to date.I hope this movie gets a sequel, there is so potential in the story.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Snyder ads his own spin to the character, I respect it for that, but some of it is what leads to the films downfall. I feel like the film does not embrace what it's messages convey. Clark contradicts himself to not save humanity but does it anyways. The lessons his father taught him seem to just not even matter in the end because he uses his powers anyways, which leads to his own new planets close demise. The destruction was unnecessary, but I do respect the new take and it does ad some sort of realism... it's just I feel it was way too overboard with the destruction to the point where I feel as though Superman really wasn't saving the day. Not to mention the scene where he literally makes out with Lois Lane over the ashes and concrete of like thousands of people that died... very weird and undeserving. The villain is great the storyline is great, script not so much, and a lot of other factors. The score is great, nothing can ever touch John Williams but Hans makes this theme work. It's gargantuas and does help the theme. This film is solid but nothing groundbreaking or next level like some fans claim it is. 6/10 (A solid start to a universe with potential)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is written by David Goyer, who wrote the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises, and is produced by Christopher Nolan, the director of the previous two titles. Warner Bros. is making the bold move of having him oversee their latest DC titles. Personally, I think it's a smart move, considering how I found the two films to be great films in general. I was a little skeptical about Zack Snyder's direction. Considering he has range from 300 to Sucker Punch. I was actually hoping that it would be good. I found the pacing in the first twenty minutes to be awful. Everything was happening so fast, it didn't let the audience breathe, considering it was the prologue. But as the narrative shifted, I felt more comfortable with it all. Henry Cavill is a very good Superman, I've heard of some of his works and he can pull off the role very well. Amy Adams is a great actress and she can pull off a role like Lois Lane with ease. Michael Shannon gives an appropriately bombastic turn as Zod. And Kevin Costner actually does a fine job as Jonathan Kent. Russel Crowe gives a very Russel Crowe performance, nothing really new, but nothing really bad. The CGI is great, a $225 million budget actually went somewhere. But the action sequence at the end went about twenty minutes longer than it should've, but before the novelty wore off it was pretty impressive. The way they end the film is a very impressive way to set up the next film, they actually gave Superman a reason to do what he did and I'm glad they did that. I like the way they are continuing this trend of superhero movies, and I really hope it continues.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I disliked superman, because, to me, he was simply unlimited strength with no complexity and no earthly weakness. Technically speaking, nothing seemed challenging for him. There was no fear of losing.2. I thought Batman Begins would remain the best superhero movie for decades to come.I was wrong. The brilliant team behind this movie has turned a hater into a lover of superman and the force that drives him. Zack Snyder and Hans Zimmer have together created a story so deep and a character so complex, he seems more human than an actual human being. The casting is perfect and Henry Cavill is the true embodiment of what superman should look like in the real world. Michael Shannon looked fearsome. The scenes with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane hit the amygdala with precision. It's mind blowing how Zack Snyder hits the emotional angle with consistency where the other Hollywood greats fail. Amy Adams as Lois Lane defines true feminism like she should. This movie is insanely rewatchable and fills me with so much hope every time. The soundtrack is mind blowing, probably Hans Zimmer's best work yet. This is by far, the greatest comic book origin movie ever made.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Its just that, unfortunately, Zack Snyder couldn't tell a decent story if someone put a gun against his head and threatened to blow up the White House seventeen times.What actually happens is this: (no ending spoilers!) Superman's home planet is in crisis, being destroyed and so, as Clark Kent, Supermanmanman must go to Earth, live as a human, but also deal with his superhuman abilities and ultimately get in a big ""monster-mash"" type battle with some dark clad extra-terrestrial superheros stolen from the 1980 film Superman 2.Things Zack Snyder does not have: any sense of realism or restraint for his CG/visual effects sequences that are all overblown and therefore become meaningless. Any idea of what character interiority or naturalistic dialogue feels like. Any idea of structure for a compelling story. Any idea of depth.That above paragraph has terrible syntax, in the hope that Snyder himself will bumble across this review, with his lumbering, crass tattoos and total lack of self awareness or intelligence and be all, like ""hey, I just took the most popular, obvious film making formula of the last twenty years and screwed it up, totally. I'm practically a walking kick-me sign for middlebrow American failure and macho stupidity"".Anyway, all that aside folks, what's really wrong with MANOFSTEEL specifically is that the main protagonist's grungy background is given depth purely through things like color grading, not actual drama - also his step father dies in a natural disaster with zero recognition after the fact, and then Kents 'space daddy' played by ruddy, hard nosed Russell Crowe (obviously no relation) keeps re- appearing conveniently as a ""hologram"" after he'd actually died in the stories opening sequences on Krypton - making the sacrifice and dramatic weight of the issue meaningless.But what about the superhero action sequences? Crap. Basically expensive computer rendered CG shows completely overblown battle sequences between the super super powered men-in-tights as they throw buses, smash thousands of bricks, sh*t fire etc. You can't have real dramatic tension when the characters are seemingly invincible, as numerous ""mainstream"" reviewers pointed out on the release of this massive turkey. Speaking of turkey, the whole 'serious, earnest' vibe that MANOFSTEEL is supposed to have is enforced through color grading and artificial grain throughout - as if Snyder and co. could imitate the gravitas of the Dark Knight series by just removing color saturation etc, ie: the sort of thing you can do on some smart phones these days.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The storyline feels rushed as we see Cal-El being sent off Krypton one scene and then the next scene he's on a ship, and quickly we must flashback to Clark's childhood, the movie picks up in the middle and then gets overblown by non-stop fighting sequences that replaces plot.Having been a lifelong fan of Kevin Costner, it was disappointing and would have been better with more Kevin. Simply put, if you saw the trailer, you saw almost all of K.C.'s part in the movie. It's disappointing that even after a Golden Globe and Emmy winning performance for Hatfields & McKoys that this kind of cameo underdeveloped character work is still the best Kevin Costner can get in his attempt at a comeback. I hope he is given more to work with in his supporting role in the new Jack Ryan movie coming out this Christmas holiday 2013. He does have some leading roles coming up in 2014, so looking forward to that.One good solid supporting role was that of Russell Crowe playing Jor-El. Russell Crowe received far more screen time than I imagined he was going to get. I imagined Russell Crowe was only going to be in the opening sequence. Russell Crowe seems to be re-establishing himself in later age as a supporting actor.Overall, not bad, but not a great superhero movie in my book. I'll stick with Batman!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Oddly enough it seems new because it's presented in almost a TV style of story telling. Throwing the audience right into the story, and main action making them (the audience) linking previous knowledge to the character(s), and what is going on right in front of them. While the story gives flashbacks on random, and even when Clark is explaining his past, giving the film a very ""Breaking Bad"", and ""Dexter"" feel. Superman finally faces a villain other than Lex Luther. General Zod is a good cinematic complement for Clark Kents alter-ego. Having a deep purpose for the main driving story, and the action that follows, and in some parts maybe even feel sympathy knowing Zod is the ultra d-bag because he was born to protect his race. Overall ""Man of Steel"" delivers without attempting to make a superhero movie a partial comedy, on the down side it does have a little to much destruction....Metropolis is in shambles while Smallville mine as well not exist. None the less, it works, it works out very well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This review is not intended to be a comparison to the comics in quality or even story. Now that you're aware that this is not a review of how well Superman was portrayed, this was a good movie. It may not be the same Superman you'ld hoped for, but it was a good movie.The back story is engaging yet not extensive or SUPER melodramatic. The writing is well done. The acting is good. The special effects are incredible. The whole movie is visually stunning. Great acting(I do have some bias for that lovely Enchanted girl). The story is flawed, but interesting.Lois lane is kind of annoying to be honest. She is the ""strong female protagonist. Which these days actually describes a female character with two main characteristics: arrogant and prideful. Superman has never been known to really have great depth of personality supposedly, but this movie tries to bring it out and does an okay job.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Not quite the best but good enough for the Next gen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2927539/?ref_=tt_urv","sohansurag","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21382612/?ref_=tt_urv","24 December 2013","Think about Comic books, who's the first superhero that comes to your mind? Its always been Superman. Since the day I could speak, since the day I could figure out things for myself, Superman had been a legend. A true SUPER-superhero, an icon of sheer courage, justice. Haven't we all draped a towel on our back and pretended to be him. And then came the movies, the beloved Christopher Reeves' Superman. It had been etched in my mind since then. The accompanying John Williams theme, Superman soaring through the chroma-keyed skies, the visuals stuck in my head even now. Thanks for Bryan Singer's Superman Returns for unmaking a Superman fan out of me. On paper Superman Returns felt like a brilliant idea, people were already familiar with Superman's origins and setting the stage for what could have been the best Superman movie sounded very good but lack of somethings made Superman Returns one of the worst Superman movies I could ever imagine. Fans have ever since yearned for a proper Superman reboot especially when Christopher Nolan had made the near-perfect Batman trilogy.I was in ecstasy when I heard Nolans name linked with a new Superman reboot and at the same time I was a bit skeptic when Zack Synder's name got attached to it as the director. Agreed, Zack Snyder is a talented director with his rep billowing with Watchmen, Dawn of The Dead and 300 but the same couldn't be said about the ambitious-yet-disastrous Sucker Punch. David S Goyer & Christopher Nolan providing the story for the reboot came as a much needed relief.Enter Man Of Steel, Zack Snyder's take on Superman. I have to say by the time I walked outta the theater I had a smile on my face, I was glad it was way beyond my expectations, my suspicions regarding Zack Snyder washed off. Zack Snyder proves that he could handle both touching sequences as well as loud, insane action sequences with the same prowess. Henry Cavill drapes the cape here playing Kal-El/Clark Kent. Things like Clark Kent constantly in conflict with himself and his identity-masking issues was beautifully handled. A ton of credit also goes to Henry Cavill for being the best Superman since Christopher Reeves. He was both adorable and unstoppable as Clark Kent/Superman. Believe me this ain't the Henry Cavill you've seen in The Immortals, he oozes that charm as well as the bravado that Superman needs. Believe me you'll be rooting for him, clenching your seats in awe by the time he takes his first flight.Man Of Steel's first half was very emotional/touching, call it 'butterflies in the tummy' or 'mere convulsions or heaves' there were many touching scenes that did make you feel that lump in the throat. Seamless flashbacks were another thing I loved connecting Clark Kent's present to his younger days. Kevin Costner, was just great as Jonathan Kent especially considering he'd got comparatively less screen time than Russel Crowe's Jor-El. Costner's Jonathan was very heartfelt and those handful of scenes he were in, he made it inevitably memorable. Tell me you didn't gasp when Costner delivered that ""You'll always be my son!"" dialogue. Tell me you didn't feel your eyes getting wet during Jonathan's 'farewell' scene. Diane Lane also brought forth that sincere motherly instinct that Martha Kent needed. Anyways coming back to Russel Crowe, he was just as bad-ass as his son, sharing around 45 minutes of screen-time, he had his fatherly moments as well action. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was, as always, a pleasure to be seen on screen, fitting the role perfectly. I wasn't convinced with her handling those alien guns btw.Michael Shannon's General Zod was way different than Terence Stamp's. Where Terence's Zod was more calm and scheming, Michael's was in constant rage, in constant aggression and it was very well suited given his urgency to create a new Krypton and as we all know from Boardwalk Empire, there's no one better than Shannon when it comes to showing rage. Then again Shannon wouldn't be the talk of the day after you've seen Man OF Steel, unlike Heath Ledger's Joker. Faora-Ul seemed much more lethal than General Zod. Where Zod has true motives to do villainous acts, Faora-Ul was just pure evil and Antje Traue, soon to be seen in Riddick, does it well.Where the 1st and 2nd act promised true immersion the same couldn't be said for the 3rd act which was squeezed, every inch, with action. But its not like Michael Bay-ish action where we couldn't figure WTF was going on on-screen, in Man Of Steel, each punch Superman delivered could be felt. I've heard people complaining about the OTT action, but that's what you get one when one super power meets another. This is Superman for chrissake what did you expect?Visual Effects towards the finale were not entirely convincing, I don't know if its me but I could clearly make out the CG counterparts from the real actors.And lastly, amidst all those destruction and carnage I cant help but think about the human causalities. Superman was always supposed to be a savior to all not just his love interest.All said, done and anathemised, Man Of Steel is not a movie to cash in on the superhero genre. It did meet a Superman fanboy's expectation and as Jor-El said ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards"" and that ideal could very well be a Justice League movie. Quoting once again, at one point Superman says about his glyph ""It's not an ""S"",on my world it means ""Hope"". It does bring hope to the Superman franchise long thought to be dead, comparisons with Christopher Reeves' Superman movies aside, Man of Steel is the definitive Superman for the new generation. Take a bow Henry Cavill/Zack Snyder team.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What makes this movie work is that it gets to the heart of what the character meant to the surrounding earthlings in the story as well as those who experienced it the first time in the DC comics. A moral backbone to a superhuman person that's able to do anything but chooses what's best for all is the ""man of steel's"" longtime montra and core of his existence. The movie is fun to watch until the last half hour when it starts to become a typical action flick with one very corny scene that should have never been included referring to the man of steel as ""kind of hot"". I think the filmmakers were trying to infuse a little humor into what up unto that point was fairly serious, but in my opinion it wasn't needed. Overall this is a good piece of filmmaking by Zack Snyder despite the subject being done so many times. He breaks out of the mold with the story a little bit putting some twists to the retelling including a different perspective from the Lois Lane character that might turn off the hardcore fans, but I think in the long run this one did well for the franchise and for the movie-going public.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think that most people expected an action pact movie because a lot of Zack Snyder's films are like this. The reason I didn't give this a 8 or a 9 was because some of the action was pointless. I thought that the flash backs about Clark's childhood was a good piece to the movie. Most the characters did a good job except the person who played superman was as boring as dry paint. Also, I would've liked to see more romance between Clark and Lois. I think that Russel Crow played a cool character and it was nice to see a different villain rather than Lex Luthor.

I didn't particularly enjoy Richard Donner's classic 1978 Superman nor the 1980 sequel (however, I did immensely enjoy General Zod as the villain in the sequel) – I didn't like how they wanted to be ""funny"" and ""witty"", and just ended up being juvenile. And don't get me started on the awful movie that is Superman Returns. So yes, my experience with the Superman movies wasn't a very pleasurable one. But, when I heard the franchise was getting a reboot, and that this time the movie will feel more serious and darker, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, bad reviews started pouring in eventually and, as a result, Man of Steel received a pretty bad rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I feared that Man of Steel would be another big superhero movie let down. I was wrong.The story of this movie is very familiar, but in case you don't know: Jor-El (Russell Crowe), in the midst of the destruction of his planet Krypton, sends his newborn son Kal-El to Earth. There Kal-El gets adopted by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner), and they name him Clark. When he grows up, Clark (Henry Cavill), since he has super powers, chooses to help humanity. Soon after he puts on the Superman suit and cape, a threat to humanity rises in the form of General Zod (Micahel Shannon) – a genocidal maniac from Krypton. Some other important characters that appear in the movie are Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and her boss Perry (Laurence Fishburne). As you may notice, this is a great cast. Actually, I've never seen such combined star power in a superhero movie. And all of them are good. Especially Henry Cavill, who shines as the title character.Bottom line, Man of Steel isn't a bad movie, it has amazing visuals and good action scenes. Most of the origin story is told in the form of flashbacks, which is always an interesting narrative device. The movie features a ton of interesting and creative Kryptonian technology so the movie's Sci-Fi aspect is also satisfying. As I said, the actors really do a good job. Michael Shannon is effective as the menacing General Zod, even though Terence Stamp's portrayal in Superman 2 is somewhat better. Henry Cavill is amazing as Superman, although we will have to wait until the sequel to see him portray Clark Kent as an inept Daily Planet journalist. Kevin Costner is another decent actor, but he has very little screen time – which is slightly disappointing since the relationship between his character and Henry Cavill's character had a lot of potential. Because of its strong actors, nice visual effects and action scenes, Man of Steel is one summer blockbuster that is worth your money.Of course, that doesn't mean the movie is without problems. The directing of the movie bothered me mostly – unnecessary shaky cam, quick cuts and strange zoom-ins are what Zack Snyder decided to use in his vision of Superman. And, of course, Man of Steel is yet another Superman movie with its runtime of over 2 hours. That wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't for the tedious second half which is made of one action scene after another. I mean, they do look amazing but after some time you kind of get sick of them. However, that doesn't excuse the awful rating this movie got on Rotten Tomatoes. So ignore the critics, go watch this movie and enjoy yourself. Man of Steel is the best Superman movie so far – although, unfortunately, this isn't saying much.Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Clearly that director didn't show up on the Man of Steel set. It seemed like he wanted to take his directorial style in a different direction, and that's okay, but it looked like almost the entire move was shot shaky-cam handlheld style. I can accept that for ""wartime"" action scenes, but to shoot everything that way, even the more poignant, thoughtful moments, was too much. Way too much. But perhaps it's just me, since I've heard no one else complain about this. Do we accept this now as the way Hollywood shoots movies for dramatic effect? Otherwise, the film took Superman in a new direction - 'Stranger in a Strange Land', coming to grips with his identity, but still provided enough homage to the original source material and even to the Christopher Reeves era for older fans to enjoy. If you don't look for plot holes, inconsistencies and 'convenient structuring', you'll enjoy it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Another masterful performance in another highly rated, intelligent SF film)Michael Shannon (as ZOD is way more menacing than that of Terrence Stamp but boy was Stamp lovingly camping it up in the original Superman's 1 & especially 2)Diane Lane (Streets of Fire for this lad of 16 in 1984 made me an ALL-TIME Fan)Russell Crowe (Jor-El) again, another match for Brando's version.Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent) another superb actor & that scene here, is rather heartbreaking.It's a SUPER ;) CAST, it really is & ALL their roles work out here (for me) not a weak link in any of them, even the surrounding cast helps the cause.More an out & out Science Fiction movie really this which happily includes
Superman & Zod from Krypton to give us a BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (Both a superb SF film with the Superhero element)I truly LOVE this film.It's one of DC's & Zack Snyder's VERY BEST films.I keep returning to it each & every year & of it's type it's damn near
perfect...The start retraces yet again Supes ORGIN STORY (Thank the Heavens James Gunn isn't once again giving us another origins of Superman story, interesting cast on this newer one to come but I doubt it will beat this cast / film version)This is hugely ENTERTAINING.Now I get that it's tonally different to ANY previous SUPERMAN films.I happen to also LOVE the Christopher Reeves Superman films (especially 1 & 2, with a soft spot for 3 also) and it's true if you want something softer, which gives a closer account to the original Superman / Clark Kent from the comics then THIS is the one to go see, they're superb films in their own rights...What's the point in remaking them like this when these were also (in their own way) kinda nearly perfect.THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT, harder, more SF Superman film & Synder kicked a
field goal, judging by a good many reviews here, it seems not everyone is
a Jack Snyder hater (and even some who are, can probably agree this is a superbly created movie, perhaps his BEST? I think so but the ratings would suggest otherwise, I'll touch on those & Synder in general in a moment) as with others here...I cannot believe this movie does not rate higher than the current 7.1 score (I guess many a Snyder hater has brought this rating down) but it's surely an 8 at worst & for folks like me who can simply see past whoever directed it (although Snyder clearly brought is A-GAME to this one) it's a 9 bordering on an actual, almost perfect '10'So...JACK SNYDER as director.There is NO DOUBT certain director's have their own style, JJ Abrams has his critics also but if a films a GOOD ONE that it shouldn't be hated on JUST BECAUSE So & So directed it.They'll always be GOOD FILMS (perhaps GREAT FILMS as I think this one rates) OK films & just downright AWFUL one's made by the same directors.This for me personally rates as Snyder's VERY BEST.IMDb thinks not (fair enough) and those that beat this 7.1 for ""MAN of STEEL"" are creditable & even a close match for this one.It looks like most consider it a very close call as to which of Snyder's films RATES the BEST...Both ""WATCHMEN"" & ""300"" rating 7.6.Of these two I prefer the more inventive Watchmen, but how can one not find '300' impressive in it's way, certainly worthy of being his 2nd & 3rd BEST MOVIES in my list.I also enjoyed ""JUSTICE LEAGUE"" (the original cut) but it seems Synder was a bit put out that HIS VERSION didn't really see the light of day until in more recent times (I have NOT YET seen this version) and it seems it now rates as one of his very best...GOOD NEWS for me as I kinda liked the original with you know who taking over as director.Others I've liked from him...""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" rating 7.3 an early (might have been his first?) movie which surprisingly worked well as a more modern ZOMBIE film.One that doesn't get too much LOVE, perhaps because it is SO DIFFERENT is ""SUCKER PUNCH"" yes there are scences within it that are a bit BLAH but the overall look & feel of the film works (for me) only rates 6.1 though.Of late his films seem to be NOT SO GOOD...""BATMAN v SUPERMAN"" was a bit of an overblown mess, especially when compared to this film.""ARMY of the DEAD"" is also a bit of mess.And although I have yet to see any of the REBEL MOON films, many that have seen these also, seem to feel he's lost his unique touch & that these are inferior Star Wars or even DUNE copies (at best) which is a shame!I don't mind ZACK SNYDER one little bit.Is he one of my favourite DIRECTOR's? Not really, has he made a number of poor films? YES, no one's perfect, but he's also made ONE OF THE GREATEST Science Fiction / SUPERHERO movies I think there's EVER BEEN & this is it & if the next incarnation of Superman is to surpass this one of Henry Cavill and / or Christopher Reeves than that's a SUPERMAN film I cannot wait to see but surely he will need to be very different from these two.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Fury of the Gods"" I decided to rewatch the entire DCEU so far, starting with of course ""Man of Steel"". I had seen the movie 2 times before this rewatch, but surprisingly this time my experience was better! Third time's the charm I guess...This movie has a couple of really cool moments, like the part where General Zod broadcasts himself to the entire world. He felt really menacing and it was actually pretty scary if you think about it. And of course Superman's first flight scene was really cool.There are some well known problems a lot of people have with this movie, but most of them I don't really agree with, because in this movie Clark just starts out being Superman, so obviously he isn't flawless. At that point he would still have a lot of room to grow as a hero. But that's purely for this movie. The problem that I have is that in later movies he just stays the same.So as an origin movie, this was in my opinion a really good movie. But unfortunately Henry Cavill never got used to his full potential.8.1/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The acting was first-rate, especially the actor who portrayed General Zod--he stole some scenes from Russell Crowe playing Superman's real Dad, and that's not easy to do. But all the actors did real well and the military was well represented and believable. I had to chuckle a little when Superman reveals he has been on earth ""33 years"" and the image of Christ is behind him in the scene from the church. But that's cool. Director Zach Snyder does a great job with this movie and the special effects, spaceships, and fight scenes are incredible.

I am sure that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this one but personally I was not overly thrilled with this movie.Sure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a ""Superman"" movie it just did not feel right to me.The original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth The first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to ""explain"" his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.Having said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high ""coolness factor"". Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch. Unfortunately I have to admit that this was my enjoyment of this movie, to watch the special effects.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They could have made it so much better, so epic. First the good parts: There is so much action, in abundance from start to finish. Visuals are stunning. Music is amazing. Acting is good too, especially Russel Crowe.The bad part: The story. What was the story? It was an alien invasion from start to finish. Like Independence Day kind of even. I agree that even Avengers was Alien invasion in essence, but every minute of it was enjoyable. There was humor, wit, interesting characters, well timed and purposeful action. This movie lacked exactly those things. To be sure, it is much better than Transformers- Dark of the moon, which also falls in the same category, but on the scale of Transformers to Avengers, Man of Steel falls a lot closer to Transformers than it does to Avengers. The story is simple enough as stated in the Plot summary. So the rest is filled with fist fights. Since the bullets and missiles can't hurt Kriptonians there is no point of gun fight. Its just Hulk meet good looks, and less humor...thats it. People who want just action, will not be disappointed, but people who expect Batman kind of take on the Superman series or even a serious franchise about story and legacy, wait until the DVDs come out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes it's a bomb, literally making neighborhood exploded (as ""blockbuster"" really means) but why can't we, spectators, want more than buildings going down and people looking up hoping for some savior? Acting is good even if, at some point, we have to smile imagining some of them with only a green/blue screen to act on... Special effects are obviously the strong statement of the movie (the only one?) but we know that green and blue colors are now Avatar's one so we irremediably go back to the sunny ones (especially when sun is vital to Kal-El!)but wanted to recreate the fauna of Krypton might have been a bit to much...About the elliptic narrative writing, it works great but at the end we have a strong impression about a collage more than an actual movie. But the pact is fulfilled: we have action, drama, romance, past, present and futur (n°2 will bring once again Lex Luthor?) all tied up around one man more than one hero as the title suggest. But something is still missing: Snyder and Nolan have given us more in their past production than this demi-teintes long and fierce movie. Stop exploring the doubt, balancing between different possibilities and make a choice, assert: this self exploring period of American cinema has to come to an end by a big break in the spectator confidence as The Dark Knight or Watchmen used to be! Entertainement is not an end, it's a meaning to more: so yes go, enjoy, appreciate but criticize too!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The majority of the acting is amateur. Russell Crowe is average, Amy Adams (Lois Lane) should be put in a soap opera, Henry Cavil as Superman has no screen presence whatsoever and Michael Shannon as General Zod was awful.3.

But what Christopher Nolan could do to batman could not be done by Zack for superman. The superman series needs to reinvent itself in terms of adding the details. There is always a great positivity in superman which needed to go into the domain of grey's (Which is what is done by Nolan). There have been many superman movies one after another trying to up the ante on the technical aspect of cinematography. Had they mere thought so much more about the real details of being a superman they could have come up with more imaginative ways to portray the whole man of steel experience...Having said all of this, the movie is still a good watch. It brings together a facet as the core of philosophical debate. Thereafter it develops the Superman character with elan. Especially good work is done by Crowe, Diana Lane and Harry Lennix. The special effects get more intense with this movie. The fight sequences are amazing work of visual display.

If anyone can though, Christopher Nolan can; so I was positive about Henry Cavill's chances of starting a new chapter in the Superman catalogue. Nolan delivers all the polish and incredible visuals that we've come to expect from him; and also, the characters have resonance and depth as always. Cavill is solid and believable as the tortured hero. I'm sure his next outing will allow him to show his leading man status to the full. For what it is, Man of Steel is good and well worth your hard-earned money, but somehow I can't help thinking that this particular superhero does not fit the 'Dark Knight' treatment. I certainly don't want a reboot of the overly moralistic and saccharine sweet Superman series, but where is the fun Mr. Nolan...?

The superhero has it's own super powers and that's all that separates him from other superhero movies. I don't think that this movie is any different. It tried to be revolutionary like "" The dark knight"" but it got a little lost with the vibe. It starts at Krypton where Russel Crowe (Superman's dad) is fighting against a General Zod (bad guy) played by Michael Shannon. Krypton looked a little bit like a mixture between Lord of the rings and Oblivion, which I think didn't really catch the Superman vibe and don't think anybody wants to see Russel Crowe flying on a bird/dragon. After that the movie and Superman/Cal-el/Clark Kent go to earth where I think the movie became interesting. What I liked, apart from Kevin Costner playing Superman's other dad, was the way the chronology was filmed. You first see Superman as a grown man still trying to find himself and throughout this process there's a series of flashbacks of his youth where he discovers his powers. This was done terrific and was very fun to watch. The dilemma's he had to go through to control and at the same time console his powers for the rest of the world in, order to fit in, where very nicely shown. And also the graphics are amazing, especially the flying and falling through buildings blew my mind. What this movie really lacked was an epic battle. First of all general Zod didn't do it for me. He wasn't dark and gritty as a bad guy supposed to be. I actually wouldn't' mind having a beer with him and talk about his plans for wold domination because I think he would hurt me and I can maybe even talk him out of doing it. I think the girl that was working for him (that almost kicked Superman's ass) was more of a bad guy then Zod. Second of all the movie misses a epic battle. Of course there were a lot of fighting scenes but they were all small scenes that were quickly over. I really wanted a transformers or avengers like battle at the end there. After having said all that I still think people have to watch this movie cause Henry Cavill did a good job (especially in the whole ""who am I"" process) and the movie is pretty gripping at times. Still I don't think that the worlds most famous superhero got his Super-movie! 7/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film also shows the responsibilities that he has to assume due to his great powers and the consequences of his battles, being these epics on grand scales.
Zack Snyder still proves to us unintentionally, that it is possible to adapt a Dragon Ball movie with mastery!
A beautiful start to the DC universe in theaters!!!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Kal-el's Last son of Krypton, raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent on a Farm in Smallville, Kansas to become the world's greatest superhero with the mortality to do good for all humanity, the symbol of peace and justice to become the man of tomorrow that we need Today! You will not find him in this new ""Man of Steel"" movie. :( So here's what we know about Superman.. When we were kids, we loved superman because he could fly, see through walls, use his heat vision, hear the world's cries, stop bullets, lift anything, punch villains to a bloody pulp and besides krptonite(his weakness) he is pretty much indestructible. But as we get older, we begin to understand that Superman is so much more then that! Superman is the symbol of peace and of course 'Hope' Superman wouldn't be who he is today if it weren't for the people who raised him. Jonathan and Martha Kent. They taught him what was 'Right' and what was 'Wrong' like any good parents would do. 'Never Lie, Cheat, Steal or Kill' We know that his one love is Lois Lane who is a reporter from the Daily Planet. Who doesn't know the double identity of Superman and Clark Kent, but we do. We know he has a Fortress of Solitude in the North Pole.. With that said and without altering any of that.. How can you NOT make a 'GOOD SUPERMAN' movie? Well they just did, I took my 6 year old nephew to this movie and he got bored. Even during the special effects. Yet he can sit through a whole Christopher Reeves(the original superman) movie with cheap special effects and not take his eyes off the television. This movie had no heart. The Villain Zod was a Zombie. I usually like villains in superhero movies because they at least have a personality. This Zod didn't. I get it, he's a General. But can he at least have one good line or quote? Nope, he just shouted once. There was a lot of shouting in this movie. Even with the great cast this movie had. The Script killed this movie.. This movie broke my heart. This was not the Superman I fell in love with when I was a kid. It was not the Superman I read in any of ""ALL"" the comics I read. This was a waste of my money and it was a waste of my time. I just wish I would have saw it before I took my nephew so I didn't have to subject him to my depressed state afterwords.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Since then there have been many movies that have stepped up as classics and with Man Of Steel, Warner Bros. were looking to create yet another masterpiece, especially given that DC's main competitor, Marvel have taken the lead cinematically speaking. While not on par with, let's say The Avengers, Man Of Steel is very much it's own movie and manages to set up a respectable story. I didn't think much on it upon my first viewing, but returning to it now, the movie made more sense and despite a necessary, but somewhat long set up to the movie's conflict, Man Of Steel delivers a comic book movie filled with great action.Henry Cavill is the perfect fit for this modern day Superman, as he embodies his difficult nature as a young man trying to figure out why he is different and shows tremendous character as the ultimate Superhero. Amy Adams makes for a more attractive Lois Lane, yet the character continues to be perceived as the damsel in distress. Michael Shannon gives an exciting performance as General Zod, the movie's villain hellbent on accomplishing his goals. And with the veteran talents of Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, the movie is well handled in the cast department. Much has been said about the destruction the movie showcases. Mostly I agree that it's a bit mindless and there could have been better ways to show combat between the characters. Still one can't deny that it's a pleasure to watch, at least for someone like me who likes intense action.Man Of Steel won't go down as a classic. In fact its middling review suggest that DC and Warner Bros, still have a long way to go before they get to Marvel levels. Still it's mildly entertaining and very much worth a view.Rating 8/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had hoped that WB had done the right thing. The last outing of Superman was the worst film I had seen in ages. So my hopes were up when I found out that they were going to try again. So my initial thought after watching Man Of Steel was good. I enjoyed how they had changed the story. The cast was outstanding and the visual effects were superb, but the film lacked something. I still really cant put my finger on it even now. It seems that they wanted to show the back story of Superman and his arrival to earth, and they did this well. The first hour or so of the film was great. Seeing Clark being alienated and struggling with how to grow up in a world that has enough pressures for its human children was brilliant. Then it came to the action sequences and this is where the story line seems to fade. Though the fight scenes/cgi is good it seemed to much at once. I have the feeling that WB are trying their hardest to catch up with Disney/Marvel Avengers and have fallen short. Its a shame really as they have lots of potential for Superman. Lets only hope they do a sequel. In all a good film but not as Super as it could have been","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But when I had to have time away from the house after the death of my magnificent old dog, I decided to see it. It was better than I thought it would be, but it had problems.There were plot inconsistencies and contrivances that had me wondering, ""Why would they do that?"" There were times when disasters came rushing at characters...and rushing...and rushing while the characters seemed content to stand and wait in order to add high drama to the scene. It was easy to overlook or discount most of the inconsistencies, contrivances, and melodrama during the movie. They started to whisper at me a bit later. The movie's plot was overall good and I didn't sweat the small stuff. It was a bit too long at around 140 minutes. The script could have benefited from another fine polishing, I think.Think back to the performances, I realized that most of them seemed very superficial. Like the actors were phoning it in. Notable exception were Cavill as Kal, Shannon as Zod, and Traue as Faora. Don't get me wrong; the other performances weren't bad, they just didn't engage me. Like I said, they seemed superficial.There are lots of special effects in MOS. Some were much better than others. The problematic ones were falling buildings that seemed to ignore the rate of acceleration and fall at their own stately pace. The tornado that appeared was massive and very s-l-o-w when such a tornado is usually unforgivingly fast.MOS is worth your time, but it probably won't top your list of favorite movies. Use the viewing as a way to get out of the heat with a friend or loved one. It fits that purpose very well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's what I had when I started to watch Man Of Steel. The movie already had two things against it: I'm not a huge Superman fan, as I mostly find his boy scout character dull and Znyder isn't that strong of a director. So color me surprised, Man of Steel is, and I know this is a blasphemous thing to say, the best Superman movie I've seen.In MoS Clark is just beginning to become the hero we know. The world finally finds out about Superman when Zod comes to Earth, looking for a codex containing the salvation of Krypton, the destroyed home plant of Clark, Zod and the small rag tag group of Kryptonian prisoners from a Phantom Zone.There's a lot to like about MoS. First of the special effects look great. And secondly, there's a lot of good actors in the movie, who give out pretty nice performances considering how inherently silly the whole movie is despite all the muted colors and dramatic music by Zimmer. Yes, there's a lot about MoS which could have turned the whole movie into an unintentional camp fest, but it never does. Some how Znyder has managed to churn out a movie about modern gods with out making it look silly. Instead the movie is exhilarating.For the first time in a long, long time, I believed in Superman. I rooted for him, despite I knew he is absurdly strong. A man of steel. A man, who is almost impossible to hurt, unless you hurt something he loves.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The villain is strong enough giving a good competition to the walking god on earth. Coming to performances Henry Caville has given Clark Kent a new look by his physique and mannerisms, Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner are good enough in their characters and a special reference to Michael Shannon for the General Zod character. TECHNICAL DEPARTMENTS: the first applause goes to the Director Zack Snyder for giving a dark look to the always colorful Superman and the way he scripted the movie.

The action scenes are simply amazing, its excessive use of CGI manages to transmit each impact, accompanied by the master Hans Zimmer, that brings a dignified and majestic soundtrack.

He seems like the ultimate superhero with all the best powers. I grew up with watching two superheroes: Superman and Spiderman. I had a chance to go see this when it first came out but I decided not to because it did not peak my interest. But after a few kids at my school began raving about the movie, calling it the 'best superhero movie' I then decided to watch it. I did not know what to expect, so I had no expectations. I found that the movie was just okay. It seemed really dark, a little too dark for a superhero movie, even though it was made by DC. Henry Cavill did a decent job as Superman but I did not enjoy Michael Shannon as the villain. He is always a hit or miss for me and I just did not appreciate his performance in this movie. He just seemed out of place with the whole thing. Also, one thing that bothered me was that the last half hour of the movie, it felt like they were trying to show off their special effects. All it was were buildings collapsing and exploding. There was nothing to it. Then, in the last scene in the movie, it goes ahead a few months and it looks like nothing ever happened.

Man of Steel however was not the best remake and could have been done much better. Too much CGI and poor casting. The young people who are impressed with this movie have undoubtedly grown up with CGI and missed a better age of movies where the movies were performed instead of computer generated. The original is a classic because as absurd as ""Superman"" is, the actors (who were dramatic stage/theater actors) performed every line. George Lucas (who later contradicted himself) said back in the 1980s while making the original Star Wars movie that a special effect without a story is just a special effect. That's what this movie was, just a series of special effects. Superman is such a fantastic character (unbelievable) that the special effects possible now could really make for a good movie as long as they are not overdone.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Though i was very excited for it after reading the mixed reviews i felt nervous but once i left i was not let down.Man of Steel is a great origin story of the iconic character of Superman. The film is filled with great performances by Henry Cavill, (who is the best Kal-El since Christopher Reeve) Kevin Costner, Russel Crowe, Amy Adams and Lawrence Fishburne. But the performance i felt left down by was Michael Shannon as General Zod. He didn't feel as evil as he could have been. But he was OK in the role. The films structure and pacing at times do feel a little off. The other thing i felt lacking was the character development. You don't get to know the characters as well as you do in the comics but it isn't a huge problem with the film. But now onto the positives of the film. All together the film itself is amazing visually. Zack Snyder is a visual director. (as you would know after seeing 300 and Watchmen) One of my personal favorite parts of the film rest around the action scenes. The attention to detail and the way it is filmed make it look real rather than a huge CGI mess. Though the action scenes do over stay their welcome for a little but i can understand why. When was the last time we saw Superman fight? Superman IV: The Quest For Peace was the last time and that didn't have anything fun to watch. I Personally enjoyed the film so much that i went to see it 4 times during its theatrical run. All and all Man of Steel is fun, epic, entertaining as hell and a good time.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The re-boot is complete, with dazzling special effects, especially for 3-D. I think I saw some Lovecraftian elements, what with the space-ships and other stuff resembling menacing lobsters, sea anemones, octopi and such stuff. But it could be my imagination on over-drive.Henry Cavill makes a good Superman, although he looks better with the beard, than without it. Half the film is based on not so-very accurate flash-backs, so the younger generation who have not been bought up on the staple diet of DC comics will never really know what the actual Superman was all about. Even the name and the symbol, S, has been down-played. Superman has dropped his red knickers in this film.. the camera avoids his lower parts, and concentrates more on his face and biceps. Lois Lane makes an early appearance.. in fact, she is in most of the frames. Poor Superman has to share most of his scenes either with his parents or General Zod. I wonder if subsequent productions will bring in some of the older, more established villains like Brainiac, Lex Luthor etc., or will it Zod, Zod and Zod all the way.Not a bad deal, on the whole. Certainly watchable, but not a collector's item for sure.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","An Beautifully Bittersweet Insight To the Character of Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3438570/?ref_=tt_urv","katquinn88","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40799571/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2016","As an avid Superman fan, I've been following the production of Man of Steel for almost two years now, ever since they announced Christopher Nolan would be producing and some Brit named Henry Cavill was going to be Superman.I went into the movie with very high expectations, and not only were those expectations met, they were just blown out of the park.Let's just start by saying that I am not a fan of Russell Crowe. Loved him in Gladiator (who didn't?) but after seeing Body of Lies and Robin Hood, my trust in him to play Jor-El was shaken. However, he did a marvelous job at conveying to the audience that he was willing to do anything to save his son, but also to protect his people.We also get to meet the film's antagonist, General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his ever so alluring partner-in-destruction, Faora (Antje Traue). As a fan of Michael Shannon, I was surprisingly lukewarm about his portrayal of Zod in the early scenes of the movie. It was a role that I expected him to thrive in, yet he seemed ratherrobotic. Maybe that's the angle he was going for (I can see how he would choose to portray the character like that) but I wish he gave in just a little bit more to Zod's rage.A few massive explosions, a death scene that should have had me in tears, but didn't (I blame Ayelet Zurer's lack of a reaction) and Russell Crowe riding a giant butterfly-dragon- eagle thing later, we finally get to Superman! Or rather, Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) as he wanders about the world, asking the ultimate question of ""Why am I here?""Just going to stop and say it here : Henry Cavil was absolutely brilliant.I admit, I am a Henry Cavill fan (thank you The Tudors.) but from the perspective of a comic book fan, he quite simply was Superman. Fit the part and did a phenomenal job acting as Superman. Not the Christopher Reeve Superman, so please do not come up to me and tell me that Superman should have been saving cats of a tree.No.Do I think that Kal could have smiled a bit more? Yes, this Superman was a bit on the broody side. And did I miss the dorky charm of Clark Kent? Yes, but this film wasn't about Clark Kent and Superman. It was about Kal-El.But back to the movie review.Quickly summarizing the rest of the film, it is a constant picture of explosions and space ships and crazy stuff flying in every direction. Many critics are saying that it was too much action and they needed to take a break.I do agree with the fact that the action scenes could have been broken up by scenes of dialogue (mainly between Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Superman) but at the same time, I don't dislike the endless explosions. It's two angry Kryptonians going at it, and yes, buildings will be falling down, things are going to light on fire, and yeah. There's going to be a lot of explosions.Speaking of Lois Lane, let's talk about that. For being such an important character in the film, Lois really wasn't in the movie that much. That being said, the scenes that she was in, I thought Amy Adams was one of the best Lois Lanes that I've ever seen (the other being Erica Durance of Smallville). She captured the pure force of determination that Lois Lane is, and her chemistry with Henry Cavill was breathtaking. Despite the fact that most of their romantic development seemed to happen off camera, the two were able to communicate that Superman, yes, saves Lois Lane, but in a figurative sense, Lois saves Kal. She gives him a reason (other than his mother) to care about Earth. I just wish that we had seen a bit more of her sass.The film also lacked some key character development between Lois and Clark. I though what they did in the film was very sweet and very very hot, but it was also very rushed. In the comics, there are so many moments that you can see that Clark just is amazed at Lois just by the way he looks at her, and this film sadly lacked that.Before I talk about the major twist at the end of the film, let me quickly say that Johnathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) were also incredible as the heartwarming Kent couple. The twist of Johnathan's character (which I will not spoil here) was completely unexpected, but really made sense and fit into the movie. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it wasforgotten five minutes later. Snyder really could have taken and drawn out this scene to further give us insight into what the heck made Clark Kent so broody.Zod'sdemise at the hands of Superman was completely unexpected, but completely in character. Which was odd to me. In the comics, Superman does not kill. At all. The way I look at it, he had no choice. He knew he had to kill him to save Earth. That was the sacrifice. Let Earth and it's seven billion inhabitants perish, or kill this one man (and leave yourself alone again.) but save them.It's as simple as that. Kal had no choice. All in all, one of the best films that I have ever seen. In my opinion, better than Dark Knight, which was my favorite movie ever since I saw it back in '09.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Not even Amy Adams, one of the most magnetic actresses working today, can bring emotional life or plausibility to this supposedly serious story.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814576/?ref_=tt_urv","TheUnknown837-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6321000/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","From the very beginning of ""Man of Steel,"" in which we see a mother suffer through the agonies and processes of childbirth, the director, Zack Snyder, has declared war on our senses. He opens his picture with a series of clumsily staged and frequently out-of-focus shots while the Foley flares up to the point where the theater speakers sound as though they might explode. I never imagined I would see a superhero picture (let alone one starring the Man of Steel himself, Superman) that opened with a screaming woman and an infant dripping with amniotic fluid. But alas, this extremely discomforting and frankly weird sequence sets the mood for the entire 143 minutes that ensues. For this new Superman is one of the most visually aggressive and unpleasantly loud movies of the year.There is some minimal comfort: we're not the only ones subjected to director Snyder's assault. Throughout the picture, anything and everything that can demolished or bruised or beaten in any sort of way receives a grueling fate. Entire rows of cars go up in flames; skyscrapers pummel to the ground; windows are popped into thousands of shards one after another; and the occasional human neck is snapped like a dry twig. Snyder not only directs every single sequence in a fast-moving, relentless manner (with the camera lenses pushed in much too far), but he does not allow for any breather space. As soon as one object (or person) has been obliterated, something else is sent off to join it. It is nonstop noise. Everything is noisy; even the tapping of a pencil on a desk brim rattles the soundtrack. Let's also take note that Superman no longer takes off and glides before picking up speed. Now he launches from the ground with all the earsplitting frequency and velocity of a space-bound rocket. And that's simply ignoring the trombone-heavy score by Hans Zimmer, which is excellent enough on its own terms, but pushed up in volume too high by the sound editors, so that it seems to bleed through all of the explosions and screaming and collisions that are already assailing our ears.So, what is the point behind all this? Even though Snyder directed ""Man of Steel,"" the dominant artist involved in terms of storytelling and mood is the producer, Christopher Nolan, who made the three recent Batman pictures. Those movies (two of which I hold with immense respect and admiration) successfully transformed the Caped Crusader from a dork in a bat suit into an interesting and oddly fascinating charactereven with that silly and not-scary voice. Nolan's Batman went from silly to serious, and now he appears to be trying the same with Superman.But here is the problem. Out of all of the superhero characters, Batman is the one you can afford to take dead-serious, because he's the one who is grounded closest to reality; he's flesh-and-blood; he's human and mortal in every way, except in his legacy and image. When dealing with a figure like Superman, who hails from an alien planet and can spew lobotomizing, crimson beams from his eyes, there needs to be some room for science-fiction wonder and spectacle.You also, given his origins, need to evoke a human side. And here is where both Nolan and Snyder have utterly failed with their film. The alter-ego of Clark Kent is absolutely essential for the Superman character, because in that personae, he brings something credible to the table, something you can relate to and identify with. In ""Man of Steel,"" we have to wait until the last half-dozen shots to see him don those awkward glasses and stuttering demeanor. Because of this, since he spends the rest of the movie in his impersonal, alien mode, this new Superman is nothing more than a brooding outsider. I usually refrain from comparing entries in a movie-franchise, but if I may say so, the alter-ego dynamic was what made the original ""Superman: The Movie"" from 1978 such a smashing success. As played by Christopher Reeve, the character spent most of his time in disguise, putting on an act, but still involving us in the story. And that's why there was such wonderful chemistry between Reeve (who in my mind, will always be Superman) and Margot Kidder as the feisty, go-getting reporter.This is no condemnation of either Henry Cavill, as Superman, or Amy Adams, as the reporter, in ""Man of Steel."" Their biggest foes are not the alien invaders (whose ships resemble something out of the ""Star Gate"" television series), but the utterly bland characters thrown in their laps. With this script, Cavill is bland and impersonal. We never get any real chance to understand him as a character, because, again, the movie is constantly forcing him to go into muscle-man mode, saving people from exploding oil rigs and sinking school buses. The only time he shows any sign of a human side is during the film's one truly spell-binding scene where Superman discovers his ability to fly. When he first takes off, Cavill begins to laugh, tickled at his own ability, like a child. And it is only here that the movie allows any significant stretch of time for the material to develop and enhance and for the meanings to resonate with us. Before and after this point, it just goes on, banging away to no apparent end. And just when things seem to quiet down – lo and behold! – a satellite falls out of the sky, and the over-pumped Foley rattles our ears. No matter all the talent put before and behind the camera, ""Man of Steel"" is not much more than a big, impersonal bore.Oh, and as for the love story. Forget about it. Not even Amy Adams, one of the most magnetic of actresses working today, can bring emotional life to this supposedly serious story.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Kal-El is a man who was born on the planet Krypton to a man named Jor-El. Jor-El as depicted in this film is a moral leader. He does not agree with the way Kryptonians have been running the planet. They have been spending all of their resources to a point to where Krypton is about to be destroyed. Jor-El sees this, and because he wants his son to survive in a world where he can make a difference, he sends Kal-El to Earth. On Earth, he is raised by a couple of farmers who name him Clark Kent. They soon start realizing that he has special abilities that no one else has, and this creates a lot of complications in his childhood. Eventually Clark finds out who he is, and that he is supposed to use his special abilities for good as Superman.However, there is another man from Krypton named Zod who was born to protect Krypton. I am not going to go too deep into what Zod wants, but I will say that he wants something that has to do with Kal-El. He also wants to do something that will affect the people of earth in a negative way, so Superman has to stop him.I really liked this version of Superman. It made me appreciate the character even more. As an audience we get an understanding of how Clark grew up. He did not like being different, there were times he really wanted to blow up at people, but he couldn't do that. He also was always willing to use his powers to do good, but he couldn't always do that because the Kents knew that he needed his powers to be revealed at the proper time. I really got a sense of how Clark is a great moral hero, and after watching this movie, I can see that he got that trait from his birth father, Jor-El. Without spoiling anything, I will tell you that his morality does get tested in the end. The director, Zack Snyder—who is also known for directing 300—did a great job at giving us a visually appealing film. I have noticed from both this and 300 that he uses color in such an interesting way that it keeps me wanting to look at the screen. Another thing about his direction that is just awesome is the action scenes: they are phenomenal! I am going to say that this has some of the coolest action scenes I have ever seen. There is such a cool stylistic, comic book feel to them especially when Superman fights the Kryptonians. It is fast paced and crisp. One thing I love about it is that Zack Snyder likes to emphasize the first and last part of a punch while rushing everything in between. This adds to the feeling of watching a comic book because in a comic book we may see only the first and last part of a hit, but we usually do not see everything in between.All the performances were very well done. I especially enjoyed the performance of Amy Adams, who played Lois Lane. When I first heard that she was going to play Lois I wondered how it was going to work. I was wondering if they were going to dye her hair black. However, I saw in the trailers that they did not do anything with her hair. It turns out that this is one of those times where performance is more important than looks. She did a good job at portraying Lois as a sarcastic, spunky woman, and I looked forward to every scene she was in. I do not think anyone could have casted a better Superman. Henry Cavill does so well at portraying Superman as a confident role model with a strict moral code. I also enjoyed watching Cavill portray him as he transitioned into this character. He is not always confident with himself until he finds out who exactly he is and where he came from. One can see a sense of responsibility that Superman immediately gets after this, and with that responsibility there is a sense of confidence about him.All of the performances were well done. Russell Crowe as Jor-El was very well executed as well as Michael Shannon as General Zod. Some of the parts were less phenomenal than others, but overall the acting was very well executed by the entire cast.It was not the perfect movie, however. It did lack some character development that would have made it better. This is especially true with Lois Lane. Amy Adams played her very well, but in the end all I knew about her was that she was sometimes sarcastic and spunky. It would have been nice if there were more scenes showing the audience more about who she is. This would make us care more about her especially when she gets into risky situations. However, with that being said, this movie was primarily about Superman, and after seeing this movie I came to know and like that character even more.I also felt that the story was probably a little over complicated. Without giving away any spoilers, there are some concepts in this movie that I felt were probably part of some deep Superman lore that an average audience member would have a difficult time picking up on. I felt that this point could have been simplified a little.With that being said, I think that this movie is well worth watching. It has great visuals, an interesting story, and great performances!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Namely - ""All-Star Superman"", ""Superman: Man of Steel"", ""Superman: Birthright"", also a plot point from Superman vol.2 #22 ""The Price"".I do consider Superman a dumb and overpowered hero. And making a good film about him is really a challenge - especially finding a good adversary for him. So, basically, Snyder did all he could, and visually the film is stunning. Yet, I find the movie wasn't serious enough. Depiction of Superman's early life made him much more humane than his previous incarnations - to the point when it was said ""Zack Snyder proved Superman can be a pussy too"". It's the common modern look on superhero reboots - much more realistic and earthly. Still, I miss the charming and self-confident acting Christopher Reeve used to show in the 1978 original.Mass destruction in the movie and the ending, if done properly, wouldn't allow the film to get a PG-13 rating - and many directors are afraid of getting the dreaded R. Still, if you've read ""The Price"", you'd know the crisis the same action drives Superman into, while the ending of the movie is treated too lightly.There is no emotional depth past Superman's childhood in the movie. Lois Lane's character, though not the stereotypical damsel in distress as in previous treatments, is underdeveloped. The ending - unconvincing. Visuals - stunning.And yes, at last the man learned to wear his undies properly.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The only other films from this franchise that come close are 'Batman Begins' (2005) and 'The Dark Knight' (2008).It's obvious that a whole lot more thought went in to this film than any of the others before it and sadly those that followed it too, which are awful and do not utilise the brilliant and ridiculously handsome Henry Cavill or his version of the superhero character properly at all.I'm easily swayed by a good looking fella, so having someone that looks THAT good always helps to make a film successful for me, but Henry really does do a great justice to the character as well. There's a gentleness about him, but also a strength that isn't just in his muscles. Add that terrific torso and jawline and phew!Similarly, Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane is far superior to any that have gone before her. In my recent review of 'Superman Returns' (2006) I state that the other versions are too abrasive and that their ambitions gets in the way of them being human enough to be attractive to Clark/Superman, but Amy, although not my type, is strong without being so aggressive that she puts everyone else down and more personable with her girl next door looks.Even Russell Crowe, replacing Marlon Brando, does a good job. He has really grown on me in recent years and I think that he improves on Marlon's rendition, with a bit more going on in his role. He gets to see a bit of the action too.I actually really like the flashbacks that he appeared in, because they feel appropriately distributed, without the whole past being lumped at the beginning of the film just for the sake of chronology. It breaks it up better and yet keeps it moving too.The CGI is also, obviously, much better than before, which really helps when making a superhero film for me. The effects used are worthy of the actors and of this monumentous character we all know so well, where they have been a bit lacklustre before.It really keeps you focussed as the story races along nicely and you grow interested in the development and welfare of those on screen. I'm glad that they didn't go down the traditional Lex Luthor and Kryptonite routes that have been overdone before, because I feel that this is how a superhero film should be made and it's so much better without those two elements.847.05/1000.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

From audience point of view, they are invincible and how would there be a win by these fists and fights. One of them would be good to speak out ""it's gonna be forever with these."" And the things should be added more in are the bad sides of Clark to demonstrate he was not always that good to make him a more believable person with real life experience and recover back from the inside of him. I like the point that the bad guy is not always from a standpoint of view of purely evil with a reasonable cause which relates to the good guy as well. This way it shows us the mixed and complex feeling of characters which reflect our own selves. It's realistic but not that realistic enough to become an adult movie like Batman series since the aftermath of the fight is enormous without any sad or sorry from the nationwide leader and humans' point of view which means not all people are that good enough to think of him as a good guy and ask him to responsible for the recovery. However, if this is the case, superman will somewhat feel like batman. :-) This is just my thought. Maybe the next installment would be much darker like the Dark Knight.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I fell out of love with the caped crusader many years and caricatures ago... as handsome and smoldering hot as the leading man in Henry Cavill could be, I wasn't invested in the outcome of Clark Kent's fate as much as I'd wanted to originally.Maybe these things are no different from passionate affairs that burn and fizzle out all in the thick of a night — one realizes what a massive waste of time it'd been only after waking up the next morning with gathering clarity.The magic stardust that co-writers Christopher Nolan (also the film's producer) and David S. Goyer sprinkled around The Dark Knight has disappeared. At a running time of 144 minutes with less than 20 lines of dialog given to its key protagonist, this film might as well be titled ""Friends of the Man of Steel"". When supporting characters are constantly forcing the narrative with long, loud and generic speeches; perhaps there is a grave problem with the focus and design of this story.Man of Steel is also an unimaginative reboot of the Superman franchise. The first act is devoted entirely to a lengthy do-over that begins with dad Jor El (Russell Crowe) and mom Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), deliberating their newborn's fate on planet Krypton. Here, cinematographer Amir Mokri (Transformers: Dark of the Moon) is limited to the same weary CGI effects and steel-silver-black palettes seen in techy Hollywood films. Ditto for composer Hans Zimmer's deafening crash-bang cues each time something very bad is about to happen on screen.Even the awestruck respect I had for Michael Shannon's acting chops as a corrupt officer of the LAPD in Premium Rush, gradually faded away as General Zod's gormless, permanent frown kept spacing off and staring into the depths of some grand, epic unknown — it must have been just as tiring for him.Why did I fork out money to watch a run-of-the mill movie I'd seen several times before? Why would anyone make the same mistake repeatedly and still believe things would finally change the next time round? Perhaps wild idealizations that accompany the search for what was once perfection are responsible for my predicament the morning after.There is little left to remind me of why the mention of Christopher Nolan's creative input sparked assurance in quality mainstream films. Flashes of grit and style so keenly felt in 2004′s Dawn of the Dead are missing as well. After the awful Sucker Punch, tiresome Dark Knight Rises and now, Man of Steel... the mature, sensible side of me hopes to never sit through another Nolan-Snyder collaboration again.

I have to admit, I haven't been looking as forward to a movie this much since the Dark Knight. As such, I knew that with the expectations I had for this, one viewing was never going to be enough to give it a fair rating.I think most of these kind of movies are defined by the villain and for that I think picking Shannon was a superb move as he didn't disappoint.The action was quite special , but for me , personally, the story of our hero and his fellow Kryptonian dealing (in their own way) with tragedy on a planetary scale is what is at the heart of the movie.Despite some people having a go about character development I think there was more depth to the background of Superman's family(s) and by extension a good understanding to the decisions he makes throughout the film.I also think Zod had more layers then the Terence Stamp character (who I enjoyed, but for different reasons). Dare I say I actually felt pity for Zod, despite the actions he was willing to take in the name of his people. It made me feel conflicted, to a degree, like the villain in Snyders Watchmen.As a side-note, there were a couple of subtle hints to what may lie ahead for superman for the eagle eye fan! I loved the original first 2 Superman movies for what they were, but this is a completely different time and this is a very different Superman so I tried not to benchmark it against these classics. As a result, I really enjoyed this movie, both times and for me thats the good sign of an entertaining movie thats done exactly what I would of hoped from the outset.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"" They always try to explain Kal El's past during the movie. ""The Writers should separate the back story into a spectacular prequel, following a great pilot story depicting Lois Lane and Superman's love affair and its developing relationship with the arch rival Lex Luthor. In such sequence the movie creates more development, and an interest for more.The reason why the Dark knight did so well is because the pace of the movie wasn't slowed down by the main character's development between each movie. It however, explained how the antagonist's backstory applies to the current crisis of the story( where the action is at.)Heres a tip "" detailed background development takes attention away from viewers because it usually does not apply to the situation of the current story (protagonist vs antagonist action).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Growing up as a Superman fan, I absolutely adored the original film starring Christopher Reeve but I waited patiently for the character to get the big screen treatment he deserves. Superman Returns failed because it didn't take us in a new direction since it was just a tribute to the Richard Donner film.With Man of Steel, Zack Snyder and co. have managed to capture the essence of Superman. The disillusionment he feels as an outsider, the love for his adopted parents, the burden of responsibility to use his powers for the greater good etc. For those critics who suggest that this film has no heart, I say Kevin Costner's performance provides a big enough heart for all of us.The action set pieces in this film are outstanding and exactly what one would expect from a movie featuring a hero who has godlike powers. I must say that I felt that I was actually flying with Superman at one point during the finale.The film is a tremendous tour de force and reminds us that Superman will always be the greatest Superhero because he is the most human (not literally of course) and is the embodiment of all we wish to become.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But that's the road not taken, so we have Man of steel instead.Clearly Warner brothers wanted more action and that's what Zack Snyder has given them and the results are entertaining and hopeful for the future.The second edict appears to have been not to follow the Superman origin story verbatim, to avoid comparisons with Richard Donner's Superman. Flashbacks are used, mostly successfully, to achieve this. The emotion and understanding that these scenes needed to inject into the movie work very well, (SPOILER-ISH) the ones towards the midway point possibly needed juggling around a bit, but almost immediately Zod reappears at this point, so the whole thing kicks up a gear anyway.There is a lot of action, particularly after the halfway point, mostly its coherent and exciting, occasionally blurry or just too fast. The cast are all excellent, for me Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon stand out.Cavill's Kal-El is unsure of himself, but not overly angst ridden, he comes over as reasonable and good natured, in other words Superman. Shannon's Zod, if its important to you, does touch on Terence Stamp's performance to a small degree, but this has more to do with the fact that there are points where his character shouts as the plot requires it and as Stamp's best (and funniest line) involved shouting, it just draws comparison. The change in origin dynamics negates any worry of audiences getting restless, waiting for the cape to be donned. (WHOPPING SPOILER!).....(NO REALLY!!) I think what I appreciated the most was after Kal has saved the day and appears to have won the trust of the Humans he has been fighting alongside of, conversely Zod has lost everything and without his raison d'etre, he is purposeless. He had one function and never had the luxury to view that function in terms of good or bad.In amongst all the battling, the scene where Zod laments this turn of events to Superman, he chooses revenge directly here and forces Superman to make choice, shortly thereafter, in terms of dealing finally with Zod's choice of actions.At the end of a superhero movie or any movie that ends with destruction, its always nice to find a moral conundrum or denouement like this.So overall Man of steel was a very good, solid starting point for DC/Warner's for future Superman projects and exploring the DC universe, beyond Batman. Now if we can just repair Green Lantern and for a REAL challenge there's an Amazonian warrior who's been cooling her heels for a while now.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was backed with great writers, actors ( Michael Shannon being one of my favourites) but the director was a definite issue. Although i enjoy most of Snyder's work (mainly 300), I think his weakest side is his story telling, which Man of Steel relies heavily on. He focuses too much on the aesthetics of the film, neglecting the build up of the story. What really saved this movie from being a disaster for me was that the acting was pretty good. With the overall hype behind this film I just didn't think it lived up to its reputation.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a must watch in the cinemas. Being a big fan of Superman my views might be a bit biased. I certainly enjoyed this film much more than Avengers and Iron Man 3. Loved the cinematography by Amir Mokri the shaky footage makes everything feel so much more real in 3d I actually forgot I was sitting in a theater for a major part of the film!!! It has become a common sight now watching earth getting destroyed but they are surely getting better at it every time :) The VFX was incredible. The film is a visual delight. The scene when Clark dawns the Superman costume for the first time and flies It just blows you away The film is more of action than emotion. The emotional scenes could have been done way way better. The story writing and dialog was weak in that department, the only disappointment in the film. Kevin Costner's act of Jonathan Kent was a very forgettable one. Lois Lane was the biggest turn off in the film they surely could have cast someone better than Amy Adams!!! The chemistry between Charles and Lois was in the negative. Russell Crowe as Jor El gave a magnificent performance. Henry Cavill also did a good job. I was not impressed by Michael Shannon (General Zod), his act at more than one place felt artificial. The score by Hans Zimmer as always was delightful and very successful in creating all the thrills.But ultimately it was the action that takes the film to a whole new level, keeps you glued to the screen. The concept of superman not being invincible throughout the film keeps the suspense alive. If you love action, Man of Steel film is delicious dessert for your eyes. Had Christopher Nolan directed this film instead of Zack Snyder the film would have been even greater than what it already is.All said and done, I am surely going to the cinemas to watch the Man of Steel in action. Again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

When the movie came out, initially I had... mixed feelings, on one hand I liked the modern take on the story, on the other hand I feel Snyder scarified some of Superman's best known attributes, after watching the film at least 3 times now, I can say I enjoy more than I did when it first came out, Man of Steel is not a bad movie, in fact is pretty entertaining, like I said, the movie's new story is great, a pretty good modern re-imagining of the character, Hans Zimmer score is magnificent, Henry Cavil was a pretty good choice for the last son of Krypton, in fact, most of the cast is pretty great and the action scenes are great, we never saw Superman fighting like this before on the big screen, however, the film still has some glaring flaws, for starters, the third act, no, I'm not going to complain about the destruction (That argument is just... overdone), but I do think the final battle could have been... maybe 15 minutes shorter or so, also I never liked Snyder's color palettes, I get he is trying to make a more gritty Superman movie but seriously, is just kinda silly how it seems like the sun never touches Metropolis, specially since Superman gets his powers from... you know, the sun. Overall Man of Steel is still a pretty enjoyable movie, the did a good job modernizing the story and we saw Superman fighting on the big screen, however the overlong final battle and the color palettes of the movie are a few complains that hold the movie a bit from being amazing in my opinion.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And with the usual critics-know-about-everything-nothing-is-good- to-me reviews the chances of be confused about this are increasing. As high as the expectations were raised after trailers, i have to tell you that you will not disappointed with this movie. Is different in many ways to the usual superhero movies but is a solid product that fits in what you expect from this kind of film. Nice references to previous movies are well executed and new plot additions are well received too. As you can expect from a Zack Snyder movie, there are several scenes that try to resemble graphic novel arts and in my opinion are very well made. Some of the nicest things about this movie is the way they made the fast moving scenes. The most of them (unfortunately i can't say all of them) look very realistic according laws of physics, the CGI are so well made that you wish that development for many movies you seen before. The movements are what you expect if such kind of people exist in reality. About the plot, i believe this is the more controversial point of what i see in reviews across the internet. Most moviegoers like it a lot, but are critics the ones ( not all of them) that are giving mixed reviews. What you realize is that critics expect another Dark Knight but this movie is not looking to be a darker one of your beloved Superman. If you are smart enough to understand that this is ANOTHER hero you will be happy with the story. If you are looking for a fourth darker than Batman movie for sure you will agree with critics giving bad reviews. This is a Superman movie and in that scenario this is a very good one.The movie has some flaws to me for sure ( i don't know about a perfect movie) but i will not comment about that as i believe everyone need to discover by themselves what - if any- dislike for their preferences. In summary this is a super hero movie that even Marvel fans will appreciate as is giving a whole new level to a classic story, turning the most beloved hero in an actual hero and mixing a great graphic novel specialist with great digital artists to give you a full action packed movie that make a good foundations for sequels.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

That is another superhero with red cloak and black hair. I prefer, by far, ""Superman returns"" and, off course, Christopher Reeve's first two films. In ""Man of Steel"", the history of Krypton looks like ""Brave New World"" of Aldous Huxley. Clark Kent as a child and as a teenager resembles the one from ""Smallvile"". But where is Clark Kent, the shy journalist? Where is that superhero worried about hurting human beings while fighting the enemy? The only thing I believe this film brought better than all the previous ones is not the way they showed Krypton (I didn't like it very much) or a deeper exploration of Kal-El's personality (I expected this but I didn't see it), but Faora-Ul, a nice character (better than Ursa, the female partner of Zod in Superman II).Therefore, this is not a bad film, but it isn't a movie true to the character, and that is not due to the revisionist uniform (which I also disliked). I expected much more of Zack Snyder, who brilliantly directed the fabulous ""Watchmen"".","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This science fiction masterpiece is unlike any other comic book based origin film before it. It's an alien first contact story starring, arguably America's most iconic character... Superman. Zack Snyder crafts an action packed journey that goes to the far reaches of space, to the grounded realism of Earth and goes full steam ahead like a locomotive, into a gripping invasion. I'm consistently appreciative of the film's subtle details which give the world's environments more weight (e.g. Clark's eyes glowing, revealing veins when he uses heat vision or the dirt and debris floating around him before boosting into flight). This movie removed the old shackles from the character of Superman and presented him with a world where he had to prove his worth in the eyes of humanity. A world where he had to choose to either save the citizens of his adopted home world or protect the legacy of his species. All of these layers make for a truly compelling tale. For those reasons, I think this film will withstand the test of time and go on to become more appreciated for the attempt to create cinema as opposed to its peers/rivals more throwaway, cookie cutter fair. Within the realm of comic book movies, there's nothing quite like Man of Steel. There may never be anything else quite like it again, for a very long time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Read this and see why they're all wrong!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816078/?ref_=tt_urv","olivercalveley","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25738381/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2013","I loved it Bloody loved it.You should ignore some of the negative reviews – crying and moaning about how it isn't staying true to his routes. 'He's too serious and not witty enough' 'He kills his enemies' 'Him and Lois Lane have no spark' 'Why is it dark?' 'He's trying to be troubled like Batman, he has no reason to be! He's superman!'Firstly they gotta get with the times – ever since Nolan's Batman our generation craves 'dark' takes on franchises. We don't want to see that 1978 cheesy Superman that all these negative review dweebs bang on about. It wouldn't do well now old timersSecondly here's what I have to say about them bitching about Superman himself:'Too serious/not witty/troubled/morally unlike the Superman everyone knows' – He has reason to be more messed up than Batman He happens to have a very very troubled background, his whole race has been wiped out for gods sake! Including his parents (his dad is awesomely played by Russell Crowe BTW - brings a hint of Maximus Decimus Meridius to the table). The fact that this is an origin story, means that he is getting used to his powers, experiences are moulding him into who he is and basically he's not perfect. He's still becoming Superman, not quite there yet but he's certainly trying his darnedest. Yes allies and civilians did die in the process and he himself does commit the act of murder however he had no other choice and he couldn't do anything about the poor civvies. Oh and there were definitely moments of wittiness, a $12,000,000 dollar accident rings a bell. 'No relationship between him and Lois Lane' - I don't even have to answer this cause when you see it, there definitely is.Things I love about itThe soundtrack it was awesome – quite subtle in the backgroundno stand out tune that you could walk out the cinema and sing whilst pretending to be superman but an awesome soundtrack nonetheless. It reminded me of an 80's sci-fi film like blade-runner or Terminator maybe alien/aliens. They had these like key-board scores that would give the future sounding effect Think of the terminator scenes where one of the main characters narrates about the apocalyptic future, there's the kind of the effect I'm talking about. Always very recognisable – like if you closed your eyes and listened you'd think of a sci-fi film. But it was like tailored to modern effect – so sounded clean and well done. Really enjoyed it, made me skin tingle. Well done Zimmer.The look of the film itself Beautiful scenery especially in space/Crypton. The costumes were epic. It had a very Aliens/Prometheus feel about it – so you could tell Snyder was clearly influenced by Ridley Scott there.I personally thought Superman was very easy to warm too. You loved the guy. Wouldn't want him as a close mate though cause he's too up himself about doing the right thing.The scale of destruction in the film – wiped out skyscrapers etc, smashed everything to pieces in a 3 mile radius. And I loved how people actually died in it, you actually see them getting owned. You don't often see this in Super-hero films. Nice change ;)It was shot in a very indie way – like he's an adult but throughout the film it reverts to game changing events in his lifetime. And the camera always has like a dark lens – to give it a sort of vintage effect. However there was a certain shot that Snyder liked to use that cheapened it a little for me. It's that shot were you see something approaching from a distance – and then suddenly the camera zooms in at a startling pace and next thing you're looking right at the object. The cameras all shaky as if it's being affected by the force of it. Don't know if you know what I'm talking about. But yeah I hate that shot, mainstream movies like to use it. Snyder was hard for it. Annoyed me.General Zod – This guy was awesome too – Michael Shannon nailed him. Loved his look and his perspective on things. He would do anything to carry on the Crypton race Anything. I compare him to a fanatic in the crusades. What he was doing was god's work. He has a divine belief. He was right. Not afraid of death as his fate is in god's hands. Nothing more dangerous than a fanatic Cant reason with that guy.Action scenes – Epic action, EPIC. Literally on the edge of my seat, stress sweating too. Very good.Yeah so there we go – it's the Superman for our generation – a reinvention. People who review this based on the old Superman are fools – cause it's a different take. Plus again he's not quite the superman people know, as the guy's learning.Go see it, it's amazing.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The others are humans first and the superhero is their alter-ego. Kal-El (Superman's real name) is an alien/ superhero first and Clark Kent is his alter-ego, or more importantly he models his human character on how he perceives a human being.Man of Steel commences from the birth of Kal-El and how is parents Jor- El and Lara, send him away from their Planet Krypton, before it is destroyed. Most of us have grown up reading Superman comics and watching Christopher Reeve (the original Superman from the series of 4 movies) play the part and know the story by heart of how superman was born and the journey of a child with super human strength from a baby to a savior of mankind. This movie however for the first time has gone in-depth tracing the origins of Superman and not only his birth but how the transformation and adaptation came about. The attention to these details seems to have dragged the movie a little to the point of sometimes being boring.There are interesting points in the life of Superman highlighted and shot well, but the plot bounces around a lot from current day to flashbacks demanding a lot of focus and attention from the viewer. Every time I watch a superhero movie, I feel the high point is the grand entrance (preferably saving a damsel or human in distress) which makes you wants to clap and whistle. Somehow, the makers of this movie failed on that front. The human connect is almost non-existent, barring the scene where Clark Kent as a kid rescues a school bus (which was kind of cool), & his interactions with his Dad and Lois Lane. Man of Steel comes across more like a sci-fi movie rather than a superhero trying to save the world. The build-up to the character seems to have been the focus in the first half, which will keep you riveted, but the second half disappoints with the not-so-required action sequences.Full marks to the special effects team for creating worlds beyond imagination, at times I was wondering men creating these concepts must be thinking way beyond any normal human's realms of imagination. Zack Snyder created the cult epic 300 and I was really impressed with his take on Superman. Having to break the mould of so many past movies, TV series, printed comics takes courage and conviction and one thing I would like to tell Mr. Snyder, this one by far is my favorite superman, who looks and acts the part. The sequels to Man of Steel should be the ones to watch out for now.Henry Cavill with his tough body, boy next door looks and intense eyes fits well into the part of a confused but strong individual. Cavill depicts the inner turmoil which Superman would have gone through with a terrific performance and ironically, a man of steel who can emote. Now that he has arrived, Superman is here to stay and only Cavill can do justice to the character.Amy Adams as Lois Lane does her part as a journalist pretty effectively, but she is not as hot as we had always presumed Lois to be. Her character has been carefully written and she gets lots of opportunities to shine in an otherwise one man film. This movie is an ensemble of great actors like Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne & Diane Lane, all of whom have small parts. Kevin Costner impresses in his small role of Jonathan Kent (Superman's earth father) especially in his interactions with Clark, the rest however did not get the screen space to make a mark. Michael Shannon as General Zod is menacing and a worthy villain to Superman with his towering personality. The young Cooper Timberline as the 9 year old Clark gets a meaty role and does complete justice to it with his surprisingly realistic performance.Now that Man of Steel is here to stay on our planet I am hoping the subsequent plots would revolve more around and his arch nemeses Lex Luthor. Even though my rating would be a 3/5, I would suggest you go and watch the evolution of the first and the original superhero.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In many areas it is simply amazing.The Hans Zimmer (w Junkie XL) score is a perfect match for the drama and the suspense at multiple points... Especially in the 3rd act , the music truly drives the emotion and ties you into what amazing things you see before you.The cinematography is first rate-- from wide shots that quickly establish the scope of scene (the northern pole for example) to tight shots showing the raw emotion of the characters. It really is a beautiful movie... Some would say the images are too cool, too blue-- but I disagree. There are moments where the characters are in the sun shining -- those purposefully contrast the darkness of some scenes .The cast is stellar-- Costner, Lane, Fishburne, Miloni are fantastic in their roles. Antje True is a scene stealer! Cavill is a believable Superman and truly a hero on screen.... Mid way though the picture, I found myself not watching an actor in costume but watching Superman-- that's high praise from someone who grew up w the Reeves films. Oddly Any Adams seems out of place in the role of Lois Lane.... She is an amazing actress, but she just seems off in her delivery. Perhaps it's the lines she's given.In any case, it's a great movie-- it's most glaring flaw?? It was one movie that set up as the first in a never completed trilogy. The sequel became a launch pad for the now abandoned DCEU and we never get to see the Cavill Superman in full glory. The film ends with hope and sunlight of a coming film-- but the story is never completed.If you haven't seen this film or it's been a bit...

On many fronts, it was close to what it should have been. The story was much more logical with reasoning given for almost each and every event. Character of Superman was much better developed and well portrayed by Henry Cavill. This is the best Superman with much more Emotion and ""Dare-Not-Mess-With-Me"" attitude.The only flaw with the movie is the presence of the name 'Christopher Nolan' because his presence inadvertently draws this movie to a comparison with his previous works and more importantly all time great 'Dark Knight Trilogy'. MoS is definitely worth comparing with that Epic. Having said that, I do not think it is a fault on the side of Nolan or Snyder but with the character Superman itself.Batman is a far more darker and intriguing character from the inception whereas Superman is an (almost superficial) embodiment of Morals and Righteousness. It is this basic difference between the two Subjects which has (and I guess always will) fail a Superman movie.In spite of everything, I enjoyed the movie. The no-bars-held action sequences were a bit too much to digest and thus felt unrealistic but I think this scale of destruction is the best possible way to portray Superman's superhuman abilities and powers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Who the hell made that decision in WB? What an idiot !! Cavill looks the least like Superman out of all the others. The storyline to Man of Steel was atrocious. A wishy washy back and forth story between present and past with vast action scenes and a storyline that probably took half a day to cook up. Jonathan Kent dies in a hurricane whilst Clark stands by and watches - that's new! They obviously didn't wanna give him the traditional heart attack then. Since when does Superman have a beard and since when does he become a drifter travelling the country going from job to job. Clark locates a spaceship and flys it where he then meets Jor-El who then gives him his Superman suit to which he then has a quick shave, gets into the suits and learns how to fly in 97 seconds. Jor-El gets stabbed by Zod whilst Lara dies alone when Krypton blows up. Superman DOES NOT KILL. I've mentioned that already right! Clark lives on earth for 33 years and takes that long to learn his powers. Zod comes along and does it in 1 day. I laughed like hell when Lois turned up at the train station just before Superman killed Zod. Has she got super powers too? She seemed to know every location he was going to land/crash and meet him there? Maybe he was texting her?! Superman had the choice of throwing Zod or flying up with him in order to prevent death to that family but NO - Superman decides to break Zods neck - and I'm supposed to let my kid see this movie? This movie should have been shot in sequence. The back and forth flashbacks got boring after the 84th one. All the buildings get demolished but yet Clark starts for work at the very untouched Daily Planet soon after he destroyed Metropolis. God knows how many people Superman killed when he flew Zod through all those buildings killing half the city. The first half of this movie tries to set the tone whilst the second half is just CGI. The movie has no real storyline. Snyder wanted to make a masterpiece and in my opinion failed in a big way. His ego was clearly writing cheques his body couldn't cash. I'm convinced that he was smoking weed whilst directing the majority of this pile of sh*t movie. Richard Donner & Bryan Singer done a MUCH better job. How does Clark end up meeting Lois Lane, reviling his identity and later getting a job at the Daily Planet? Where can they go with the separate romance between Superman and Lois whilst Clark remains a third character. What more can I say? Shite acting, depressing soundtrack, zero humour, most of the movie shot in CGI, terrible storyline, no character, no heart, etc etc etc etc etc...........This movie was made to make $$$$$ because it certainly wasn't made for true Superman fans. This movie was awful and that's not an opinion! I could watch all the other Superman movies again. Will I ever watch Man of Steel again? LOL !! Enough said !!! I give this film 1/10 only because I'm a generous kind fella. All I really want is my money back and to erase my memory of this diabolical disappointment.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

From the beginning when I read that Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer was the team hired to remake superman, I was excited. I loved Snyder's adaption of Watchmen (2009) and of course admired Nolan's trilogy for The Dark Knight. So I knew that this movie was going to be epic and IT WAS! Despite what these idiotic critics say this film was incredible. They gave life to this realistic superman. They showed more of the man and what it meant for him to grow into his human side. Though the beginning of the film did move at a fast paced, it was all worth the rush with what the action sequences brought and they were mind blowing, powerful fights. Kevin Costner and Michael Shannon gave great performances worth watching. Amy Adams version of Lois Lane was at its best and as for Henry Cavill, he is this generations superman and should be right there next to Christopher Reeve. This movie to me is the movie of the year hands down. A must see film. RJ's Rating: 3 & 1/2 Stars","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Despite the fact that he is easily the most iconic superhero in history, it seems he has fallen out of the public eye in the last decade because he simply hasn't had a movie that nails exactly why we should care about him. By this point the most famous superheroes have made their big screen ventures and sadly 2005′s ""Superman Returns"" failed to capture the imagination or leave much of an impact on audiences. Just when things began looking bleak for the boy scout, ""The Dark Knight"" director Christopher Nolan was brought on as producer to reinvent the character in ways we've never seen before. Does Man of Steel bring Superman to a new generation with brilliance, or is this just the latest outing in a string of lukewarm attempts to bring back the last son of Krypton?Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-rV","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

A superhero who is complete in each and every respect. Sadly never has any of his movies been the biggest. Finally Superman gets a movie he deserves. Man of Steel is totally worth it. It has a hero who is alien yet human. Who is invincible, has emotions, feels human love and yet is the flag bearer of his race. A villain who is as big as the hero. Sometimes you feel for the villain as well. The story takes us to the beginning and has every ingredient to make a die hard superhero fanatic happy, very happy. The action sequences are awe inspiring, best that I have ever seen. 3D is not all that great and the shaky camera kind of irritates at times. Not withstanding the movie is pure Superman from start to finish. We see him in all his glories, his powers and his evolution from Kal L to Clark Kent to Superman. The background score is fantastic and the final 40 minutes are some of the best action you will ever see. And those complaining of not much humor, boys this ain't the tin man. This is the Man, SuperMan sans that red undergarment. And for those asking, Henry Cavill looks nearly as good as Chris Reeve.9.5/10.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Goyer'A young itinerant worker is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage when Earth is invaded by members of his race.'After the success of the Dark Knight Trilogy, I couldn't have been more excited about Christopher Nolan on board with a Superman film. I was disappointed that he wasn't directing but I don't believe it hurt the story but other categories suffered.As I pointed out earlier, I was disappointed that Christopher Nolan wasn't directing this film but Zack Snyder's efforts can't be ignored. His vision in this film was great. I found this superhero film different than others I've seen in the past. The story is much more definitive and the characters are much more expanded than in other superhero genre films. it wasn't hard to follow the story and I loved how the audience got to see much more of Krypton than in other Superman films. But saying all that, this film has one big important flaw and that is the CGI usage. It's as if the first half of the film is dedicated to the story then the other half is all action/CGI with barely any new information given to the audience. It depresses me to see that a lot of new superhero films are taking the massive CGI efforts, examples include the Avengers, Amazing Spider-Man and Iron man Trilogy. This point and this point only is why I would have preferred Christopher Nolan directing than Snyder because Nolan despises CGI and is always creating new sets and designs to avoid such thing.There's not much to say about the acting in this film because 75% of it is action. But the actors did do well with what they were given. Henry Cavill not only looked like the best physically formed Superman in film but you could really feel his loneliness through the screen. I was very impressed with the skills of this man. I was always a big fan of Michael Shannon since 'Revolutionary Road' in which he gave an academy award winning performance if it wasn't for Heath Ledger challenging that year but he didn't disappoint me in this picture as well. He really gave the character attitude and could truly see that he had no remorse in his plans and had so much love for his home planet and fellow beings. Great character and great performance. Amy Adams is a great actress and I am always impressed with her work and she did live up to her reputation in this film but her hair ruined her performance. Since when was Lois Lane a red head? That would be like turning Mary Jane from 'Spider-Man' into a brunette. Lois Lane is legendary as a very strong and independent brunette. I didn't particularly enjoy the look of the character but Amy Adams did great with what she had to work with.Without even looking at the credits, you can notice that Hans Zimmer did the score of this film. The music throughout has such a similarity with 'The Dark Knight' trilogy but with a little twist at it's side. It's a little brighter and it's as if it more adrenaline. It works very well with the action scenes and the score also works very well with the dramatic scenes as well. Hans Zimmer is submerging into the new 'John Williams' of this era. Very well done Hans.The CGI used in this film nearly destroyed it in my opinion. I prefer realism and using the camera and actions of the actors to portray the art on the screen. It seems like things are only getting worse and soon we won't even need actors anymore. But luckily this film had a great story and great actors to go along with on the ride. A must see and one of the best films of the summer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What people saw in trailers saw nothing, the film has a lot more the trailers did not show, which is how it is suppose to be. Man of Steel like The Dark Knight raised the bars for superhero movies, again. This is the most different Superman take than any other movie, cartoon, game, or any of such, this is a fresh story for Superman.Similar to The Dark Knight, this movie is indeed dark. However, its a dark setting, environment, and tone, with a bright hope leading character that sheds light into the darkness of the film. There is a lot of action in the movie, jaw dropping incredible action, the special effects were out of this world. Story starts of as a biopic of Superman, then later reveals the major plot in the movie. All actors/actresses play their roles best. You don't get many films with both good story and graphics, it's always one of each, you have both in this film.Henry Cavill's Superman is at the level of Christopher Reeve (RIP) and Brandon Routh. Cavill was great, majestic, and comical as how Superman is suppose to be. Amy Adam's Lois Lane needed more screen time but she was portrayed almost as how Lois is in the comics. Russell Crowe's Jor- El is an excellent heir to Marlon Brando (RIP), he was significant. Everyone, from Costner, Lane, Traue, Lennix, Meloni, and Fishburne were amazing to their roles. A very special comment to Michael Shannon's General Zod. In all honesty, he stole the whole movie, General Zod became a new icon in this movie like how Terence Stamp first made Zod an icon in Superman II (1980). General Zod was a more interesting character than Superman. Why? He's an antagonist with a purpose, he can be sympathies with. For a villain he wasn't so evil as people expected, he was more of a dictator. Personally at one point of the film, I was rooting for Zod during his fight with Superman cause he was that good!Man of Steel broke few Superman traditions, but kept the soul purpose of the character and story alive. The flaws would be that its darker than Nolan's Batman, the movie felt pretty rushed and fast, and some comic fans will be pleased to some of the changes, but as a comic fan myself, its a realistic take on Superman so I am fine with it. This is an epic incredible movie. I would still get goosebumps watching it again and be blown away. Go watch it, enjoy it, love it, and please praise it, Man of Steel deserves it. As a major comic fan, this is one of the best treats for the hero that inspired almost all superheroes today.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's hard to top a man who can fly, zap things with his eyeballs, see through walls, move faster than a speeding bullet, jump over buildings, survive just about everything, and live for centuries. On film, the Man of Steel has been treated with varying degrees of class and cheese — Richard Donner's films are iconic in themselves, and Bryan Singer's film has its moments. Given the success of The Dark Knight trilogy, it was only inevitable that filmmakers would try to put a more earnest, serious, heavy-weight spin on the saga of Superman.Unfortunately, this is still not a perfect adaptation. Many critics and film-goers have written this film off as stylistically gaudy, crammed-full of gargantuan action scenes with one too many camera zooms and shakes and a wonky narrative. It has become the biggest love-it-or-hate-it film of 2013.I, for one, love the film, despite all its excesses and problems. The action continuously blows me away — its sheer scope and velocity blows most other superhero films out of the water. It's relentless as superpowered characters slam into each other at rocketing speeds, blasting entire city blocks in their wake. In some of the most gut-wrenching scenes, alien machines pummel huge parts of Metropolis to a flattened ruin. It is rather exhausting, but this is the spectacle I always wanted out of Superman: an epic and highly-destructive clash of menacing, otherworldly forces.A lot of the film's momentum can be attributed to its narrative, which is purposefully mixed-up so that it doesn't waste that much time covering old ground. The relevant parts of Superman's origins are covered in flashbacks inserted at key moments. This does create a jarring shift that may throw viewers off, but I feel the pacing is perfect — the drama never overstays its welcome. What really matters are the characters, which are at their strongest. The film intimately explores the title character, not only through the snippets of the origin story, but also in exploring him as an outcast full of emotional vulnerabilities. The film shows what he learns from living among humans, the importance of moral strength and moderation, and his struggle to find his place in the world. There are also some deviations that I think benefit the story (Lois Lane is no longer a total ditz, General Zod has phenomenal motivation that makes him a villain to sympathize with, and there are no more silly games being played with secret identities).There are still a few nitpicks that even I can't shake off, however. I never did get used to the notion that Superman can be seen as a threat to humanity (perhaps because I've been spoiled by the older films, where Superman saves people and is cheered — here, he saves people and gets into trouble). The fate of Jonathan Kent is a rather manipulative scene that I feel is quite daft. The most critical viewers would also make the same complaints as with Zack Snyder's other films: too cold, not enough depth. Although I can understand the same complaints for Sucker Punch and Watchmen, I feel that Man of Steel is the warmest film Zack Snyder has made to date. It does succeed in achieving the right level of pathos to make the audience care for the main character (something that other Snyder films always struggled with).As mentioned before, the photography can be rather gaudy, with frequent use of zooms, some camera shaking, and some scenes with bright flashing lights. Personally, I never found it all that problematic — most of the film still looks pretty solid, and I think the drama scenes boast some of the best shots, with intimate close-ups of specific characters and objects. Editing is pretty interesting, for better or for worse. Acting is a surprising treat: I think Henry Cavill is superb as the title character, and everybody else is pretty decent. Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe steal the show repeatedly — Shannon is especially menacing and intense, for perfect effect. I appreciate Amy Adams' and Diane Lane's performances. Didn't mind Kevin Costner — I can take or leave Laurence Fishburne playing Perry White. For some reason, I'm enamored by Antje Traue playing Faora — she's wicked and intense enough to put Ursa from Superman II to shame. Writing gets the job done — there are some good lines, but some of it feels rather blunt to me. This production has great-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales — it's especially cool how organic and unique all the Kryptonian technology looks. Special effects are plentiful, some looking phenomenal and others looking a little too glossy or cartoony. Hans Zimmer's score, much like the film itself, has been criticized for being too much shallow noise, but I personally love the music for its simple themes and powerful spirit.In fact, that pretty much sums up my stance on Man of Steel: it's noisy, but I still find it moving. It may not be a perfect film, but it does pack a heck of a punch in many ways. It has power not only in the action scenes (of which there is plenty), but also in the characters and their struggles to find strength and a place in the world.5/5","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The fight scenes were exciting but after awhile they started to feel very repetitive. The fight scenes also made Superman seem anything but super to me, which is my biggest problem with the movie.

Yes, the tone is dark and brooding. It's merely a different take on the Superman character. I don't feel Zack Snyder is going all ""Dark Knight"" on us with this version. His vision of Krypton and Clark growing up on earth is fantastic. I also love how the story is told through flashbacks instead of a linear timeline.
The special effects are fantastic, and I think the score is one of my favorite superhero scores of all time.
The movie is perfectly cast. Henry Cavill is the first actor, IMO, that looks like he stepped off the pages of a comic book. He, along with Chris Hemsworth, look like they were made for their roles.

"6","/10","DC Comics has no idea how to build a universe, and despite some shortcomings, Man of Steel passes; though not with flying colors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817574/?ref_=tt_urv","leecjaster","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24281952/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2013","In reviewing Man of Steel, I have to divulge a few biases that will help everyone immensely in deciding whether or not to check out the Zack Snyder/Christopher Nolan take on the comic book icon.I do not — repeat — do not have a problem with origin stories or integral details to the Superman character (as presented in the comics) to be changed. This goes for any of the recent Marvel adaptations which are slowly allowing auteurs to grab hold of a vision and go, taking the reigns and creating far, far better films than would have been possible with a studio puppet behind the cameras.Man of Steel takes a lot of liberties. There are a lot of key points that have become part of the Superman lexicon than are absent from Snyder's vision. To this reviewer, it was a welcome break of tradition to bring Superman into this generation.What Man of Steel gets right makes it (hopefully) the start of a series of films with Henry Cavill and Snyder working in tandem. Cavill is fantastic as not only Superman, but Kal-el and Clark Kent. The three roles are clearly separated in the narrative, as Cavill is given a wide spectrum of emotions to play upon. Who is he? Is he alien? Human? A god? A farm-boy from Kansas?Man of Steel hits full gear when the plot is dealing with the struggle for Superman to find an identity. The script, written by David S. Goyer, has the feel of The Dark Knight Rises — for better and for worse.There are epic choices that will shape Superman's growth in this universe. It's a great jumping off point for the franchise (and hopefully a similar-in-style Justice League film), but it has the same holes the The Dark Knight Rises did. Frankly, the dialog is laughable at points. Partly due to the fact that DC has chosen to be a strictly ""no- fun"" zone, whereas Marvel is happy to provide levity in its universe. This leaves DC dark and gritty, which requires better dialog than, ""You're a monster Zod, and I'm going to stop you."" (Maybe it's a mid- west thing?)Instead of having to endure Brandon Routh attempting to be attracted to Kate Bosworth (which should be a feat for no man, let alone a Superman), we're treated to Amy Adams and Henry Cavill ready to get ""under the cape"" from the opening glances. It's a palpable chemistry that appears to be completely organic, and completely unforced by the script. It's a bright, unexpected spot in the grim world that Snyder & Co. have created.On the acting front, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are absolute treats. Shown through a series of flashbacks, these provide touching moments to the character that is Superman, pulled between two worlds. The central core of each of Superman's fathers' teachings is love and destiny. There's empowerment in these words, and an honesty that Goyer should be praised on. The dialog here works like magic in he hands of Crowe and Costner.The one mild disappointment is with Michael Shannon. No, his performance is worthy, but it's thin. General Zod is played slightly more ambiguous that he should have been. In fact, with Cavill's performance being so varied and conflicted, the only character who seems to have any real confidence are Crowe's Jor-el, and Adams's Louise Lane. Imagine Batman Begins without Liam Neeson's final few scenes, which would have left Ra's Al Ghul a bit of a polarizing, morally-debatable villain. The final scenes rounded out him as a nemesis to Batman, and the protagonist's growth is that much more focused. Shackled by some hack dialog in key moments, Shannon's Zod is lost in internal conflict, and we never get the cinematic payoff the audience deserves in a Superman/Zod showdown.OverallIt's all there — Zimmer's score, Snyder's stingingly beautiful CGI vision, Nolan's Machiavellian antagonist against the outcast protagonist, and Goyer's hit-and-miss dialog — and it passes, barely.If you're a hardcore fan of Superman, you have to see this in the theaters, regardless of your view of augmenting the gospel. Casual fans of Superman and Snyder's work will feel right at home, along with those who have generally enjoyed Nolan's Dark Knight saga. More than anything, that nagging feeling of what the trailers promised is going to sit with you for a few days after, in the same way a few of the scenes feel like moving works of art will — a high compliment to Snyder's growth visually. He's more tasteful and polished than he was with Watchman and 300.Man of Steel barely breaks the sound barrier, but it breaks it; and the idea of seeing two or three more films with this Man of Steel, well, it'll keep audiences flying high.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After about the 7th TV spot I felt like I had pretty much seen the whole movie already and as it turns out, I had. All the best moments had been spoilt for me. But despite all that I really, really wanted to love this movie, when they first announced it would be Zack Snyder directing and Chris Nolan producing my head practically exploded with excitement. The dream team I thought to myself, Snyder's eye for epic, super powered action sequences and Nolan's dramatic, grounded story telling. How could this possibly fail? Well not that it failed exactly, but I certainly wasn't totally blown away in the fashion that I was sure I would be. Obviously my impression is massively tainted by the sky high level of anticipation I had for this film, but to be fair I was in the same state of mind when I saw The Dark Knight in the cinema and I walked away from that experience having had my high expectations absolutely blown through the roof, with Man of Steel however I left feeling just slightly mehNow having said all that I will say that this is easily the best Superman movie to date, it totally blows the rest of them out of the water. The action scenes, as we've all seen from the trailers, are the truest depiction of Superman's true power and the other great strength of the movie is the relationship between Clark and Lois, which is absolutely nailed this time. But other than that I found it pretty hard to care about a lot of the other characters. I wasn't overly impressed with Zod as I thought I would be, a lot of the obvious dramatic moments fell flat for me and a lot of the movie really felt by the numbers and predictable.They actually gave most of the best sequences to Faora and she displayed most of the best moments of Kryptonian abilities, shockingly I found myself more interested in watching her than I was in Superman. I was sure this was to set up Supes in the last act to start truly kicking some ass but no, the flip never happened. Obviously Superman wins but not in any spectacular fashion, he just sort of wins.In the final showdown Zod asks the appropriate question, if he was born and trained to be a warrior and on Earth he has all the same powers as Kal-El than what chance does he; a farm boy realistically have? And there is no answer for this question proposed. There real question then becomes why did they have that line in there when it's only purpose is to make the audience say to themselves, Yeah Zod really should have won.That's just one of the little things that really irked me, and the point is if I'm taking the time to actually pick that apart and get annoyed by it then the movie's not doing something right. Man of Steel is movie with serious ups and downs and unfortunately did not live up to the hype that surrounded it and having now had some time to analyse it I really don't know if there's anything DC can do to bridge the ever expanding gap between themselves and Marvel. And unfortunately for all the fans out there dreaming of a Justice League movie to knock Avengers off the top spot, this really doesn't bode well for it. To be fair if Man of Steel had dropped before any of the Marvel stuff had been set in motion I probably would have looked far more favourably upon it, but it didn't. And the landscape for comic book movies has changed so much in the last few years it feels like DC will forever be lagging behind which is really unfortunate.I don't want to end on such a down note, so I will say that there is the definite possibility for a successful Man of Steel sequel but I think there has to be a major change up, lose Zack Snyder.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie actually seems to get better and better on subsequent re-watching, it's a truly fantastic re-telling of the Superman story we all know but given a sci-fi update to tie it all together. Everything now makes logical sense! Clark wasn't simply sent to Earth to save him, there's a greater purpose. Zod and his followers now have a solid reason for their actions beyond mere revenge which ties in with the plans of Clark's father, and their escape is no longer random but is linked to the fate of Krypton and the modifications they saw Clark's father had made to his own ship. Even the fortress of solitude is re-imagined here as a crashed Kryptonian vessel and becomes pivotal to the plot. This may be the first version of Superman that can stand on its own as not just a superhero movie but also a logically consistent sci-fi tale with a satisfying journey for the lead characters. Yes it has great action scenes, but what's between those scenes holds up very well too.Actually I think maybe I do understand why at least some of the negative reviewers had a hard time with the movie - simply, it isn't Superman 1978. For some fans there's only one way to tell a story, and ""their"" Superman is a fully fledged superhero before he ever fights another Kryptonian. He is never forced to make the decision Clark does at the end of this movie because... I guess the plot should just shield him from that?!I can't imagine anything more dull than remaking the same story for the umpteenth time, passing up all opportunities to explore what the character would have done if things had developed just a little differently. That's where Man of Steel really shines. This isn't Christopher Reeve's Superman who had the benefit of of a relatively easy introduction to the superhero business, this is a Superman who is still fighting against his own destiny as a result of his Earthly father's warnings when he's suddenly thrust into the role. It's absolutely still Superman, but given a new twist that really helps with the character's depth and journey. It's just a shame that the subsequent DC movies didn't live up to this fantastic start.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So after reading at least 15 reviews and speaking to at least 10 people asking how the movie was, I ventured to see it in the 2nd week.What I got was Superman's tale in Nolan style similar to Batman but a bit too long....at least 15 mins.The movie starts well and visuals are breath taking. The scenes between Jor-Al and Kal-Al and Clarke and Jonathan and Martha are well written and executed. However, once the action starts , the movie loses steam. The action scenes and sequences are too long and confusing. I got restless after one pt of time and waiting for the movie to end. As my cousin said and I wholly agreed with him, 15 mins too long.What saves the movie is the star cast. Nolan gets the casting perfect. Everyone from Cavill to Fishburne have done justice to their roles. Special mention to Lane's performance as Martha.I'm waiting for the sequel.

Zack Snyder brings the joy and hopefulness of the character to life throughout multiple scenes in the film that are visually stunning and well acted by Henry Cavill. The standout portrayals are clearly Cavill, as well as Crowe (who plays Jor-El) and Shannon who has a take on General Zod that is more sympathetic than one would think.
The action and fight scenes are right out of the comic books and are even five years later still the gold standard for all comic book films. While the film does still have its problems and hindrances with its writing (some characters aren't fleshed out enough and the story isn't well refined) these are easily overlooked by the fact that it is simply too entertaining.
Man of Steel, true to the titular character's nature, stands above all others superhero films and provides an ideal to stride towards.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I know Snyder could make ""Man of Steel"" better, but what I saw after watched the movie. There's not much beauty things in there. Snyder always make a beautiful battle scene just like what he did on 300 and Wathcmen. But in this movie it just too much brutal scene. I think, those buildings are too fragile. They easily broke down and the city are destroyed too much. I know it tells of misery that happens but that not what usually Snyder does. And, Nolan created the story? What's wrong with him. It should be more complex! He is a really great story maker, but at this movie. He seems to lose his power. The story seems to be happens so fast, how Clark easily falling in love with Lois. And the battle seems to be happen in only a day. The CG is normal, well good actually. But I really hoping a beautiful scene, whats wrong with those people. Quite disappointed, but actually ""Man of Steel"" are a good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

(outer) space! So I left it. I tried again a few days later, but alas: the same thing. So I left it for about a week or so and tried yet again. For me, third time really was the charm: I liked this movie quite a lot. I know some of the critics really didn't like it, the same applying to a lot of Superman fans; and as far as the latter goes, I can understand why they would be miffed with some of the casting choices (Amy Adams... a red-head!), and the decision to exclude the red shorts of the hero's costume – I suppose I would feel the same if a book I loved had been adapted for screen and cast someone ""wrong"" as the lead.But personally – and I'm speaking as someone who prefers Batman to Superman, and an Amy Adams fan – I thought the casting was good; I especially thought Henry Cavill did a wonderful job as Clark, and I really can't think of anyone who would've suited the role better. I enjoyed Michael Shannon as Zod, he was sorta kinda subtly, calmly menacing which was fun to watch, and really: apart from the 'physicality' issue, Adams made a pretty good Lois. But then perhaps I really am speaking as a Batman fan here. As for the rest of the cast: Fishburne, Lane, Costner, Traue, Meloni were effective in their respective roles (...and if I am to be completely honest here: Antje Traue was a lot of fun to look at as Faora).My only real problem with this movie was the fight scenes. Because special effects are so evolved it's gonna take a lot more creativity in their implementation to make an exploding building seem anything more than that: an exploding building. And there are a lot of exploding and crumbling buildings in this movie, and not once was I particularly moved or excited. I felt, too, that these scenes were WAY protracted, and the damage done was bordering on ludicrous; I reckoned that at the end of the day, when all was said and done and dusted, there really wouldn't have been much difference if Zod and his world engine had gone on to annihilate earth.But on the whole: a pretty decent superhero / action movie. I felt the characters were all nicely developed, and they did a pretty good job with Kal-El's backstory – I also quite liked the fact that Cavill's Superman was a somewhat darker and sombre incarnation than in previous Superman films. So I reckon if you're not a die-hard, purist fan of Superman (and I say that with respect to those who are), perhaps you could over look the red hair and absent red shorts, and you may just enjoy this movie experience.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So, I made up my mind that I wouldn't bother finishing, though I found Russell Crowe's character excellent. But then my siblings started to watch it, so I thought I would give it a second chance.
And I'm glad I did.
While I didn't get to see the middle, I got to see the climax. And it's freaking awesome! It has great tension, an awesome villain, spectacular special effects (amongst the best I've seen), fantastic musical score. There were several times I thought 'this is the end', but it turned out that there was still more to go. And it doesn't disappoint. Very satisfying.
The acting is top notch and I think the person who does Superman does him wonderfully, possibly perfectly, though I can't judge that as this is the first Superman movie that I've seen and I've never read any of the comics.
Fantastic, fantastic movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I wasted time watching it so I wasn't going to waste any more. But the thing annoyed me so here it is.First of all, if you like action-packed but don't care about a story or about characters you can connect to, then this is perfect.The storyline is more of a dotted line, suggests but doesn't show all the action. You have to guess or assume how things got to a certain place. I hate that. Maybe they wanted to give that graphic novel feel, where the image is meant to say it all. In the case of a film, of this film specifically, it just feels pretentious without adding anything valuable.It's a waste of a good cast, none of the characters draw you in. I know these are good actors so it has to be the way it's put together. If this wasn't about Superman, I guarantee not many people would stay on till the end.And, since I am ""venting"", why do all these films have to be so ""cold""? They use this filter, making everything feel cold and void, hopeless. Aren't superheroes meant to bring hope to the world?!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Unfair to Compare Superman to Dark Knight","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814612/?ref_=tt_urv","kgprophet","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1158617/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","I read a few reviews before seeing this film (yes FILM not video) and saw that many reviewers were faulting it for being too by-the-numbers. I agree about that for the finale, but in actuality my impression was the opposite. The filmmakers were trying their best NOT to be by-the-numbers. I also felt that by design, the marketing of the film was supposed to make you think of The Dark Knight, with Christopher Nolan attached.I think that is a bit unfair. Yes, Superman should be re-invented and more grounded in the real world. But the movie jumps around too quickly for the kind of resonance we are looking for in our origin story. The biggest problem is that the adult Clark doesn't have time to talk and engage with people to humanise him. Compared to the charismatic and playful version of Clark and Lois played by Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, Henry Cavill and Amy Adams are too withdrawn and unhappy. We the audience need to like this guy. And sure, we all get our hearts tugged with the poignant flashbacks to his childhood with his father. But that was the kid, we need to see some resonance with him as an adult. We only get some of that as Clark returns to his mother.But then there is the pacing. The screenplay tries to have the heartfelt moments but be a popcorn movie too. Literally within the moment of finding some sentimentality BAM! something crashes through the walls. Unfortunately, the frenetic editing pace started to remind me of the worst of Michael Bay. Much has also been made about the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer can have his brief moments of grandeur, but most of soundtrack material sounds generic. He can work up the score to give you all the evocative feelings that are happening in the story, but he can't write a memorable melody.The gritty blue-ish tint to the film works well. It did a good job grounding Metropolis as a regular world. Lois Lane seems to just pop up everywhere in the film. She is used unconvincingly to bring peril or a surprise rescue all too conveniently. Her ease of access and involvement in almost every aspect to this story felt manipulative. In general, you get to understand the style of writing in the screenplay, as it was more necessary to come up with another big action scene that include our main characters than it was too justify it. Again, there is an out right goofy moment where Superman surrenders to General Zod. Out of nowhere, they decide to take Lois Lane as well. Why? Lois is everywhere.This kind of story manipulation to give us more popcorn thrills is to the movie's detriment, however, this is more nitpicking than anything. If we take on this franchise reboot on it's own, without the shadow of The Dark Knight clouding over it's expectations, I say we have a very energetic and successful beginning. All the elements needed to wash the bad taste of Superman Returns out of our mouth have succeeded. Just some minor course corrections are needed. Cavill needs to lighten up a bit and try to have some fun once in a while. Lois should have to try a little harder to get in or out of a predicament. And the producers should have a little more faith in telling a story without resorting to yet another building being demolished.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Man of Steel takes a darker and more realistic approach, an epic and great Superhero movie - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4498208/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","6 December 2018","Man of Steel is the first installment in the DC Extended Universe and was directed by Zack Snyder, with a script written by David S. Goyer and a story by him and Christopher Nolan, the latter also producing. In the film, Clark Kent learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet Krypton. He assumes the role of mankind's protector as Superman, making the choice to face General Zod and prevent him from destroying humanity.The Krypton sequence is visually stunning from start to finish, showing a planet so different in technology and well everything but it feels so believable, huge thanks to the production design and direction. The music is what truly makes the sequence, Hans Zimmer's score is incredible and epic.The movie is well cast, they make the characters believable. It has some of my favorite actors in it Like Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Amy Adams and Michael Shannon with lots more. The characters in Man of Steel are my favorites going all the way to my childhood, I grew up with Superman and Batman so this movie will always be among of my favorites. I know they have changed up the story quite a bit but for what it's worth, I like the change as it makes it different than the comics. Henry Cavill is a perfect Superman, with the script and direction he got, he succeeded in bringing a fresh take on the beloved character. Amy Adams was terrific, great acting throughout the whole film. My favorite Lois Lane portrayal to date. Kevin Costner does a great, no, a incredible job with his performance as Jonathan Kent. As a father figure and just excellent acting in every scene. Michael Shannon is Zod, after seeing this film again and again, his performance is one of the many highlights and reasons why I re-watch it so many times. General Zod is a villain but the writing and his performance makes him so realistic and I don't see him as a truly evil man, as he's just a man that's trying to save the remaining of his people which is a pretty good reason but the execution is the evil deeds.Zack Snyder knows how to make great visual movies, but does his style fit with everyone? Far from it, it's a much different tone than example a Marvel movie. Personally I love the tone, themes, pacing and the length of the movie. It's my kind of superhero film. The fight choreography is great and the action sequences is something Zack Snyder knows how to do, it's brutal, noisy and something real in it. He also knows to create a story that is epic, interesting and different. Amir Mokri served as cinematographer for the film and with his knowledge of shooting big action movies, it's easy to see why the action sequences in Man of Steel looks so stunning. The costume department deserves an award for their work, it's fantastic. The production design is another thing that deserves much praise, just wow. The Krypton sequence to Smallville to Metropolis and everywhere in-between, the production design is one of the film's many highlights. David Brenner edited the film and in my opinion, he did a great job.After the Krypton sequence we get to earth and we follow an older Clark Kent as he goes with a man with no name kind of style, saving and helping people. But that isn't the beginning, we get to see how he got to that point through flashbacks throughout the first act. It tells the story perfectly of a flawed man that is trying to find out who he is. Critics said that there are a lack of character development in the movie but I don't agree. There isn't anything big and that's because of how Zack Snyder had planned 5 films that tells the story of Superman and the fifth will show the Man of Steel from the comics, is that the best way for character development? Not really but he had huge ambition and see the end of that road would have been amazing and kinda mind blowing to see, I believe. But for what we got in this film is a Clark Kent that is kind of depressed and doesn't really know what he's supposed to do, and the way he is portrayed is fairly accurate to how a human being acts, we are flawed and so is Clark Kent. Zack Snyder paints the picture perfectly in how men and women with superpowers would be seen as god like figures, and possibly be sent to the government to be trained and there's a character in the film that believes that and it's Jonathan Kent. Zack Snyder wanted Superman to be portrayed in a realistic way and the world to feel real, and he succeeded with that. But I I understand why this doesn't work for some people, it isn't the Man of Steel you grew up with and that's okey. To say that it's a bad movie is wrong as it is a gorgeous film with an engaging and amazing story, dark but great.I've now watched this movie 6 times and it still holds up as a great Superman and Superhero movie, it's epic, with a memorable origin story which is inspired by Richard Donner's Superman 1 and 2.My final paragraph is about the 4k blu-ray version which I watched for the first time, having only seen the blu-ray version and once in the cinema. The HDR is used perfectly and you really see the difference with the 4k resolution, it's such a vast improvement. The CGI and visual effects look so much better with this 4K release, so you're in for one great and mesmerizing visual experience. The Dolby Atmos track is like the other stuff, breathtaking. From the music to the action sequences, everything hits right and increases the epicness, even the dialogue is clearer. I've always loved the musical score, sound design and sound mixing. The costume department did some award worthy work in this film, creating a magnificent and in my opinion perfect Superman suit.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Cavill certainly had the look, and then some, and was convincing as Clarke Kent. Amy Adams I didn't quite get, and whilst I think she's a good actress, and I know she's always wanted to play Lois Lane, I didn't see it somehow. All the other characters were well cast and well utilised; well you don't have Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner in a film and not give them some space do you? I loved Crowe in the role of Kal-El's father Jor-El. Diane Lane as Clarke Kent's mother was delightful - I can't believe how far she's come since Cherry Valence in The Outsiders!! The film was, for me, a bit long, especially the big Kal-El/Zod battle... I got a bit bored and that brought the film down for me. It became all CGI (of course) but it was all so fast that it was totally fake, and I don't like that. Otherwise the SFX/CGI in the film were awesome - I particularly liked the breathers covering the faces of people needing breathers. The flying sequences were really realistic and good... and Adams and Cavill seemed to have good chemistry in their romantic interludes, including the times he flew with her. All very good.Very entertaining film, and certainly if you were a DC/Superhero fan this would be a superb experience and people who know more about these things than I do say it's close to the comics. Even as a non-expert I liked the nods to previous incarnations of Superman and some gentle humour. Look out for the sign saying ""0 days since the last accident"" on a building site, Lexcorp stuff and signs for Smallville etc.I really did enjoy the film, except the long winded bits towards the end, that got wearisome. One bit where Superman is fighting with a morphing silver snakey thingie from the space ship (see how DC-savvie I am?) the noise was too sharp and I flinched at that. A very good film and, I believe a very convincing and powerful reboot on the classic older Superman franchises. I thought Cavill reminded me of Christopher Reeve a little, which was nice. Loved the dog actors in the film - super cute border collie. Some humour, some emotion, some tense bits and then also a little romance. Very good film","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I know the Snyder faithful will find exception with my assessment, but with 2009's box office disappointment Watchmen, 2011's miserable polished turd Sucker Punch, and his latest endeavor, the superman reboot Man of Steel, Snyder's work speaks for itselfit's average.In a world filled with big budget comic book movies, Man of Steel sadly feels mundane. With extremely long fight sequences of Superman and General Zod throwing each other into crumbling buildings mixed with bloated backstory and endless set up, finding something unique about this film seems to be a hard task. How many times can we the audience see the same thing before we finally give up on the comic book genre? Is seeing big city skyscrapers falling down really that appealing?Man of Steel sneaks glimpses of greatness with Amir Mokri's beautiful cinematography, and Hans Zimmer's piercing score, but in the end the latest Superman movie feels like just another alien story missing out on connecting with the human aspect (similar to Thor) and relying on CGI action as a crutch (similar to Spider-Man 3). David S. Goyer tries to deliver everything and anything a Superman comic book faithful may want, but this tactic doesn't pay off like his Dark Knight stories causing it to tip over and collapse.One thing's for surethis movie will make money and there will be a sequel. And by getting all the backstory out of the way, part 2 is set up to overcome Man of Steel's weaknesses and achieve the greatness missed out on the first attempt.

Some tasty stuff: some very innovative special effects on Krypton, artistic, new, compelling. The Bad: mind numbing action sequences that were frankly repetitive. Many many of these could have been deleted with no effect on the story. Potential character arcs frequently left undeveloped with the exception of Clark's relationship to his mother/father. Relationship to the villain, to his Krypton father, to Lois Lane, to Perry White all undeveloped. My most prominent memory of this film is the characters standing still and staring up into the sky as scenes of massive destruction played out 50 different ways. Then I watched the credits: multiple Executive Producers all with their own title frames. Too many leaders/cooks in a film's financing and development can leave the food tasteless.

It's 21-st century, not film's golden era. What I enjoyed? The fact this Superman doesn't wear panties over the pants. Cavill really knows acting (late Reeve was so desperately bad) and is a nice looking bloke. All of us with beer bellies may want to look like that if we only care about it. The movie is darker than we used to. The unnecessary humor is expelled except in ""I grew up in Kansas"" line. So what? What ruins th film? CGI were pretty good but sometimes made me think ""when this scene is going to end!?"". Sound seemed a little overhauled. Louis Lane is again non attractive and annoying. Characters are generally like made of cardboard. Story (plot?) is, well, there was no story. And another thing. You wanna bring me the new take on the Superman story? Do it like there were no Superman movie before. Don't go with the presumption I've seen or red all earlier works. Some gaps were filled in story we all knew and that's it? Oh c'mon! The way movie is done it only looks like Snyder took some of the magic he used to make completely perverted 80's comic like Watchmen movie, to twist Superman into a more popular antihero rather than Reeves' that wore bright colors and had almost the same motto as US police has.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Granted the special effects are absolutely great, the climatic action sequence is the most genuinely thrilling the action gets and makes that of Avengers Assemble(which on the whole had much better-executed action and was a vastly superior film) seem tame in comparison, the flying scenes are cool and the scene of the sensory overload causing his powers is interesting. There are a few good performances, the best coming from Russell Crowe who plays Jor-El with dignity, Kevin Costner whose performance is very heartfelt and Michael Shannon who makes for a legitimately fierce villain. Henry Cavill is also very well-cast, he looks the part and is very reserved yet charismatic, he does a good job at showing Superman's pain. The rest of the cast are not as impressive, Amy Adams very shockingly is a blank as Lois and she is not helped by that she has nothing to do. Laurence Fisburne and Chris Meloni do their best but their characters are almost pointless, and while Diane Lane is charming she also has little to do. While the special effects are great the cinematography and editing are not, often having a dizzying and overblown effect with excessive shaking, in-your-face close-ups and abrupt zooms. Zack Snyder's style is not for everyone but his directing is leaden here and his style doesn't really come through. Hans Zimmer's score is disappointingly pedestrian and rather one-note mood-wise, very over-serious and with an attempt to be epic but never soaring. The sound is loud and noisy and often is so much that it induces a headache. And while I do like superhero films and action when done right, Man of Steel is a case of too much action that on the most part is too long-winded and rather repetitive in execution. There is a complete lack of emotional connection(even in Jonathan Kent's father's death), the romance is contrived, the characters are standard clichés with little personality or development and much of the dialogue is forced. The story is filled with overlong exposition, as admirable as showing Superman's origins are in flashback it does cause the film to lose momentum, and is so scattershot in structure and jumps around so much it is not always easy to decipher what's happening. All in all, not a terrible film but a long way from super. 4/10 Bethany Cox","30 out of 94 found this helpful.

The rest of the cast all look very pretty in their scenes, but their purposes are only very slight, and add a little characterization to this other-wordly feeling movie (I'll elaborate more when I get to the director). But in all honesty, the likes of Amy Adams and Laurence Fishburne don't add any big acting chops for this film. Michael Shannon proves a worthy foe as General Zod. And on that note, I must make a slight aside. I was quite impressed to come into this film and not hear any mention of kryptonite or Lex Luthor (yes, there's an Easter egg, but hush up). One of my biggest flaws with Superman is that literally his only weakness is kryptonite; thus, the story lines get dragged on too much. General Zod is a great change of pace, even if he is similar to Iron Man or Hulk villains in the sense that the villain features very similar powers to the superhero (one huge upside to the Batman universe).Then we have the man of the hour. Probably the biggest praise I can give this film is Henry Cavill. To me he represents the perfect Superman: the hair, facial structure, body physique (ladies, be ready for an absolute beast of a body), deep voice, and ever so slight mannerisms mainly seen in a comforting grin. He truly is the Man of Steel.If I'm being honest here, I have to give it up to Zack Snyder. He takes this CGI-filled movie, and he allows his decisions to dictate what you see. The opening sequence on Krypton is a little much for me, granted, but there's a lot of really power-packed shots like the sun glowing between the fingers of Superman. Furthermore, such sequences such as Superman testing his limits on flight show just how great a reboot is supposed to look.Zack Snyder isn't perfect though. There were one too many shots of a broad landscape only to zoom in on a speeding, flying object. His message of stepping back and looking at this from a perspective of a human suddenly finding signs of aliens works well, but it was used just too much. The action sequences look great, but I do wonder if Batman vs Superman will address the amount of damage caused to Metropolis. Like, that economy is down the hole. And take it whatever way you want, but the final fight reminded me so much of The Matrix Revolutions.The final issue I take with the film is in its essence. At the core I feel like Superman doesn't fit into a darker world that Batman embodies and embraces. I understand the reboot and the direction the producers wanted to take it, but there's a part of me missing John William's ""Superman Theme."" Sorry, Hans Zimmer, there's just a few composers even you can't beat. There's plenty of merits on the film from the director, main actor, and top-notch special effects, but the separation of this reboot from previous Superman movies mirrors Batman's reboot to a fault.

I've watched Superman since I was a kid. Even back then, compared to other Superhero films, Superman always seemed to be the ""cheesy"" superhero. The tights and cape. The cheesy flying scenes. Back then I was more a fan of Batman. I watched the Superman movie from 2006 and was disappointed like most others. With that being said, I seen the preview for this ""Man of Steel"" while seeing a few other new films and had to check it out!Man of Steel rocks! Finally Superman was done right! First off, the GOOD side of this film. An awesome, new uniform (I couldn't stand the red underwear in the old ones!). Great story line, great cast, great villain, great soundtrack/CGI/FX, great everything. Fantastic film from beginning to end. A good twist to Superman while remaining loyal to the original concept. This movie definitely gives Marvel a run for their money this time! I enjoyed this more than the recent ""Iron Man 3"". Unlike the Marvel films this Superman stayed more of a serious superhero film. I don't mind a bit of comedy, but Iron Man gets a bit over top sometimes. The bad. Very minor things. This DID feel a bit ""kid-oriented"" more than other superhero films (although that's not that bad a thing, right I mean they are KIDS movies at heart?). The fighting was all over the place and a bit over the top at times. One instance Superman smashes a guy into a familiar IHOP store where a kid from grade school is the manager... this among other scenes felt forced with very obvious ""product placement"" scenes. Also the beginning seemed to hop between superman being old and young a bit too much. Lastly I felt the relationship between Superman and Louis Lane was a bit rushed and didn't have time to develop much. Besides the shortcomings this is a fantastic Superman film. I now hope that they continue to roll with it and make some epic sequels. In a perfect world we might even get a ""Justice League"" film (and I do hear there is one in the works). It's nice to see another franchise make it big besides Marvel who has had their plentiful time in the spotlight already. I recommend this film to anyone whether you are a fan of Superman films or not. It's not perfect, but it's one massive step in the right direction and I would definitely watch it again (and again and again)! 8/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, as a superman movie, it is a little disappointing for missing some of the signatures those were engraved in our minds since we were children about superman movies, for example; The Original soundtrack was so awesome (Well, was missing), The keyword ""Superman"" as part of the title is missing this is why I did not watch the movie since 2013 till 2016 because all that time I thought it is something related to iron-man or real steel or such. I do not want to be a detail- oriented, So I really hope they bring back at least these two missing items for the incoming episodes of the Superman franchise. The Movie action is a 10/10, really awesome. The New version of the Superman Uniform, is Super Awesome. The physical shape of Superman, Well, for my opinion, I think is a little over shaped (Lol, not sure if this is even a used term ""Over shaped"") what I mean by, the Shoulder Muscles look somehow too huge for the body!!

I don't know if all the money goes to the special effects, but this epitome of merchandising put boring and predictable dialogs in a 2 hour pack, mixed with a lot of stupid quotes, plus a horrible actuation of the man of steel, who might be a great character for a model campaign, but has no charisma at all. Of course there is no turn of the screw nor a moment that would make get into the ""intelligent argument"". I tell you, back in the '80, the movies of Christopher Reeve with less budget were much better.

The fragility of his dual identity is never touched upon. The supposed smart career woman who he's in love with never sees through his disguise as Clark Kent. He's all powerful, doesn't lie and always does the right thing. Nothing can physically hurt him except Kryptonite. How do you find conflict for this character? How can he grow? What is there for him to learn? This makes Superman a writer's nightmare. The original material has written itself into a corner. It's clear that the filmmakers' goal was to undo many of these trappings and update Superman to a real modern context. Content aside, I'm a Christopher Nolan fan but I have never liked any of Zack Snyder's films. What would be the end result of a Nolan-produced Zack Snyder production? Would they accomplish their goals? This left me going in with an open mind.Henry Cavill makes both a great Clark Kent and Superman. Surprisingly much of it is a silent performance, as he has minimal dialogue and communicates a lot of the inner turmoil through his face. The story gives him a lot to play and watching Clark grow into Superman step-by-step make up for the the most interesting segments. When he makes the choice to become Superman, we feel the gravity of that choice. The film is called Man of Steel for that very reason.Lois Lane is the trickiest part to cast out of all the characters. The career-driven overachieving qualities of Lois Lane, if not balanced correctly, can easily make her into a bitch. She should be a jerk, but a likable jerk. It's in Superman's overwhelming presence where her heartier side slowly surfaces. Amy Adams nails the career woman part of Lois from her first scene. The heartier side she plays out convincingly as well but unfortunately the romance is a bit rushed. I would have liked to see Lois's vulnerable side melt away slower and have it unfold in a sequel.Russell Crowe gives the film an engaging energetic kickstart as Jor-el; he puts an enthusiasm into this role he hasn't in years. Michael Shannon brings a ferocious intensity to General Zod, who's written as more complex and more relatable than Terrence Stamp's version. I believe his motivation and anger. Laurence Fishburne is always a welcome presence and makes a fine Perry White, but what is up with that diamond earring? Is that suitable for work?Kevin Costner is the heart of the movie as Jonathan Kent. He and Diane Lane make really convincing on-screen parents. Both are real-life parents and there's something about how being a parent that physically changes the way carry yourself that's hard to fabricate. That quality is captured effectively here and the values the Kents instill into Clark echoes throughout the film. Martha Kent's first scene with a young Clark at school almost moved me to tears.Hans Zimmer's music punctuates the film's goal by scoring a ""Man of Steel"" theme as opposed to a Superman theme. There's no distinct attempt at trying to capture Superman's presence with musical keys, the emphasis is the man himself. This separates it from John William's class original score. The bombastic loud soaring god- like moments are operatic, and the quieter human moments show a lonely man moving from contemplation towards action.Zack Snyder makes good directorial choices. Snyder's held back with his trademark slow motion shots and thank goodness for that. The hand-held cinematography effectively grounds the scenes, particularly the childhood scenes in Smallville evoke Terrence Malick films. The non-linear flashbacks is a great choice as it mixes things up for an origin story that we have seen before. It was more interesting we didn't have to go through it linearly.The finale is too long, partly it's a reaction from all the complaints of no action from Superman Returns. People have been talking about the issue of too much destruction. It's more that a lot of the destruction is caused by Superman himself. He seems unaware of his surroundings and is actively using the surrounding buildings to hurt his enemies. This would have been nullified if Cavill's Superman just saved more civilians between the fights and if the aftermath of the destruction was addressed by the media. Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh's versions had no problem multi-tasking. The only one Superman power that wasn't shown was the super breath, and there were many instances he could have used that power to put out a few fires. Maybe Superman hasn't learned that power yet but he could have used his powers more creatively as well. On a tangential note, I loved the design of the heat vision. There was a destructive 'last resort' quality that looked scary and painful to fire out of your eyes.Finally, some people might feel cheated by or downright reject these changes to the Superman mythos, but these changes properly inject the necessary weaknesses that can set this version of Superman on a journey with enough lessons to learn for subsequent films (assuming they're making at least three of these including a Justice League movie). The new places they go with Superman were ultimately what thrilled me and the quiet human moments were what moved me. Personally I would have traded 10 minutes out of the finale for 10 more minutes in Smallville.I look forward to where they take this version of Superman. Depending on which direction of the next film may affect how I feel about Man of Steel because there are a lot of things that are left unfinished that can be fixed in the sequel (i.e. the romance, the aftermath of the damage, Superman saving more people, how the world is reacting to his presence). It's time to cast Lex Luthor!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

On the plus side, it tries for something slightly different, seemingly taking itself quite seriously. The humour of the leading characters just isn't there, but that could be because of the dialogue or lack of it. Henry Cavill is bit wooden as Clark Kent and Superman, though his physique is chiseled to the maximum, looking more like a drugged fuelled bodybuilder than any Superman we can recall. On a large scale the special effects are impressive, but lack the imaginative set designs of earlier films. This film seems to drag on during its 2 and half hour run. Whereas you can get so caught up in the 78 classic, that time just seemed irrelevant until the thrilling conclusion.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It gets credit for setting and keeping a super fast pace through a relatively long film. Some of it is too fast and excessive, or maybe just too super. On the other hand, it's more than just action and there's a lot of unexpectedly smart thought and plot development at the core of all the action with only a little over-explanation. For Avengers/Iron Man fans, this is definitely a separate, independent Earth. It might be best viewed as an early 2000s setting with Iron Man taking place post-Superman in 2030s. This is set in the basic, less technologically advanced world of today complete with dirty oil rig technology, farms, malls, Internet leaks, and the overly watchful paranoid military lacking the behind the scenes support of any other superheroes.This is also a new film variation, a much more modern comic book version with more of a working man's Superman to go with a reporter superhero in Lois Lane. If you go in expecting a continuation of the same old stuff, you will be shocked.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't understand it's hate. It has a great story with great action. It probably has the best action in any superhero movie ever. It is so epic and General Zod is a fantastic villain. It perfectly sets up Dawn of Justice and it only makes sense to introduce Superman into this universe first since he is practically the leader of the Justice League.The only thing that I can understand that people of a problem with is Jonathan Kent dying and Lois and Clark's relationship. Jonathan Kent originally died from a heart attack, and in the movie he dies from a tornado. I thought it was very weird and I liked the thought of his father dying from a cause even he couldn't prevent. However, I thought it still worked for what they were going for and it wasn't wrong, it was just different. Lois and Clark's relationship seems to move forward rather quickly, which I actually didn't like. They could've made the movie a little longer to flesh that out, but it was alright. Hopefully they will continue to flesh out their relationship in future films. Overall, it's a fantastic movie that I always enjoy watching!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Awesome CGI & action, decent plot.
Maybe there are some minor plot holes, but they aren't significant enough that they'd destroy the movie, at least for me. Also they might stem from the comics and they kept it for the movie and at least tried to make it believable.
Overall this movie accomplished that I like the character, which I can't say I did before (which might also be due to lack of interest in it). Afterwards, I watched Superman I & II from 1978 & 1980 and yes, Christopher Reeve might be THE Superman for some, but Henry Cavill truly is a worthy successor, also 'Man Of Steel' is NOT cheesy, but the old movies are.
This is definitely a solid ground they can build future movies on.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"4","/10","While it doesn't quite dazzle like Nolan's Batman trilogy, it does pack enough of a punch to satisfy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2812040/?ref_=tt_urv","trublu215","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28528605/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2013","Now, before I go off on this, I must say that I am the furthest thing from a Superman fan. Quite the contrary, I never really saw what the hype was about. However, after seeing Zack Snyder's rendition of the titular character, it definitely changed my perspective a bit. The film is a visual stunner, with action sequences that are breath taking and absolutely ingeniously shot and constructed. However, the film's true heart exists in humanizing a man that is not human at all, giving him moral dilemmas that challenge his every move. It is a tough feat to do for a seemingly invincible character but Snyder manages to pull it off quite well. Without any spoilers, there are a few touching scenes with Kevin Costner that reminds us of how great he truly he is as an actor. Henry Cavill, while he is better than the atrocious Routh, he never quite soars to the level of Christopher Reeves. Cavill's performance is good for what it is but it leaves you wondering whether or not he is just right or overacting. Now...for the best part of this film...MICHAEL SHANNON. Shannon's performance as Zod is pitch perfect. He's a villain you love to hate and he commands the screen with a villainous beat that is hard to mimic. He is the scene stealer in this film, even more so over Kevin Costner, in my opinion. Amy Adams gives a grim performance as Louis Lane and she is one of the dim parts of the film. Now, being a huge fan of Adams, I can't genuinely say that I hated her performance in this film but I can say that she has done better work and could have done way better than just playing the typical damsel in distress routine despite the character calling for just that. It just seemed that there could have been more to her performance than what was shown.Now, the story is rather easy to understand, the set up is grand and the execution is pitch perfect but the film fails to dazzle like Nolan's Batman trilogy which serves as a huge influence on this film. The dark tone is misused in this film because the source material doesn't call for it to be as dark as Snyder wanted it which creates a sense of muddled scenes. There can be comic banter but the banter that was placed throughout the film felt as though it was confused on whether or not to take itself too seriously or too light. Either way, the tonal shifts from scene to scene periodically seemed a bit jarring for me. However, Snyder does allow for much darkness to spectacle itself around for much of the final action packed half hour or so which sends the viewer off on a good note.Overall, I felt this film is the best Superman film since Donner's Superman II. It is loud, seldom dumb, action packed and, for the most part, competently made. Now, as for summer blockbusters go, this is definitely the definitive summer film of 2013 thus far so if you want a good CGI spectacle then this is the film for you. If you're expecting the next Batman Begins, try again. Overall, it is enjoyable, at times mindless and most of all, entertaining.","13 out of 35 found this helpful.

He is one of the most recognisable figures in pop culture, but since the rise of the superhero genre in cinema Superman has somehow struggled to return to the silver screen. Man of Steel seem set to save Superman's fortunes.On the planet Krypton the planet's chief scientist Jol-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have the first natural born child on the planet generations. But Jol-El discovers that Krypton has only weeks left before the planet collapses on itself and General Zod (Michael Shannon)attempts a military. Amidst the chaos Jol-El and Lara send they son Kal-El to Earth before the planet is destroy.33 years later Kal-El has grown up as Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), a Kansas man with amazing abilities who attempts to remind anonymous but ends up saving people wherever he goes. As he investigates his own past when the American military discover a lost spaceship in the Artic a top journalist, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tries to find out who her mysterious survivor really is. Even worst Zod and his follows had survived the destruction of Krypton and demands Earth hand over Kal-El, believing he hold the key to the rebirth of their race.Superman Returns was disliked by audience, but I personally enjoyed it. The big criticism of Superman Returns was that it lacked action: Man of Steel has the opposite problem, it is too action heavy. Zack Snyder, the director of 300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch was brought in to helm the film. He started the film with massive battles, fights and chases in opening ten minutes and the film does not stop. Snyder knows how to shoot action, particularly the big battles and showcasing the powers; but his trademark slow-motion is cut back, instead using a hand-held style (but there are some annoying zooms when showing things in flight). Man of Steel is a film that racks up a lot of death and destruction, with half a city getting destroyed. Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich would have been proud. 2013 is a year that has racked up a massive body count in blockbusters.Whilst the action is great, the story is very thin and the film is too long. 30 minutes could easily have been cut and the film is not as thematic as it intends to be. The film wants to have a message of destiny and free will and nature versus nurture: but the film is not as deep as wants to be. Snyder is not a subtle director, but the real let down is the script by David S. Goyer: it really lacked depth. We do not get to see much of Superman as Clark Kent, especially as an adult: we needed to see more of what made him tick and occasionally Superman did feel like a secondary character with the military and Lois Lane taking a lot of screen time. The basic plot of the film is also similar to Transformers and Transformers: Dark of the Moon, i.e. find the alien device that could bring new life to an alien planet/race and try and turn Earth into a habitable world for the aliens.Because of the origins story it is easy to think about the original Superman film and Superman II, there were similarities to the story. Christopher Nolan was a producer for the film and it is clear Warner Brothers were hoping for a repeat of his Dark Knight Trilogy (which it will do financially), but its style and approach actually reminded me more of The Amazing Spider-man, particular some of the plot points, the basic look of the film and the wider picture, such as the use of the military. There are also some elements of J.J. Abrams' Superman Flyby script in Man of Steel as well, examples being Clark Kent trying to control his powers as a child, the use of the military in the narrative and the climax and the use of Zod who takes up Krypton and being the main villain of the film (though in Flyby it was Kal-El's cousin).Man of Steel has a fine cast, with Snyder and his team filling the film with a top actors, a great combination of stars and respected character actors. Cavill does look the part as Clark Kent/Superman but his performance was a little bland: Cavill tried his best but he did not have much to work with. Crowe, Adams, Laurence Fishbourne were all strong in their respective roles and will be serve future Superman films well. But the most fun was Shannon as he chews the scenery as Zod; he is great at playing insane characters. Antje Traue too was notable as Zod's second-in-command.John Williams' famous Superman theme was not included for the reboot. Whilst it is missed, Hans Zimmer's new score was excellent, powerhouse piece of music. The final think to note was cinematography by Amir Mokri was disappointing, having a murky filter making the visuals a little unclean and the colour pallet was a brown, dulling out the film when its colours should have been brighter.Superman is a series that needed a reboot and Man of Steel does set up a new world and the action. But it is a film that plays its hand to early considering the action on the screen, the amount of destruction and how world changing an event it would be. The film should have been a little more small scale. But I will still go and see the sequel.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am not even a major fan of the Superman character since the comic book character is pretty cheesy, but this movie made me a fan. Man of Steel has a stellar cast, the action is intense, and the final act is climactically exciting. Henry Cavill is a phenomenal Superman. This telling of the story is accurate and spot on and also accessible to new fans of the franchise. Henry Cavill made fans fall in love with him as Clark Kent/Superman with his perfect performance. Zod is one of the best villains and is portrayed with evil perfection. The movie was written and filmed so well that I cannot think of a better way to tell the origin story of the Man of Steel. Most of all, this was a successful kick off to the DC Universe.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film did surprise me to an extent which made it quite enjoyable and better than I expected.From the beginning on the movie, any member of the audience could tell ""Man of Steel"" wasn't going to be a colorful, delightful superhero movie like ""The Avengers"" or ""Spiderman."" Due to the director and producer, a majority of the audience knew it'd be something similar to ""The Dark Knight"" with a serious and darker look to it.The beginning of the film which occurred on Krypton was done greatly. It showed Clark's origin and how and why he ended up in Earth. I must add that Russell Crowe did a great job as Jor-El, Clark's father, as well. The only thing that kind of bugged me was Clark's mother. Ayelet Zurer, who took on the role, was just completely unbelievable and seemed to lack emotion during certain parts.No matter, the first half of the film after that seemed to focus a lot on Clark's back story and how he grew up with himself on Earth and to be honest, it seemed to drag on. It was just slow and not a lot happened which kind of made me lose interest. Henry Cavill did an amazing job as Clark Kent though. He was completely convincing and really seemed to understand Clark.Another thing that happened in the first half though was a lot of Clark and Lois's relationship. Their relationship did not feel realistic at all. One scene they just met, the next they're both looking at each other with a look like they're in love. There was just no development or even chemistry between them at it was just so awkward and kind of disappointing to watch.Once that lull ends, it becomes a lot more interesting. Based on other reviews, a handful of people weren't fans of the fighting sequences as ""they went on and on and were boring,"" but the actions scenes were spot on, really representing the power he possesses and it was done the best way possible without going too overboard.The bad guy of the film, General Zod played by Michael Shannon, was done just alright. I didn't really feel intimidated by his character, but it was still a convincing job.Overall, the film was an enjoyable watch but it went on forever. With the slow first act and a specific part of the film where the filmmakers could have ended it yet continued on, it was for sure one of the best representations of the hero known as Superman.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","I Wanted to Like it, Really I Did","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7199815/?ref_=tt_urv","clh-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3473506/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2021","I am a huge Superman fan, and after feeling let down by Superman Returns, I was cautiously optimistic about this movie. Despite having to work the next morning, I went to the first midnight showing, and I was left... ""cold"" would actually be putting it nicely.A Superman movie or television series should, ultimately, feel like we are being reintroduced to an old friend. That does NOT mean doing the same story over and over again, or telling the actors to simply do impressions of their predecessors; but it does mean making sure that the characterizations are right. Among fans of Superman, when asked to rank actors who've worn the cape, when all the votes are counted it's a safe bet the top two spots are going to be Christopher Reeve and George Reeves. In a lot of measurable ways, they're very different, but they are both Superman. This movie and its main character are not Superman.The characterization is off; Henry Cavill looks the part as much as any other actor, but he isn't allowed to inhabit the character. As much as some will chalk it up to a younger version of the character still learning, the actions of the character are things a thirty-something would know are not good; while I'll leave aside the way the villain is dispatched, the climax as a whole is all about the destruction porn. An action scene needs to have stakes, but the hero(es) should make protecting the public their first concern. Other superhero films have a certain level of mayhem and destruction, yes, but the heroes are actively trying to mitigate it. In the climax of Man of Steel, it's all about how much more damage can be done to the city of Metropolis. Other things are, in what could have been a scene full of emotional weight where Clark Kent grapples with using his powers in the face a jerk in a bar, he instead acts with pettiness and uses his powers disproportionately to wreck the guys livelihood. At the end of the film, for a character that is actively trying to gain the trust of the peoples and governments of Earth, he destroys military equipment that poses no real threat to him. The S must stand for ""Superjerk"".Characterization of the title character aside, while Cavill and Amy Adams seem to be giving their all, they don't really have a lot of chemistry with each other. And for a character that seems to have an interest in maintaining a secret identity, she sure yells ""Clark!"" in public a lot. There are narrative issues, certain scenes happen just because the script says they do, instead of being an organic development. For example, while most versions of the Superman story feature the death of his adoptive father, as it happens here it's just idiotic. Within the context of the scene, there were at least two logical outs that wouldn't have revealed the secret they weren't trying that hard to keep.Lastly, and I must give the sequels credit for rectifying this, the film was shot with awful ShakyCam. If I'm paying $15 to see a movie, I should actually be able to SEE the movie.Some things that keep the film from being an absolute dud are that some secondary cast members (Kevin Costner, Lawrence Fishburne, and Russell Crowe) all seem to not realize that they're in *that* kind of film, and really do give it their all. The set design of Krypton is alien without being ridiculous, and stands out from previous versions. And Hans Zimmer's score is pretty good, with the piece that accompanies Superman's first flight capturing the sense of joy one must feel taking off for the first time.On the whole, the film that I really wanted to be good was a disappointment. And none of its direct sequels saw fit to fix the problems with Superman. As of this writing, it seems that this version of the character has reached an end. And I'll be cautiously optimistic for the next take.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I wanted to feel the weight of why Clark is who he is. It had that potential. The camera work is annoying. Every scene in the beginning hour of the movie is so shaky. The lens is pulling in and out of focus sometimes and it doesn't sit well with 3d. I wanted to give this a 10/10 so bad. It just couldn't do it. Zack Snyder brought great action scenes.

Now Amy Adams as Lois Lane.She is cute,sweet as pie.She is perfect female lead.Lovely. Michael Shannon as General Zod --awesome.3.VFX and SFX are up to the mark,okay lets say over the mark.Fantastic in one word.Cons: 1.Regardless of such great effects and acting,this one is not flawless.The actions may be ""too much"",almost throughout the movie,which was against a strong story building.The film lacks a decent time of breath.As the action comes rapidly,you may want little rest.May be its an overdose of action. Though we wanted a stronger story,the story is still decent and up to the mark.2.About 3D:Since its a post-converted 3D film it does not have any pop-out 3D effects(Nothing comes out of screen) but has the depth of field.A 2D watch does not hurt in case of this movie.The trailers of movies(namely Gravity and Pacific Rim) before ""Man of Steel"" starts were more stronger as 3D.OVERALL:The major difference between ""Man of Steel"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is former has better action and weaker story and the latter has less actions but stronger story.(I know I'm gonna have many disagreed people,my review is not dedicated for Comic-fans only,its for all.) I recommend everyone to visit the movie along with your family.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't like Superman. I never liked him. Even when I was a kid he was a joke to me. More importantly, I was never a huge Zack Snider fan. I liked the animated movie with the owls but I hated '300' with passion and before I saw 'Man of Steel' I hadn't seen any of his other movies. That's right, I hadn't seen even 'Watchmen'.What drew me to this movie then? I read some reviews describing it not as a comic book based superhero movie but as a sci-fi tale about a superhuman. I read that the creators of the movie approached the character differently. And indeed they did. This time Clark Kent is really confident, he knows that he is god-like compared to the humans and he knows that it is his choice to do good and no one else's. As you can see in the trailer, the dynamic between Kent and Lois Lane is dramatically changed, which I also like. Kripton is now shown differently, it is not the blue crystal planet we were used to seeing since the 70s. The way it is shown is cruel, cold and beautiful, rich in color and epic in scale. A lot of attention is paid to Kent's childhood and him getting to know who he is and what he is capable to do. The action scenes are just sweeping. Frighteningly epic scale, massive destruction, probably way too much death - millions of people die like flies. It is getting ridiculous at some point but it is still beautiful to look at.And yes, the writing is really not very good. Some parts of the dialogue are just laughable. But the movie is wonderfully filmed, the pacing is perfect and the acting performances are simply great. This is the Superman that I can like. And I like it. Give it a chance, even if you don't like comic book based movies. This is not a superhero movie, this is a science fiction movie and despite the flaws in the writing it is just wonderful.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Brush our teeth. Take a bite on the bread. And then the office. Why this boring life? Wish I could fly. I wish I could punch all the goons or burn all the terrorists who kills people with my red ray from the eye. To satisfy some what this kind of need Jeery Siegel and Joe Shuster of DC Comics came with a superhero named ""Superman"". Day by day more super hero came. Then came their movies. But on 2008 there ""The Dark Knight"" which made all the super hero movie lovers expectation to sky high. To fulfill that kind of expectation Zack Snyder brings the movie about the first Comic Superhero: :""Man of Steel"". Lets get with the story. A farmer's son named Clark (Henry Cavill) in Kansas. At school days he realized he has the terrifying ability to perceive anything with too much detail. If someone talks about Kanye West - Kim Kardashian he can listen or anyone hums any ""Friday"" of Rebecca Black he can hear it. What a mess! He also doesn't get anything funny with Chuck Norris movies. Because he can be a Chuck Norris too. What so funny about it?One day he learned about his true identity. That he is not belong to this family or even on this planet. He was found from a spaceship in the farming fields. He felt terribly lonely. When he become a ""Man"" he went in a search. A search of finding his own identity. But one day his fellow aliens came from his planet ""Krypton"". They wants to do some experiments. You know what kind of experiments. But they has all kinds of powers that Clark have. Can Clark stop them?The first part of the movie is quiet touchy. But the later action is too much. Like what is happening? I can't imagine anyone but Cavill as the Superman. He is the best. He acts well and also very much dashing. He did a great job. Amy Adams was good as Lois. Kevin Costner, Diana Lane, Michael Shannon all did a good job but the best one was Russell Crowe as Superman's father ""Jor-El"". The soundtrack of the movie was too good. Hats off to Hans Zimmer. There is nothing special about the action about the movie. Its just as boring as the Transformer movies. I was surprised about one thing while watching it in IMAX 3D. It doesn't look like a 3D movie. Later I learned it was not filmed as 3D but was converted. I felt very much conned. So don't waste your money watching it in 3D. Some scenes are great and some are awful. But Still its the best Superman movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What I didn't expect was to be so bored.There is basically no plot and storyline (most honest reviews acknowledge this). I do give the film makers credit for generally not pretending that either exists but at least something would have been nice.In the end the movie is nothing more than a series of special effects that are at first pretty amazing but sadly quickly become repetitive and predictable. Instead of making the movie exciting it's like watching someone play a video game. It becomes not a movie but a demo reel for the CES show.The cast is amazing. So much talent. The exception is sadly Superman. It's not clear if it's poor writing, directing or acting but a piece of paper has more dimension than what is shown here. That being said he has spent A LOT of time in the gym. I wonder if they film makers realized this which is why Jor-El (Russel Crowe) seems to have more dialogue and screen time than Superman.The rest of the actors are incredible . . . in other projects. They clearly have nothing to work with other than to look worried as big explosions happen (a lot) or as they stare at green screens.A franchise with so much history and with so much potential has been wasted here. It's a real shame. Superman, and his fans, deserve so much better.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What really stands out during the first half of this movie was how unnecessarily disjointed the editing became with the non-chronological scenes using flashbacks and forward jumps in order to tell superman's origins. Man of Steel initially incorporates visual similarities to the alien ambiance of Avatar (2009) and later visual elements of the more raw and gritty District 9 (2009), The Matrix (1999) and Inception (2010). As with these special effects extravaganzas, there will always be more and better movies to come and like Avatar and Inception, Man of Steel has lifted the bar moderately for now to present an enhanced 3-D experience. Such advances in appearance, however, can't overcome the disjointed quality of how this story unfolded until later in the movie when the action takes over to the end of the movie.Unlike the horror movie Constantine (2005) that uses primarily a linear chronological unfolding, where its director included judicious use of flashbacks, but only to enhance the story, not to dominate it. Man of Steel's unfolding story seems to have been based on avoiding extended scenes lengths to reduce cost or compress the time to supposedly pick up the pace. Even From Up on Poppy Hill, a Japanese animated movie that came out this year understood the selective and deliberate use of flashbacks that didn't necessarily confuse and jolt the audience suddenly ahead in time or back in time like some audience member to be manipulated for the sake of the director's interest. What made Ryan Lantern's character in Green Lantern (2011) so enjoyable was its depiction of the character development and human connections and discovery. Omitted in this version of Superman is the even the initial fascinating discovery of Superman by his adopted parents or even an extended evolving childhood development in which psychological attachment is so important a period in any character's life. Kill Bill No. 1 (2002) and No. 2 (2003) were a few of the action movies in which the use of non-linear flashbacks was well executed and didn't confuse or break the rhythm of the movie, even Elektra (2005) was able to accomplish this same feat.Unlike The Matrix (1999) where the antagonist is primarily an unemotional machine, where there is logically a black and white element to the antagonist's character, the human resemblance and actually the literal adoption of the human form as Superman's biological parents makes for the use of the black and white stereotypical antagonist as two-dimensional qualities quite inconsistent with a three-dimensional visual movie format. Spiderman (2002) perhaps reflects the best of allowing a movie to unfold in its storytelling narrative, that includes the same life experiences as occurred in Man of Steel albeit which was more condensed that included a moment of discovery (unlike that omitted in Man of Steel), the attachment to one's parents and the parent-son conflicts. But in Spiderman series, even a more multi-dimensional antagonists that made for a more compelling, balanced emotional tension as in Spiderman (2002) and more recently Spiderman 3 (2007) where the Sandman character is a compelling example of a more complex character that allows for a more reflective and substantive satisfying emotional experience.Even as Christopher Nolan who helped with the movie's story, whose Dark Knight (2008) visual design and lighting were the problem but not in Man of Steel, nevertheless unlike Dark Knight the attempt to compress many individual scenes and history into this movie didn't come off well. The Dark Knight succeeded in its depiction of extended deliciously wicked moral dilemma's while Man of Steel that seemed more by the numbers. While it is commendable that Russell Crowe as Jor-El in place of the Marlon Brando of Superman (1978) has an even more compassionate and emotive portrayal, the script still didn't allow Russell Crowe the breadth of character development, interaction that could cement the beginning scenes. Then at some point more wasn't sufficiently better and as the awesome Inception (2010) like visual effects and other superhero banging and crashing into buildings continue they becomes very overdone by the ending of the movie.Overall, Man of Steel is an impressive presentation of this superhero, yet it just seemed overly chaotic, a bit over done in places, a bit by the numbers, and overly ambitious in its use of special effects.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is well cast, visually stunning, and had all the ingredients to modernize the classic, if only....But as with nearly every Hollywood product these days, Man of Steel falls apart due to lazy and borderline incoherent writing. The only compelling character in the story (remember, it's supposed to have a story) is Clark's big hearted but foolish adoptive father. Although he's a well drawn and interesting person, he isn't enough to carry the movie by himself. He isn't even on the screen for very long.All of the other characters are just reading stilted lines and going through the motions. Particularly bad is the awkward insertion of Lois into the plot. In many scenes, her behavior simply doesn't make sense. With one major plot point, there's just no sane explanation for her presence, let alone participation.While on the subject of not making sense--the lax physics in Man of Steel is really embarrassing. I'm willing to suspend some disbelief for a comic book, but this so bad that anyone with a grade school education will spend at least twenty minutes of movie time in face-palm pose.Apparently in an effort to disguise the above weaknesses, the movie has some of the longest, loudest, and most violent action sequences I've ever seen in a movie theater. My ears were ringing the next morning as if I'd been to a Megadeth concert. As much as I like big action stuff in movies, this excess actually made the movie worse. Shock an awe are not a substitute for good storytelling.I will admit to feeling a bit of guilty pleasure at the amazing artwork and effects in the movie, but ultimately this just left me in mourning for what could have been.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Worst movie of 2013. Appalling and sacrilegious movie, with the director's pornographic use of lens flare","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2928747/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael Kenmore","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0089164/?ref_=tt_urv","26 December 2013","There's not much to say about this movie already said by other critics in other user comments preceding this comment, noting the sacrilegious abuse of the original material that form the Superman mythology, by the storytellers and the director who brought us 300 and Watchmen, which I loathed with in-depth criticism in the past reviews on this web site.Besides the horrible retelling of Superman mytho which essentially deform the original story to comical effects, I vehemently, with repulsion, object to the director's fetish for the constant sensationalism with the shaky (even zooming, as the director's trademark) cinematography replete with the inanely pornographic employment of lens flare, like his fellow director J.J. Abrams of the Star Trek reboot, which I harshly criticized as well. Zack Synder ""made it"" by dishonest means, which is the remake of the zombie movie directed by George Romero who was struggling financially to fund his next original zombie movie. Here we continue to be delivered the abortions and abominations by Mr. Synder, who produce these films to degrade and mock the audiences as the proverbial cash cow, not unlike Michael Bay who produced and directed vulgar (in terms of degraded quality and language) and outright sensational and garbage films.The overuse of lens flare, almost all computer generated, indicates utter lack of directorial creativity, and could only be abused by the hack who seek to gain only fortune instead of making the movie that actually respects the source materials, out of genuine love.The director and producers Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer should be ashamed that they have committed possibly the greatest desecration in the malformed adaptation of the comic book since Albert Pyun's spectacularly hideous Captain America (not to mention the offensive recent adaptations of certain established comic books with the heroes and Norse mythology characters in revisionist storytelling to mock and insult the specific audiences) and Roger Corman's rushed and mind- blowingly cheap production of Fantastic Four.I don't bash this film for comedy. I say this as having been the comic book collector and reader of Superman, including the original published comics from the Golden Age. This film is certainly not like Neal Adams' revision of Superman in character design and storytelling in the 70's.Instead, Man of Steel is close to what it might have been had it starred Nicolas Cage, complete with the giant spider and the fight sequence with the aggressive polar bears. When the movie concluded with the ending credit rolling, I watched for Jon Peters in the credit. There he is, as the executive producer.If the movie has the credit by Jon Peters, even if barely related, you'd know it's a stinkbomb that serve strictly as the ATM machine for the producers involved, that take the popular source material to strip of its cores in terms of common humanity to defile with sensationalism to render the movie unwatchable because corruption and absurdity pervades.The ""fight"" sequence towards the ending is so repetitive it is palpably tedious. I yawned throughout the movie. I had to pause between boring and extraneous scenes a few times, for the length of time, while I prepared dinner, read books and even text a friend about how damn awful the movie is, when I have not finished watching, barely past the first hour.I watched Man of Steel on Blu-ray rental at Redbox. Because I was too lazy to finish watching the movie in full, the rental period was extended to two days, and my money was ultimately thieved. This movie is, with all things considered, the thief of the audience's time and money.This said, at least Russell Crowe excels as an actor as usual, even if he phones his role in. The sequence with Russell narrating amidst the moving background was the only highlight of the movie, if somewhat pretentious.Man of Steel is a sacrelige, indeed, with irony noted which is in regards to the dishonest (source material polluting) producers and the comic book creators' intent.This movie accompanies Bruckheimer/Bay's production Armageddon and J.J. Abrams' Star Trek how NOT to direct the ""blockbuster"" movie. 1/2 out of four","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

The movie wastes no time and plunges the viewer into great action set pieces, while building the foundation for the movies lore. The characters are believable and their performances are very solid for this type of movie. The critiques who slam the movie for not having enough humor or for over the top action are completely unfounded in their arguments and just prove how arrogant they are, this is not 1970's, hero movies must retain a serious tone to be relevant nowadays.

There, he must blend in, as a normal human, until a group of revengeful survivals of the same Krypton threaten to ""clean"" Earth in order to restore their race.It's a superhero movie which presents the beginnings of Superman, his origins and how he became such a popular but mysterious character. Many events from his youth are also presented, thus slowly describing his evolution while desperately trying to keep his powers unknown to ordinary humans. It's packed up with action, drama and suspense, having a very serious approach in terms of plot and storytelling. And to be honest, I'm glad they chose this approach, as it made the whole idea a lot more suspenseful and dramatic, creating a catchy atmosphere. The visuals are top notch, every single sequence which features CGI looking simply astonishing; not to say that there are many, many of them. The plot is also well written and enrolled, making it a very good watch, especially thanks to its well designed and played characters.I really enjoyed this movie! It managed to keep me interested and entertained from start to finish, without being boring, exaggerated or over prolonged, while providing satisfaction with many of its actions and its finale. It is a very good film overall, the only thing that restrained me from giving it a full ten stars was the fact that it wasn't as wow as I expected it to be.

Well, both fail. All that is paired with a mediocre and pale super-hero in nylons. I'm not able to point something out what I did not saw much better before in another movie already.

And, somewhere along the way, Superman got lost. Yes, Henry Cavill was here playing the part, wearing a blue costume and red cape, but I'm talking about what you might call the spirit of Superman; the sense of fun that should be a part of this. It's based on a comic strip for goodness' sake. And what happened to truth, justice and the American way? Really, this just turned into a non-stop battle between Superman (or ""Kal"" as they called him - short for Kal-El) and General Zod (Michael Shannon.) And the fact that it was essentially non-stop meant that, really, it became quite dull, and there were points during the mayhem when I found myself thinking, ""good grief, not more."" But, yes, there was more. Always more.It just wasn't interesting. If all you care about are explosions and mayhem then it will satisfy, but if you care about story or characters or performances? Well, this is totally lacking in any of that. Cavill, Shannon or Amy Adams as Lois Lane? They all faded into the background, because the star of the movie was the overdone special effects and action.The most obvious comparison to Man of Steel would be Superman II in the Christopher Reeve series of movies. That one, in my opinion, was immeasurably better. It had a story that flowed well from beginning to end, whereas I found the story in Man of Steel - especially in the early going - to be disjointed and difficult to follow. The Reeve version also had the sense of fun added by Gene Hackman's portrayal of Lex Luthor, or even Margot Kidder's turn as Lois. There was no character in this that one could have fun with.With the emphasis on the alien ships and assorted ominous looking alien outfits, plus the explosions and spacecraft, one got the impression that director Zack Snyder really wanted to do a Star Wars-Superman hybrid, with the emphasis definitely on Star Wars.

Well I can safely say that overtime, my view on this film had changed a good amount. For the most part. Let's talk about the positives first.Henry Cavil just owned the role of Superman. Even if he didn't really have much dialogue to say, you can still get the sense that he captured the spirit and the overall nature of who Superman is and what does it mean to have someone with this special kinda of power, as well to protect the people around him. It's all handled pretty well, and the performance from Cavil helps out that as well. Michael Shannon was very convincing as Zod. Sure he went a bit over the top at times, but he did put so much passion and care in his performance to make things convincing and you understand the motivation behind his character as the film goes on. I thought he was a great villain as Shannon is usually a great actor.Some other noticeable performances I want to mention and they're Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner as Kal-El's fathers. They were both very good as the two separate fathers and they both give good motivations with their characters to help Kal-El to understand what does it mean to have these types of powers and how he can used them for the uses that are needed and when to use them to be a symbol of hope.Which it's another thing I did liked about this film is that isn't really afraid to dive into the meaning of being Superman and how much can it accomplish wonders. Even though it doesn't always work, you still get the sense that the central theme does play a big part of the development of how Kal-El is learning as the film goes on and he had to learn the both the good and danger side to this type of power. Zack Snyder is a director that I admired for quite some time. Even though his films aren't masterpieces (expect for Watchmen obviously) I think he's a pretty good director who know what he's doing and this film is a good example of it. He gets a clear and very different view of Superman while also paying respect to the lore of what Superman is. Not to mention that's he's really good with the work behind the camera with the nice looking cinematography, entertaining action sequences, good effects and not to mention that Hans Zimmer's score is uplifting and powerful.Now I do have some problems with the film and I'm going to discuss them for a bit. For one, I felt that there some storytelling issues that felt a bit out field and not really straightforward enough like it should have been. Also some of the symbolism (particularly with its religious metaphors) as well its attempts at humour don't feel subtle enough to be strong but rather feel painfully obvious to take me out of the experience for a bit.But even with it's flaws, I found Man of Steel a pretty underrated and entertaining comic book film that don't deserves all of the hate it's getting.Sure I can understand were the negative side is coming from. But I personally found the film more grounded, more ambitious and more confident than most superhero/comic book films out there thanks to it's clever directing, strong performances, entertaining action and effects, and how it tried to go deep into the character of Superman while also respecting the lore of Superman bold and proud. So I say it's worth seeing if you want to take a stand on the films reaction. Just don't expect the typical Superman your normally used to.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Bryan Singer _, how we thought then, cemented the fate of the Superman movie franchise. Although solidly directed, it was a long and sometimes boring movie with almost no action scenes and the main advantage was visually spectacular Superman lifting mountain into space. huge budget was not justified , film failed at the box office.but behold, the devil could not rest, apparently C. Nolan needed some money and decided to produce a new Superman adventure.trailers have been promising, action packed with spectacular visual effects, but on big screen, it all looks a lot different. film is surprisingly dull. action scenes are endless , awkward staged (Snyder directed the whole movie with only one camera, which is unacceptable for a movie of such proportions), and when  action miraculously ends  , then we have endless babbling and irritating flashbacks of young Clark Kent . What I was particularly astounded by were almost unfinished CGI that does not look good and extremely fake. snyder tries  to make this movie epic , but unfortunately there is no knowledge or talent. one of the few positive things: the soundtrack is not bad , solid acting and Henry Cavill is certainly the best superman since legendary Christopher Reeve.but the 'man of steel', mainly due to aggressive marketing, sails very good at world box office , and it doesn't have to be afraid of singers shipwreck from 2006.It took me seven years to figure out that 'Superman Returns' is actually a good movie while 'man of steel' together with 'after earth' is perhaps the worst blockbuster this year so far..","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

They could have complicated or shown more hardship of superman being accepted by humans. The last 30 minute of the fight in the movie was very boring to watch. It seems like every comic movies adapting to this epic battle where all the buildings falls and makes it like its going to be end of the world but we all know its going to be saved by the hero.

The Krypton origin back story of Superman is unfortunately pretty tame and does not define him for what he went on to become on Earth. Director Zack Snyder (he of the flops ""Sucker Punch"", Dawn of the Dead"" fame) and co producer/co writer Chris Nolan try and add new elements to Superman's character like edginess, violence, grimness, grittiness but the end result is still pedestrian. Nolan, in fact, tries to do a Batman to Superman but fails spectacularly. First half of the movie shows some potential but the second half is just an excruciatingly boring slug fest of explosions, fights, clashes, crashes, flying, tumbling, falling etc. We have seen it all in umpteen movies before. ""Man of Steel"" has nothing new to offer in the 2nd half. It gets so tiresome that the viewer needs to have nerves of steel to sit though the entire second half. Whatever little Snyder managed to build up in the pre-interval phase, he destroys it in the last 45 minutes of mind numbing action.As for the lead actor, Henry Cavill, he certainly looks the part but his granite face remains just that (stiff and stony) for the better part of the movie. Cavill is definitely an improvement on Brandon Routh of ""Superman Returns"" but Christopher Reeve still remain the actor the role continues to be identified with. Even though the rest of the star cast comprises of such acting heavy weights like Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Amy Adams, the movie remains distinctly underwhelming on the emoting front thanks to their characters being sketchily conceived. In the end ""Man of Steel"" is neither style nor substance. The movie must rank as this summer's biggest disappointment. ""Man of Steel"" is just an expensive, soul less, dumb, long drawn and lazy spectacle. And in my book that is worth only 2 out of 5 stars. PS - True blue Superman comic fans will never forgive Zack Snyder for killing off Costner's character in a way which is absolutely different from what happens in the comic and therefore taking off all the significance of that event.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I found that superman returns was disappointing because it lacked dialogue and character formation. I was excited that the man of steel was taking on the story from the beginning, and had the opportunity to make the viewer fall in love with the much loved characters all over again... The trailers were fantastic and I was hyped and expected great things. My highlight was the beginning- the character of Jor- El was admirable, a great beginning. But from there it was down hill. Unfortunately I found that not only was there a lack of character development and relationship development with the main characters; there were certain lines that were crossed that ought never be so - to be true to the characters and all they represent. Jonathan would never disregard the importance of life under any circumstance. Superman himself seemed to lack humility and wasn't as self assured in his values/ priorities. The action and collateral damage took away from supermans purpose in defending life. From a female perspective, the romance was an utter disappointment. The romance was totally a side show and is normally so essential to the superman story - you can't believe they could have fallen for each other in 3 or so uninspiring scenes! Overall and besides there was way to much action compared to dialogue - there was no chance to get to fall in love with the characters. They sold the story short for a few big action scenes.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry were excellent as the young Clark Kents, having to deal with the emergence of super powers at age nine and the necessity of not smashing ignorant bullies at age 13. Amy Adams as Lois Lane did a fine job, but she was in on the secret identity from the get-go, having ferreted it out as the great reporter she portrayed. We had many shots of Adams' interesting nose in profile. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were Martha and Jonathan Kent. Laurence Fishburne was Perry White, and Jimmy Olson was not there at all. There were a couple of funny spots, but not many. One thing that bothered me, however, was the references comparing Superman to Christ. After speaking to his father, Jor-el (Russell Crowe) Superman ascends in a pose with arms outstretched and legs together, as though crucified. A scene in a church places him in front of a large stained-glass portrayal of the Sermon on the Mount, and we are told at least twice that he started his work at age 33. This worked with E. T., but it did not work here. Still, we thought it was a good movie, and I recommend it for all Superman fans.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Also with Zack Snyder at the helm, I was very excited to go and see it.I was very impressed with the beginning sequence, with a great opening to the film, an introduction to Kent's parents and the Villain, General Zod. However, from then on in I felt the film was rushed; squeezing in an explosion at any chance possible. I have thought of multiple plot holes which have angered me. The scenario in which when something/ someone was falling, predictably Superman would always save it. I know that sort of sounds like what Superman is meant to do, but I lost count for how many times something was falling, if you get what I mean. Also the amount of destruction in the conclusion was just, too much. FAR too much.People like this film.

Being a fan of Snyder's Watchmen I had high hopes from this movie since I saw its teaser before TDKR. There are some scenes in this that will bring a smile on your face, make you gasp and make you say ""awesome"". However, it's an origin movie and we all know some part of the story before going in the theater. It was really a tough job for the story writer to make it a new story and he did deliver. I have not seen the Reeves movies so I can't compare it with them. I don't know what critics were expecting from this since they have been complaining about too much action. It's a movie about an alien or a GOD from another planet and how he tackles some of his own who are as powerful as him. And the only way a director can go about it is use CGI and make things explode. Let's talk about the actors now, Henry cavill does a good playing an alien child lost in the new planet. You will feel his pain and his confusion when he's growing up. But it was Antje Traue who stole the show for me. She was brilliant and ruthless in her character. Overall, I just want to say that it's the Superman for the year 2013, an alien brought up on earth who behaves like a human and had to make some tough choices as he grows up. Trust me, you'll be satisfied when you leave the theater if you're ready for a change.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

What I also love seeing is his conflict in how the world will react to his existence and rightfully so, and to quote perry white ""can you imagine how the world would react knowing someone like this is out there"" and he is right. What we have here is a superman who is finally relatable who was brought up with human ideals and feelings, even when clark finally meets his real father and learns of his true origins and aspiration to be the beacon of hope for both the people of earth and krypton he still holds the love and admiration for his earth parents especially his adopted mother who also in very heartfelt scenes shows even if he was an alien she still loves her son and vice versa clark is willing to protect.The cat and mouse interaction between lois and clark was also fun to watch and the chemistry shows on screen between the two and very reminiscent to what Donner was trying to accomplish in his cut of superman 2 (minus lois pretending to have a loaded gun)We also see superman fully tested physically, only partially seen in the donner films and limited to the special effects of the day, what we have here is a full blown fight between two gods taken to the limit and what would happen. Even Richard Donner himself stated this was what he planned on having his version of superman 2 be in terms of two super beings fighting, but again limited to the effects of the time, the fact that he absolutely loves the film is also a passing of the torch from director to director.What I also love about the movie is that it puts superman in a choice scenario, some people seem to have an issue with it yet are ok with with chris reeves superman depowering, crushing the hand of zod and then ultimately killing zod by throwing him into oblivion while smiling about it when he had the choice to have him arrested and put in prison.What I love in this movie is that superman instantly regrets the choice he had to make, it was the last of his kind and had to make a choice to save a famil on his adopted home world and you absolutely feel for the guy.Sure you can have a hopeful superman but I dont want a superman smiling ALL THE TIME like some lunatic. Lois asks him for a divorce oh its ok because he is superman and he smiles lol uh no people tend to forget he was raised on earth, even superman the movie showed a glimps of that emotion when he suffered loss but didnt learn from it as he just reversed time.What worked in the 80's failed to work in the 06 movie, we have here is a superman who learns from his actions, the consequences behind those actions and nothing is sugar coated.What we have here is an AWESOME superman movie for modern times.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The casting for a huge catastrophe, Henry Cavill as Superman was not working, his acting was so forced that sometimes I actually sad for him, I mean the effort he had to put to get the emotion out. All the other characters also felt out of place, not natural. I seemed like its was all forced, I don't how to articulate this better, but that is the way i felt, unnatural.

Bottom line.. worth watching for the special effects and some really crash bang make everything blow up and come crashing down scenes. But not a movie to write home about.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The best fighting scene in a history of superhero movie, it was stunned me to my seat with my open wided mouth, when you're using a word super, thats what you should do, hardcore smashing and jet packed flying.. Amy adams never looked so enchanting and smart before, shes quite good for the smart and strong lois lane role here, and also the perfect cast for a superman, not a good sweetie boy who loved to smile with his red underwear. The stories for the origin of superman, was really smart, mixing the comical and science thing, it's just complete.

The critics have certainly had a field day with it. It has been said that the movie lacks depth and it doesn't deliver dramatically, it's been said that it closes with too much noise and exaggerated action and too much effects. But what some people had failed to notice is that this movie is quite rich in story and character purposes. I will admit that I thought it has some plot holes or the build-up felt kind of accelerated at some points, but when you have a superhero that's so recognized, you just don't need a lot of stuff to be aware of what he is about.But even so, I thought that they developed the character pretty well. And they give him a majestic background, they really took the time to established the situation that came before him being sent to Earth by his natural parents. Some critics say that he lacks emotion and ""passion"" but if you really pay attention to the movie, you'll understand why he is the way he is. Other people has said that General Zod was not as stunning and impressive as they were expecting him to be, but I don't think that he needed to be this intensely evil character. I mean, he had a purpose, a belief, and he was a soldier, and I think that it was well established and portrayed. You only see his eyes and you can see how menacing and scary he can be. Another thing, Faora, Zod's right hand, was as hot as she was amazing.And yes, the movie had a lot of action and effects, not as much as Transformers, but it was indeed loud and overwhelming, but I don't mean it in a bad way. But let's face it, if you had superpowers and some alien who's also super powerful comes down to Earth and he's like ""I'm gonna get you and your whole planet"" and starts causing problems, you're gonna go to town on this dude, and you're gonna break some stuff and have a super destructive fight. It was kinda painful to see how far the destruction went and it would've been decent to add like a line of dialogue or something to point out that the destruction was massive and probably a lot of people died.So yeah, the movie had some things that might have been too much and some not enough, but it doesn't mean that the movie wasn't amazing and breath-taking. I believe that it was an excellent jump-start if they're planning on going with the whole justice league thing or if they'll do a sequel. I believe they really made the statement: Superman is back and here to stay. Go watch it.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

That being said, Superman is not my favorite superhero but its one that deserves a worthy movie, which I've been expecting for a long time now. And I must say it blew my mind.Everything you might want out of a Superman movie,its right there. It's action packed,it's fast paced, and the introduction in Krypton was already worth my money. I thought that being the first Superman movie again and having to go through the introduction again would make it slow but they handled it amazingly well. The cast is extremely well chosen,and Cavill makes a perfect Superman. I also loved how we get to see a villain that is,well, evil, instead of some poor misunderstood guy that takes it out on everyone. We get a villain that truly believes in his cause and doesn't care about the rest.Superman finally gets the movie it deserves, im just so glad that it happened and im gonna watch it again really soon.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The origins of the central character are better depicted in the movie as compared to the previous versions of Superman. The screenplay is good. Some of the dialogues were worth listening to, which gave a brief glimpse of Christopher Nolan's writing.Other than the above points the rest of the movie is pretty much disappointing. First, the story is just a rehashed account of the previous superman movies combining parts of superman and superman 2. There was no new angle or perspective to the story as is expected with movies written by Chris Nolan. Being a Nolan fan my sole reason for watching this movie was because of his association with it. I am sad to say that I am let down by the storyline.Secondly the computer graphics used in the movie leaves the viewer disoriented and confused as to what is actually happening. So for god sake people, please save your money and don't see this movie in 3D.Acting is mediocre especially in the case of Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Russell Crowe holds his ground but that's about it. No one comes even remotely close to his standard.More was expected from Zack Snyder but I suppose after directing ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" his creative output has taken a downward plunge.Honestly, the movie could have been better and more entertaining. But in its current form the movie does not do justice to the hype surrounding it. If you really want to see it then I suppose you could wait for a couple of weeks till the hype and the ticket prices go down.Overall rating: 5 / 10","23 out of 75 found this helpful.

My father and I went in without knowing anything about Zack Snyder's version of Superman. We watched it in 3D and boy o! boy, from start we were glued to the screen, those fast paced scenes on Krypton looks beautiful and show what's next to come from Zack Snyder.Seeing the back story of Clark Kent in some what similar manner to what Nolan did to Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins was very innovative and even if there was problems with pacing in the first half, it was entertaining and transformation from Clark Kent to ""Kal El"" (Superman was refereed to Kal El in this one) was did perfectly.The cast was spot on, acting was great too (Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner did justice to their roles). We also get to see a different perspective on Clark Kent story though eyes of lovely Lois Lane (Amy Adams). When you actually see Henry Cavill in that suit that is when you will start loving this movie even more, he looks amazing in that costume, and we get to see him fly first time is just a masterpiece of a scene, no other can give you such a trilling visual experience in 3D like Zack Snyder do.Then there's General Zod (Michael Shannon) and Faora-Ul (the beauty that was Antje Traue). Micheal Shannon plays General Zod with such rage, when you hear him you can feel the intensity he brings to the character. Antje Traue does her role in such a fashion you want to be on her side the whole movie (probably my favorite character from MOS). Both (General Zod and Faora-Ul) and many of other Kryptonians were more than worthy foes. The plan of General Zod was not just a full on attack , it was very strategical. When the plan is implemented one would thing what can Superman do about it. The damage to city was destructive. Oh! and the fight in the end between Kal El and General Zod was icing on the cake.Watch it to believe it, don't listen to critics (who do it nowadays, really), my father throughly enjoyed it as much as i do. All in all 10/10, Superb 3D entertainment and fantastic plot, acting and direction. Henry Cavill will definitely go down as Superman of our generation. MOS 2! we are waiting...*puts the laptop aside and off to see MOS again.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Nobody cares about the moral conflicts of Superman, the villains, the citizens of Metropolis or his romantic interest. Superman is the greatest hero of all for not being an idiot but here he is. He is fragile, incapable of making key decisions, allowing problems to grow until they become unmanageable, and ultimately wasting his talents to put on a colorful and memorable show. The film is long and the plot tedious. When with greater production possibilities you can't even match the charm of Cannon's Superman, you have a very serious problem.

The film is beautiful in design, the actors are top notch, the non chronological story works perfectly (as it did in batman begins) and the story is humble. Only the best written stories can make you feel sorry for the bad guys, some examples (Monster, Return of the Jedi, The Godfather) and Man of Steel joins that list, I found it hard to route against Zod in this film and that connects you to the same struggle Clark Kent finds himself in. This film doesn't feel like a popcorn, corny, camp, comic book movie; although the action lends itself to one. It is a film about an outsider, a loner, a bully victim, a homosexual in today's society. It is about every insecurity we have ever experienced all in one man. This is all written perfectly into the guise of Superman, and that is exactly why this story is still so compelling after 70 odd years. It connected with me and I am sure everyone else in the cinema had the same reaction in one way or another. We have not all flown around faster than a speeding bullet, but we have all been and felt different to everyone else at one point in our lives - and this film is an adaptation of that feeling. I can understand people disliking the length of the film, and the detail of the back story, but we must appreciate those things were needed to be told to set up the rest of the story. Henry is now Superman in my eyes, not anyone before him, The Man of Steel has the power of the world and more and can practically do as he wishes; and I never got that feeling from the late great Christopher Reeve ( and this is why I find it better than the original)but I get it from Henry, although Henry could not shape this character without his predecessor.Nolan can make a man in a cape seem deep and pensive, not silly looking(Watchmen), Nolan has took watching ""Superhero"" movies from the shelf of (don't let them catch me watching) and (It's something the kids will like) to (Lets watch a detective film about corruption and love called The Dark Knight) He is changing the whole game, and this film supports that. This is only the first chapter in the retelling of what should have always been a monumental, serious and introspective story, and I cannot wait for chapter two.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

There's not a whole lot of depth to any of the goings-on tho. MOS steals from a bunch of other movies. The early counsel scene is taken directly from the 2nd/3rd Matrix movie. MOS / Henry Cavill stole scenes directly from Wolverine's X-Files formative persona. The fight scenes especially at the end stole directly from the 3rd Matrix movie (I really thought Neo and Smith were going to fly by for cameos). The City sequences reminded me of Independence Day. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) reminded me of Kate Mara in House of Cards (but with more clothes on). I know the plot's driven by the comic book, but can't we do better in the rationale department? Folks on Krypton just got stupid one afternoon? Hey, speaking of the Matrix, I see MOS borrowed the Matrix's general for essentially the same role. Don't forget to bring a pair of good earplugs to this loud-fest of predictable CGI-dominated caped extravaganzas.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I didn't want to spoil anything for myself. I knew that a lot of critics were saying that it's a flop of a film, but I went in with a blank slate. I was open to whatever the film had to show. I was pleasantly blown away. The music was excellent. Sets the mood and ends up being a very iconic sound for this Superman reboot. The visuals were excellent. The sci-fi elements were so well-done that I cannot wait to see more. The CGI was excellent - I noticed it only a few times. The action was excellent - the fights were choreographed beautifully and the film is quite brutal despite the PG-13 rating. The acting was excellent - the villains are menacing and threatening and the supporting actors do a great job.The character development is subtle at times but it's prevalent if you pay attention to each character's struggle. As an origin story and a first-villain story, Man of Steel had a notable amount of character development and history jam-packed into two hours and thirty-five minutes of footage. I would say that the vocal critics are forgetting that this is the first film. This is not to concede that there is poor character development or story, though - there is plenty and there is much potential for more in the future.Go watch the film. There's really nothing negative I can say - I just wish it was longer. ;)","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The movie is targeted for the mass that is interested only in visual effects and will not notice an absence of proper storyline. I have the feeling that Nolan was not even aware of the creation of the movie, cause there was nothing from him: Nor deepness of the characters,neither any kind of intrigue in the plot. The original story of Superman contains everything that is interesting for nowadays public and is more than enough for a good movie creation and you are probably a mediocrity if you have managed to spoil all these. The worst of all was presented the relationship between the Superman and his EARTH parents, I mean how would the Superman let his father die only to keep his secret uncovered, considering that the main strength (and probably the biggest wеаkness) of the Superman has been always his absolute self-sacrifice, which was not presented in movie at all.

I have always been a great believer in watching a film expecting nothing and accepting it in its genre. Don't watch this movie and expect a period epic. Having said that if you like comic book movies then this is the nuts!Therefore, I'm not going to moan about what Superman would and would not do. Superman is an icon and in this film you see a true representation of an alien trying to fit in on Earth (as much as we Earthlings can portray it I guess).Henry Cavill is great as Kal-el and fills the boots nicely nicely. The plot moves from his birth on Krypton to his acceptance on Earth as you would expect and Snyder paces the story perfectly.The action and effects are superb and the soundtrack is thumpingly good.Do yourself a favour and leave your preconceptions at the door and just enjoy a very well crafted movie that will have you entertained throughout.I personally think that Zack Snyder is the right man to bring the DC canon to the screen in spectacular fashion and this is just the start of a lot of awesomeness to come.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I enjoyed Superman Returns and was hoping that this movie would equal or surpass that one, and keep the franchise alive. I was severely disappointed.How can you start to make a Superman movie, with so many plot angles to take, and just end up with a documentary on how to CGI a complete city destruction? The action sequences which occupy the last half of the movie were stultifyingly boring, with missiles firing, planes crashing, people being blown up, buildings falling over, and Zod and Superman duking it out like two Hulks going at it. This made the movie seem much longer than it was. Good for GCI buffs, but inappropriate for portraying the Superman character. in all prior movies, the important character point would be that there are 100s if not 1000s of people that need to be saved in those building, and Superman would try to save them. Yet obviously people are killed and maimed when Zod and Superman battle, and the movie showed no concern, or even images, of their plight, other than a few of his colleagues of the Daily Planet. In all prior Superman movies, this disdain for human collateral damage would have been unheard of. What little story was contained in a few scenes with his Earth mother and father, portrayed by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, and their scenes were the emotional anchor for the entire movie. But all that was contained in a few minutes of flashback. Russell Crowe should not have been in the movie at all, for all the impact he made. It was ironic that for most of the movie he played a hologram that could be shut off by inserting a keyfob into a keyhole.I disliked the Superman character from the number of standpoints: First is his physical presence, because he has a super-human physique as a young man. He stands out among the crowd, so how can you suspend your realization that this guy is built like a muscle- bound weightlifter, and possibly can perform super-human feats of strength. Second his appearance as a young man made him appear moody and foreboding, to the point he almost looked menacing. Not exactly the mental image one has of a young Clark Kent. If they got that characterization wrong, you can imagine how wrong they got Lois Lane.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

He last bowed out in 2006- when Bryan Singer attempted to revive the hero with the help of Brandon Routh- generating extreme divide between audiences and critics, some liking the old-fashioned feel, others wishing for a darker tone. Finally, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have delivered a film worthy of high praise, Superman is back, on the big screen, done away with the campy garbage we should have left behind with 'Superman IV' in the year 1987.Have you ever seen a superhero movie as visually enchanting as 'Man of Steel'? Snyder has brought his striking cinematography to the table, four years after showing the world his visual talents with Watchmen- a movie which feels similar to 'Man of Steel' in terms of some of the questions the two movies bring up. I bet if you were to mute the film and leave it on in the background, you would still find the imagery on display here to be, at the very least, engaging and attractive. Superman- and his surroundings- have never looked as good before.Structurally, 'Man of Steel' works to perfection. The first hour is pure, unfiltered build-up and character development. Considering the amount of balls that Snyder has to juggle in terms of character pieces, every notable cast member as a story arc that is beyond strong enough. Even Russell Crowe, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner's characters feel real, despite their lack of screen presence. The pacing of the movie is also excellent. Enough action to satisfy our needs, but not too much that we long for the movie to cut back to the quieter moments.I love the way the film brings up Superman's humanity. Where does he lie, with his Kryptonian past, or his faux human background? Ultimately, he choses to become human- to subside his birth race and fulfil his father's wishes in giving ""the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards""- making the film much more complex than being your standard superhero fare.Why the hate? Because Superman isn't perfect? Because he makes mistakes and sometimes choses to show his human side? I don't get it. This movie is Superman at his finest. Pure excellence- Snyder's greatest achievement.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Everyone know how well Nolan's films are made with a humane nature touch for the superhero & interweaving between scenes & characters.Everyone including me loved the Batman series reboot along with Inception & The Prestige,since it's one of kind of Top notch Films made in Hollywood.The trailers provided much hope for me to watch the film,since I believed that it could have a quality like the Nolan's films earlier had.Watching ""Man of Steel"" in First day,First Show,I realized that all the gimmicks thrown out in the Trailer is better to watch than the Original movie.Trailer is the most comfortable to watch than the whole Movie.In a nutshell,""Man of Steel"" is a Superman movie episode,with Transformers 3_The Dark of Moon climax plot with some expansion of his origin ,with a confusing Nolan Touch.Most Superhero movies made recently like Ironman-3 & The Avengers are like a regular blockbuster movie with thrilling Special effects,Actions & a simple story thread.I know that with Nolan on Superman side,I could never expect such a thing here & I don't but the product I saw was a totally confusing ,boring as well as Dumbest Film I have seen recently.I expected the confusing element would be there,there was only confusion & nothing innovative or smarter things are in here.Bad cinematography as well as confusing editing & bad performance from actors make this movie,you should avoid watching anytime soon.Editing is done in such a way to provide more depth to the movie & it was an utter failure.Cinematography was below average for such a massive budget superhero flick & is very ordinary.Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel is one of sorry figures of this movie.His presence as the Superman is not convincing enough for me & has a emotionless face every time you see him.Initial scenes including Russell Crowe provided some thrills & it ended there.Michael Shannon has a rude face from the Beginning to End & I don't know how his performance is praised by some critics as Top Class on other reviews.Amy Adams has a smiling face for major period in the Film & worthless to watch.Some special effects are worth to watch & it is only thing that Man of Steel can boast of.I could say Christopher Nolan tried to elevate The SuperMan similar to his Batman series reboot but the end result was that of boring & worst movie you would expect.If you don't know the SuperMan before,you could have some fun but even if you know,you should never leave the eyes & attention of screen .If that happens,you can leave the theatre failing to understand what the hell just happened in front of me..","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I do prefer the darker more complex Superman, I thought Henry looked the part and the new suit was cool. While I knew they were going for the ""summer blockbuster"" style film, I was still hopeful that there might be some substance and that Chris Nolan's involvement (albeit limited) would finally help Hollywood produce a Superman winner. I was so very wrong.I wanted to like this film so much that I was willing to overlook the terrible writing and seemingly useless acting that was evident very early in the movie. I really tried to accept the overwhelming crash-bang computer generated action. BUT, to be completely honest, this movie could not have been much worse. In addition to the almost boring level of destruction going on throughout, the film seemed to have multiple different endings, all of which were lame. It was as if they filmed a couple of dozen scenes that would look good in the trailers, and completely overlooked the story.A really well written sequel could help salvage this reboot effort, but my gut tells me this is another failed reboot effort. Nonetheless, if you like big explosions and mindless 3D action, you're in luck.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I didn't hate it. I did hate much of it. Much of the 2-1/2 hours involved machines blowing up other machines. There were also machines ramming into other machines. And sometimes people slamming into other people. Much of this happened on Krypton, so it didn't matter, the place was doomed anyhow. But a lot of it happened on Earth, and caused some pretty bad destruction in Smallville and Metropolis. (A pretty funny line: Superman asks the residents of Smallville to stay inside and lock the doors. But when Zod & Superman to at each other, they knock each other threw the walls of multiple product-placement sponsors: 7-11, IHOP, etc.) No one on the Daily Planet crew could possibly survive the destruction in Metropolis, yet were supposed to believe and care about this bunch of intrepid reporters.So, I would prefer this movie if all of THAT stuff were removed, and we were just left with the bits where Clark tries to get control of his superpowers (loved where Clark could not stop using his xray vision, and saw too much), the scenes with Ma & Pa Kent, the scenes in Newfoundland on the fishing boats. I like the flying scenes in this version because you really get a sense of super speed--it never seemed like the other supermen were going really fast.So, for my viewing, I propose a totally expurgated, 1/2-hour version of the movie. Needn't be 3D--two dimensions would be plenty. Oh, and I'd use the score from the the Chris Reeve Superman movie--I kept wanting for it to come on. Also, do not spend more than, say, $1 million on special effects. And turn down the sound effects--maybe just get the sound effects guy from Prairie Home Companion to do all the effects.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Superman it's an almost impossible task to acomplish bringing the reality to the screen. That being said, the fact that a successful director took a clean perception of the needs of the situation and the concern of the public, instead of the box office approach,got him the task done. The perception that there is so much controversy, made the film a success. That makes fans and reviewers watch it more than once if they want to get a better idea of the reasons of why they hated or loved it. The Nolan- Snyder collaboration triumphs within the complains due to a simple fact, good writing. A good script appeals to each part of a story. People need to remember that grounding a god like creature like superman requires more than just special effects, and trough the narrative and the deep compromise of the story telling of it's actors, the movie told the story by different angles. What it's more important to remember it's that this superman was taken to a different era, the twenty first century that it's a complete different Millennium in comparison with the movies from the last century, even the last decade movies. We require a superman that needs to be real in every aspect,and an actor that can carry that legacy. The superman suit is more like an armour, that's heavy and extremely complicated to move in, and Henry Cavill made an amazing fit in that armour. Good story telling it's hard to find, specially in Hollywood, when reboot and remake are trademarks that come and go every year, and good script writers are so few. In a world when every movie it 's trying to portrait the realistic focus of the real life of the people, a real hero needs to be characterized with the maximum care of his origins and close to life conflicts. To make a godlike creature get grounded in a mortal world, the director made an amazing job utilizing the best technology, the most innovative tools and great post production editing. Let's remember that superman it's not a real being, it's an aspiration so culturalized that had brought the world to the fascination with this sci fi persona, even making it an archetype of the new era. Snyder gave the world the most real man of steel that this era could have being given.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't think that the high frequency of fighting and length of each bout contributed to the storyline.If the speed at which the men or women were fighting were slowed down and the number of fights reduced, perhaps I would have enjoyed the combat a bit more.Overall I'm glad that I saw ""Man of Steel.""","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I couldn't have imagined a better modern Lois Lane than lovely Amy Adams and Michael Shannon is a great Zod, so casting is top notch. Of course, a bit of Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne and Russell Crowe as supporting actors didn't hurt either. And I expect to hear more from the delicious Antje Traue.When one thinks of Superman, they get an image which is more or less different based on when that person was born. You have the funny old Superman, flying in his pajamas in comic books, you have Christopher Reeves battling a diabolical Gene Hackman, maybe one of the TV series Supermen or even a cartoon Superman, either from TV or some console game. The fact is that it is increasingly difficult to talk about the same character with so many reinventions in as many eras. In the 21th century, Lois Lane is an independent woman who doesn't need to swoon over Superman and she knows that he is Clark Kent, even under the clever disguise of large rimmed glasses. The origin story is also retouched a little, with a very nice intro on Krypton, laden with special effects.I liked that the space and ship camera work (as well as some of the supporting cast) were borrowed from Battlestar Galactica. The same slightly shaky quick zooms and camera turns, like there is an observer in space eager to record events. The 3D touch interface that the aliens used was also interesting, as design goes, even if I think it would have been impractical in real life.So overall a very good Superman movie (considering the bar was very low to begin with), but there were things that were not as good. One of them is the physics of things. Very difficult to gauge what level of physical violence will hurt or not a Kryptonian, as they seem to respond randomly to varying methods of attack or to forces like inertia. New York is destroyed almost completely just because sir Punch-a-lot would not fight in a field or a small town and kept going to space and then returning to smash in the buildings of New York again. After he has finished with Zod, the Big Apple must have looked like an Apple logo. The fighting also took a lot of time out of the movie in detriment of character building scenes.But I think that what is the best feature of Superman is that none of the characters is stupid. Zod is brutal and, from our standpoint, probably insane, but he has layers of complexity that show him acting within reason. His fascist female sidekick is also believable as a villain. The military, as outgunned as they are, don't act like complete morons. Superman is not just acting cool, he is also capable of thought. I really enjoyed a film that doesn't treat its audience like it's too stupid to understand complex characters.Bottom line: for a Superman movie, this is probably one of the best, if not the best. A well chosen Lex Luthor will probably make the new revamped Superman be even cooler in the sequels. I would love to see a sequel with Doomsday as the villain, too! Not much humor in the film, though. I felt that as a loss.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Though they have intermittent moments of faith to the source material (comics) it is clear they wanted to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the original series (Superman I,II, III, IV: The Quest for Peace, Returns and Supergirl).Gone are the crystals of yore, replaced with what doesn't look that unlike graphite. A change that initially aggravated me, but began to grow on me very damn quickly, especially after I saw just how encompassing they were with the technology (see the Moon Nazi meets Space Jockey gasmask above for reference).Michael Shannon (Bug) is a great General Zod, and though his voice lacks the commanding presence of Terrence Stamp from the original, his character is written much better, and so Shannon is able to take the role to a far superior place than Richard Donner ever did.When all is said and done, Man of Steel was well worth whatever hurdles had to be crossed to make it. It succeeds as a piece of entertainment, and sets up a pretty great mythos to ground the future in. Probably not for a Justice League film (an idea which has never enthused me) but most certainly for a second Superman film (which I actually rather look forward to).I did, however, have a multitude of issues, not least being ""Why the Hell does Superman mystically find a suit with his house-sigil on an unrelated space ship? More importantly, why is his the only one that has colour?"". The most of which however, was the needless destruction. Violence doesn't phase me in the least, but I like to see it done right.Single punches sending your enemy flying through a couple dozen skyscrapers for 25 minutes straight is not ""done right"". Especially not when these fights are performed almost entirely with very poor CG. It's like they haven't progressed in technology from Blade II (despite it being released over a decade ago).

Good CGI and VFX, perfect cinematography, good story, good acting, OP characters, perfect action, good music to set the scene. The list goes on. And now I'll mention the short list of cons. It didn't show Clark and Lois's relationship well enough, and it didn't really have anything that hooked you in/not very interesting.

It all started back in the late 30s but his name was just Superboy, then as the years and decades progressed this great phenomenon became the truth, the justice and the American way. Superman has graced our lives and hearts for 75 years ever since that one comic book hit the newsstands back in 1938 and now with digitally enhanced supersonic strength and digitally mastered special effects, we begin to hope again.This movie has outshone every facet of this superhero's life from the very first appearance on television with George Reeves to the incomparable Christopher Reeve then it went onto Dean Cain then television did it right again with Tom Welling then it went good with Brandon Routh and now the red and the blue returns for a new chapter with Henry Cavill as he joins this elite squad of the red blue blur.Everything about Man of Steel, was perfectly done and at the helm of it all Zack Snyder, who brought us Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Legends of the Guardians, Sucker Punch and now Man of Steel. And right beside him was the Batman Trilogy director Chris Nolan – excellent and superb job well done. The graphics, the CGI, the effects both sound and special – were out of this world.Speaking ""out of this world"", I am reminded of what Jor-El once told his son Kal-El, ""Krypton lives inside of you wherever you go."" Superman a.k.a. Clark Kent will live inside all of us from now and into eternity.RIP = George Reeves (1959), and Christopher Reeves (2004)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have a little boy.Getting straight to the point, I gave a vote of 9 because my father, in his mid-sixties, simply could not enjoy it the way I did. I think the film does a brilliant job of combining the histories set in other media (comics, television, other films, etc.) while at the same time, forging its own path. The acting is superb; the storyline is deep and playful. I truly hope the same team can come together to make another.Seeing movies on the big screen is a tradition with my father and I. We like to discuss our opinions about plot, depth, computer animation, etc. The best way I can describe his dissatisfaction is that he ""wouldn't keep up"". Physically, his eyes aren't what they used to be and we compared action scenes with The Avengers. Again, to the point, Superman is FAST - a fact they make very clear in the movie. Understanding how my dad's aging vision ""works"", I understand how the action scene speed in Avengers was exciting for him, but headache-inducing in Man of Steel.And it is the headache that really gives Man of Steel a 9 because the storyline is also quick in terms of plot development. There's a lot of history to cover with Superman and again, I think the team does a great job of paying respects. To cover all of the bases as well as do something new, I think that it be ""quick"" was always a necessity for the storyline. Does it move along too quickly? My father thought so, but I did not. I can't help but feel, though, knowing him as I do, that his opinion turned sour early on because of animation. Just the facts, though :)So, before I wrote this review, I decided to go see it again by myself. I loved it. Forgive the cheesy-ness, but I think it's pretty fair to say this team forges the Man of Steel right in front of you.But how can I give a 10 to a wonderful father-son story that my father didn't like??? If my son likes it when he's old enough to appreciate it in a few years, perhaps I'll come back and change my vote :)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In this current post-Dark Knight cinematic landscape, and with Christopher Nolan on board as producer, some feared it would be too dark and too macabre; losing the innocent playfulness and wish-fulfilment excitement that has always been at its heart. This incarnation of Supes is undeniably a brooding one – backed up by a story that is firmly set in the present day and includes omissions of traditional Superman lore that audiences of today just wouldn't swallow – however it never loses sight of its number one priority: to entertain the whole family. Those red undies are gone though. Director Zack Snyder has his fair share of fans and critics alike. Detractors bemoan his hyper- stylised visual aesthetics and unfocused characterisation, which ironically is exactly what his followers enjoy. MOS won't turn opinion one way or the other, it will only reinforce it. The action set pieces are full-throttle and grand in scope; the breathtaking fights extend from atop buildings to ground level to outer space, with fists, tanker trucks and even satellites orbiting Earth used as weapons. Snyder achieves the difficult task of portraying how quick these aliens move without making it too hard to see what is going on, and the plethora of scenes with Kal-el (Superman for those not in the know) flying are exhilarating and believable. As always the 3D won't be for everyone's tastes, but coupled with unsurprisingly high-quality CGI it added to my overall experience. Famously, next big thing Brandon Routh went nowhere after his turn as the Krypton native in Singer's 2006 flop, a fate that British actor Henry Cavill won't have to worry about sharing. As Clark Kent he is relatable and likable (but devoid of humour thanks to a huge chip on his shoulder), however when wearing the cape he truly excels, embodying Superman wonderfully both physically and emotionally. Michael Shannon is a commanding presence as the indefatigable General Zod, who is given depth and meaning beyond your typical villainous motivations, and Russell Crowe's Jor-el (Supes' biological father) is more compelling, involved and bad-ass than Marlon Brando's version. As wholesome Kansas folk and adoptive parents Jonathon and Martha Kent, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are reliable without being memorable, whilst Amy Adams isn't convincing enough as Lois Lane and Laurence Fishburne is horribly miscast as Daily Planet boss Perry White. An enthralling blockbuster that kicks off what is sure to be a massive franchise, MOS returns Superman to its rightful place in the top echelon of cinematic superheroes.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy his other movies ""300"" and ""Watchmen,"" and they are both well made movies. ""Sucker Punch,"" on the other hand, not really. So, why do I consider this movie to be Snyder's best film? Well, I guess you can say that I am more familiar with Superman than any other comic book characters that appeared on film or television. Although, I do prefer Batman because he has always been my personal favorite superhero, but let's not get into that. ""Man of Steel"" is one of those films that I can watch and never get tired of it. I do enjoy the reinterpretation of Superman for not being dark and realistic, but showing the human side of him. Henry Cavill does a wonderful job for portraying the character on its own than just acting like some of the other actors that had already portray him. Amy Adams, at first, I wasn't sure how she can pull her role off, but as I saw her on screen she really is Lois Lane. I really love how she updated her for not making her a damsel in distress, which is a good thing. Also, I do like that she is able to do something rather than just screaming for Superman to be saved. Nothing much on Michael Shannon's take on General Zod, but I do say that he was really good to play such a villain. The other actors like Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El do there jobs well enough. I thought Hans Zimmer's score was brilliant. His score does capture for the film's tone, and doing his own theme besides doing the classic Superman theme by John Williams. I also do like to point out that it is cool to have Christopher Nolan on board as producer after coming his success with ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" which they are awesome movies. I will admit that the origin did not need to be told again, but nevertheless, it is really well told on its own. The action in this movie is awesome. Its like ""Dragon Ball Z,"" but even better than that despicable movie ""Dragon Ball Evolution."" I know there are people out there who don't like this movie as well as the critics. Honestly, I don't care what they have to say. I know is their opinion, but we can agree to disagree. I can defend this movie as much as I want, but I digress. ""Man of Steel"" is an awesome movie, and I give it a 10 out of 10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately as you can see by my rating, it barely did the job. Is this a bad movie? Not at all. But there was more than a few missed steps and far too many times it just fell on its face.The revamping/updating of the Superman story/mythology was completely overdone. I found the beginning sequences over the top and while beautiful to look at, did nothing for the story and were somewhat confusing.Later in the movie, what I can only describe as ""WTF?"" moments kept happening and each time I found myself wishing the movie would somehow redeem itself by showing some intelligence.Unfortunately this did not happen.This latest effort does no better than the last simply because it tried too hard to set itself apart from previous efforts. In doing so it lost its way and ultimately lets the viewer down in the storytelling department. It's new, but so far from improved that they actually made it worse.Underneath all that polish I still found a turd.

I'm old enough to remember the Christopher Reeve portrayal of old Supes and it was far more entertaining than this. Yet again, the viewer has to sit through another destruction of Krypton prologue with a big name actor in the part of Poppa Jor-El, who with his wife Lara send their newly born boy Kal-El to Earth where our yellow sun will give him ""super"" powers, also another big-name couple playing Ma and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) during young Clark's boyhood, before the meat of the story appears, or rather reappears in the form of General Zod, a fellow Kryptonian exiled to the Phantom Zone for an attempted coup and murder of Jor-El. However the problem of pitting two super-humans against one other as the film's finale does make for a really boring match-off as they knock each other into the middle of next week, destroying buildings and cars by the score before an admittedly surprise code-breaking conclusion came literally as the end.The whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" schtick was really done to death as we're asked to believe that our hero would just let old Pa Kent sacrifice himself for the sake of keeping Clark's identity secret, as if life preservation wasn't our hero's chief modus operandi, at least the way I read the original comics.The SFX were just CGI overkill, not helped by Hans Zimmer's ear-bashing soundtrack. For me Cavill gave me nothing new in the titular role, despite his Mr Universe physique, likewise Amy Adams as a decidedly unsexy Lois Lane and Laurence Fishbourne in his P.C. turn as Perry White. Michael Shannon merely blustered as Zod, although I did think that Russell Crowe passably represented Jor-El although how he ended up getting more screen time after his demise really stretched artistic licence.With no Jimmy Olsen, Lana Lang or Lex Luther either, it did seem as if characterisation lost out out in favour of the old crash-bang-wallop of interminable fight sequences, indeed you knew you were in trouble early on the moment peace-loving scientist Jor-El makes like a ninja when he encounters Zod early on in the movie. There was zero humour either, no real pacing and very little engagement in the story-telling.Listen I know that a lot of success in comic and film adaptations in recent years has come from re-imagining the character's origin story but this one seemed boring and shed very little new light on old red and blue. By the finish, my eyes and ears were black and blue from the unwelcome sensory assault I encountered here.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think Zack Snyder saw that same post. The beginning of the movie sets that tone with a wild action adventure segment that would make you think you're watching the wrong film if you did not know better.This tone is carried throughout the movie with Russel Crowe's fabulous take on JorEl being similar to Sir Ian Mckellian's, Gandalf replacing Wizardry with Science (It feels like the Krytonians don't known the difference)I love this movie's version of Lois Lane. I always found all other versions too stupid to be the best reporter in the world. I don't care how you reason it, if you have strong romantic feelings for someone, it gives women a bad name that he can fool you with a pair of glasses. Lois Lane is one of the greatest females to come off the funny pages and Amy Adams gave her the honor she deserves. Micheal Shannon was the greatest as general Zod, it's an intense performance. These days, superhero movies tend to be so driven on the protagonist that they forget that a good protagonist needs a good antagonist. Shannon never lets you forget that.Christopher Meloni, straight from his exit on Law & Order: special victims Unit was in it as well. Like with the Dark knight movies they put known actors in smaller roles like with Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White and Kevin Costner as Johnathan Kent. Diane Lane adds tons of unflattering make up to play Superman's elderly mom in the movie, as well. As a comic book fan, yeah, they're things in the movie that didn't feel like Superman. It felt like the Dark Knight, explained by the fact that the trilogy's director produced this film, sometimes I wish they went another direction, but it did not ruin the film for me. Man of Steel has a lot of gentle quiet moments. Is not quiet for no reason, it matters and then when the action picks up, it picks up. Like a quiet before the storm, and I like the storm. Why do a movie about Superman if it does not exploit all his cool powers(And since it's Superman's first flight, that explains the destruction, most viewers seem unready for) ?I always liked Zachary Snyder as a director, and I really like how his style was constant throughout the movie. Even when the effects got heavy, his unsteady camera style was still all in.It's not the best Superman movie or superhero movie made, but That's asking too much. It was a great action adventure movie and for those of us who are comic book fans, feel good with the knowledge that it kicked of the DC cinematic Universe better than Green Lantern's attempt.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I advocate for 'Man of Steel' not simply because it's a summer blockbuster with excellent action scenes, special effects and visuals, but because it is only the tip of the iceberg for a reinvented Superman for a more cynical age. It has more to offer than the sum of its parts.The story opens to the birth of Kal-El, the first naturally-born Kryptonian child in centuries. Jor-El, Kal's father, tries to warn the council of the planet Krypton's imminent destruction, but General Zod stages a coup against the council and attempts to have Jor-El killed. Kal-El is launched into space shortly before Zod and his followers are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone and the planet Krypton is torn apart from within. Kal's ship arrives at Earth, where he begins a new life as Clark Kent. Because of his powers, Clark grows up alienated from the rest of society and searches for the truth of his origins. He discovers a crashed Kryptonian spacecraft in the arctic and learns of his true heritage from the preserved consciousness of Jor-El. Jor-El instructs him to perfect his powers to become a symbol of hope for humanity, bestowing him the blue and red-caped suit. Meanwhile, Lois Lane of the Daily Planet reaches out to Clark and makes him feel accepted among humanity through her companionship. But Earth is threatened when General Zod and his cohorts, escaped from the Phantom Zone, demand Clark's surrender in exchange for the planet's safety.'Man of Steel' is an origin story in a similar vein to Richard Donner's 'Superman', but is much more grounded in reality, like The Dark Knight trilogy. During the second act, the story is told through a non-linear series of events in the present and flashbacks to Clark's adolescence, benefitting the pacing. These flashbacks demonstrate how much Clark was able to turn the social weaknesses of youth into his adulthood strengths, making Clark that much more human and relatable despite his alien heritage.In this cynical age, Superman risks becoming an irrelevant and dated figure of heroism, showing him as the unfinished Man of Steel offers a chance to reconstruct that image. Batman and Spiderman underwent similar evolutions, and so Superman is in the midst of that. The Donner films are excellent, but hold the trappings of the 70s/80s. The film's atmosphere is more jaded but has moments of hope, and there's a scene when Jonathan Kent himself questions whether Clark should let his powers be known to the world, even at the cost of human lives, because he fears for his son's life. Although Jonathan doesn't believe in his own words, the need for such a figure of surety and hope in Superman is incredibly powerful, as Clark must challenge his Kryptonian heritage for his earthly home to become that symbol for humanity.Henry Cavill is possibly the best Clark Kent/Superman since Christopher Reeve; displaying high moral fibre and restraint when under stress as an outcast, and came across as kind and courteous when at ease. I saw him as the very best a man can humanly be. I also really enjoyed his thrilled reaction to discovering his powers of flight. Amy Adams provides a spunky, compassionate and sharp-eyed Lois Lane, who takes part in the story in a heroic light. Both Cavill and Adams share a budding chemistry that doesn't quite match the strong chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder, but what's important is that there's a foundation to start from. As Jor-El, Russell Crowe gives a solid and empowered performance as a man to inspire honour and courage in Clark, and Kevin Costner worked well as a reserved and guarded Jonathan Kent, cautioning his son regarding his powers. Out of all the cast, these four stood out the most for me.Compared to many superhero movies, 'Man of Steel' is wanting for humour. Some people accuse the film of being a Michael Bay movie, but consider the welcome absence of Bay's typical racial stereotypes, lazy scripts, lowbrow and racist humour, and questionable directorial choices. I'd rather have few attempts at okay humour than plenty of questionable, dirty jokes. I will say that if Snyder can work in more wit, charm and good humour into the sequel, it would help more than he might know.The action is executed remarkably well and provides a sense of scale and fragility of civilisation, demonstrating how super-powered beings in combat would fight in real life. However, sometimes less is more, and some slightly less intense action scenes would have helped stakes remain high. It annoys me when no-one bats an eye about property damage and gratuitous action scenes in 'Pacific Rim' or 'Avengers', yet go ballistic towards 'Man of Steel', a superhero movie where action is expected. In war, buildings are destroyed and casualties will be high. Snyder can't be blamed for not shying away from the horrors of destruction.The usual criticisms aren't invalid, as people were expecting a more balanced Superman movie. But, Snyder, Nolan and Goyer do understand Superman and his symbolic importance in the comics, but for that symbol to have meaning, they have shown him at his rawest and grittiest before his timely perfection (I hope). What it may lack in humour, it compensates in moments of awe and inspiration. Ultimately, 'Man of Steel' is like an unfinished marble statue with clearly defined features and a certain rough-hewn appeal, but needs a little refinement in order to become the absolute perfect Superman of our time, and maybe beyond.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

That movie was made by people who despise Superman and hoped to destroy him and everything noble and honorable that he stood for. ""Man of Steel"" (2013) was the best Superman movie to date, great on multiple levels--plot, acting, SFX, filmography, musical score, message, etc. That's saying a lot, because I did believe that ""a man can fly"" when I saw the first Reeves movie 4 times in the theater way back in '78.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I wish it would have stayed that way the character development and connection that were being built were so strong, but then it began focusing on the action ""superhero"" part of the movie, it would've been better sticking to Clark Kent's story and learning about his life. Also the relationship between Clark and Lois started strong but never went anywhere.

It focused mainly on demystifying Mr. Kent's past and the motive behind it.Henry Cavill justified the role of Superman. Amy Adams didn't have much to do.

There. I said it. One of the reasons it was as good as it was is because although it was certainly more serious than the original, it never gets too dark or depressing. The tone is occasionally light, especially when Kal-El first learns how to fly. The little things like that make this a success because they serve as welcome reminders of the original while being it's own thing.The visuals, of course, are spectacular. As anyone who has seen Watchmen can attest to, Zack Snyder is a far better director than many people are willing to give him credit for. Each fight, shot of Krypton, superpower scene is incredibly well done and never feels fake or unrealistic.The actors are all great, with exceptional performances all around. Henry Cavill perfectly portrays a Superman who feels like an outcast. He never comes across as melodramatic, and he has to grow into his role as a hero. Superman has a vulnerable, human side that grounds the film in a sort of realism. This version isn't nigh-omnipotent in the absence of Kryptonite. He isn't able to turn back time to bring someone back to life. There are high stakes, which help to make the film exhilarating and an incredibly enjoyable time at the movies.Note: the hatred this film has received is largely from fans who wanted a re-screening of the original. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan of Russel Crowe (except for his part in ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"") but he's a great Jor-El and drives us into the movie. Michael Shannon is great too. The rest of the cast is not my favorite (Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne...) but with Cavill and Shannon, the show can go on. The Superman of this movie is the same at the comic's, he looks really strong and is ready to sacrifice himself without hesitation. Adding the visual effects similar to Watchmen or 300, we have one of the greatest movies of the year. Rem","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

OK, I'll just startimagine a time when you were young and it was weeks before Christmas. And during this time there was a toy or something that was supposed to be amazing, and you prayed that Santa would put it under the tree for you. Remember the anxiousness you felt day after day when you were pretty sure you were going to get this awesome toy, but couldn't know for sure. Remember feeling the nervousness you felt, when you thought about getting this toy and wondered if it wasn't going to live up to your expectations. Christmas came, you got the present you were looking for, and it was better then you could have imagined. This is an analogy of what I felt before and after watching Man of Steel, and this is how you will feel during the film.Zack Snyder, David Goyer and Christopher Nolan took the challenge of rebuilding a long distressed franchise that had been regulated to jokes and empty promises. Believe me when I tell you that they took this challenge to heart. Snyder imagined the character of Superman that was only known in comic books. Snyder has redefined how a superhero movie must be made.This is a complete reboot, right down to the opening scene when you witness the birth of Kal-El. For the first 20 minutes or so, Snyder goes into great depths of the origin of Krypton, their history and their world. You quickly discover that Krypton is on the brink of destruction, and General Zod has betrayed the council by starting a war. Jor-El finds a way to send off his son and Zod is banished into the Phantom Zone.The story continues to go through Clark Kent growing up, but in a way that's never been done before. It's an almost depressed Clark, where he is divided and confused about who he is and about his place in the world. Snyder also used the obvious connection between Superman and Jesus Christ, by making several references to God, and Clark being a God. This adds to the pressure to live up to the ""hype."" General Zod finds Kal-El just as he is finding himself and declares war on him and the planet. I must say that from the beginning of the film, to when Zod arrives is nothing but intense drama and promises of what's to come. While I was watching the film, I wondered if the result could live up to the hype, like Christmas. But believe me when I tell you that it will exceed your expectations. The relentless action and amazing battles are like nothing I've ever seen, or could have imagined. Even during all of this, Snyder is able to develop the character of Superman with cut scenes to the past and conversations with Jor-El. I don't want to ruin the movie so I'll stop talking about plot points.There is only one character that is truly developed in the movie and that is Superman. Everyone else is there to move the story and assist with this development. However, Snyder makes these people important through great dialogue and a well developed relationship between these characters. The acting in this film helps this along. Henry Cavill is not Christopher Reeve and doesn't pretend to be. He is a darker, more grown up and an emotionally torn version of Superman. Amy Adams is great as always, she plays a Lois that is not as in ""awe"" with Superman as the past versions of the character. She knows that he is meant for something great and assists as necessary. Russell Crowe is always an actor who commands your attention on screen (as long as he doesn't sing) and he play's a more ""take things into my own hands"" type of Jor-El. Michael Shannon is a great and not well known actor, who plays and excellent and scary Zod.In conclusion, Man of Steel exceeded my expectations. I am still in disbelief about what I just saw. This review is biased based upon my love for the character and the material, but I am confident that your view of the film won't be far off.I saw this film at the IMAX 3D and I recommend you do the same. Spend your hard earned money to see this film, because a movie like this only comes around once and a life time.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

You get a character who is invincible yet torn of emotions, a love interest, heroic act at every corner, comic ability when required and a deficiency that can be exploited. Yet they've ruined ever single one of those elements.Ignore those desperate to see their hero succeed in this film.

I went to see this movie with very high expectations due to the excellent trailers and this film totally hit a grand slam all the way up to Planet Krypton! For those who have not seen it yet, get up and go! I suggest seeing it on an imax or rfx with Dolby Atmos Sound System. Warning: for those who don't appreciate loud piercing soundtrack, Dolby Atmos is not for you. However, if you're like me who is obsessed with high end sound system, you're going to want to rob a bank to have this sound system installed in your home. Casting is dead on. Henry Cavill is Superman. Keep in mind MOS is a film about 'Kal-El' becoming 'Clark Kent'. So don't be expecting any 'clumsy' 'nerdy' Clark Kent in this movie. I believe this is why a lot of what they so called themselves *expert* film critics expected the movie will be. The good old Christopher Reeve's exact re-make of Superman—they are mistaken. MOS is nowhere near the original version. In my opinion, the new plot is very good and the action sequences are breathtaking. Cavill have the look, the voice, and the charm of a perfect Superman. Amy Adams was a great choice for 'Lois Lane'. What was great about this 'Lois' is that she's actually very intelligent and has more to do than just being the damsel in distress. Michael Shannon was menacing and played a great 'General Zod'. No offense to 'Bane' played by Tom Hardy in Dark Knight Rises, I believe Michael Shannon's portrayal as 'General Zod' surpassed 'Bane' as the most hated villain in a film. Michael Shannon was absolutely vicious! All the actors who played the parents (Russell Crow, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) were excellent as well, especially Crowe as 'Jor-El'. With all due respect to Marlon Brando, this 'Jor-El' is way better. Let's not forget 'Lara Lor-Van' played by Ayelet Zurer and 'Faora' played by Antje Traue—mother may I. Did I mention about the action? I'll say it again. Holy Cannoli. It is brutally insane. For those complaining that Superman Returns didn't have enough action, the first 20 minutes of MOS alone have more action than the whole 'Returns' movie. Superman throws it down in this film. Imagine the end fight from The Matrix: Revolution between Neo and Agent Smith and times that by 5. Overall, this is a great start off point for DC to start building their universe. Hopefully they don't screw this up with another dud like 'Green Lantern'. I can't wait to see what Zack Snyder and David Goyer have planned next for 'the last son of Krypton'.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Now you can go ahead and listen to all the critics saying, too much action, characters not developed, blah blah blah. But my take from this film was that it wasn't even trying to go in depth on the characters. It didn't even go too in depth on superman. Although the cast did a great job on there characters, and if we see a sequel it would most probably develop all the characters a lot more.I'm also glad this didn't turn out nothing like the dark knight, which it did look that way in the trailer. Overall, the action was breathtaking. There wasn't too much action, its just at times the CGI was overwhelming (In my opinion). But that's nothing to moan about as I was entertained a lot by these action sequences. Overall it was just such a fun movie to watch, the acting was great, the directing was good(The camera was a bit too shaky at times). My final rating is, 4&1/2 out of 5 Stars. (9/10)By the way, excuse any bad punctuation.( Writing this review very late and prefer to keep it short)","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Best I can offer it is 6 out of 10 on IMDb. I think Henry make a good Superman... but I did not like how they changed the story so much. Russell Crowe was good as Jor El... but, the fact was it was just too graphic. I mean, there was too much action. These days in action movies they are just cramming so much CGI in the flicks that it is hard for the eyes and mind to take it all in. That was really the case here. The fight scenes were so intense that you could not keep up with them. The eyes could not process the information. ---- think about it like this... did you ever try to follow the hockey puck in a hockey game? Same thing. It's just too much, Hollywood. I did think Michael Shannon (from Lexington) did an OUTSTANDING job as General Zod. He had more dialog than pretty much any other actor it seems.... and he played the role well.And, I really did not like the story. Parts were OK of course. Lois Lane was in it of course.I don't know. I know they wanted to create a whole new Superman.... but, I am getting tired of Hollywood changing the characters that were big enough to begin with.For instance... a couple of movies back, they gave Superman a son. Argh. That angered me. Bottom line, this reviewer says 6 out of 10 stars.","9 out of 30 found this helpful.

That would mean that my hopes were high and it could have easily been disappointing.But no! Man of Steel to me has given the Superman character the movie he deserves. After Superman Returns, everyone was complaining about the lack of action in that movie, but this movie delivers it. Not just a little, but full-packed action, exactly (or better) than how we witness in the animated versions! All of Superman's abilities were handled perfectly.The story is simple and straightforward. Well we couldn't have expected a ground-breaking story when it's an all-start for Superman. It is more of a save-the-world-from-extraterrestrial-attack kind of movie, and very well done in that sense I can assure.The movie has a serious tone to it. It hardly has anything to laugh at, but that's how I personally think Superman should be done.One part where the movie lacks is the character development. But the rest of the stuff does cover for that.So here it is. A movie worth watching and worth going to the cinema for.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I am not a fan of the Superhero movies that have been sprouting up over the past 5-10 years. I saw The Dark Knight, and the sequel to that. I also have seen parts of the Iron Man franchise. Those are all pretty good, but really Hollywood was just looking for a platform to serve up it's new and enhanced technology and techniques. They just needed a story - a shell. Dark Knight reigns supreme as the best of these new shells, but this was way better than The Dark Knight. For this to actually get to me, is a testament to the greatness of this movie.The size, and godlike scale of this movie, is a leap in movie power level - just like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2 was, or Avatar. If you watch this and don't consider it one of the best movies of all time, you are in denial and deluding yourself.You will be blown away, and you will be happy you saw this.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's a realistic depiction of how Superman would have been like if he were real. Henry Cavill is the best Superman in my opinion.

Hmmm, disappointed to say the least, this movie just doesn't have heart like the earlier chris reeve films. I like the bits of him growing up and for me that was the best stuff but there needed to be more as it wasn't explored enough. There is also way too much cgi,especially the beginning on krypton and the final showdown. While some of it is brilliant some of it also isn't. The flying scenes were impressive over the sea and through the clouds but the fast up close stuff wasn't. The big end battle had so much devastation it was like superman you've probably killed a few thousand people with the damage to buildings you've caused so it would have been best if you had just left and fought elsewhere. I always thought superman would fight but with causing as little damage or threat to human life as possible but that just doesn't happen here and it didn't feel right. There was so much slam bang action none of it meant anything as it went on and on and so there was no stand out stunts or moments. The movie kept my attention but I didn't feel any real emotion for this film apart from one bit with pa kent. I will definitely watch 2 because I think it will be truer to the original concept and more grounded. Cavill I have to say is perfect for superman today both in looks and acting wise so hats off to him. Half marks from me, 5/10 as it wasn't really a bad or good film but I probably won't watch it again.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The trailers looked so awesome! Yesterday, I saw the movie. Was it as good as I thought it was going to be? Two words: Heck. Yes. The story is really good. It's the normal Superman story we all know, but with a darker twist. It seems more serious and intense than having the destruction of Krypton be a sheer coincidence. You also see flashbacks of Clark Kent (that's Superman's earth name) getting used to his powers and how different points in his life made him the man today. I liked this. You could see how much he struggled. Superman in the past just seem overpowered and couldn't really be taken seriously. The Superman in this movie is relatable and shows his vulnerabilities in a great way. The only part that I needed explaining on was how his dad was able to put his personality, appearance, everything, inside a machine to reanimate himself with (I hope that made sense), but it's nit-picky and not too confusing. I also liked the more serious tone. Most superhero movies have more humor in them to take break apart the more intense scenes to show the light-heartedness of the movie. This didn't do that. It kept the flow of the movie going really well. There are a few funny moments, but nothing that distracts you from the content of the movie *cough* Green Lantern *cough*. The acting is great. They picked the perfect actor for every single character. They also seemed very relatable and realistic. Even Superman, which is pretty hard to pull of, since he's, you know, almost invulnerable. The action is some of the flashiest and intense I have ever seen in a superhero movie. There's crumbling buildings, gun fights, people getting stabbed, punching, kicking, throwing people through buildings, explosions, neck snapping, and more. And it's awesome! It's so fast paced and intense, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I love it. The special effects are some the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Everything looks so realistic even though you know it's all fake. My favorite parts with the special effects all are in Krypton. That planet looked awesome. This movie had the special effects that Green Lantern could've had. Overall, this movie awesome. Pretty much everything about the movie was awesome. Anything I didn't like about it are so nit-picky and small, that I'm not putting them in here. This is, so far, my second favorite superhero movie of all time, behind The Avengers.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not an avid fan of Snyder, but MAN OF STEEL is an up-to-par epic bandwagon superbly grafts the invincible Kryptonian alien under the context of a xenophobic earth milieu, a human environment-nurtured extraterrestrial identity chooses to combat against his own race to save the cynical earthlings. The film majestically branches out a unique palette of indigo and gray, a post-apocalypse solemness which is unlike most of its superfluous comic-derived peers (producer Christopher Nolan's sway may be a plausible influence), and a hefty impetus of Clark Kent's poignant relation with his human parents perpetually spurs the film to imprint its most eloquent fingerprints onto the heart of its recipients, a far better fulfillment than the parentless spidey (both Costner and Lane are heartwarming and sagacious in it). Crowe and Zurer as Superman's biological parents, both are throwaway in the overture of Krypton's demise, the former then resurrects himself as a bewildering wraith inside the flying vehicle, sabotages General Zod's scheme. Against the ageism, Adams offers brilliant ballast as the mettlesome journalist Lois Lane, a paragon of the benevolence from human part, the mutual attraction between her and Kent is ignited, but markedly Snyder saves the best for the sequel. Antje Traue and Christopher Meloni, one is the ferocious sidekick of Zod, another is a human general fights till his self-sacrifice heroic act, brings out an intensive beast-and-prey pattern of diversion which is a rare treat for side players in mainstream cinema. Michael Shannon as General Zod, a bona-fide super-villain counteracts Superman's almighty indestructibility, his human-eradication theory surpasses any comic fecklessness, and the gravity-reconstruction concept really put the entire planet hanging on a thread (I always redeem a sudden depletion of gravity is the way to our doomsday), Shannon is incredible to magnify his militant loyalty and the genocide-prone mercilessness whilst viewers would eventually be touched by the former, such a transcending feat to accomplish out of a fixated mold. Same can be stated to Henry Cavill's Superman, he is a flawless messiah of our planet, and Cavill is the perfect Superman, both from his physique and his charisma (and finally the underwear goes underneath his uniform), his oscillation has never been shied away in the film, and it makes the final neck-breaking such an emotional disturbance both to him and to the viewers. The CGI effects are another fusillade of leveling cities and blasting buildings after THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), but an amazing stunt is this time it ad hoc showcases an uplifting process of Superman's sway of his flying expertise. A recurrent blip of the genre is the willful negligence of the aftershock, 5 seconds later, everyone act like they are totally oblivious of the apocalyptic attack no matter how damaged the city is, the transference is unnaturally nettling, the least one can do is to take a few shots of people's contemplation as survivors of such a catastrophe, or raise hope to shoot scenes of the restoration and a panorama of the mess is a must to deepen the seriousness of the matter. Anyhow, MAN OF STEEL is a stylized orthodox superhero film which successfully recoups the fan-boys and bolsters a stronghold for the series in its lucrative future projects, its mass appeal might lag behind Marvel's SHIELDS coalition, but Superman's adventure will be more audacious and reflective other than its entertaining face value.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Forget about subtleties, deeper meanings or even a story... in that sense, Man of Steel is not to be blamed; the road was paved a few years ago when Hollywood, unable to write and a produce a good script, turned to cheap thrills. Within that scope of cheap thrills, the Man Of Steel is one non-stop roller-coaster ride filled with explosions and fights for your average testosterone driven adolescent viewer to be excited for quite a while. When people loose sense of important things, they turn to cheap thrills, and this film would be one such thrill. With great cast who all performed quite well, and excellent effects which fill 100% of almost all shots in which characters are not yelling (which is very few), this is one of those ""one (film) for me, one for them"" kinda deals - do it for the studio so we all make money so we can do what we like later... That's the bad news, and it should be enough to keep a true cinefile well away from the Man Of Steel. The good news is that the script was at least not terrible, it had some resemblance of intelligence in it, although don't expect triple digits IQ, and certainly very little if any wisdom in it. It is a ""good vs. evil"" story with nothing new brought to the table except - fight force with force (which actually never works, but we would like to believe it does, so we watch movies which feed our illusions). Careful product placements - from I-Hop to Sears and latest Nokia phones, adds to the commercial feel of the film. A few stupidities kinda make one cringe, but in all that chaos, who will notice?All in all, a decent FX Fest with very good cast, and lot of noise, explosions and fighting. Technically - truly well done. Story-wise? Well, it was never meant to be intellectually stimulating... but it could have been. Even thrill rides can have a clue or two about deeper human values (beyond just love at first sight) and so on, yet this film mostly fails there. A zero in that department, combined with 10 in how it was done, and you get a 5 on 1-10 scale. Watchable, but not the best way to spend your evening. I had to watch it, but otherwise I probably would not, except perhaps out of curiosity.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

And Superman he is not perfect and at every place every time. Also a very hollow critic about Superman being able to save everyone. And he definitely could not save Zod. He had to make a choice. Save humanity, or save Krypton. And if you want an Omelett, you'll have to smash some eggs.Also the humor issue, there were plenty of scenes, where the audience was laughing (Truck? Jor-El's tricks? Downed drone?, so the movie wasn't that listless at all. It simply didn't want to be a running gag, just like Iron Man 2/3.Nevertheless, it is an action movie, and it's really good at delivering it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was action packed from start to finish. The characters were well developed, the fight scenes were epic, the villains were heinous, and the hero was a super portrayal of the most iconic hero of our time. The movie modernized the Superman story and brought it back to audiences the same way that Batman Begins revitalized the Batman story.A caveat is that the movie stops building the characters about half way through which makes the action seem a little mindless. There is also a lot of senseless violence towards the end of the film that seemed more appropriate for 300 or Watchmen, and not a Superman movie. The more violent scenes towards the end emphasized that Zod was truly evil and thereby strengthened that Superman was his counterpoint. However, Superman is supposed to protect all human life and promote the better points of humanity. With that in mind, some scenes seemed out of place.This movie is still easily one of the best, if not The Best, super hero movies ever made. I loved it, and I'll probably see it again before it leaves the theater. If you like action, this is a must-see movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even though I can never forgive Zack Snyder for ruining my favourite graphic novel of all time (Watchmen) for me, I expected something better than what I witnessed tonight. Zack failed to put emphasis on the points that matter the most. To me, Clark's relationship with Jonathan Kent (his adoptive father) is the most important part in Clark's development into the greatest superhero ever, and all we got were a few flashbacks. All we were given is a bunch of CGI fighting scenes and some really bad writing. Also, one thing that really bothered me is that basically half of Metropolis is destroyed while he fights two of the villains. The real Superman always puts others before himself, he would never cause this many casualties. I also didn't find the villain to be exciting in any kind of way. What I learned throughout the years is that a good superhero movie must always have a great villain, especially a serious movie like this one. But I will tell you this: The 2nd instalment of this movie will be good. I always found Lex Luther to be an interesting villain and if they are able to cast well, we should be looking forward to a great movie. I wasn't a huge fan of Batman Begins, but The Dark Knight is one of my favourite movies to this day. And with Christopher Nolan as producer, he will make sure he doesn't make the same mistakes he made in Man of Steel.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Why Zack Synder gets a hint of attention I don't know. Watchmen was disappointingly mediocre and 300 is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I dread to think of watching any of his other films. I don't know why I had even a tiny bit of hope for Man Of Steel back in the Summer but the mixed reaction proved that he has not learned. He is, undeniably and only, a visual director (and maybe if his sources and scripts were better he might have a chance at making a decent film one day) but unfortunately his taste in visuals is pure dreck. He tries to assimilate some emotion into the picture of Man Of Steel, but it's all on the surface, and there's no heart to be found. I quite like Superman, I haven't seen Donner's 1978 hit but I did enjoy Singer's Returns at the time. However, there's not an ounce of joy to be found in Synder's film and the plot too often doesn't make sense at all. Why does Superman care about humanity? Why don't the residents of Krypton encase themselves in the protective shields that they put their prisoners in? Why tell Zod that Superman even exists?It's just one contrivance after another for the disheartening result of destruction porn. These are laughable contrivances too, the script constantly had me laughing as to how serious it was taking everything with applying modern techno mumblejumbo. The whole movie is just clunky exposition drenched in melodrama without any character development. It can never find its footing with the pace, either wallowing in meaningless drivel or propelling us into tensionless mania. Terrible idea to jump back and forth with flashbacks. Even if the film did work, all it wants you to feel is depressed. Where's the hope? The only people I feel sorry for are the VFX team. I hate the filters, terrible angles and annoying zooms Synder and his cinematographer put over their hard work. Nothing particularly special, given what they're used for, but it's always a lot of admirable effort involved. Wish they could've scrubbed the most obvious product placement in the history of film out at the very least. Just give me a break, especially with those trite religious undertones. Shame on everyone else involved. Nolan, you're on thin ice after The Dark Knight Rises. Please pick up the pace with Intersteller. Please. Worst film of the year right here.3/10","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

You can pick one superhero to pin all of Earth's hopes upon. Who do you go for? It's a no-brainer, isn't it? When it's all on the line, you want Superman.The last few years have seen one big-budget comic book adaptation after another, many of them quite good and a few of them truly great. But Superman, the very first superhero, has been strangely absent. Until now.And it's been worth the wait. Man of Steel is a great tribute to the most iconic comic book character of them all, and superlative summer entertainment besides. The cast—spearheaded by Henry Cavill as Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Michael Shannon as General Zod—is outstanding, with Cavill's interpretation of the character rivaling Christopher Reeve's classic performance from the 70s and 80s. Cavill grasps the heroic spirit, instilled in him by his earthly parents the Kents, that separates Superman from almost every other costumed hero, and does a fabulous job of bringing that spirit to life. Cavill's Superman is selfless, sensitive, and willing to sacrifice himself to save others if that's what it takes. The fact that Superman is more powerful than the other superheroes we've seen on the big screen lately isn't really what makes him a greater hero—it's his soul.And Man of Steel's script goes to great lengths to explore just how Clark Kent becomes Superman. Clark doesn't know where he's from to start out with, but he does know he's very, very different. He's naturally faster, stronger, and more durable than everyone else. His parents (played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) don't have all the answers, but strive to raise their adopted son from the stars to be moral and upright in every way. It is Clark's gradual evolution into Superman—aided and abetted by a certain beautiful reporter named Lois Lane whose interest in our hero melts into something rather more personal-- that forms the basis for the Man of Steel's plot.But there's plenty of action too, action of a caliber perhaps never before captured on film in terms of scale. The climax does indeed pit Superman against alien invaders who happen to be criminals who survived the destruction of Krypton, led by the diabolical General Zod. Zod, played with a brilliant malevolence by Michael Shannon, wants to recreate Earth in the image of Krypton, and he has the means to do it. His ultimate battle with Superman in Metropolis makes similar scenes from the Transformers movies and The Avengers look like low-grade dress rehearsals. If you're a longtime Superman fan like I am, you'll love this movie. If you're simply a fan of good action movies, you'll still love it. Man of Steel is a tremendous cinematic achievement, one that puts Superman back in his rightful place as the preeminent superhero in the world. Here come the aliens. Looks like a job for Superman.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

You still have Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White, The Daily Planet, and Metropolis. The basic story of how Superman came to be is held in tact. Much appreciated.The action is what impressed me the most. There is plenty of it and the graphics are superb. This movie reminds me of others like ID4 and the X- Men.

What's wrong with critics , because made a dumbest film called sucker lunch doesn't mean he can deliver another dumb film always .2. By the way what was wrong with the film it had the best best story not the perfect one but for the first time I felt that Superman exists for real.3. I do agree Henry cavill does not best the charm that Christopher reeve had but is that charm that we expect what Superman should have in this current scenario.4. This movie justified the real story line , of course it did not relate to any of the Superman cartoons or the comics , much of that that the storyline is fresh new and really zack has given a logical change to the story line.5. It really shows the dark side of clark his struggle how he struggle's his place in the society how he struggle's with his power simply touching and one would mourn all the hardship he undergoes.6. Kevin costner though had a small role he played a really a very notable of being a very responsible father.7. Lois lane by any Adams was justified as why she is award winner report writer.8. Henry was seriously the best suited guy for Superman he seriously really justified the role with that magnificent physique and his acting skills.9. Russel crowe was inspiring and of course general zod was the villain and a super match that super man can have. He though wasn't shown as really bad he wanted create a new krypton.10. Superman kills wtf really did he do that after leavin cinema hall I was wondering how can ever Superman but then it did strike it really was logical, he had no choice he saw a family gonna be killed by zod and he was left with no choice and after he does he did regret for what he did. This really was logical.11. And the CGI it was mind blowing the action, but the action here and there was too much and before you could see what happened they would land up in next building the visually effects where good but I felt they where way too lot and made it being too louder and boom boom , it did lack bit of zack's touch that slow motion of action all.12. But last but not least I watched the movie in cinema s twice and in blue ray at least not less than 12 times.13. Having watched this many time I should agree it did entertain and gave all the satisfaction a movie lover wants.And all the critics who know so much to let down a good movie, I would suggest you do come up with a one good movie and lets see how it does fair , I don have much of idea how a movie is made but I do know what entertainment means.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie has nothing to do with the other 5 movies that have been made. You see the birth of Kal-El, the struggle with Jor-El and the planet Krypton and the fights they are having with General Zod. Then Kal-El's life here on Earth, trying to adapt to life with these powers that nobody else has... until Zod finds him and seeks to destroy Earth to rebuild Krypton.The film is full of action. the fighting sequences were amazing. In all of the recent super hero movies, when the fighting sequences are happening you can see that there has been some computer generated moments, but in this film I can honestly say that it was so well done that I didn't notice anything like that. It genuinely looked real.The acting was good throughout too... Henry Cavill plays Clark/Superman/Kal-El, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, Michael Shannon plays General Zod, Diane Lane plays Martha Kent, Kevin Costner plays Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburne plays Perry White and Russell Crowe plays Jor- El.I have to say I don't agree with the complete casting on this film. Henry was a great Superman, Amy was a good Lois, but she was a completely different character than the Lois from the original films. She was more serious and less accident prone. Kevin Costner was not that bad as Jonathan Kent. I was a bit sceptical, but he was OK. I think the biggest mistake was Laurence Fishburne playing Perry White. Perry should always be a character that was hot headed, always shouting with a bad attitude... but Laurence played the part calmly. He needed to shout more. I would have thought Louis Gossett Jr. would have played it better. He knew how to shout.General Zod was brilliant. He has such an evil look about him. And the fighting scenes with him and Superman were fantastic. Another thing I liked about this film is Superman does not get to save everybody like he does in the original movies. People actually die. Superman is not super enough to be able to rescue them all... during the fighting and destruction of Metropolis, a lot of buildings get destroyed and there are explosions everywhere... it makes a change to see Superman slightly beatable in that aspect.There was a couple of things about this that I was not fond of too... but I don't want to put any spoilers in my reviews so I will let you watch it and see if there is anything you don't like about it and see if I agree. Nothing big, just a couple of little things that I thought should have been done differently.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A great start for a reboot... I look forward to seeing another one which I am sure they will make. This could be better than the recent Batman trilogy... and I am more of a Batman fan.For more reviews, please like my review page on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I mean, there is NO Superman movie that has EVER started like that. That was really sad. 2nd of all, there was entirely too much talking. All the historical data about Krypton over and over and over from Kilal and Zod. I mean, stop with all the talking. 3rd, For Superman to take a beating throughout the movie and NEVER get dirt on his face or his hair out of place, just not realistic even IF it's a superhero. and again...4th, Superman getting beat up. I mean, come on! Answer me this: are Kryptonians skilled in the art of Kenpo, Wing Chun, or another foreign Martial Art, because they sure were faster, at parrying and blocking every punch Superman threw! A rookie at fighting at best. All those superpowers but can't fight? I guess, that's because Kevin Costner (as dad) didn't want him to know how to fight in the first place, right?And lastly, What was Superman thinking that he could out Fisticuff, Zod? It took him that long to figure out that the only way to beat this guy was to break his neck? Remember, He was ""TRAINED for COMBAT?"" Finally, Why was there only ONE MILITARY Unit throughout the entire movie. Where the Navy SEALS, Green Berets, Rangers, etc? OR even more where was the ENTIRE military against one ZOD who wanted to replenish the earth with his OWN agenda?Then the ending. He KISSES Lois Lane so passionately, like they had this hidden personal ""HOTS"" for each other - oh, yes, the first time Clark/Superman has ever kissed a female. NOT CONVINCING...all that fighting, all that trauma, BAD BREATH all over the place!Then when Clark is introduced as the ""new guy"" NO ONE recognizes him EXCEPT Lois, after being close up on him in the movie...GLASSES changed all that? C'mon man!This movie made you feel like, ""OK before we ever think about dealing with aliens, every business needs major insurance coverage and help from the TOTAL military or a SUPERHERO who is skilled in boxing, martial arts, and just plain kicks butt if EVER Threatened by outside forces.Because in this movie, SUPERMAN NEEDED =====> The AVENGERS...

Other than that, its the best movie so far to come out in 2013, fast 6 was just for money making, and iron man 3 was like watching a french movie without subtitles, i mean i never understood what was going on, so i would say that you won't wanna miss this movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is my very first review to IMDb. Hope you like it.First and foremost. Yes, I like very much this movie,100% Happy.I like the story, the photography,the soundtrack,the actors, everything! and yes, of course, i see it more bigger in my mind. But, come on! you have to admit it... Man Of Steel it's a Awesome movie! (at this time i see it 11 times, to see what i like again, and see what some of you guys hate) and why some people hate so much this movie? it's simple, and my point of view is this: Not all the people/Fans love to read comics, Not all the people like to see movie From comics books. I have 36 years old, and the very first time i see Superman was with the George Reeves Show. he was so powerful to me. i love it! since that day i found my favorite Super hero ever. and then come The Justice League, Christopher Reeve, all the cartoons and the Action Figures, Even Tom Welling on Smallville like it! More than Batman or Iron man. i got a few Comic books (4 to be exactly) All the people who doesn't like this movie, are Comics books freaks, and you guys waiting to see a movie exactly like your books and you fantasy head. it's impossible! you guys would never be satisfied! always see the bad thing. You know what is a bad thing? never have a Superman or any Super hero Movie!I never see, in my life, a full ""good"" review from any hero movie before.(10 of 10) I think it's time to give a chance to a new Point of view, Fresh star. And if you don't have the chance to see the movie... here is my tip: Erase all the things you know about Superman/Kal-el/Clark Kent. it's a new begins. And of course Hope Ben Affleck Do it a Great Work on MOS2 (I DON'T LIKE IT, But if is done.. is Done.I think This is a movie for a decent Superman! Better than Superman Returns! and you know it!

It's painful to admit just how bad it is because i am such a hard core Chris Nolan fan, if anything i expected the plot to be good, but it isn't. The plot is unappealing, the acting is horrible, the lines are cheesy, it's very unoriginal. Not one of Nolan's best, he should try to make us forget that he is even involved in this project. Just terrible! Henry Cavill is a waste of hotness, his acting is terrible, so is Rusell crow (I don't understand how he still gets cast in big blockbusters) and the guy who plays general Zod is rubbish","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I will admit I went in expecting to like it but that has never made me bias, example Iron Man 3, or The Amazing Spiderman. This movie delivers from start to finish. The story is fast paced and for being 2 hours and 23 mins it flies by so fast I couldn't believe when it was over. There are certain characters that are not given the time they deserve but I feel it all made sense for the story. This isn't your Richard Donner Superman movie, this is Superman in the real world. When he is discovered things move fast and with the arrival of Gerneral Zod things really pick up. There is plenty of development of Clark, and General Zod is a creepily good character. The real surprise for me was Russell Crowe, Jor-El was given an excellent role and his character was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Like I said not all characters get great attention, like Perry White, but I feel that we will get that in the next movie. The ending of the movie sets up the next ones perfectly and I left truly excited to see more. The movie is action heavy, and it has awesome set pieces and the special effects are truly spectacular. If your looking for your family style happy go lucky Superman movie this isn't it. If your looking for a great Superman movie that taps into the full potential of this great iconic character this movie is exactly what your looking for. Could there be improvements made? Yes, Does that effect the quality of the movie, absolutely not. I don't think I really could've enjoyed this movie anymore than I did.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

What really bugs me is the people the people that say this film was like a video game, the action sequence was just buildings being destroyed and has stations blowing up etc. you people need to realize that your basically defining action sequence, like seriously what do you expect it to have like 30% action and 70% speech and just plain nothing but traveling around the world cause thats what it's sounds like. Zack Snyder done something new for a superman film he made his own version, now I agree that that's risky but it turned quite good, if he made it like the other superman films I swear you could predict it before even watching his daily job as a journalists becomes superman when there's trouble and dare the world, it's to cliché, at least Snyder tried something different and most of you's hate on it, which really angers me. This superman film in comparison to superman returns is much better, at least it makes sense, if you's watched the other one sand paid attention then you know what I mean.

The years have not changed my love of science fiction or action but this movie is very poor in story, directing, casting of Superman and execution. Take away Superman's muscles and there is nothing left. Maybe the Man of Steel title was more about his personality.Russell Crow (Jor_El) and Dylan Sprayberry (Teenage Superman) stole the show, they brought their characters to life.Hollywood announcing a sequel before it's release is very clever. If the studio believes it is great - maybe it is great - and I am wrong.What a shame this Superman didn't take me to another level. The trailers had me believe this was a more mystical, spiritual sort of Superman film. It definitely wasn't. Unfortunately it left me wanting to leave the cinema 30 minutes before the end.Reviewers have complained of the endless fight scenes - I think they are needed as there would be no movie without them.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Is it a plane? These are the phrases that comes in mind when someone refers to the Superman. The movie Man of Steel has certainly shown dare and has broken the tradition that we see in the old Superman movies. Henry Cavill has certainly proved and lived up to the expectations that people had when this movie was about to be released. He is a complete opposite of the old Clark Kent/Superman played by Christopher Reeve. The new Kent/Superman is less humorous, comes to know of his power when he was a child and tries to fit in to the society throughout the movie unlike the character played by Reeve. As a Reeve fan you might find it hard to accept Cavill as the Man of Steel but he will grow on you during the entire duration of the movie. Even the meaning of symbol 'S' has been changed representing hope and sigil of the house of El.The whole movie is presented as any other Snyder movie- dark themed, close up actions, tragedy in every half an hour but this time these things are what that had made it one of the unique and unforgettable movies of 2013. Story is well pitched and has a great pace which will captivate the audience. Kevin Costner has played a troubled earth dad of Clark who tries to find the meaning of his(Clark's) arrival to Earth and even motivates Clark to do it. Jor-El wonderfully portrayed by Russell Crowe who in every bit has looked as much of a Kryptonian as Brando himself. But its Michael Shannon who takes the prize for his portrayal of General Zod, a commander so ruthless who will do anything to save his planet(Kryptonite). He mourns for his friend (Jor-El) but at the same time is willing to destroy Kal-El (Jor-El's son) showing that nothing comes between him and his duty towards his planet. He is not propelled by greed or evil towards his mission but by determination which keeps him on par with Kal-El.The daily planet cast have been shown as average with importance given to Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who throughout the movie pursues the mysterious hero and fights with her boss. Laurence Fishburne though given a small role as Perry has done good but somewhat been under utilized.The whole movie is presented with a wonderful background score none other than the maestro of music Hans Zimmer himself. From scene one to to the ending part not a single moment is there where the beat and the tune doesn't keeps the viewer intrigued. The visuals are really good and certainly would be magnificent if watched in IMAX. All in all this movie is entertaining and certainly exceeds the expectations of any action movie buff. I will myself rate it to 8.7. I would have given it somewhere around 9 if not for certain cheap humor at one or two places and uselessness of one or two characters.In the end I would just like to quote that this movie certainly gives itself an ""Ideal to strive towards"" for a sequel which we will be certainly waiting for.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I think he's the epitome of a bland protagonist who you're only supposed to like because he always does the right thing, and I don't even remember liking the Christopher Reeve movies as a kid very much either.But considering all that, I was kind of looking forward to revisiting this film, because most of the complaints I remembered seemed to be solely about how this film ""ruined the character of Superman"", while I was in the corner saying that he never had much of a character to ruin, so they could go nuts as far as I cared.And then they made him even worse because now, not only does he have no character, he doesn't even have the inherent likability of such a charismatic person. Oh dear. And he is basically responsible for the deaths of a good few hundred people by the end of the film. And none of the other characters have any real depth to them either, which is a real shame because the casting is actually pretty great. Henry Cavill absolutely looks the part, Amy Adams could have been a great Lois Lane if she had anything to do, and Michael Shannon...um...Well he sucks.Frankly, that one controversial moment right at the end was just about the only time something bloody interesting happened for me, and even that is plagued by the numerous other options that could have happened. Which in itself is faced with the inescapable question of why Zod can't just go do his thing on Mars instead of committing planetary genocide.Because we need a movie to happen.For some reason, the first half or so is told out of order even though it would have just been better if it wasn't, and why couldn't Clark have run into the tornado instead of his dad?Say it with me: Because we need a movie to happen.And man does Zack Snyder's directing annoy me. He'll have a perfectly nice shot all lined up, it looks good...and then he lets a five year old take over and zoom. In or out, shake it all about, it doesn't matter, but it's virtually never necessary, and just makes the shot look worse. And when the camera doesn't have ADHD it's all just very bland.The truly tragic part though...this is still the third or fourth best film in the DCEU so far.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Kevin Costner gives what could be the worst performance of his long illustrious career. Laurence Fishburne the same.

I love that they show how superman has evolved from the original creation only being able to jump very high and far due to the earths gravity and then to being able to fly. I also think that the action was very well done since superman has super strength and bullets can't hurt him it is only fair that he has super battles. My favorite parts of the movie is when he flies and to me this is the best flying effects that I have seen. Don't get me wrong the movies with Reeves set the tone for every superman movie that will be ever made and every superman after him has kinda looked like him to a point. Also they did an excellent job at General Zod and they nailed his character very well. After seeing the Batman movies and seeing how well Nolan did with batman I was very excited to see him do superman and I hope that he keeps up the good work. In my option this movie beats all the batman movies and beats the last superman movie even more. The last superman movie was awful and seemed like it was made by the same people who made the first hulk movie and I am sure we all remember that bad excuse for a movie. I hope Nolan keeps up the good work and makes lots of more movies to come. I kinda hope that he is picked to direct the JLA movie. I give this movie a 10 of 10 cause no one has captured Superman the way Nolan did and no one probably ever will.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They have long been superseded by films which are fifty minutes too long: Spiderman 3, the Dark Knight movies and now Man of Steel. If as a young adolescent, you enjoyed comic books which took twelve minutes to read, you probably thought, ""if they could only make movies like this!"" As is so often the case, getting what you wish for has turned into a curse: that 12-minute dose of high romance--that you spent the rest of the day thinking about while you did other stuff--has turned into a two and a half hour ordeal that you spend the rest of the day trying to forget. In this latest version of the Superman origin story, the planet Krypton is transformed into a (strangely colourless) wonderland where babies are raised in underwater reefs, Superman's dad Jor-el flies around on a giant insect, and we are treated to every second of mother Lara's delivery pains. But the essential story, mass-distributed since 1939, is old news. Fortunately, if you have waited, as I did, to see Man of Steel on the Movie Network, you can fast forward through all this to get to Superman/Kal-el arriving on Earth—although you will pay for it, as I did, with some confusion as to why although the bad guy, Zod, ends up searching for Kal-el for 33 years, the vessel that becomes the Fortress of Solitude has been in the ice for 18,000 years, etc. The cast is first-rate, though Russell Crowe as Jor-el seems more at home spouting reams of solemn exposition than does Michael Shannon as Zod—though to cut Shannon some slack, it's hard to imagine any actor getting into a character who's such a cosmic sourpuss. When Superman saves the world, only to find that Zod is still left and spoiling for revenge, it gives the viewer not so much a shock of horror but a moan of anguish that the movie is not going to end, or even lighten up and give us a denouement with a few jokes, but continue for another seemingly endless CGI fight sequence. The fun denouement does arrive, though it's all too brief, and when the production credits start to roll, after the obvious talents of Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer, we have to wonder just which of the many producers were responsible for turning Man of Steel, with all the talents behind it, into just another oversized carton of overpriced popcorn.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Firstly I'm a comic fan and have been for many years, predominantly Marvel but not exclusively. Secondly I'm one of those awful people who likes Batman as a character more than Superman and who was wowed by both Nolan's take on Batman and The Avengers (though for slightly different reasons). Lastly I went into MoS pretty enthusiastic although I'm not a the biggest fan of the character or Zack Snyder.*phew* Now that's all over, let's get on with talking about just how much I hated Man of Steel.....err.....I mean my glorious review. Ta-daaaa!!Let's start by saying to all of the people who haven't seen this movie who are excited because of Lord Christopher of Nolan's involvement...hold your horses buddy (or buddette?). This film is very Zack and very little Chris. Any film about Superman is obviously going to have to stray far more into the fantastical than a Batman movie, but this film not only revels in Superman's super-dooper powers, it rubs your face in them. Now on any other day I'd try to be pragmatic and weigh up the good and the bad, but in this case I think that would be difficult and misleading. Let's be clear and say that this isn't a film that started well and then 'Jumped the Shark'. No, no, no. It's a film that's started very badly, briefly failed in an attempt at interesting backstory, completely fumbled it's build up to the final act and then totally obliterated the entire film with the most horrifically tedious final battle that I have ever seen. How many times have you wanted to ask for your money back? I wanted my money back, a shoulder to cry on and a bottle of Optrex to wash my eyes out with.If I say this is the worst film that I have seen in the last 10 years you will either not believe me or think I'm an exaggerating fool. But this was easily the worst (big budget) film I've seen in 10 years!! It was truly terrible in every way. The script was appalling, the direction was abysmal, the concepts were hackneyed and ill thought out. The special effects were surprisingly awful. Golden opportunities were squandered, actors were wasted and the final 40 minutes of the movie was so shockingly terrible that I swayed between open-mouthed shock at how bad things had become....and just sitting there laughing. Yeah this film made me start laughing my arse off. I ended up reaching a stage where I was bored, laughing, shocked and depressed all at the same time....whilst all the while knowing that none of these emotions were what the director had intended.'Less is more' might not be a sentiment that Zack Snyder is familiar with and it may not be something that Superman fans would expect from a movie about a character who is super powered to such an extent, however this film ends with a fight sequence so relentlessly ludicrous it was like Fast Forwarding through 10 hours of footage from a strobe lit 1980s rave party interspersed with a montage from a WWE computer game. In an effort to make each sequence even bigger Zack Snyder seems to have forgotten somewhere along the line that he had a story to tell. He certainly seems to have forgotten those early sensitive, thoughtful trailers that enticed us. This film is nothing like that for 95% of the time and not at all for the last 40 minutes of the film. Instead it's just more explosions and destruction and fighting and more fighting and explosions and fighting and blah and blah and blah and blah.........until you just want to go home and scream.A truly terrible film.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But...I would say that everything I read is correct. I guess it just depends on what holds your focus most as to who you will feel was right: those who praised or those who criticized.The opening act up to the destruction of Krypton was amazing, as was the fight scenes towards the end. When Superman and Zod fought, in particular, was in my opinion the top rung so far in super-hero movie action scenes. The movie felt disjointed, yet at the same time felt powerful. It seemed to lack a story at times and at other times brought me in to the solitary life that is a growing Clark Kent's.I don't want to say too much or get close to revealing any spoilers, so I am keeping this review fairly brief. I will say that the movie experience I would most compare it to was when I saw the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie. I just had a kind of sense of awe, like ""Wow, that was a lot of stuff"". I loved it in spite of the fact that I thought it missed on a few elements. Perhaps the director and all involved didn't feel it missed where I thought it did, perhaps it was how they planned it. But all in all I think this movie is one to be highly recommended. You may like it you and you may not, but I very much feel that reading the reviews (the good and the bad) can not give you any idea of if you are going to like it or not; you just have to see it for yourself. And I strongly recommend that you do.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Superman/Kal-el's character is revealed at the perfect pace. I loved that they used flashbacks spread throughout the film as opposed to a time line, it shows his life without boring you. The casting was borderline perfect, some are saying Amy Adams was an just an okay Lois Lane, but I strongly disagree, she brought the character to life like no other actress could. The only thing i would have changed is her hair, they made it much darker than her normal light red, but I'm just nit- picking. The acting is spot on, as you would expect from this kind of film. The only thing that may be considered a downside, is some parts are rather cheesy, such as *Possible Spoiler* the scene where superman has General Zod and is about to snap his neck, and Zod points his laser eyes at that family who are pressed up against the wall. They could have ducked the beam easily. another small detail was the people tried to outrun the collapsing buildings by running vertically, instead of to the side, but this is to be expected. This film left me more than satisfied, and looking to a very possible sequel. If you are going to see any movie this weekend, see this one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The trailers made it look so epic and important, and with Christopher Nolan attached to the movie what could go wrong? Well, just about everything honestly. What I remember was being very disappointed in the film and somewhat embarrassed for having dragged several friends along with me to witness such a failed reboot. I noticed this movie got a 7.4 rating here which is a respectable rating by IMDb standards, so I thought I might try and watch the movie again since it's been on heavy HBO rotation lately. Well, the movie is just as bad the second time around I'm afraid.The movie starts as you would expect with Krypton set to explode and Jor-El preparing to send superbaby to earth. Once on earth the movie cuts to present day adult Superman, who is apparently a scruffy drifter who picks up odd jobs here and there. Supermans upbringing on earth is told through periodic flashbacks from his childhood. The flashback method was not a bad idea considering the studio probably didn't wanna drag the audience through the first 20 years of Supermans life again before you even get to see him in a cape. However, the flashbacks are just bland retreads of what we've seen in previous Superman movies. A scene of Clark rescuing a bus load of kids. Clark getting picked on by bullies and turning the other cheek. A worried protective mother and wise father who warns him on the dangers of his powers and the responsibility that goes with it. Ugghh! Oh, and don't get me started on the tornado scene where Clark's father dies. It's plain laughable. Even though the flashbacks are short they are just tired cliché variations on what we've seen before and do nothing but take the air out of the movie.In between flashbacks Clark discovers his power of flight, Lois Lane searches for the truth, Superman's identity is revealed, and General Zod along with his Krypton thugs hold earth for ransom until Superman is delivered on a silver platter. Sounds like a good build up to a climactic showdown with Superman and General Zod right? Wrong. It's extremely boring in fact. While the movie looks good from a visual standpoint each scene is presented to the audience in such a matter of fact and dull way. The characters in the movie are flat and generic to say the least and the performances are stiff and void of any personality whatsoever. The movie is basically a snoozer up until the fighting starts near the end. However, at that point you're pretty much ready for it to be over.I could try and pick apart specific scenes in the movie but honestly the movie is too forgettable. Nothing memorable enough in the movie happened much for me to critique. It was just a muddled depressing slog of a super hero movie. With all that was wrong with Man of Steel I feel that it's biggest problem was the total lack of humor in the film. I get that this was supposed to be a more brooding and serious take on Superman and all, but it took itself way too serious. I mean the Dark Knight was dark but it had some twisted comic relief from the Joker to balance out the tone of the movie. Man of Steel makes no attempt at levity at all. Because of this the movie feels overly heavy and not fun at all.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film is full of metaphors and while some struggle to understand the message behind this story, it is pretty clear to me what the movie is saying. Snyder's film removes the sugar coating from Reeve's superman and tries to integrate superman into a modern society who have different opinions. I believe the reason why this movie got a 56% rating is because most are used to the innocence of the 70's superman and cannot seem to let go of the past as we head into a new society. Also this superman is not as Americanized as previous movies which allows a wider audience to relate to the man of steel.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film is an origin story that the people deserve and the cinematography in the film is excellent. Zack Synder has done an amazing job of capturing Superman and setting up a further DC Universe with very well thought out and placed Easter Eggs. Man of Steels story is frankly amazing with heart warming and heart felt scenes, to its fight scenes. Man of Steel is inspiring. The performances in Man of Steel are top notch with the whole cast putting in great performances and a standout performance from Henry Cavill as Superman/ Kal-El.Additional credit should be given to Russel Crow as Jor-El and Michael Shannon as Zod as these two really set the tone of film with their opening conflict at the start of the film. David Goyers screenplay is amazing as the story is one of brilliance. With the father son conflict throughout the film, Kal-El becoming Superman and the conflicted villain Zod. Zack Synder should be proud of his creation as scene in the film is shot perfectly and the C.G.I is some of the best I've every scene demonstrated by the fight scenes in the film and when Superman is in flight. Man of Steel is a fantastic movie and is an emotional thrill ride from start to finish. Man of Steel is a perfect movie due to these reason and is a great indication of more things to come from DC. Marvel time may be over.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I would have to say that really the only 3 things positive this film has going for it are the Score (Hans Zimmer) the special effects, and the talent. Other than that the film is a ridiculous escapade of action sequences and explosions, which I guess hey, moviegoers want these days. However I am not one of those moviegoers. That's how I felt; I actually wanted to leave the theater at a few points because the fight sequences simply dragged on for way too long without adding anything as far as plot development goes. Seriously, it was like the director and writer were like ""Ok, so let's have the plot advance here for 5 minutes and then we'll cut to a 30 minute action scene."" It was painful to watch after a while. I went into the theater expecting a moving plot with great execution, however I was greatly disappointed. I don't usually agree with harsh critics, however whatever bad reviews this movie got it deserved. Maybe Hollywood should stop trying to please the mindless moviegoer with endless action and focus more on the actual content of their summer blockbusters.

Not even noteworthy actors as Lane Costner, Fishburne and Crowe could save this train wreck. The beginning of the film is tolerable and looks like it might be a very good film but then with the first flight of Superman and the apparent cheap special effects it's all down hill.

A place, much different than ours, granting our eyes and imagination a spark of beauty, sadness, and a world far away.I will not call this movie perfection however, nothing is ever without its faults. Time will tell what becomes of this, but for me...it was inspiring to see The Man of Steel raise from so far down. To burst into the scene like this, and once more become an ideal to strive towards. Hidden messages work into this movie, action fills at times, and a story complex enough to be satisfying, but not confusing still.Well done.

Without any time for some Father-Son bonding, the child is sent to Earth for refuge and to give the planet hope, ""something to strive for"".Jump 33 years to the future and A bearded, reserved and a muscular figure -- yes, it's Clark Kent, is working on a fishing boat and is quickly jumping into action on a flaming oil rig to save workers trapped onboard.It turns out that Clark (Henry Cavill), conflicted about revealing his alien heritage and has kept moving around the globe whilst reminiscing on his childhood with Ma and Pa Kent where he had to learn to control his senses so he could blend in with his adoptive home.Meanwhile we are introduced to the instinctive reporter of Lois Lane (played by an underused Amy Adams). And after a near death experience, Lois investigates the origins of her mysterious savior. Before Lois can say ""Look! up in the sky!"" Her story is soon interrupted by the appearance of our main antagonist and fellow Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon), who has come to earth with the old fashioned plan of 'Taking over the Planet' and turning Earth onto the new Krypton.Cue rampant destruction and loss of life in both Smallville and Metropolis ""Man Of Steel"" ends up just being another summer movie about bad guys toppling Skyscrapers nothing we haven't seen before in ""the Avengers"", Batman or the Spiderman Movies, - The best visuals are all in the trailers and the use of 3D is pointless and not worth the extra admission price.The moments between Clark and Earth-Father Jonothan Kent (Kevin Costner) give the film some much needed soul and warmth, but these moments are soon gone to soon and we recede back into the cold.Do we get to meet mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent with the dark framed glasses ? Not quite. Is there romantic chemistry between prize-winning journalist Lois Lane and Clark? Nope. There's not even any 'Tony Stark style clever one-liners to make the audience smile.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, I've never thought about a film as much a I have this film.I was with this movie up to a point. I'm open to many interpretations of characters that are adapted from comic books. Hell, I'll even argue to a point that the terrible Batman & Robin is true of an incarnation of the characters it portrays. The same can not be said of Man of Steel. This film has had the hugely successful ""Dark Knight"" realism prism adapted to it. A prism that was so successful for the character of Batman because that character works in a real world setting, the premise of that character is possible in a real world. Superman is not. This is a film about a flying alien who wears a cape, why was a real world prism even considered for this film? Not only was the real world prism added to this film but so was Batman's attitude added to the Man of Steel. Now the beauty of these two characters is that they are polar opposites both fighting for the same goals, this works beautifully, especially when they're working together, the two opposing philosophies meshing. This film portrays Superman as conscienceless powerhouse, levelling cities and killing 1000's to save the world. Not only this, but he breaks the superhero code by killing the main antagonist. In short the symbol of hope that the character is, that they even do a very good job of building up in the film is rendered completely redundant.A huge missed opportunity in this film is the possibility of showing the wonderful dichotomy of the character. The character is essentially 3 characters. Kal-El - The man himself, Superman - The public persona of Kal-El, and Clark Kent - The disguise. Instead of delving into this and the huge potential for character presented to the film makers, they decide to ignore as much of this as possible and just present an alien destruction movie. I really wanted this film to show people that Clark Kent is much more than someone who just puts on a pair of glasses and fools everyone he knows, it's a permanent public act and a huge character trait.The film wasn't completely without merit, there were some wonderful teases in there for the wider universe that DC/WB are attempting to build. And I really enjoyed a few of the visuals, the beautiful war like murals that Clark has his history explained to him on were outstanding.If this is the latest incarnation of this character, I'm out. I've always loved the wholesome boy scout approach to the character. Not only is he a Superman, he's a super man, a man to strive to be like. This point was completely missed in this film. A film in which it's an offence to even say the lead characters name out loud will never have me on it's side.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Instead of relying on an intelligent audience to enjoy a well written film, they expect the entitlement ADD generation to not be interested unless it involves violence, sex and a hint of Michael Bay-ism.They fail to realize that the smaller back stories to our comic heroes were meant to stay a mystery, always to be wondered about but not be the main focus.In Man of Steel, by 1/3 into the film and the script goes into detail about origins, answering the burning questions and handing everything to Clark on a silver platter. They dumb it down and give it word for word to the ignorant audience, whom they have no faith in to figure things on their own.As for the other 2/3 of the film, insert romantic-hero-epic-CGI action film stereotypes or just read the other reviews on this site.Gone are the days of Christopher Reeves playing the socially awkward Clark Kent - heck gone are the days of Clark Kent.

I expected to be disappointed by this movie, thinking is another representation of the already crowded Superman franchise.The movie had great prospects based on the trailer. The note on IMDb kept around 7 for quite some time which was also a strong motive to go see it. In the beginning instead of focusing on the supernatural powers of Superman it tackles the emotional aspect. This emotional part together with the the history lesson from the beginning set the movie apart from other Superman movies I've seen. I really enjoyed finding more info about where Superman comes and what the S stands for.I was quite impressed by the visual effects. I felt the producers put a lot of effort into creating very realistic visual effects. For example, when Superman learns how to fly, he passes trough a pack of animals in Africa and the pack actually splits in two.Toward the end of the movie, the tone changes. The movie stats to look more and more like another Hollywood action movie with a lot of fights. By this time I was enough hooked by the movie to not get bored and survive to the end. With over 2 hours, it's a long movie so if you watch it in theater be sure to not drink too much juice of water. Going to the bathroom in the middle of a fight scene really sucks :)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is a must see, but it lacked a few things I was hoping to see.Weaknesses: Character development was weak for sure. The action was very visual and stunning, but I would have preferred less explosions and more super speed sparring. What they had of it was awesome. Superman was also not quite cool enough for me. I would have loved to see him take on multiple Kryptonian enemies and look cool doing it, but he usually got his butt kicked, then found a way to win in the end (yawn). He is more used to the planet, his powers, and the atmosphere, so you think he would be able to do better than he did, at least while the others were still getting used to all that stuff.The biggest fail of the movie was definitely the small attempts at humor. It was poorly done, and didn't make anyone laugh. Would have been better to completely take it all out and keep it 100% serious. It simply did not fit the tone of the movie or the tone of the characters.Transitioning to the flashbacks were a bit awkward. They had powerfully emotional scenes that you were not set up for, so it made them just seem awkward. They needed to invest more time helping viewers connect with the characters before trying to have emotional scenes. Clark getting bullied as a kid was awkward too. It could have been better done, but perhaps it was simply a fail for the child actors.Zod could have been set up better, too. It wasn't easy enough to hate him. They could have added a little more lines or a few more scenes to help the viewers really see how twisted he was.Strengths: The beginning scenes on Krypton were a pleasant surprise. They completely re-vamped the world, so don't expect it to be anything like what previous movies have portrayed it as. Jor-el was very cool.Cavill was a great fit for Superman. I would like to see his interpretation of Clark Kent in future movies before I am sold on him, but he does well on the Superman side of things (which is probably the easier role). The other actors also did a good job. Surprisingly, I was not too impressed with Kevin Costner. I am not sure if he fit the role.Faora-Ul was by far the coolest character to me. A lot of the action that she participated in was the type that I would have liked seeing Superman perform. At times I was thinking ""Why is she so much cooler than Superman? They should be having him do this stuff!"" She also looked a lot like the character from the old movies, so that was a plus.Overall, it was a good movie. Not great, but good. I would definitely recommend seeing it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder, director of 300, Watchmen, Suckerpunch, movies containing some of the very best, most awesome over the top action scenes the world has ever seen..? And then he makes a Superman movie, and it is totally not awesome? It must be studio interference that screwed this up, because I really want Zack Snyder to have more awesome action up his sleeve.You can say a lot about Man of Steel, but here is my main beef. The action is not very good. We get a lot of destruction, humanoids being tossed around, thrown through buildings and such, but why is it not awesome? One reason I think, is that it is just too.. hard. Too violent. Not too violent as in in too much violence, but it's like, they barely touch each other and then they just fly through the air 1000000000 miles per hour.. You get no sense of their power, although that's what you're supposed to, because it's just so overdone. For that to work, you must build it up. You don't start with the biggest action scene. You wouldn't start with superman hitting someone making them fly through a thousand buildings. First we get a little taste, then a little bigger taste, and so on.In all the fights it's the same. Somebody pushes or hits someone and they fly away so incredibly fast that you get no sense of anything. A real shame. The effects are very good though, this could have been awesome. But it's not.I know the movie is just made to clear the way for Batman v Superman, but still. And why are there not lots of slo-mo? Come on, it Superman for crying out loud. Even the last Superman-movie had that awesome bullet-to-the eye-scene. Here we get nothing? At least I can't remember any.Also it is totally devoid of humor, badly paced, just not very entertaining.

Except unlike that movie, this one at least has a good excuse: the original 'Superman: The Movie' came out in 1978 and is ripe for reinterpretation. First off, let's be honest: the late great Christopher Reeve was a brilliant Superman. He was also a brilliant Clark Kent, having the talent to thread a fine line with a performance that was at once comedic and sober. For some, he will always remain the quintessential Man of Steel. Rather like Sean Connery in the Bond franchise before him, he is the original and all who come after-wards have to stand in his shoes and be compared to him And admittedly, they are rather large shoes to fill They had previously attempted to fill those shoes in the 90s on TV with Dean Cain in 'Lois and Clark' and failed. They had tried it again in the 21st century in 'Smallville' with Tom Welling, which while being a huge improvement over the Cain version, was still missing something. The fact is, just like Batman/Bruce Wayne, Superman/Clark Kent is an extremely hard role to get exactly right. You can usually get somebody to do one or the other, but it's rare that they can do both. Among the things they got right this latest retelling of the story of Kal-El is the casting of Henry Cavill as the Man Of Steel. He is without doubt the best actor to don the cape since Christopher Reeve. Whereas Brandon Routh's rendition in the 2006 movie 'Superman Returns' is an honorable failure, the biggest problem with his interpretation of Kent/Superman seemed to be he was doing an impression of Christopher Reeve. Spot on as it was, he was channeling Reeve (probably at the behest of director Bryan Singer) to such extremes that you wondered why they even bothered. Another issue with that movie was Routh looked too young in the role: it's not Superboy/Boy of Steel, its Superman/Man of Steel, and as such, Cavill – even though he would have been in his late 20s during the time of shooting - brings a maturity and gravitas to the role unseen since Reeve's heyday. Rather than doing an impersonation, Cavill brings a fresh approach to a role that could have been one-dimensional - yes, he's THAT good.Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) produced this and it's easy to see his influence. The movie is meant to be rooted in reality with a gritty sense of realism. For one thing, check out the title: it's not called 'Superman' but the 'Man Of Steel'. So dedicated it is to this realistic approach that when the character is called Superman by someone, they are interrupted before they can finish; when we do eventually hear Cavill's character being called 'Superman', it's with an apologetic – almost embarrassed – tone. Seriously, what is wrong with it, and why couldn't they just have called this movie 'Superman'? No expense has been spared on this production and they have got a terrific cast. While the 1978 movie was great, it wasn't perfect. Terence Stamp's rendition of General Zod was slightly one-note; Michael Shannon in this gives a more three dimensional performance. And the growing romance between Lois and Clark here is done much better. But the unsung hero in all of this, it has to be said, is Kevin Costner playing Clark Kent's dad. His screen time may be minimum, but his impact is huge. Just like the greats of the past – Marlon Brando/Glen Ford playing the Kent's dad in the original - he casts a large shadow and his scenes with the young Kent as he reaches maturity are brilliant, genuinely touching, and heartfelt. Even after his arc of the story is completed, his ghost seems to loom throughout the remaining picture, with Kent/Superman carrying his legacy. Russell Crowe might be equally as good in his role as the father of Kal-El, but Costner leaves a lasting impression. Do they give Oscars for super hero movies? Just saying because, honestly, this movie needed more Kevin Costner in it. There are some small issues: the Krypton here is a vibrant, active world that seems very much alive; at least the Krypton in the 1978 version looked like it was already in the throes of death. This Krypton is also so hi-tech – you can see space ships - that you just have to wonder why Jor-El and wife don't just jump into a ship and escape with their baby? Similarly, what exactly is going on with Superman's breathing: he breathes in space; no, he can't; wait yes, he canBut the obvious question is: is it as good as the original 1978 movie? Is it even fair to compare the two? It's inevitable comparisons will be made but the simple answer is no, it's not as good because the original had a magic that isn't really present in this newer, rawer take. While there is no question that Messrs Cavill/Costner/Crowe/Shannon are definitely on par with the originals in the 1978 movie, somehow the wonder that was in that movie is missing here. For one thing – obviously attempting a 'clean slate' - they eschewed the brilliant John Williams composed theme. No musical themes here leap out and grab you the way that did. Furthermore, the effects in the original – dated though they are – have a realness to them because they were all done practically. This movie, it has to be said, turns into a CGI fest to a massive extent. While the CGI is more effective in the background - for example, when buildings are falling etc., - it's a bit less effective during the superhuman-on-superhuman bouts. Still, overall it is a worthy and spectacular watch. It beats Bryan Singer's entry in spades and is a more than deserving addition to the Superman cannon.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was hoping for new twists, better CGI, adult dialogue, mind-blowing cinematography, interesting characters, believable scenarios (within reason, of course), and something that generally would be more interesting than what we have been forced-fed in the past by Hollywood.The movie started strong and quickly but quickly devolved into mind numbingly boring fight scenes that dragged on for what seemed like days.Let's start with the length of the film. Far too long. You will catch yourself (and family) laughing every time you think it's about to end and it doesn't. It taunts you a second, third, fourth, and fifth time in very unamusing ways.The characters are boring (well, except for maybe the dad).There was so much potential with this story. There could have been a great apocalyptic moment of world wide survival against an enemy here in the flavor of The Walking Dead, but no such luck.

I watched it several times,i grew up,but i still think the same i thought over 10 years ago: ""This movie is flawless""I don't know where to begin:
The Cast? It's not 10/10,it' 11/10! Henry Cavill as Superman was the cherry on top,and every other main character was the other cherry on top of another cake. Gosh,even secondary characters that you see less or that have simple lines of dialogue are perfectly suited for their role,whether it's important or notThe Acting? Marvelous. From every single actor/actress out thereThe Writing? Almost flawless,they retained the OG story extremely well and suited to our modern worldFilmography? Very very good,the CGI here is very well done, and surely it's way better than most of the MCU movies that were released in these past 4 yearsI even loved how the military was portrayed: strong,but under a heavy crisis due to facing the aliens.I can keep on going forever,so i'll just say that the Critics butchered this movie simply because it wasn't Marvel so they never understood it. Thankfully, every movie that is misunderstood in the past,becomes a gem in the future,so we just need to wait.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think the first time I liked him because of this grand presentation which commercially feels good. The old one was more drama kinda movie than the heavy stunts. Compared to 70s superman, this movie had computer technology with it to make every impossible things to possible and that was the highlight of 'Man of Steel'.Like I said it was a heavy graphic movie and I loved it to the core. Tell me if you are a graphic geek then how could you not like Zack Snyder's movies, ahh?. The stunts and all were the massive. I knew Henry Cavill can pull this movie but the surprise was Michael Shannoni. He was the best villain I have seen in any Superman movie, a backbone to 'Man of Steel's success. Others like Amy Adams, Russell Crowe and Diane Lane's supported very well.This reboot was dumped deep details of the superman from the old movie. They retained only main storyline and went straight to the 'Superman II'. Hope the its sequel will tell us the superman's job at the press company and affair with Lois Lane. I eager to see the clash of Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in Zack Snyder's 'Batman vs Superman'.8/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course being a Zack Snyder film, all out bloodshed and destruction comes as standard, but the balance between this and the subtle, powerful scenes between the characters is a welcome intrusion. Mixing both past and present events from Clarks life, and letting us see how key events have shaped his development allowed us to see a real in- depth look at to how this great being was nurtured into the great symbol of hope he later became. The cleverly structured film - although it stutters in some parts - has a nice, clean flow to it and is a fresh take on the superman genre. DO NOT LISTEN TO CRITICS' REVIEWS!!! Critics have come down hard and I do not know why. Is it a vendetta against Snyder?? The user reviews speak for themselves. Last of all, I will reiterate my earlier point... this film isn't just for hardcore superhero franchise fans. I took my girlfriend to see this and she was drawn to tears within the first 20 minutes. It sets up nicely the sequel in which (hopefully) they will further explore the relationship between Lois and Clark. We look forward to the continuing franchise and expectations have certainly risen for the sequel...A must see.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And there has been several remakes and reboots since that time. Unfortunately, this latest installment is all about showing off with modern tech and special effects, with little real substance.There is no story. It starts with the usual Krypton agenda and then just melts down into chaos and destruction. If anything, the makers have conjured up a script that keeps wrecking itself and which in turn allows the main characters to wreck everything in it for more explosive scenery and effects with little regard to any potential innocent lives that might be at risk.Even Christopher Reeve (the best guy to ever play the title character) in his Superman movies always put innocent lives first no matter how minor the probability of injury to them.The movie refused to progress after I gave it an hour, it was continually spiraling into on screen destruction and more destruction. We kept waiting for something else to happen!!There are some obvious occurrences in the film which will echo a lot of 'WTF?' phrases, but I will leave that to you. Don't waste too much time or money on this, wait for it on DVD or something...Here's hoping they get it right next time.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Synder/Nolan/Goyer trio did what Nolan accomplished with The Dark Knight series. The main superhero comic book character taken and lifted with its roots and resource material , updated with current times and themes we can relate ( great drama and character work , non linear back story , a plot stakes with as high as possible to thrill , wonderful production values , zero camp/cheesiness or immature humor ) This is the first first-class production that do Superman justice since Christopher Reeve era. Production is very impressive. It is not trying to imitate or try to be something from past of Superman mythology. This is completely a new a restart of Man of Steel legend. With plot themes like isolation , trying to find your place , alienation from society , first contact and choosing to do right thing Superman comes to our level for a better understanding and we rise to his level to empathize with him. This is a guy with almost god like powers after all. What can harm him or stop him ? A green shiny rock ? No even better. Himself. His identity search. His principles. His limits. His inability to save everyone. When third act starts and casualties suffered in characters introduced and climatic battle finalizes you realize what I mean. Story themes are about being as idealistic and inspirational as possible but there is a limit even in that like in real life. Soundtrack is amazing , beautiful. (I am listening it as I write this review ) Hans Zimmer adds so much to this movie. He is the BOSS.Casting is just perfect. Henry Cavill is this generations Superman. He relays everything Clark Kent feels and experiences with his quest for identity and choices. Russell Crowe was just great as well. He was the mentor , guide of Kal El as his biological father. I felt Kevin Costner was underused though. He nailed Jonathan Kent but his scenes were not that much. Amy Adams fits as not as damsel in distress but as a resourceful investigative reporter Lois Lane. And antagonists. Michael Shannon is a new and fresh take on General Zod. This is not a character to conquer Earth for his ego but for his vision his agenda about greater good. He is a fanatic but you can even sympathize with him. Rest of cast Antje Traue as Faora (watch Pandorum) , Diane Lane as Martha Kent , Laurence Fishburne as Perry White , Chris Meloni as Col. Hardy perform superbly as well. Just this amazing cast is enough to watch this in theater.As for negatives in third act there is just too much CGI destruction action and even after you accept nature of this movie after a point your mind goes numb and blank after one destruction scene another. How many buildings you can destroy you ask and then you accept plastic CGI simulation as ""meh whatever."" And aliens leveling another US city like this was done to death before. They drop a couple of stars from this. Please try something else next time Snyder. I know you are visual director but enough is enough. Still very impressive take on Superman. Eagerly waiting the sequel.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you go into this movie not being a comic book fan, you WILL be disappointed. However, if you know the mythology of the DC Comics you will be highly impressed with this version. Superman was not a humorous person until the Silver Age (On of the worst times in comic books in my opinion). To truly get the understanding of this movie you MUST read the comics or at least know the character was not a comedian. Just like Batman, Superman was serious about his duties on this planet and did what he had to do to protect it. Batman started off just like the Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. He was not a hero, he was a vigilante. He did major damage and even killed the criminals he faced. Superman, albeit wasn't as dark and vengeful as Batman, was concerned with protecting Earth and finding his place in the world. He ONLY wanted to be like everyone else, but finally realized he could never be. From start to finish, this is more the Golden/Post-Crisis age and is by far better than Christopher Reeve's version. Don't misunderstand me Christopher Reeve was excellent for the Silver Age, but Henry Cavil was born to be the best Superman. To all my other comic book fans let's show the critics how much we care about their opinions and make this movie one of the biggest this year!!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had enormous expectations and was actually disappointed by the initial Critic reactions, and after seeing it I can only say, 'WOW'!!Let me first start with the CONS:1.) The action was a tad bit too long. Now as a fan of previous Die Hard (not Die Hard 5) and the F&F franchise, I love action and this film has plenty, actually a bit too plenty for my liking but it doesn't become a bore. Only if they would have shortened the last sequence by about 7-8 minutes, then it would be good. But again, this is my opinion.2.) The pacing of the movie was absolutely bonkers. It's one of the most fastest pacings iv'e seen in a movie and I don't blame Zach Snyder for it. There is so much of the story to portray in just two and a half time-frame.3.) Wrong timing of the kiss between Clark and Lane. Seriously Zach could have just ditched that part and still wouldn't make any difference in the movie. I found it to be a bit forced.4.) Dialogues were really mediocre, they never really stick to you. I really don't remember any lines except ""He'll be a God to them."" I for one love brilliant dialogues like in TDK.Now the PROS:1.) Perfect casting!! Everyone fitted their roles perfectly and I for one actually liked Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Henry Cavill is Superman for me.2.) The Kryptonian sequence was the best part of the film, absolutely brilliant. Never will you see a better Krypton in a film and Russell Crowe as Jor-El was fantastic.3.) What can I say about the CGI filled action...Biblical, Epic and SUPER is exactly what they were. The BEST CGI effects i've seen ever! (I've seen Oblivion and can assure the CGI in MOS is better) Zach truly delivered in the visuals as expected and the action is very fast but easy to follow.4.) I really liked the story. I thought it was a proper interpretation of Superman's origin. It might be a little less developed, but it never leaves you with confusion or a need of more story.5.) That score from Hans Zimmer!!! Good lord that was brilliant! Literally heart POUNDING!! Suit the movie really well.6.) The suit doesn't look gay anymore. (IMO its very good and modern)7.) Darker tone of MOS was a big welcome. It brought in a sense of realism to it. But it isn't too dark so as to make children cry. (There were at least 20 kids below 10 years in the theater and not a squeak from them, one of them actually was shouting ""SUPERMAN'S AWESOME"" after the movie.8.) This movie thoroughly settles Superman as a Superhero of the world and leaves the Clark- Lane story for the next installment. Finally, this movie is definitely worth the money (see in 2d if possible, 3d doesn't do any good). It's a feel good, popcorn, fan based movie which is satisfying and gives you a perfect start to the probable Justice League franchise!!An 8.5/10 from me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I appreciated Superman Returns for it's nostalgic links to the Christopher Reeve movies, but was ready for something different. Something new.I swear Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer are telepathic, because one night, they reached into my mind and pulled out my greatest hopes and dreams, and turned them into a movie. Man of Steel was the Superman I was waiting for. This was the grown-up Superman story that took itself seriously. Every bit as much as a science fiction movie as it was a superhero movie.The planet Krypton was beautifully fleshed out. The first act of the film felt like a sci-fi Lord of The Rings. The friendship-turned-conflict between Jor-El and Zod was deeply emotional. The added mythology made the Kryptians a much more interesting people.Clark's struggle to find his place in this world was deep and real. His moral struggles when Zod showed up were greatly moving. The visuals were spectacular. Henry Cavil put in a superb performance, hitting all the essential notes where it counts.Amy Adams was a fantastic Lois Lane. She immediately blew away my doubts. She was surprisingly perfect for the role, and the script gave her a lot to do. She held her own nicely beside superman. I appreciated how this movie cut through all the angst and just allowed Lois to know who Superman was from the very beginning. That was very refreshing.One of the reasons this movie works so well for me is that it is a first-contract alien invasion movie, and it works very well as such. Independence Day looks like a cheesy cartoon in comparison.The flash-back scenes were nicely handled, allowing the story to fill in important elements of Clark's childhood without bogging down the beginning of the movie.I'm not sure if it's fair to call Man of Steel a perfect movie, but I can say without any hesitation that it was the perfect movie for me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Once and for all David S Goyer proofs that a mighty pen is vital for this kind of super hero, costume, fantasy adventure to attract attention beyond the CGI department. To mention just one actor in the cast is probably not totally fair because the whole ensemble is really OK, but with that said I will claim that it's impossible to deny Michael Shannons brilliance in virtually every role he takes on. In my opinion he's simply one of the best actors around these days and I would urge every fan of cinema to look him up in Iceman, the film he made previous to this one. As Supermans antagonist he succeeds in getting General Zod to become really menacing and unpleasant, and yes he ""steels"" every scene he's in even those he shares with the man of steel himself. Man of Steel is one of the top productions in this genre, almost on par with Batman Begins which nine years after its release in 2005, in my opinion, still is the best super hero adventure to yet have landed on screen.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Superman and Green Lantern were my favorite DC characters, as Green Arrow and Batman had too similar origins and partners, Speedy and Robin, respectively. Marvel Comics were not even carried on any of the news stands I frequented. While I later became more found of characters who relied on their skills rather than super powers, I certainly read more Superman, as he appeared in both the Superman and Detective Story comic books. I had never been really satisfied with the movie versions of Superman; it always seemed to me they chose the wrong actresses to play Lois Lane. Both Noel Nell (""Adventures of Superman"") and Terri Hatcher (""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"") resembled the comic book Lois Lane, both in appearance and class. However, until ""Man of Steel,"" I had never seen a such a hash of the Superman legend. Even as a kid, I understood that Kal-El embodied BOTH Clark Kent AND Superman; and that Lois, while a fearless, crusading reporter, was so vain and self deceptive that she could not recognize that Clark and Superman were one in the same; as she was unable to accept both sides of Kal-El. Kal-El loved Lois, despite this tragic character trait. The widely-despised ""Superman III"" actually makes a point of this; in that Lana Lang loved Clark Kent and could not care less that he was Superman. However, in ""Man of Steel,"" Lois is ONLY non-family member who knows Clark Kent is Superman. The entire theme of ""the inner man"" has been tragically shelved.Henry Cavill does a fine job of playing Kal-El, even if he less resembles the comic book Superman than Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain or George Reeves. Clearly Cavill has a great future in Hollywood. Amy Adams, an otherwise superb actress (""American Hustle"") is totally wrong for Lois Lane. Not meaning to be unkind, I asked myself, ""Just how does one actually go about kissing a woman with such a LONG nose"". As written, NONE of Lois' trademark characteristics are visible in Adams' role.Russell Crowe seems to have as much screen time as Cavill. Whose movie is this, Jor-El's or Kal-El's? In the original comics, the Kents were an ELDERLY couple. Here, they appear to be in their mid to late 40s.While the effects and production design are handsomely mounted, there is nothing new here to rave about. Worse, the movie is numbingly long. Superman does not even appear in costume until nearly two hours into the movie. Say what you want about any of the Christopher Reeve efforts; they were never boring or ponderous. ""Man of Steel is both.""First Knight"" was rightfully savaged in 1995 when it created a travesty of the King Arthur legend. ""Man of Steel"" gets kudos. Has our cultured declined THAT much in the last 20 years?I give ""Man of Steel"" a ""4"".","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action scenes are so over-the-top they actually become stressful to watch. I had virtually no idea what was even happening at some points, and to be honest, I didn't really care. The CGI is overwhelming and it feels like the editing team are simply showing off what they are capable of rather than trying to present something meaningful.Underneath all this ostentation is an array of horribly thin characters. Henry Cavill looks like Andy Murray on steroids and has the charisma to match. I don't expect Christopher Reeve levels of charm and likeability but Cavill is drab and insipid throughout, and his Clark Kent is barely distinguishable from his Superman. Michael Shannon had a tough job following Terence Stamps wonderfully camp portrayal of General Zod in Superman II, and he falls well short here. His performance was completely lacking in humour and charm, and his sidekicks were equally bland and one-dimensional. Amy Adams, who I rate as one of the better mainstream Hollywood actors, gets it all horribly wrong as Lois Lane. She seems to be torn between damsel in distress and strong independent woman and ends up just being nothing whatsoever. The worst performance in Man of Steel, however, is claimed by Russell Crowe who is tedious and pompous as Jor-El, and suffocates every scene he is involved in.The story is obvious, boring and excessive. Superman is unrecognisable from previous incarnations and the bad guys are just unimaginative gruel. The whole DCEU franchise gets off to a predictably bad start, and I dread to think what follows next.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

The film also does a crazy amount of expositions because it wants to be an origin story, but doesn't have the balls to be a character piece. The film has these great action set pieces, but when you see other people are in danger around Superman, you care very little, because the film spent no time developing any of the side characters. The film is cliché, generic, formulaic, and just isn't a lot of fun. I wouldn't have mind a character piece, but the film instead tries to be just another action film, but without the boisterous pleasure of something like The Avengers or Spiderman 2.","30 out of 120 found this helpful.

Such is the case with the second half of ""Man of Steel."" The first half is a decent origin story for the hero, but the second half devolves into so much mindless action that I found myself bored despite all the ""exciting"" things going on. Say what you want about 2006's ""Superman Returns,"" but it didn't make this mistake. ""Superman Returns"" had great character development and was engrossing, and more so as the story progressed. ""Man of Steel"" is the exact opposite: The more the story progressed the more detached I became.""Man of Steel"" has a lot going for it. For one, the cast is superb. Henry Cavill is the best actor to play Superman yet, and Amy Adams (Lois), Michael Shannon (General Zod), Russell Crowe (Supe's dad) and Kevin Costner (Clark's stepdad) are all fine here, not to mention Zod's female assistant, played by Antje Traue, who steals the show! Like the original 1978 ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve, the sci-fi in ""Man of Steel"" is stellar, only more so. Despite this, the first half's origin tale isn't as engrossing or entertaining as the first half of the '78 version. Still, it's not bad. Things go wrong in the second half, however, where one action scene is lumped on another with top-of-the-line F/X. It's similar to the Terminator films where two or more invincible inhumans pummel each other through walls and buildings, and humans shoot billions of ineffective rounds into them, except that the first three Terminator films keep your interest (especially the first two).FINAL WORD: So my feelings are mixed on ""Man of Steel."" In many ways it's great filmmaking, but they fumble the ball in the most important department -- an interesting story and characters you care about. They somewhat succeed in the first half, but the second half is an overload of ""exciting"" action scenes that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.GRADE: C+","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

His eternal fight against evil got immortalized in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve.

Superhero movies are supposed to emphasize the hero's cleverness and the villain's plot. The last half hour of this movie is more like a Rambo movie. On top of it, the movie has too much of a religious bend: Superman is less a character that inspires cosplay than a Jesus-like figure.So, I don't recommend the movie.

This is THE BEST reboot of the iconic hero my eyes have laid upon, and the satisfaction from the Man of Steel experience, is addictive to say the least.Writers Christopher Nolan and David Goyer, deserves applause for Man of Steel's storyline. It happily veers away from eccentrics and humor, and settles as an engrossing & original sci-fi drama that pursues Clark's altruistic fantasy to blend in, and humanity's response to his godlike being. As for Clark's back stories, our dear writers amazingly spares little details and offers heavy handed emotions, that never feels imposing. From the action packed opening events in Krypton, to well placed flash backs of his adoptive parents, Clark's upbringing that justifies his morality is brought to light. The focus on these storylines in place of the inevitable romance between Lois and Clark was a welcome surprise, as the drama was brimming with interest and novelty that previous Superman films plainly lacked.As for the portrayals, DC Films & Zack Snyder gets a 10/10 for Man of Steele's cast & direction. Henry Cavil dons the red cape to perfection, conveying a certain majesty Superman deserves. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner & Amy Adams were on point casting, convincing as Clark's source of morality & warmth. As for the antagonists, General Zod's menace impressively emanates from the always intense Michael Shannon, providing a worthy challenge to Superman's righteous grandeur. Special mention for Antje Traue, who steals her every scene with her sinister & ominous renders.Final praise to the visual effects & camerawork that produced the best & most creative action sequences in any Superman adaptation. These never before seen angles and embellishments elevated the spectacle of godlike beings' toe to toe action, and the magnificence of their superhero abilities. Jaw dropping!Man of Steel then, is truly an amazing Superman film and an outstanding kickoff to the DCEU. Excitement is an understatement for what the studio Snyder has in store for for us. 9/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However poor a review, however few people go to watch it, however far from the original, I will still watch on some format and have a thoroughly good time doing so. Well this is what I told myself after I watched Superman Returns. After all, these films, if to be true to the comics, must have a comic feel. Now, not all comics are like the Batman television series from the 60s; believe it or not, many are just like the Christopher Nolan Batman films and often even darker! This Superman film does not disappoint. I can imagine this story coming straight from a comic book layout; big pictures - dark, light, colourful, dark, light and finally colourful once again. Something else about comic books is that there is not a great deal of words in them (well usually). Again, a key aspect to this story is the lack of talking (although this could just be a consequence of Nolan's involvement). Something else that could come from Nolan's involvement is the aspect that comics do struggle to provide - the sound and the music. It enhances the film and does not, as I have heard people complain about films with Nolan influence in them, overpower it.So, what's not so good? I've seen complaints about some of the action and, mostly, I don't agree. However, a good comic book will not repeat the same pictures, even if the same characters are involved. The eyes, during this film, might just be forgiven for believing that they have just seen this same fight take place 10 minutes previous. Even if Spiderman, Ironman or the Incredible Hulk end up fighting the same person over and over again; it will almost always be in a visually different place or, if it needs to be in the same place, be with the lights on and then the lights off. To be honest, this is just nit picking. I am not even sure if it is really what happened; it is just how I ended up feeling after all the fighting finished. In the end, the film will finish and you should end up with that nice warm feeling inside that says, ""I enjoyed that, I want to see it again.""","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm not sure if it was because I wanted or hoped for a better Superman than the first instalment. I was not disappointed with Zack Synders take on Superman in fact I loved some of the new ideas that came from this movie. I grew up loving Richard Donners Superman and Christopher Reeve will most probably always be my favourite. Along with John Williams score I can see how hard it was going to be to make the hero come to life in a new way. I think Zack Synder has done a great job breaking away from all the previous Supermen and Hans Zimmer done a fantastic score. Man of steel has been brought into today's world with today's problems. Henry Cavil is an awesome Superman and does the character justice. Amy Adams is a great actress and also done well as Lois Lane. I would have liked to seen less Cgi and a little bit more light heartiness come through in the script because Man of steel does tend to take itself a bit too serious. I didn't want a Dark Knight reinvention. I really like the flight scenes especially The First flight! I know that superman would be super quick and the fight scenes do tend to show this a little too often. Everyone will have a different take on this movie and I know comments come thick and fast. I believe that Richard Donners Superman hit the nail on the head ""You'll believe an man can fly"" and I did! When I first watched Superman I believed a man could fly. Being only 8 it was a lot more convincing.

The old Superman who was slightly comedic is long gone and the dark hero which proved so popular for the caped crusader is here! I'm very impressed the way this movie concept was dealt with and the fact that it shows good character development. It wasn't as gritty as the Batman films but we certiantly saw a different side to Superman. I also love the fact that they gave Supermans home planet Krypton even more back story and showed us what exactly the planet looked like. The CGI was on point, most super hero movies are just violent without a real plot (Avengers) where as this movie showed more plot to go with the awesome battles within it. The story has set up well for more sequels but to be honest I am worried about the upcoming Superman vs Batman movie, maybes that should of made a sequel first where they introduce Lex Luther before jumping straight into this movie","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Batman, and Superman, then more Batman, then more Superman.Whereas some of the Batman and Superman movies might be really good, I find it impossible to respect them because its ALL been done before.When I heard there was going to be a new Superman movie, I sighed, knowing that this is just another money-making scheme because they saw how much Avengers Assemble made, and DC wanted a slice.This is obviously a build-up to a Justice League movie (completely ripping off Marvels success from The Avengers), and if DC had started their 'films building up to JL' with something like Wonder Woman, I would be much more enthusiastic, because its a change. But I read last week that there would be Man of Steel, then Man of Steel 2, then JL movie, THEN if that does well, they would do all the separate hero movies.No matter how good Man of Steel is, I can't respect it, or value it at all, simply because we have seen it all before a thousand times. To DC, make a movie of one of your heroes that we don't know about! I have no idea what Aqua-man's origin story is, or what villains he fights. I would much rather see Aqua-man, Flash, and Wonder Woman get their own movies before another Superman movie, because seriously, we are bored now.","12 out of 43 found this helpful.

But, he soon discovers his superpowers and the truth behind his origin, and just in the nick of time as he is Earth's only hope to defeat the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) of Krypton and his followers.Though a very long movie at over two hours, this film grabs your attention from start to finish, filling the screen with intense drama and action. The plot is more darker than the Christopher Reeve trilogy and the character development and backgrounds are different. There is plenty of crazy CGI action - Superman flying everywhere, buildings topping, planes falling, and edge-of-your-seat good guy vs. bad guy action. The acting wasn't bad. Henry Cavill makes a likable Superman and Amy Adams makes a tough but caring Lois Lane. I also like the portrayal of Martha Kent by Diane Lane. The film gives a more in depth look into the devastation of the planet Krypton, the relationship between Kal El (Clark) and his Earth parents and a better chemistry between Clark and Lois Lane (Amy Adams).Overall, a pretty good introduction to the new trilogy of Superman and other DC superheroes.

"10","/10","People are being way overcritical, almost jaded. This is the reboot that needed to happen to make Superman less comic book silly and more real for modern audiences.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2824273/?ref_=tt_urv","bryguy74-606-17871","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40870240/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2013","Everyone can agree that there's something nostalgic and timeless about the Superman of yesterday, whether it be the good old days of the old cartoon serials from the 1930's to the TV show of the 50's to the hugely popular Christopher Reeve movies of the 80's. In fact, some folks are down right emotionally attached to the old ways, and any change is regarded as an act of treason! Mixed reviews aside, even the Superman Returns rehash of 2006 didn't dare change the Christopher Reeve nods and comic booky style of the franchise. This movie was able to do what no predecessor ever has done before, which was to make it feel real and relevant to modern audiences, and do so with astonishing attention to detail. There finally exists a movie now about an alien from another planet who isn't hanging from wires as can be seen in the 80's movies, and no more goofy stuttering, stammering of Clark Kent, and no more depiction of hickish oafs, no more unsophisticated and almost sloppy lack of attention to plot consistency.What we have here is an amazing makeover on a popular franchise done correctly. Not dark like one would expect from a Nolan vehicle, just set in a tone that modern audiences don't feel is dumbed or watered down, in a setting that is believable and emotionally grounded, well, for a superhero picture that is! Don't get me wrong I loved the Christopher Reeve movies. I loved his persona, and certain elements whether done badly or not, just reminds you of childhood. But let's be honest, it wreaks of bad production value and silliness. After Superman 2 they become barely palatable. Hey what do you want, 80's audiences weren't that sophisticated yet! Throw in a big popular comedian of the times, slap in some kryptonite, pepper in some thinly veiled technological plot that today's audiences would pick to pieces like famished wolverines, and there you have it, a Superman movie. This movie is NOT that.I liked what they did in the '06 version, insofar as it took the old concept and polished it up, put it in a neat little package with a bow on it, and relaunched the franchise with clean lines and good intentions. The problem was, it was boring! Nuance and emotional subtlety aside, it just didn't pack the wallop that the franchise needed to relaunch the series. Maybe if it added another solid 20-30 minutes of rip roaring action then perhaps it might have done the franchise justice. Roth and Spacey did what they could with the Bryan Singer ""refined fancy man"" sensibilities that the movie was obviously influenced by. It really was a beautiful picture actually, just almost too clean and too pretty, but falls flat. But Man of Steel delivers on so many levels; an action packed, humanity laced, octane charged, humanity driven movie of not just a dude in tights with super powers, but an alien from another planet. It succeeds as an extra terrestrial sci-fi and action movie, as a love story, and as a spiritual commentary.There is a thin line movies must tread when depicting alien planets and alien races, as it can lose an audience if done incorrectly, as I believe it did for some viewers with such movies as John Carter or even Avatar at a certain level. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but the movie is big, it is nuanced, it is passionate, and takes the subject matter dead seriously and is done in a way, I believe, that puts this classic story on the silver screen in a professional and qualitative way that has never been done correctly before. It does away with the tights, instead opting for a traditional uniform given him by his Kryptonian culture. The S no longer a cheesy ""hey it's Superman"" S, but a symbol, a familial crest if you will, symbolizing hope. His nemesis Zod, really does believe he is doing what's right for his planet Krypton, not just a devilish and fiendish character to frighten and be eccentric for acting sake, but a person on the other side of a point of view, who also believes he is serving as an agent of good, and doing what's right for his people. I like the updated General Zod and his 2 cohorts. No longer looking like Pat Benatar in their Hefty bag outfits, but similar enough you know it's still them. It still has the sassy cute brunette short edgy haircut chick and the big big BIG guy, minus the cheesiness, and this time Zod is an actual General, not the self given title as with the original movies. All the elements of the Superman methos are there, but subtle enough to not feel contrived, not just with characterization, but with the whole theme of this movie throughout.To sum, the movie is big, it's huge in scale, it's loud, it's got punches and people being flung through buildings, it's got laser beams coming out of the eyes, it's got all the makings of a big budget summer movie and high octane action movie. But what it also has is grounded characters that keeps feeling grounded throughout, because it doesn't forget to have heart. It is the Superman movie that needed to happen, and I am very pleased with it. Under a microscope I'm sure folks will find fault somewhere. But honestly, unless you're looking through the lens of a cynical desensitized jaded hyper sophisticated douche filter, you won't notice the cons nearly as be impressed with the pros. I believe a big visually interesting, intellectually honest, eye candy spectacular saga is reborn, with all the trimmings, and in good fashion. You will never get me to stop loving the timeless classics of yesteryear, but at least now I can breath easy not seeing wires or scoffing another hoakey line again.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Reason: it tells a story. Also, it is not a rip off of the previous movies of the Superman genre. Instead, it offers a unique interpretation of the Superman story. It frames the story as a morality tale with the protagonist caught in a moral conflict, one which defies an easy solution. Also, the story's main antagonist, General Zod, has a plausible reason for doing what he does. That is, his actions are not motivated by any sadistic urges but rather are part of a mission, one that Superman cannot readily dismiss since it involves him too. One can almost sympathize with Zod's plight. Also, the story plays up the fact that Superman is an alien, and one who could also pose a threat to the human race ... if he wants. Unlike previous Superman movies, this movie deals with Superman in a forthright manner and not merely as a comic book character with special powers. That Superman must disguise himself as a human is evidence of his own uncertain and tenuous relationship with the rest of the world. This uncertainty permeates throughout the movie as Superman is shown concealing his true identity in order to avoid alarming people. This ambivalence raises the story of Superman to a more mature and dramatically powerful level. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman and the rest of the cast is equally excellent too. This movie is a must-see for all movie buffs and for everyone else too.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Everything is tinted blue. Even Superman's costume is dark and drab. The problem is that they approach the legend in the wrong way. There are three hero tracks. They are born great (Superman). They achieve greatness (Batman). They have greatness thrust upon'em (Spiderman). The second and third tracks are more interesting dramatically because the hero moves from one state to another. All we can do with the first hero is marvel at his superiority, but that's Superman's tale. In ""Man of Steel"", Clark Kent is Peter Parker. His gifts are a curse. But Superman is a hero because he embraces his greatness fearlessly, and he fights for truth and justice (not the American way, Hollywood forbid) joyfully and confidently. ""Man of Steel"" was more like ""The Last Temptation of Superman"". We're supposed to look up to him. We're not supposed to want to buy him a beer and say, ""Everything's gonna be all right, buddy.

It was an EXPERIENCE. It was an event. From start to finish, I was captivated. I won't sit here and act like I don't have a bias here, but I know that the makers of this film took special care with the material and did well go piece together a very carefully written screenplay. I especially loved how the Superman mythos continued to take on the identity of its original creators, two Jewish men living at a time where a messianic figure was needed to provide an escape from the harsh realities of a growing world. The visuals of this film--seen in 3D I might add--were stunning from start to finish. It is no exaggeration to declare that this spectacle will be successful in suspending your belief that a man is incapable of flying through the sky. I witnessed intrigue, wonder, excitement, action, adventure, mystery, and even love. Family, sacrifice, loss, and tragedy were all seen here, all finding it's way into the origin story of a man named Kal-El sent to our world in order to serve as a guiding light for our darkened ways. I felt a spiritual connection to this film as well, and considering my upbringing coupled with my love for the Man of Steel's stories growing up, it was a match made in the heavens. I too was not of this world--even if it was for a little over two and a half hours. The right man was found to portray the man who would be Clark Kent, and his qualities as the Last Son of Krypton totally overlooked the fact that he was the first Superman in film that didn't stand around 6'4. His inner strength was evident, and this film masterfully depicted the struggles of an essential demigod as he sought to blend in with his surroundings as much as he possibly could. For the first time, I saw a Superman film that had both an origin story and a real danger for him to do battle with. This was no picnic for Superman. Normally, films that introduce or reintroduce a character usually have a rather easy foe for him or her to deal with, all while giving them a medium to introduce viewers to their abilities. Not so with Man Of Steel. Man Of Steel showed a Superman faced with quite possibly the greatest challenge any superhero had ever faced on the big screen---the threat of the global extinction of his adopted people. From the very beginning to the last shot of a smiling hero, the viewer is treated to a riveting musical score that matched the pace of a film that was majestic from start to finish. Most people like myself expected them to use a revamped version of the classic theme, but upon realizing that this was a new generation and a new era, I quickly grew to adore the new theme almost as much as I did the old one. I can't wait for the next installment of this new DC era. This movie has earned a 10/10 in my book. Superman has returned to theaters, and after this near masterpiece, he's finally here to stay.  As a dedicated Superman fan, I couldn't be happier. I took more than a few moments after the closing credits to catch my breath, and I'm ready to see it again. I could honestly go on for hours and days about this film, so I'll stop before IMDb revokes my ranting privileges for a month. God bless the Superman franchise. I feel like a kid again, and I don't ever want this feeling to leave me. Bring on the sequels!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A big comic book fan, I was pleased to see all of the references and inspiration from Superman literature. This film captured the struggle Clark Kent goes through trying to find himself. It is able to have a huge emphasis on story while providing excellent action. Zack Snyder was able to modernize Superman, and make him relevant once again. No movie is perfect, and this movie does have a few Errors, but none so significant they would detract from the viewing experience. Man of Steel gives us a Superman for today, and is faithful to the superman of the past.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

If your characters are invincible, you can't have them physically fight for an hour and a half. Get creative. Gratuitously blowing up buildings for a full hour and a half is a real cop-out. So they basically wrote half a movie and forgot the rest? No thanks. I was near tears from boredom by the end. I give it a 5 because the first half of the movie was great and he was sexy as hell.

It lived up to the hype, despite the sub par reviews it received from the critics. Seriously, this was a wide spread mistake among the film critics. The film was fantastic. Sure the fight scenes were a little overblown, but BAD?! ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! Man of Steel had a great story, an epic scale, great music, and Superman has been brought back to life.If there was one thing that stood out in the movie, it was the action scenes. The fights were incredible. It reminded me of not only The Avengers, but also the anime masterpiece Dragon Ball. I know this may not sound like anything new, but it really reminded me of it considering I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z and it was a mega part of my childhood. It was quite spectacular seeing how similar it was to Akira Toriyama's classic fighting style that's since been adopted in millions of Hollywood blockbusters nowadays. Aside from the fighting, it's classic Superman storytelling. The film is faithful to the Superman mythos, from the destruction of Krypton to Clark being discovered by the Kents, thus adopting the identity of Clark Kent. It follows the Superman mythology well, but it does take liberties of its own, like some references to other DC characters that may result in cameos in Man of Steel sequels.Overall the film was great. But I dare say that the script was sometimes overwritten. David S. Goyer is the man to hire when it comes to writing a great story for a superhero film, but his dialogue contains too many big words that human beings wouldn't speak in regular sentences. Regardless, the script still gets high marks from me. It gets a grade of B+; great execution, but should have been revised a little more before shooting.I give Man of Steel 9/10 S'es, but it's not an S. On Kal's world it means hope.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I have been on Man of Steel board almost since it's inception. Probably most of you will recognize me from my earlier posts or from my replies. I am a die-hard Supes fan like most of you here. And I can vouch for it's sincerity, it's genuine likability; as a fan, as a reader of the comics, and as a guy just desperately waiting for it's release. And now that I have seen it, I don't have words to describe the moments this movie offers, the emotions it conveys, the depth it has. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge action fan but if you are just looking for action (which in MOS destroys any other superhero movie action ever put on screen), maybe this movie isn't for you. I have been hearing a lot of negative comments about it, like how strange it is and how dark it is. But I honestly can tell you that if you had faith in Man of Steel since they announced it more than a year back and you wanted it to succeed no matter what the odds were, you will get up at the end of the movie and clap. This movie conveys everything Superman is and stands for. Henry Cavill makes this character his own and his interpretation is maybe the most realistic portrayal of a desolated, alien superhero ever put on screen. He has the charisma, the humility, the voice and the looks. But in addition to all this, Henry gives his heart to the legend we all admire and cherish. I am sure that Henry will always be remembered for Man of Steel not because he is an actor, but because he is Superman. Bravo sir, I salute your effort. You have made a new fan in me, not that I doubted that you wouldn't be able to. Another thing I would like to talk about is the music. There is a backlash concerning the original theme and why it wasn't used in this movie. But how can one reinvent and still use the same structure? The music in Man of Steel plays a huge part in the progression of the story. Yes, John Williams' legendary note is sincerely missed but Hans Zimmer provides Man of Steel with a subtle yet radiant symphony that makes the viewer get lost in the story the movie is telling. The action and drama in the movie would be incomplete without Zimmer's provoking pieces. The fight scenes are equipped with music so epic that one can only feel and applaud while watching the movie. The supporting cast is tremendous too. Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Antje Traue, Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Laurence Fishburne are all great in their respective roles. The movie required a certain aura from all of them and they contribute perfectly. The direction is great, as nothing asinine can be expected of Mr. Zach Snyder. David S. Goyer has crafted an intelligent story, reinventing the beginnings of Kal-El. Its top notch science fiction put into writing and it clearly shows while playing on screen. I have to mention the fight scenes; it would not be fair otherwise reviewing or talking about a Superman movie. If nothing else would satisfy you in Man of Steel (which I highly doubt), just imagine the action in Avengers and the battle scenes multiplied by 1000. The result is Man of Steel. You will see destruction on a scale of grand magnitude so epic that you will be almost forced to say ""WOW""!!!!!!!!!It will take your breath away! There are some contexts present in MOS which may not be appreciated by a few people. But I went with an open mind, not getting influenced by the critics or by the horde of imbecile trolls currently frequenting this board. I saw it, I liked it and I believed in it. There were genuine claps all over the hall when the movie finished. All of us left the hall knowing that we would be returning shortly. And if that is not the magic and purpose of a superhero movie, I think we have failed as viewers to enjoy the few hours we get to escape reality. I know I would be watching this at least 2 more times. I am completely immersed in the experience it provided and I am sure it would take some time to snap out of it. This is pure MAGIC OF EPIC PROPORTIONS people and if you can take a word from a real fan, go and see it. I am sure the real fans and the original posters on this board would agree with me. Score : 11 our of 10 starsThank you!","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Is this what the director of ""300"" dove the waters of his spirit deep to find, a darkening and almost inaccessible alienation of the Superman dynamic, until it is almost unrecognizable as the ""Man of Steel?"" These are iconic characters submerged into the depths of a graphic novelist's imagination, where beauty is transformed to ugliness, where divinity is transformed to the demonic, where a heavenly vision is turned hellish, in the name of a realism that exists only in this gifted filmmaker's mind. Yes, he is extremely talented, but at what cost to the moviegoer, who sits in naïve desperation at his dark, alien vision, reaching into the gloomy gray of it to grope for some earthbound substance, to find a character named Clark Kent, and another one named Superman. Somewhere in this gray, clouded vision of ashes, they are lost.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Zack Synder is a sort of ""hit or miss"" director for me (Loved Watchmen but Sucker Punch and 300 where nothing special, IMO) and the early reviews and commentaries where not specially positive.I went in with rather low expectations but by the end I really liked this take on Superman and this general take on superhero movies. The movie had a compelling story to tell, never trying to be specially ""Deep"" but giving us a new look into the origins of superman and giving great focus to both ""Fathers"" which defined the man he became. I think it was a rather good mix of story and action, a kind of mix that I would like to see more in superhero movies. The latest batman felt a bit too heavy on the story, giving a rather small amount of screen time to Batman himself (now, I do enjoy them wanting to tell a deeper story with the batman movies, but they can't forget that we are here to see a superhero movie), and the newer Marvel movies have almost felt like comedies with action scenes (Iron Man 3 was basically a series of jokes and funny situations in between action scenes). So it was nice to see Man of Steel keep the serious tone without giving up on the action and over the top fighting.And as we talk about the action, it was really well done. With good use of special effects and a lot of amazing looking scenes.Henry Cavill works well as Clark giving a solid performance but I didn't quite like Michael Shannon's take on ZOD.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

As Krypton's foremost mind of science he is trying to warn others of the planets ultimate destruction. Yes, this is old hat, but new to the equation is General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempting a takeover of the Kryptonian government. As the planet erupts around them Jor-El and Lara send their child to Earth.""This sounds like the beginning to Superman: The Movie!""I hear you, I hear you, but where Snyder and Goyer have gone so completely right is how fully fleshed out Krypton is as a world. No one, outside of comic readers, have truly seen any type of Kryptonian environment represented on the big screen. Full of mountains and flying creatures, it was great getting to see a true eco-system that makes you feel more connected to this doomed world, and therefore, feel more of a connection when the inevitable happens.Going into Man of Steel I can sense some of you feeling some trepidation that you will have to sit through an entire origin story that you already, for the most part, know backwards and forwards. I am hear to tell you to have no fear because one of the best aspects of this movie is the way Goyer has inter weaved Clark's early years into the story of Man of Steel. You will not be sitting through 45 minutes of young Kent exposition to bring about the birth of Superman. Rather you will be getting adult Clark looking back on his life as moments remind him of his childhood years. Such a simple and completely satisfying way to watch an origin story, even one you already know all too well.The wonderful thing that Man of Steel does is show Clark's need to be more. His want to help, even in the face of people learning his secret. This is the essence of a hero and the biggest reason why Superman is who he is. He is learning the hero thing as we watch. The lessons that both of his fathers instill in him are the bedrock of the film. Will the world reject a savior? Even if they do, is it still his responsibility to use his gifts for the good of mankind?","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

A revamped look into the world of krypton was amazing and really does help set the tone, as well as back story for Clark Kent aka Kal-El aka Superman!It definitely was a darker version of the story, but this allowed more depth for the development of Clark as a Human, and I feel the movie focused more on these parts slightly more than other movies - which simply concentrate on supermans powers. The development of clark's super powers was not as in depth as other movies.Visual effects were stunning. Aside from the planet krypton, the movie modernizes supermans superpowers, using the latest visual technology. 3D viewing would be recommended!Overall the movie was quite good, it had good visuals, a deeper storyline and also great action sequences. Russel Crowe does a good job appearing here and there to help tell the story and give it some depth. I rate this movie at an 8/10!

Lois not knowing was what made the other version so superior to this one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

With Warner Brothers having had success with Christopher Nolan's rebooted Batman series, they decided to bring him on board for the Superman reboot. It has worked very well.This movie has somewhat taken the same route as Batman Begins did with exploring the origin and beginning of Superman which really added substance and more depth to the protagonist. While the Christopher Reeve movies had a more light-hearted tone to them, this movie is more grounded and gritty. The old Superman movie theme tune and red trunks on Superman's suit are gone which was a good thing.While the action sequences were admittedly over the top, they were still great fun to watch. The special effects were also fantastic.I have to say that I am bewildered that this movie didn't get great reviews. Then again, I've come to realise that movie critics can't be trusted because they really don't know how to enjoy movies and end up taking them too seriously. It's not the first time either. They have also given negative reviews to other popular movies including Taken and Man on Fire. So the take home message is simple - don't trust the critics!Arguably, this is the best Superman movie so far. Christopher Nolan's touch has really worked here. The long-term hype was worth it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Wonderful graphics, in depth storyline and memorable characters and plots. I can't wait to see the next adventure of Superman and hope Henry Cavill will reprise his role for future projects!

Everyone wants to blame it for too much action at the back half of the movie, along with too much CGI, and the ending. We are no longer in the 20th century, we are in the 21st century and this is what people want to see. I mean look at what the movie has grossed so far. People are going back to the theater multiple times to see it. Superman is the most powerful superhero and his abilities should be displayed. How else was he supposed to fight off the villain(s) he did? With a villain such as Lex Luthor it will be a change of pace as obviously he doesn't possess the powers of Superman. Definitely wasn't perfect in all aspects, but a great start. I have confidence the Man of Steel movies will continue to improve. Good start to a shared universe and I expect that Man of Steel 2 will have more hints to a Justice Leaguer or 2. Looking forward to what solo movies will follow with Justice Leaguers and I hope DCs plan is released at the upcoming Comic Con.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Marvel previously has dominated the comic department, and kind of kicks DC films out of the way due to their frequent releasing of films, but in this movie it's makes Marvel to DC as a Best-Seller Worldwide comic book to a comic strip on the back page of an elementary school new paper. DC now has a chance due to this films tremendous and perfect outcome of the worlds best super-hero now gives them a chance to expand their franchises. Visually, breath taking, the jaw-dropping action continues through out perfectly has to be noticed for it's amazing visual effects. The camera motions and the animation that blend completely into the action packed story serve that jaw-dropping effect. The actors where perfect for their role, Henry Cavill has to play Superman in the new films. General Zod was a perfect villain. This movie was my favorite by far, I will never forget going to see this the day it came out on June 14th on Friday, the last day of school, at 1:30 pm at the Everett Mall Stadium Regal Cinemas. I am going to see this movie again on my birth day, and if I could another. Zack Snyder has been my favorite director for a while, but now to me he is the best. I give it a 10/10, 5 out of 5. 1,000,000/1,000,000, flawless perfection at its height. Amazing, and good luck on the nest one. Best movie and my favorite movie by far.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Probably one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. The last 2 hour movie I sat through was ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and at the end of that movie, I sat there wondering why in the world did I just sit through a 2 hour movie that could've been done in the typical 90 minutes. BUT Superman, yea I wish it would've been 3 hours long. They did a great job of telling a story so even if you had NEVER HEARD OF SUPERMAN (which we know everyone has) you'd still be able to understand WHO Superman is and why he's so super! ;-) They did a beautiful job of showing both sides of both worlds. I don't think we realize how much of the movie is computer graphics & how much is just exquisite props & sets because either way, it looked realistic. Superman is now my Hero! And Henry Cavill who played Clark Kent was the perfect choice to play this character which is very cool because Henry doesn't have a long track record of films...that is until now. I bet you see him in more movies from here on out! The only thing that I didn't like IF I HAD TO pick something, would be Lois Lane played by Amy Adams. I just think they could've found someone a little better to play her character. I found her annoying to me at times. She doesn't play a knock out beautiful girl & I think that's good for the story & purpose but she just didn't fit the bill to me. Maybe Rachel McAdams or someone, I don't know! But other than that little meaningless opinion, it was AMAZING! A must see in the theater on big screen with surround sound! ;-D SOUND ;-D","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It lacks character, emotional, and intellectual building that makes a great movie in our time. The writing is just as predictable as the plot itself. It's one of those movies you will check your watch and think ""when it is going to end?"". The CGI and superman's muscles are great no doubt, but I believe we are not here for CGI and definitely not muscles.

This reboot made me feel connected not only that it seems to somehow catch up with where the TV series 'smallville' left off in its final season, but on how the story of Clark Kent was tailored to somehow fit the scientific realm. How and why his powers came to be, what happened to his home planet before he was sent here to earth and how the Lois and Clark actually began. Although I gotta admit that I still crave for the Lana Lang moments that were hugely part of the Smallville Series.Henry Cavil made a perfect superman for me for he possess the qualities of that superhero we've always known. The touch of family and drama in the movie makes it more interesting and the come back of some veteran actors in the film such as Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Russell Crowe just satisfy the audiences' craving for new faces in the big screen yet this time it came like a blast in the past.The storyline is just carefully thought of and makes us believe this reboot of superman is the real story after all- no offense to our Original Christopher Reeve.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everyone who wants to see how amazing a Superhero can be should see this movie. Superman's powers are on display here, and there has never been anything like it in any movie ever made. Hands Down.

I saw the movie ""Man of Steel"" my observations are as follows:- 1. The computer generated graphics were at its best, everything was running so smooth and without any glitches that it really gives a real look, which was much appreciated. 2. In the starting scene of the movie the process of child birth was shown which I think was a bit graphical and was not suitable for younger children to watch it with their parents that scene should have been avoided; if possible. 3. The acting part of either the man of steel or the reporter from ""Daily Planet"" Ms. Louise Lane and much to mention about the excellent gesture in the eyes of the editor of the newspaper was really heart touching and it really moved me as I was deeply touched. 4. In the ending scenes of the movie the destruction shown in the city created by General Zod and the superman was a bit annoying as that scene was over exaggerated as it was for a longer duration it really lose its vitality. 5. In the culminating scene of the movie at one side the General Zod was shown so powerful that he was melting the steel pipes and steel structures and on the other side he was so weak that superman just twist his neck and he died which I think was out of proportion. 6. At the beginning of the movie I was not comfortable with the new superman but his acting and performance as a superman and as a human being was very outstanding and it really make me to like him by the time movie was ending which is quite good as the gentleman really make his mark. I will rate this movie by giving it 9 out of 10, as it really allowed me to watch it in one go and not even allowed me to go out for a smoke as it has really created an environment in which I was forced to watch it without any distraction. A good job by all the team members of the Legendry Pictures which really know how to make a movie!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This character would be the type of man and standard comic readers could joyously envision themselves being, not only for his godly physical capabilities, but for his strong will and lofty moral standards. Within every man there is a desire for good, and Superman is the forgone peak that makes us realize we have a long way to go.But before this, he was just a man. Zack Snyder, a director with an historically weak track record save for the passable Watchman adaptation, approaches the character in a way that's clever, and wholly appropriate upon contemplation. Understanding that audiences today can't relate to an illogically perfect right off the bat being, Man of Steel places Clark Kent right smack on the same overwhelming mountain climb, headed towards the same polished morality and idealism, but in a way that's humane and flawed. The result is a Superman that's more likable and accessible without having his core essence sacrificed.Right smack in the face of all rules and regulations of the book of Superman Stereotypes 101, Man of Steel creates a thick palpable atmosphere that's defiant, but also wholly appropriate. Superman is very much a product of mythology, a god to many, and the film's gritty style and tone are carefully created in a way that not exemplifies this image, but is a refreshing change of pace for a franchise previously chained down by expectations of whimsy and farce.Hanz Zimmer's heart pounding score combined with Snyder's skillful visual direction create a sort of atmosphere and aesthetic complexity that hits the audience as a much unexpected surprise. Much of this can be found in the long awaited Superman style combat scenes, which are well crafted enough to (almost) justify their excess. The camera captures the motion of the two colliding titans in a way that doubles as my mind's eye when I read Superman comics, and saw panels of shock-waves and mountains crumbling. This is Superman action exactly as this Superman fan envisioned.Although the overarching action itself, often composed of tired Michael Bay tropes, crumbling buildings and much of what I wasn't pining for in Superman Returns is part of a flawed script from Goyer. His screenplay is let down by bits of cheesy dialogue, tiring thematic exposition that doesn't really know what is trying to say, and many underwritten ideas. The blunt of the story however, is compelling enough to keep these short-comings at bay. Zod is a compelling, well written antagonist that can make you root for both sides, and is played with an immense passion and gusto that makes him the most threatening and likable comic book villain yet, at least for the last several years. The entire cast, though sporadically let down by flaws in the material presented, fit like a glove for the roles they're playing. Cavill, a man who looks like Superman straight out of the comics, emphasizes the human, the Man in Man of Steel, and is convincingly confused and unsure of himself. There are moments however, where we see exactly the kind of ideal he'll grow to be, and it's in these moments of unbridled charisma and presence where his performance truly shines. Amy Adams may have come off as too cute and refrained to pull off the sort of hardened tough girl lines Lois Lane's character requires, but in technical terms, there are no complaints.Man of Steel is a flawed, but visceral ambitious take on a familiar that treads a line between daring and uncompromising. One of the best comic book films and a Superman film that sores above and above all reasonable expectations.84%","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was no humor in the movie which is a good. Overall i feel the script had flaws but it did not distract from the over all epicness.

Metropolis is never mentioned, the final Clark Kent with glasses is far more evident than the Reeve one... Ahhh please don't talk about the soundtrack without Williams!I really supposed that Nolan will do something more but it was my mistake, What can I say Alexander Salkind and Donner please forgive Nolan and Snyder!I need to see the 1978 movie again!

Let me start by saying that I've been looking forward to this movie more than any other this year - and when I saw the bad reviews come in , not only did I dismiss them, I felt angry having not yet seen the movie, as I was convinced it was going to be great. I mean, how could it not be, with Zach Snyder directing, and Michael Shannon as Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El ?? The thing is that didn't mean a thing, as the whole thing turned out to be one big snooze fest of CGI , explosions , headache inducing camera-work and lots of military spouting nonsense. It was like the bits of a video game that you end up skipping on your play station, but for 2 and a quarter hours. I don't hate CGI, but you can't just throw a load of effects on a screen with a load of big bangs and call it a movie. The first half an hour was OK ( although I prefer the old icy version of Krypton - this one looked like something out of The Dark Crystal - dragons ??), but as soon as Zod turned up it became one long bore. I had to pinch myself to not fall asleep - oh, more crashing buildings ? more frantic camera-work - this is not action, it's just a mess !! I liked 300, and loved Watchmen, but this is just garbage that seems an all too familiar trend in the last few years - Pacific Rim, Star Trek into Darkness, The Avengers - no plot , all messy rubbish insulting our intelligence. And with my next point , I know many will disagree with me, as Hans Zimmer seems to be revered - but John Williams he ain't - and the Superman music made those films great. All I hear is his usual pounding drums and noisy brass - he has done some good scores, (such as Inception) but let him near an action movie and the results are horrible. Until cinema audiences start demanding more creative and imaginative movies, the lazy studios are going to keep offering the usual garbage. Look at the line up of films for 2015 - Star Wars Episode 7 (again we'll all get excited and it will be a mammoth CGI blast em up with no plot) , Avengers 2, Independence Day 2, Terminator 5, Jurassic Park 4, Pirates 5 etc ... I mean talk about lazy filmmaking , yet the buzz and hype will be unavoidable and all original, worthy films will fall through the cracks. Look what happens to talented directors such as JJ Abrams, Guillermo Del Toro and Zach Snyder once the studios get their hands on them - all of their unique vision and style goes out the window. Was Pacific Rim really directed by the same guy who directed Pan's Labyrinth ?? Cinema these days is great if you're about 10 years old and still into transformers - anyone who's not a teenager can go swivel. I'm depressed after watching this movie for the state of the film industry these days ....","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sorry for my bad english, but don't listen to the critics. 9/10 for me. Also, I feel they could have done more for Kevin Costners character, i feel he is a bit wasted. But Costner does it well. Russell Crowe is also good as Jor-El. I think this is truly a underrated superhero movie, and DC's best since Tim Burton's Batman.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have always been a big fan of Zack Snyder's work and this film is no exception. Snyder upped the ante to a new level by providing not just an origin story of Superman- but an incredible epic with so much flare it's hard to not be impressed. I don't understand the level of hate this film receives. Yes it's not as lighthearted and cheery as other superman flicks of the past, but if you wanted the exact same thing, why bother making a new film. Not to mention the dark tone for this film works so pehenomely well you'll wonder why they made the other films so light hearted in the first place. None of the wonder or amazement is lost here, and the charm is more impactful than ever. The set designs and look of the film are absolutely astounding, and although the film itself is not perfect, in many instances it did blow me away. I feel the biggest flaws with the film take place in the films second half- mainly towards the beginning of it- and the somewhat tedious action scenes that commence. They don't have the same heart that other scene have and feel like they are just kinda thrown in there, whereas later in the film it definitely feels more natural. Besides that though, the film does an excellent job with its balance of dark tones, realism, and heart- with some of the best writing i've seen from a superhero flick in a long time- remembering that it's not just about the CGI or effects but who these characters are and what they care about. In the end, I find Man of Steel to be a criminally underrated superhero flick and encourage anyone who hasn't seen it in a while to give it a second chance.My Rating: 9.3/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The reasons for this were never difficult to discern. Batman, with his cool Gothic-noir styled world, his psychologically fascinating rogue's gallery, and the overall dark and cynical themes of his franchise (which resonated with the true state of contemporary society only too well) was understandably galaxies ahead in the zeitgeist than Superman with his old-timey ideals of 'Truth, Justice and the American Way'. The fact that Christopher Nolan gave the world the 'Dark Knight' trilogy of the most critically acclaimed comic- book films EVER, while all Superman fans got was a nostalgic look-back at the Christopher Reeves/Richard Donner days, sure didn't do the Big Blue Boy Scout any favors!Indeed, the greatest triumph of director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David Goyer, is undoubtedly the fact that, for the first time in a long while, Superman seems as grounded, emotionally intense, and dare I say 'cool' as the Dark Knight!The story is one which everyone is familiar with, yet the details have changed a bit, and its those little changed details which have imparted 'Man of Steel' with greater depth than the previous live-action adaptations of the character. From Krypton, to the Kents, to Clark's developing powers, to his emergence as Superman, his first meeting with Lois Lane; we see all the familiar beats of an often told story, and yet THIS time round, we're far more emotionally involved in this tale than we ever were before. Jor-El and Lara, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Lois, Perry et. all are no longer just supporting characters playing their part in the myth and bowing out from the stage-they truly are full- fledged characters whose actions and fates we are as investing in as we are those of Superman's.Speaking of the titular Man of Steel, special credit is due to the lead actor Henry Cavill for his very relatable portrayal of a character many have complained is completely unrelatable. In stark contrast to Reeves' somewhat one-dimensional, corny, paragon of selfless heroism, Cavill's Clark Kent is a far more conflicted character, demonstrating a few grey areas that will not fail to shock audiences. This is most vehemently NOT a Superman who spends his days saving kittens from trees.Amy Adams does a great job as Lois Lane, making her more than just a damsel-in-distress or a standard movie love interest. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both stand out as Superman's kryptonian and human fathers respectively. And Michael Shannon truly steals the show as the violent, genocidal, yet oddly sympathetic General Zod.On the whole, 'Man of Steel' succeeds not only at reinventing a seemingly antiquated hero for the 21st century, but also as the pivotal film that sets the stage for a further realization of the DC Universe on the big screen...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I liked it but I just don't like that the fact it is too long...2 hrs and 24 minutes...and when i watched it for the second time, i kinda felt asleep for a bit loll. Zack Snyder did a good job but most didn't like the movie. Iron Man 3 was better for some of my classmates...and the fact I was the only DC fan and a comic book fan in my batch. So excited for the sequel...oh wait....They added Wonder Woman and Batman was the planned add on and Flash was also rumored so is it still a MOS sequel in 2015? I liked Superman's suit BTW. MOS is much better than superman returns and I don't know why singer screw that. No offense. But Singer is doing well in writing the X-Men movies but why did he screw up in superman?

But as the movie progresses, you realize that the story is no longer predictable. The visuals in the movie are amazing and the scenes in Krypton are brilliantly shot. Clark Kent's journey as an alien on earth are sequenced well and the viewer can pretty much connect with it. There is a good continuity in the story and it has been written very well. The action sequences are a bit lame and can be a bit of a drab with the 3D. Despite that, the plot deviating from the commonplace Superman movie makes it stand out. The way that the alien turns down his own people to fight for humans is shown in a fascinating manner. Henry Cavell and Amy Adams have done their roles well. Hans Zimmerman, I needn't mention at all. And to top it off, Nolan has a part to play in it. One can't ask for a better superhero movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Or at best, a 'B' movie.With a budget of $225m you have to think that $200m of that was spent on the CGI leaving $25m to write, direct, edit, and act out a ""movie"".Respect to Ben Affleck who turned down directing the film: ""A lesson I've learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they'll spend on effects or where they will shoot. Story is what's important.""There are things to like in this for sure, assuming you're a Superman fanboy and/or 12 years old that is but in terms of the standards (barely kept these days ...) of writing, acting, directing and editing (was there any???) required to make a real movie it's actually quite embarrassing to watch, incohesive and, frankly, boring for long periods - how many fight scenes between indestructible characters can you have in one movie for God's sake??!!It's also somewhat stupefying to believe that it actually made it to the big screen - 20 years ago this would most definitely have been a ""straight to video"" release and it ranks up there with recent gobsmackingly poor efforts such as The Great Gatsby and Trance.While I can understand the cast of TV actors wanting a part in this to get themselves onto the big screen alongside the likes of (the *incredibly* overrated) Russell Crowe, you do have to wonder just how much benefit their careers will get from being involved in such a poorly executed project - for sure they'll have made a few quid but none of these guys are short of cash anyway I wouldn't have thought!Whilst Henry Cavill can be forgiven for taking the opportunity to land a ""big lead"", I'm staggered that someone of the calibre of Richard Schiff would get involved in something like this - was there even a script ahead of signing these people up??!! Oh and don't even get me started on I'm-so-fat-I-can't-even-run-anymore Fishburne lolWhile I've been delighted to see the standards of TV dramas rocket in the past decade or so, almost to the point of good movie making standards, this type of travesty is a clear indication that there are clear limits to what can be achieved when attempting to merge the two formats.This felt like an attempt to cram a season or two of a typical TV series into a (impossible to justify given the ""content"") 2 and a half hour movie.What's quite telling is that in the effort to use TV standards to make a movie, this has actually not only fallen way short of being a viable movie but it also pales next to the plethora of quality TV dramas we've been treated to recently.On that basis, I can only hope that this attempt to merge the two formats (ala games and movies anyone??) will quickly die away and we can continue with, the very occasional, great modern movie and more terrific TV dramas but on this evidence, never the twain shall meet!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The competition is not very fierce, as I don't have a deep love for the Christopher Reeve films.The introduction to the Clark's character is simple yet complex. The beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. From the bus crash to the tornado, every cut scene had a purpose and was on point. These moments created an emotional depth to the character and helped make Superman human (something the other films struggled with).The casting is superb with Henry Cavill perfectly fitting the part of Clark/Superman. Amy Adams is also excellent in her role, as is the majority of the cast. While the first two acts of Man of Steel are first-rate in character development, the third act completely falls apart. The high level of destruction and the endless flying fight scenes are unnecessary and detract from the story.Superman's human moments are by far the best parts of this film. While I understand that big, bold action sequences are ""essential"" in this genre, they could have been toned down a bit (i.e., Winter Soldier). I love pieces of this movie, and when I look back on Man of Steel, that's what I focus on.Best Character: Clark
Best Scene: First Flight
Best Quote: ""The world is too big, Mom."" - Clark. ""Then make it small."" - Martha.Best Piece of Score: ""Flight""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I wouldn't recommend it. The back-story part of the movie is long and you feel it. Then the violence is harsher than what you'd expect, too.As an adult, I thought the movie was great, on paper. The acting and casting was done well. The actors play with heart and humor like you'd expect (or maybe even more.) Zod & company take you right back to how they ""felt"" the last time around, but with an update.You can tell a Batman writer had a hand in writing the screenplay. All- in-all more techno-based than you'd expect. Aside from not being able to enjoy this with my family, the script was a disappointment. It seemed like it went out of its way just to be different for difference's sake.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I've been a fan of superman since the late great Christopher Reeves soared through the skies in the late 70s. It didn't have all the spectacular movie effects, such as 3D, green screen, and CGI, but the cinematography was great and it worked for the audience at that time. And that's what I enjoyed about this rebooted Superman. The director and his team of producers made a movie that captured the audience's attention (Action!). Yes we all know the story behind Superman, but I liked that they dug a little deeper into Superman's Kyrptonian past. Gave it a rough edge and more darker look into the once great but foolish Alien race. Yea the critics cried...what did they expect? Superman from the 50s era?! Hello?? This a remake...a reboot...something new and perhaps different?!! I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I for one will say Man of Steel was Superb!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I liked Superman Returns, but most people didn't because there wasn't enough action, or Lex Luthor wasn't a fighting villain. That's not a problem here. About the first hour or so is all biographical, unlike Returns which kind of took place after Superman II. If you don't know Superman's origin story, this will suffice, though Marlon Brando's Krypton was prettier. Bottom line it sets the groundwork for Kal-El's journey, not to mention General Zod's. Only flashbacks allude to Clark's younger years, making the story feel less like a coming of age story. The second half however is almost all action, from huge world-saving extravagance all the way to super-powered fist fights. The very final action sequence reminded me of an episode of Justice League or Superman: The Animated Series, which aren't bound by the limits of what can be put in front of a camera and see battles that cross the entire planet earth and sometimes beyond. No live-action film in the superhero genre has captured the feel of such a battle in this way, and I couldn't help but tear up as it started to take place. Man of Steel won't make anyone forget about Christopher Reeve's performance or the story he was a part of, but this isn't about that. This is a visually stunning modern telling of the greatest comic book superhero of all time.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Superman Returns came in which was not bad to start with, but during this modern age where audience sees and expects far more advancements (Be it imagination, technological,visually -awe inspiring). Man of steel delivers a punch on these aspects! Its visual effects on 3D is awe-inspiring, breathtaking action and most vital, it has followed the roots of this marvel. Script has been given a lot of thought to it, the storyline is perfect! It builds on us and sets up for a clash of Bad Vs Good from 2nd half onwards with unimaginable action sequences.The story grips us, has a psychological edge to it and deserves to be accoladed. I saw it the first time, and I had to hold onto my seat as it was a roller-coaster ride. I had to see it again which I did, and I should say it was all our money's worth. A modern day Superhero proclaimed by Zach, and he has not disappointed in anyway. Both the good and the bad come from the same planet, and they just thrash each other around the Metropolis, but wouldn't want to kill each other due to the scarcity of their race. It all comes to the last plot where Superman has to take a decision to save the goodness of the people of earth but as well- sacrificing one of his own.Henry Cavill was a perfect fit, and so was Amy Adams. Perry White was fantastic for the role he was given, though short! All in all, the cast was sewed to perfection for each role. I can't wait to watch this spectacle over and over again.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

From the ages where we have heard the quote 'It's A Bird ... It's A Plane ...It's Superman', to the new avatar of our iconic hero. DC Comics brings back one of the biggest comic heroes with a BANG! Directed by none other than Zack Snyder - the one who directed '300' - and Produced by the maker of movies like Memento, Inception and Batman Trilogy - Christopher Nolan, you surely wouldn't want to miss this at all. Trust me.The movie starts off on Krypton, the planet far away from Earth. And the first half hour just gives you the feel of '300'. The dark and hazy atmosphere of Krypton surrounds you completely. Hans Zimmer's musical magic strikes the chord from the start. Russel Crowe as Jor-El, father of our hero portrays the role strongly. He gets his piece of action.The movie starts taking shape when our hero is discovered by the Kent family on Earth. And then his life's journey begins. The discovery of his identity on Earth, of his people and more importantly... his family. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) wouldn't have portrayed the role any better than this. And when he suits up with an 'S' and the red cape, you know he is The Superman. What an amazing suit!!The bad guy, General Zod, portrayed by Michael Shannon, isn't promising enough. Lois Lane, as the damsel in distress, is easily pushed backstage while our mighty hero is on the stage blowing punches on the bad guys.The first half of the movie has some action and some drama. But the second half is completely stuffed with action. And by action, I mean, totally destructive action. I haven't seen so much destruction in any movie as much as I have seen in this one. One of the best quality in this movie is that the action scenes are choreographed excellently. The fight scenes are so very well executed that you'll even enjoy Superman getting beaten by the bad guys. There are more punches than kicks. The cinematography is excellent. The camera work is steady. You can see Superman flying everywhere through his point of view.The screenplay is really good. Specially when Superman is on screen. The one scene that really made my heart beat faster and left me on the edge of the seat was when he pushes himself against the gravity with full force. The power and the energy are shown perfectly on his face. Henry Cavill has taken this hero to the next level.When you see him thrown into a debris of fallen building, and he comes out without a scratch, you know he is Superman, When you see him punched and banged hard on the ground, and he gives a punch back, you know he is Superman, When you see him kicking ass mid-air, and when he lands smoothly with the girl in his arms, you know he is Superman.The only missing piece is the humor. But, you wouldn't miss it when you have all the action to look forward to. I wouldn't listen to any critic's reviews or depend on their views. As a viewer, I loved it and enjoyed the action thoroughly. A must-watch for all the action fans. Its Superrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am Speechless!!! To say the least. Especially post interval.The magnitude and sheer brilliance of the director's imagination in the action scenes deserves an 'open mouth expression' on our faces in the theater. I did it and I am sure anyone who is a special effects freak would do that. I saw what I wanted to see ever since I was swept off the floor when I saw the first trailer. My expectation which was built after each succeeding trailer was met with more than what I had imagined.The word limit over here has limited my expression of feelings running down my mind and heart.Last but not the least...

However, as the film progressed, I found myself losing interest in the characters and story.In my opinion, the films biggest problem is how it uses its lengthy run time. The film has so much time to develop characters and their relationships, but it completely fails. Clark has nearly no character arc in the film, and his relationship with Lois is so rushed, I recall them only being in 3 scenes with minimal dialogue before they were suddenly in love, and it doesn't help that Cavill and Adams have barely any on screen chemistry. I liked Clarks relationship with his mother though, I thought that was mostly well handled, and the actors worked well together.I could overlook the problem of underdeveloped characters if the film was mostly focused on action sequences, but it's not. And perhaps it would be more forgivable if the action sequences were thrilling and memorable, but their not. We get one relatively enjoyable fight scene towards the end and scenes of a city being destroyed. It's just not good enough to compensate for the films lack of character development. This brings me back to the point of how it uses its runtime. We have around 30 minutes of action sequences and around 2 hours of characters talking but never forming relationships, building a little bit of tension for the finale and just the generally telling the story. What I'm trying to say is that the amount of story, action and character progression in this film does not warrant a 2 and a half hour running time.I thought that the acting was really nothing special at all, Henry Cavill is given next to nothing to work with, so he never really gets a chance to really own his character. Amy Adams & Michael Shannon aren't even that good here, Michael Shannon does an OK job, but he overacts a lot. Amy Adams never brings her usual charm to her character. Russel Crowe does a solid job, definitely the highlight in terms of acting. The story never goes anywhere interesting either, it's just the basic dealing with the responsibilities of being a superhero, but there's a villain on your back story that we all know. The villain isn't even interesting, he's motives are believable but overall hes just a very angry man.The film obviously shines in the special effects and sound design aspect, I don't think there's any denying that, it just looks amazing throughout. In my opinion, Man of Steel is just another summer blockbuster with some OK action sequences and a forgettable story. It fails to distinguish itself from other superhero films, and I wouldn't be so disappointed with this if it wasn't such an iconic superhero we have at hand. I'd like too say that Man of Steel is a fantastic movie, but it just feels like an average at best popcorn flick with Supermans name attached too it.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Also as a kid, I watched the black and white Superman TV show with George Reeves. Later, I enjoyed Lois & Clark on TV. The Christopher Reeves Superman was enjoyable too. A year or so ago, I watched the whole 10 seasons of Smallville on DVD or BluRay. I liked it well enough to watch them all again immediately after. I guess that gives me a bit of Superman knowledge, so I was able to catch a few clues during Man of Steel that some people may have missed. For example, I saw a semi-truck with Lexcorp on the side get toppled during the destruction scenes. There was no mention of Lex Luther at all in this movie. But maybe a sequel?There was also no kryptonite in this movie. I expected there would be since there always is--wherever Superman is. That surprised me, pleasantly. We didn't need any kryptonite in this movie though. There were several evil Kryptonians who had the same powers Clark Kent had on earth. That worried me a bit since it would seem he was way outnumbered. However, it turned out in this story, the Kryptonians need time to adjust to Earth's atmosphere. Clark had been here 33 years and already adjusted, so that gave him an edge.I am guessing that some of the writers for this script may have worked on Smallville because there were many similar incidents that I had seen in the Smallville episodes, but in this movie, they had been improved upon.I was pleased that Russell Crowe had a bigger part than I expected. I love him as an actor. I think Henry Cavill really did a great job in the role of Clark/Superman. Even Amy Adams was good as Lois Lane even though I wouldn't have thought of her for the part.A lot of the storyline I knew from the comic books was changed (for the better in my opinion).My only complaint about this movie is that the fighting and destruction went on way too long. There comes a time when it is just tedious to sit through it. Even 5 minutes less would have been better.I saw this in 3D and I don't think the 3D improved it at all. If anything, all the action made my eyes tired watching in 3D. I plan on watching this again in 2D when it is out on BluRay.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I think the fans should have anticipated the bad reviews. His style is actually what critics hate. The over the top action and CGI is actually his trademark. So, even from the beginning, I think this is actually the kind of movie the producers wanted. About the lack of romance, I really do think it's saved for the sequel. The sequel will definitely explore more about the relationship between Clark and Lois. This film focused on 2 aspects: the origin (krypon,struggle finding his place) & the action (Zod and his army). Don't expect humor or romance.The visuals were spectacular! What's best about this movie is its action scenes. The action were just relentless. I think the fans would not be disappointed at all. Yes, I know there is only a very few humor this movie but that actually doesn't even matter. The battle between Superman & Zod will definitely 'wow' everyone but the critics. I mean who cares about the critics opinion? A superhero movie MUST NOT be judged by the critics opinion, what's more important is the audience's opinion about the movie and especially the fans'. I think the movie really delivered. Most people will definitely like this movie. I am really sure that many fanboys will consider this as the best comic book of all time.

But this is certainly not a Superman movie. It's dark, broody and violent. The cinematography is very gray, the tone is depressing and some of the acting is laughable.
I'm going to start by saying I loved Superman II, and I liked Terrence Stamp as Zod. He was a leader and never needed to worry about proving himself through violence. Plus, he invented the iconic line ""Kneel before Zod!""Michael Shannon is not that. He speaks with a laughable slur and isn't developed well character wise. He simply is a villain because he's selfish, not like the original Zod who believed that he could change the world by ruling.Clark never has his iconic phone booth transformation, because he spends most of his time as an alien who is somewhat known by man. Zack Snyder clearly does not care for the characters he's working with, and only cares if a building gets knocked over, or if a neck gets snapped.My other criticism is Amy Adams. I don't hate Ms. Adams, but she made me hate Lois Lane. The attraction between her and Superman is sudden and out of place. She just is there to troll the audience. I really think they need to fire or recast her.I really don't think we can like a Superman movie that makes fun of Superman's superhero name in an unfunny scene where army people almost laugh when the name ""Superman"" is mentioned. Or when a horny army girl remarks to her superior ""I think he's kinda hot."" It's not funny, it's just cringeworthy and it doesn't belong. I don't blame Cavill though, he deserves better and Zack Snyder should not be allowed to direct another superhero movie after the DCEU.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not a big Superman fan, so I felt very indifferent when I was dragged to the theatre to see this movie the other day. My feelings did not change throughout, and I left the theatre eventually forgetting what I saw.I will not bother with explaining the plot here, as I don't usually do, but for good reason this time. Basically, it is a remake of the classic Superman movie from the 70's, but without any of the ridiculous fun it had. It replaces Lex Luthor with General Zod, which is a refreshing change of pace from a villain who does what he does simply for power. And, although artistic liberties were taken (according to my sister, who is more of a DC fan than I am), the origin story was interesting in a sense. Too bad it was one we've seen so many times in the past few years.I felt the characters were heavily wooden in this instalment. It's not the actors' fault, however; they're just doing their jobs. The writer, on the other hand, needs to be reminded of the definition of an underwritten character. For example, I like Amy Adams, for one; but, when it comes to playing the part of Lois Lane, who is known as the standard 'damsel in distress' in most of this franchise, she isn't given much, if any, significance in the role. The role of Superman isn't much better either; he is much too perfect, without any flaws or hindrances in his character that can apply to the story (no, there isn't even an appearance of Kryptonite, which could be considered a missed opportunity).I also feel sorry for anyone that had to see this in 3-D (unlike myself), because the ultimately fast-moving and jiggling shots come at a high count. A reminder to Hollywood: people do not shake up and down like mad when running forward, or even sitting in a bus. It's very distracting.So, if I were to come up with one word to summarize my overall feelings of this film, it would be 'uninspired'. It's not bad, but it's also not great; it's ultimately forgettable. It falls victim to many Hollywood clichés in several instances, and I only recommend this to hardcore Superman fans. The rest of you will probably forget what you saw within about half an hour after seeing it (like I did).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Perhaps they have hastened what seems to be a an inevitable self-fulfilling prophecy. Actors are becoming less relevant.What many consider to be the most engaging scenes in the Man of Steel, typically don't use actors for anything more than props. Perhaps the opening credits should feature the names of the talented digital artists working alongside teams of software developers who create the bulk of the film's content. I imagine the most difficult part is incorporating living, breathing actors into the mix.I felt that Man of Steel should've come with a controller, or, at least, a tactile keyboard. The actual live action filmed scenes in the latest Superman origins story were not much different than expository cutscenes in tier one video games.Henry Cavill looked like a proper Superman, Amy Adams served as an effective Lois Lane. Costner, Crowe, Lane, Fishburne - they all did well to fill in the gaps between the indulgent abundance of raw computer processing power made available to the stars of the film: the artists who juggled trillions of ones and zeroes to create immersive digital effects. That is what The Man of Steel and other superhero movies have become - and, for no good reason. Sadly, no matter how quite impeccably designed and detailed the effects are, there still exists that numbing uncanny valley effect that never can quite manage to suspend disbelief. I'm reminded of the self-described desktop publishers and graphic designers of the 1990s who created documents with dozens of typefaces - because they could.The best special effects are those that don't call attention to themselves. After years of destroying larger and larger swaths of simulated real estate (including planets) to outdo that which has come before, I note how such little thought is given to how humanity would legitimately react should these near world-ending calamities ever occur.I wasn't sure how I felt about the strike until I watched, ""The Man of Steel."" Sure. I support not just the stars and writers whose names I recognize; it's the truly gifted original storytellers that challenge actors to push the limits of their craft who I consider the best of the best.GAME OVER.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It really deserved 7/10 stars, maybe 8/10, but still the best Superman film to-date, thanks largely to leaps in CGI and advances in film making tech.This is not Donner's ""phone-booth"" Superman about the lovable and clumsy Clark Kent who becomes Superman to save a cat trapped in a tree b/c little Cindy was sitting on the corner crying... and thank god for it!This is about the alien Kal-El who becomes Superman on Earth. This is true to the comics and, as a big fan of Superman comics (post-WWII), I absolutely loved it!Awesome action sequences, ground-breaking CG battles where transitions btwn CG and live action seem virtually seamless. Thanks to Nolan's crew, the story is great, the musical score is epic and leave it to Snyder to bring the comics to life.There is a big gap btwn user-reviews and critic-reviews. This is b/c the critics were expecting a totally different Superman and were generally disappointed when they didn't get enough of Clark Kent and Lois Lane. The users, on the other hand, were pleasantly surprised that we finally got the bad-ass superman that we've been asking for. Awesome movie, plan on watching it a few more times in theatres.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The science fiction was fresh, and although a bit bare on the emotional side of things, there was still plenty of heartwarming philosophy in this film.Never have we seen Superman like this; the way he is supposed to be depicted. Henry Cavil is no Christopher Reeve, at least not physically, but he's a pretty damn good actor when it comes to silent body language. This is a Superman who is easy to relate to, even though he seems to impervious to pain and suffering. He just cares. And doesn't use his power for personal aggrandizement...which is something that so few people do in the real world today...a world where absolute power corrupts.Russel Crowe stole the show however, his lines were said in the tone of a great leader, and he bore the carriage of a king. The acting was fantastic throughout, from Lane, to Costner and even Fishbourne.Now when you compare a film like this to lets say...The Hulk...or Captain America, or even the Avengers, one might find that Man of Steel has more substance, more heart, more intelligence for that matter. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that this film even helped change my religion in a sense...even though I was aware of ancient astronaut theory already. Now, for me, this is a powerful film but an esoteric film, and those without a specialized knowledge into the occult and ancient astronaut theory might not appreciate this one as much. 10 out of 10 despite its flaws. My one problem with the film is that the character development went no where in the end, and Superman never was threatened, even though the Earth was. Perhaps they should've had Superman sweat a bit, or even bleed. Nothing thrown in his way seemed to hurt him at all, and that took the urgency out of the situation, at least when it came to his peril, not the Earth's. A little more character driven stuff and less action and this film would've been a masterpiece. I still love this movie to death and it is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite superhero film ever!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It has nothing new to offer.Its all formula now for Nolan and co.and they are measuring it right from the screenplay,the E.Q,IQ and the time linear form. and not to forget the marketing strategy to the final output.I am not surprised if people gave it some 8 or 9.Its the course of the world now. My personal opinion-please don't waste your money on it,instead do better things with it or best wait for the video rental.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The characters fell flat and they lacked chemistry which made all of the interactions feel empty. None of the scenes actually moved me and the second half of the movie was a fight scene. I understand that this movie was supposed to have a more ""dark"" ring to it but I personally thought it lacked depth. At the same time the movie had a lot of plot holes which made the movie feel stupid. It was hard to apply logic to some events which made it hard to take serious. Personally I thought they could have made this movie a lot better but that's just my opnion. The only feelings I felt was boredom and annoyance during this film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The villain Michael Shannon did a really good job he brought true anger into character though I expected General Zod to die by being thrown into a black hole or a supernova star or may be into the world engine but no it was a jiu jitsu move that did the trick, I also sensed a small argument in there between evolution and creationism which was interesting, but my favourite dialogue in the whole movie was between Colonel Nathan Hardy and Faora-Ul when the Colonel tells the alien he (did not care what she was going to tell to her boss General Zod about not taking the girl Lois Lane also with superman that was not the deal the deal was just superman to surrender) hahaha showing the good also fashion American military mentality of fighting anyone who opposes freedom. Just Perfect. I truly hope they donated some of their billion dollars profit to charity.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Luckily though people seemed to like it so I jumped back up on the hype wagon and I finally watched the film.....loved it! I am a huge fan of anything that has to do with superheroes, whether it be DC or Marvel. Everything about this movie is great! From the deep and emotional story right down to the super special effects. Zack Snyder did a fantastic job. One thing that stood out the most for me was the acting. Cavill did an amazing job as Cal-El/Clark/Superman(that's what they're calling him). Costner and Crowe were also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an apatite for some action, and trust me there is no shortage of action in this one. Go see it!

It is a reboot of Superman through the eyes of Zack Snyder, taking him into the modern times where wearing red underwear on top is frowned upon. I am a huge fan of Snyder after he perfectly brought one of my favorite graphic novels, Watchmen, to life in perfect clarity. So does he deliver? I would say YES The movie is a big hitter with all manner of high production values, great actors you would expect from a AAA blockbuster.Despite similar circumstances, the movie showed clear contrast from Marvel's 'All flash, zero substance' with DC Comics﻿'s focus on storytelling, bond between the characters while keeping the action on the background. All which makes you connect and care for the action on screen instead of just letting it all blast past your eyes.My rating for Man of Steel: 8.5/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I did like some of the references that they placed in (like the brief showing of a Lexcorp truck) as well as the prologue of Krypton, who's society and culture remained a mystery up until now. Also there were a few adjustments to the original Superman films that I did like, one of which was fixing his costume which was just plain ridiculous. What I didn't like is how little plot there was. Pretty much the whole movie was fighting, which is good if the movie is short like Taken, but for a movie about two hours long, it's not the best. It also could have been better if they featured a villain that was introduced in the comics but not the second movie, Superman II, but seeing as they wanted to make this more realistic, I can see why they picked General Zod. Overall though, the movie was a disappointment, and I feel they could've done better.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Man of Steel- A brilliant movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816340/?ref_=tt_urv","daylfc13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33305293/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2013","This is a quick review on my thoughts and feelings about the new Superman film-Man Of Steel. Firstly, i would just like to credit the amazing work by Zack Snyder(director) and Christopher Nolan (producer)- those two really set tone, from the offset, what can only be a success. I hate to dig into or complain, but we all know that the previous Superman films were a bit of a shambles, we all knew it, we all were beyond it. When i heard about a new Superman film i thought, not again, another one, but then they got some backing, some force with cast and production alike and it tuned the new film finely into becoming something more than what it was intended(quote from the film, had to throw it in there). Escaping from all that, we see Superman in his element, from where he began to the hero he becomes, from a baby to a man, and a super one at that, but i think the most intense moments were when he was just a boy, the introduction starts off when he was just conceived on planet Krypton. This introduction for me personally was by far my favourite part of the movie, it shows the beginning of how it began almost perfectly, and this is what starts of a truly spectacular performance from the beginning. The Villain in this film was a Krypton born man called General Zod, he was to see the beginning of a new Kyrpton, after its collapse on of course where else, but the planet earth. This all sounds very cliché, i know i know, because well it is, but from time to time, you can allow it. Amir Mokri the director of photography for this film, really pulled out all the stocks with this one, and made everything work perfectly and capture everything needed. The scenes are truly epic and Krypton is a set perfectly, it helps by having the backing of Syncopy and Legendary studios of course. Henry Cavill (Superman), Amy Adams (Lois Lane) and Russell Crowe (Supermans father Jor-El ) were all superb in this movie, casting Henry was certainly a risk, but a well worth risk and worked very well i feel, Amy Adams as always was magnificent and i can't speak more highly of Russell Crowe's contribution to this film, he did a lot more than was expected and really set tune to the how great this movie really was .Of course with a superhero like Superman and with his traits it's near impossible to not have a few moments where you think ""wait..what"", but there is just no way around this i feel, so even with some outrageous moments, the action filled epic scenes fade them out. Furthermore, their were a few moments in the film were things were laughable when they were supposed to be serious, but hey with what film as action packed as they do you not do that. Overall , this film made it for me, i loved it, it looked and sounded brilliant so credit to the people behind that, and everything within it made this really the first Superman film i really got myself in to and believed in. With this installment of the franchise i believe that more will come and with bigger and better scenes, hopefully again with the backing of Zack and Christopher.I give this film a solid 9/10, which is brave , but totally deserving.

Tough to figure? I agree.Essentially while there is a lot to like about the story, the direction, Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner et al, there is still a lot missing, Too many scenes that are never established, too many careless shots inserted haphazardly amongst the beauty the adorns the rest of the piece, too many jerky and off-kilter lines in the script that take you out of yourself and make you realise that you're just watching a movie and nothing more.I still hold BATMAN BEGINS up as the greatest super-hero film to date, but MAN OF STEEL felt like the best bits of WATCHMEN, mixed with the worst bits of DARK KNIGHT RISES.Overall, it's not a convincing narrative, nor a very carefully constructed movie and yet, it does have some rough edged beauty to it.So much to like, yet so much room for improvement.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Fast-paced with lots of action and momentary pauses to catch your breath at dramatic scenes invoking emotion. Great watch for any one who enjoys a movie, brilliant to super hero fans and will be orgasmic for fans of the Superman series.

Henry Cavill/Christopher Nolan/Zack Snyder to an absolutely amazing job to bring the 'Superman' story to the 21st Century.The use of Camera shots and the skilled score by Hans Zimmer lifted this movie to a whole new level. We are watching the future of movie making/story telling.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Turning my least favorite hero into one that I can't get enough of.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2858666/?ref_=tt_urv","slicedbread117","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26777495/?ref_=tt_urv","26 August 2013","I'll be honest, I used to hate Superman. Despite being possibly the most influential fictional character in American history, his ever-growing and nearly god-like abilities, crappy past movies, and his awful secret identity just didn't strike a chord with me as much as someone like Batman, Spider-Man or Iron Man. And also to be honest, the main reason why I was getting excited for this movie was because I saw Christopher Nolan's (director of my favorite trilogy ever created)name pop up in the trailers. I work at my local movie theater, so after seeing this movie twice (2D and 3D), I'm happy to say that my perspective on the Man of Steel has changed dramatically.*WARNING THERE ARE FEW,BUT MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*In any movie, it has to spark your interest almost immediately. Right from the start, Man of Steel immerses you in a plethora of some of the greatest CG effects I've ever seen in a movie. The world of Krypton needed to feel real and alive in order to provide a sense of loss and hope, and the special effects created a beautiful and jaw-dropping fictional world. I was very pleased on how the movie spent a good deal of time on Krypton, giving the movie a much needed solid back story for the title character and his home world.Following the beginning scenes on Krypton, the movie spends a great deal of time providing us with Clark Kent's current endeavors as well as his childhood memories via flashbacks. I enjoyed going back and seeing how Clark struggled with his humanity, what with basically being a god, and how his struggles affect him in the current time. Clark Kent/Superman, played by Henry Cavill, is a deeply developed character and fits the role of Superman very well, something that was desperately needed.As the movie progresses, we eventually meet Lois Lane, Superman's iconic love interest. Played by the lovely Amy Adams, Lois is at first a reporter looking for a good story, but becomes much more important. The more romantic scenes in the movie are needed to develop a strong relationship between Clark and Lois, and thankfully don't ever bring the film to a screeching halt.Like with all of my reviews, I love talking about the villain because I love a good villain, and the villain makes the hero who he/she really is, and in this movie's case more than most. General Zod, portrayed by Michael Shannon, is an absolutely stellar antagonist, providing the viewers with a deadly and desperate villain who's power matches that of Superman, something you don't see every day. He will do anything to save his people and will go through anyone to get through Superman, creating a truly epic villain. As the final battle scenes arrive, I was treated to some of the most action-packed and thrilling action sequences I've seen in a superhero movie to date. General Zod and his henchmen proved to be capable of massive destruction and make even Superman look like he is helpless. Once again, the CGI was in full swing during these fight scenes to amplify the action even more. Eventually, we get to our final showdown between Superman and Zod. This final battle is a spectacular one, showing off how powerful these characters really are. (SPOILERS NOW) Superman eventually gets Zod into a head lock and Zod unleashes his heat vision on an innocent family scrambling for their lives, nowhere to go. Zod gives Superman a choice: let the innocent people die to prevent killing Zod, or end him in order to save the family and stop Zod from causing any more damage. He chooses to kill Zod, by breaking his neck. Now at this point of the film, hardcore Superman fans are in a monsoon of rage that their perfect hero actually killed someone. For me I viewed it in two ways, one good one bad. The good reason is that as a not so hardcore Superman fan, the scene was extremely intense and pulled an enormous emotional weight behind it. After Zod is killed, Superman lets loose a tremendous scream of emotion to signify his actions. It was that choice that he had to make, and as a viewer, it was a powerful moment. Now the bad. What made The Dark Knight trilogy so phenomenal was that Batman would not kill, no matter what. Even the Joker could't get him to kill. And that defined Batman, solidifying it throughout the series. With Superman, his no killing rule could have defined him as it did for Batman, but instead they gave him a new identity. All in all however, I was a big fan of the scene and liked it more than not.So, how to conclude. Man of Steel is amazing. Director Zack Snyder decided to take the hero-humanizing, Dark Knight approach that worked for Nolan and Batman, and it fits very well here. The special effects are stunning to say the least, the action was epic, the acting was spot on throughout the entire cast, the story (which I didn't even really get into) was a great one for an origin story, and it was overall just a very well put together 143 minutes of superhero entertainment. Man of Steel puts Superman back on the movie map, and if the upcoming Batman vs Superman and Justice League movies are anything like this, The Avengers might not be the only heroes dominating anymore. Bravo DC and Warner Bros.9/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A surprisingly mature approach from Snyder","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2896679/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","30 October 2013","Dumping the light tone of the original Richard Donner Superman films (1978/1980) and their ridiculous sequels, as well as Bryan Singer's failed reboot, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel adopts the Christopher Nolan approach. With Nolan as producer and co-writer, this is Clark Kent seen through the eyes of a steely, saturated lens, with Henry Cavill's somewhat stoic and monotone Superman battling inner demons as well as General Zod (Michael Shannon). It's a typically long, convoluted modern blockbuster, but Man of Steel prevails thanks to some surprisingly dedicated focus by Snyder, who abandons the slo-then-fast-mo stylings of 300 (2006) and Sucker Punch (2011) for something much more grown-up.The movie begins on Krypton, where Jar-El (Russell Crowe), delighted with the planet's first natural birth in centuries in his son Kal-El, pleads with the leaders to help save the planet from inevitable destruction. Enter the usurping Zod, who is leading a coup to overthrow the leaders and re-establish Krypton as a real power. Zod is furious at the birth of Kal-El aka Clark Kent, but Jar-El manages to blast his son off into space towards Earth before Zod overpowers him. Cut forward some years and Kent is working on a fishing vessel, at ease with his powers. When the military discover an alien craft in the Arctic, Kent infiltrates the mission and discovers his origins from the preserved conscience of his father. Meanwhile, Zod is approaching Earth with plans to use the planet to re-create Krypton.It's clear from the off that this is no regular superhero origin film. Snyder manages to somehow bring a grounded realism to Krypton - giant human-carrying dragonflies and all. We then skip Kent's entire upbringing to witness his natural inclinations for good as he saves some oil rig workers from certain death, displaying the powers he is now at ease with. Through some beautifully realised and melancholy flashback scenes that evoke the style of Terence Malick, Kent's parents (played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), gradually teach him that he is different and has a much greater purpose than he could imagine. Costner is superb in these moments, bringing an old-hand, gravel-voiced weight that I have never seen from him before. Similar to Snyder's Watchmen (2009), these flashbacks are peppered throughout the film, yet don't damage the flow of the central story.Where the film fails is in the action-heavy climax that lasts for pretty much the entire final hour. Zod and his cronies battle Superman and smash each other to a pulp. It's very similar to the climax of Thor (2011), that also had impossibly strong super-beings battle ten tons of s**t out of each other because, well, what else can they do? Buildings collapse, explosions litter the screen, but there's very little tension. It switches the action between Superman and the Daily Planet, where Laurence Fishburne's Perry White serves no purpose other than to save some people from falling rubble. Perhaps it's setting the scene for future instalments, but they seem rather intrusive here.The same could also be said about Amy Adams' Lois Lane, who is a spunky, determined character diminished to a simple love interest for Kent without any real chemistry. Of course she's important to the Superman universe, but there is no real dimension to her persona. Michael Shannon, however, is reliably excellent in his role, and his Zod incarnation is by far the most interesting thing about the film. He's a sympathetic bad guy akin to Tom Hiddleston's Loki, to the point where you can fully understand his reasoning. The man plans on genocide, but this was the role he was raised to play, and his determination to re- establish his race is certainly understandable. You can even see that Superman knows this, but he always knows that he must destroy him, whatever the odds.Overall I was extremely impressed by Man of Steel, and its flaws can certainly be forgiven. This is a mature movie with underlying themes. Superman is God, an indestructible force (to us mere humans) that possesses too much power to be at ease with, even when he assures them that they are on the same side. The religious metaphors are embarrassingly obvious at times, but it's a thought-provoking sub-theme and a nice alternative to the crash-bang-wallop of the action scenes. Although it's not up to the ridiculously high standards set by Christopher Nolan, this can sit nicely alongside his Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012) in the re-imaging of DC's universe.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Especially from the incredulous, and supercilious people of Rotten tomatoes. This is a movie wroth seeing. The cast are all excellent. Michael Shannon does a great job as the determined General Zod. He brought real depth to the character. You could really understand, and even sympathize his point of view. As for Henry Cavill, his performance as Superman is almost as perfect as Christopher Reeves version of Superman. There are scenes where you can really feel the internal struggle that Clark is obtaining from finding his place in the world. Cavill, also does a great job capturing Clark's kindness, and care for his fellow man.Zack Snyder did a very excellent job of directing his cast, and visually capturing the world of Superman. Although some scene seem to be shaken,and too much yelling, but other than that. Zack did a unbelievable-outstanding movie. I remember seeing the audience clapping at the end of the movie, only to find myself stunned by disbelief that Zack actually did it. He made a movie about Superman.The visually effects and music are enough to bring you to your feet. There was a man who sat next to me and said ""Wow."" When he saw Krypton, and so was I. I have never been visually ""wowed"" by special effects until this movie. Hans Zimmer music is perfect. It captures the rawness, and intensity of each action scene. It moves, and saddens you when disaster, sacrifice, or death is near. I can go on forever about why you need to see it.This is my first review on this website, due to the fact that I thought this movie deserved it. Watch this movie and judge it yourself. This ins't the greatest movie, or the greatest superhero movie, but it sure did get damn close to it. So damn close to being Perfect.Despite these so called ""critics,"" I beg you to see it for yourself.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can honestly say, that I was blown away with the film & can truly say that Mr Snyder has relieved all worries that I had anticipated. Most people will struggle to step away from the Christopher Reeve era, understandably. This film is completely different as it takes Kal-Els character from a completely different angle, ie he is vulnerable without Kryptonite having to be used. It makes you wonder if you were him, what route should you take- expose yourself for who you are, or hide away in fear of being cast a freak. The story is expectedly slow to start with in getting the main character to where we expect him to be, but once he gets there, boy does this film pack a punch (or 2) literally. The fighting scenes & flying etc are absolutely out of this world. The age difference between Cavill & Adams is not shown, mainly due to him looking a little older than what he is & Adams looking great for being that bit older. There is chemistry between them & a much different take on how their characters know one another from the Reeve era. I thought I may be a bit biased with my view as I am a Superman fan, but my 10 year old nephew described it as ""awesome"" & my 4 year old hugged me (unusually) & told me it was great! Without spoiling any of the film for those who have not seen it, the new Zod is nasty, but you can understand why to an extent, & he shows how far he is willing to go to protect his people, which is the making of Superman as he has to make huge decisions between Zod & Earth.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

So where Watchmen gave us a fairly true frame by frame representation of that graphic novel, this film takes ""Superman"" Canon and gives it some nice new flesh- In more ways than one.Russell Crowe's ""Jor-El"" was basically the same man we met in the Comic Books from the 60's, and his agenda is much the same as that Jor-El: He knew Krypton was going to be blown into chunks and he wanted to save something of his culture. Basically, in the 60's this culture was in the form of his son, ""Kal-El"" aka ""Clark Kent"" aka ""Superman"".But over the years in the comics and other movies, the idea that Jor-El may have put some kind of documentation about the planet Krypton in Kal's spacecraft has crept up into the Canon. In the original 1979 film and the later ""Superman Returns"" sequel, this was in the form of a crystal memory. In this film, it takes yet another form.What we have in this film is not a chronological re-telling of the Superman Origin story- What we get instead is a representation of who Kal-El really is, and how he got that way. Not merely his Super-Powers, but his reasons for using or not using them.So we don't see any of the iconic imagery of Clark Kent using a Phone Booth to change into his Blue Suit. Instead we delve into the real character of Superman and what makes him different from this General Zod guy.We've seen Superman treated as the comic book character he is through the old Serials and the George Reeves TV show, and in 1979 we believed he could fly due to Christopher Reeve's portrayal, but in those days Lex Luthor was a cardboard cutout of a crook and thorn in Supie's side. So over the years we have seen the maturation of the franchise. There are also decades of story that have elapsed since the original comics came out. So, how are we going to handle it this time? By making the characters much more believably human. Even in ""Superman Returns"" there was a trickle of more mature story mixed in with the basic Lex Luther comedy, but here the old Comic Book aspects have been spirited away. Does this mean that there is a darker story happening? Maybe. But if there is a more realistic story happening on a human level, that is what sets this film aside as a different approach.And this is seen in the short vignettes between Jonathan Kent and Clark, in the short pontifications of Jonathan (Played by Kevin Costner). Diane Lane becomes Martha Kent and is also part of Clark's conscience and consciousness. And where Lois Lane was simply a female in years past, she is now a trusted confidant played by Amy Adams, willing to keep Clark's secret.Other regular ""Superman 'Verse"" characters are shown, Pete Ross and Perry White and others, and their spirit if not their original appearances have been kept.It's just the idea of seeing ""Clark"" backing down from an aggressor who he could knock over with his Pinky - In other films, they actually had Superman beating up bullies. But here, the concept of the real damage that could be wreaked by a blow from Kal-El's fist is respected, and his Restraint becomes more pronounced.This film is almost wrecked by the resurrection of the ""Zod"" character who first appeared in the 80's Superman movies, but they gave him more dimensions and that made it less of the Monologuing bad guy and more of a nemesis, and the threat to the planet was just a wee bit more sinister than ""Superman II"" where these cronies simply wanted to take over the planet. Oh, they still want to take over the planet, but it's not the same thing as was proposed in ""Superman II.""It's not that I didn't love the Superman TV show when I was a kid, or the cartoons, or hundreds and hundreds of comic books, and the several movies of the 80's plus the ""Donner Cut"" of Superman II, which was partially used in Superman Returns, and I like this one as well...But NOBODY has ever made a Superman Movie where they showed Jor-el, Lara, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Lois Lane and Lana Lang. Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, The Bottle City of Kandor, The Fortress of Solitude with the huge golden key Supie would heft to open it, Bizarro World, Professor Potter, or even my favorite Supie Crooks The Parasite and The Composite Superman - Nobody has ever made a movie showing these people and things exactly how they looked in the comics, they always seem to re- image it all, which is sad, because in all four Spider-Man Moovies, they have kept the strict imagery of the Comics. And that has been the Only Franchise which kept to the original designs. Why can't they do it with Superman?Of course, Zod becomes something more in the 2nd entry into this universe, ""Batman v Superman""- but Superman's Doomsday was the result of clever manipulation of several arcs from the 90s-2000's comics. However, they kept the continuity from this film.Unfortunately, Zack Snyder was prevented from finishing this trilogy, and it was wrecked by Joss Whedon, who rediculous-ized the darker aspects of Zacks story.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It had everything you wanted in a superman movie. It starts off with a great understanding of what Krypton was like. You get to see what superman's parents were like. Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job playing Jor-El. We are introduced to General Zod played by Michael Shannon, who gives depth to a character, not just a typical villain. Zod is responsible for his soldiers, he will do whatever it takes to protect his people, and unlike most villains who do wrong just to spite their advisary or have a sick and twisted mind, Zod is a character who truly believes he is doing right by his people with his actions.New comer Henry Cavil did a great job as Superman and as Clark Kent. Director Zack Snyder made an epic action movie with well written drama by David Goyer. We got a chance to see a Zack Snyder movie that didn't involve slow motion fighting or naked guys. Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Costner reminded us what Jonathan Kent is all about. He is a down to earth American farmer who would risk his life for his neighbors. He made us feel sad but happy when he risked his own life to protect his son's secret. Martha Kent played by Diane Lane did a great job reminding us what it is like to care for the most important things in life, things can be replaced but the people in our lives can't. Zod's commander Faora really brought the punches in this movie. She was a character that was well trained and destroyed much of the town of Smallville while fighting Superman. She embraced the super-speed the most in the movie, which made it look much more action packed. Other actors such as Amy Adams and Laurence Fishburne brought great acting and drama to the movie to balance out all the non stop action.The last fight between Zod and Superman was one of the best parts of the movie. Zod had great and terrifying dialog which makes your spine chill. What made the ending great was, without spoiling too much, Superman needs to make a critical decision to save lives, which will lead to why he is so against killing.The whole movie is supported by a great music score by Hans Zimmer, as the ship takes off to take baby Kal El away, the music gives us goosebumps every time.Now for what we didn't like, and thankfully, it wasn't much. Up until the halfway point of the movie, the scenes tended to jump around. But in any case, the movie wasn't suppose to focus on Superman's origins too much. If you don't know his origins by now, then that's your own fault there. He has been around since the late 30s.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I could barely await to see this movie! Man, it 's AWESOME!!!! After Batman and Iron Man trilogy, Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Green Lantern and Captain America, and mostly, The Avengers, it would be a difficult task to make this movie a success! I'm no expert, but I can not understand the bad critics about ""Man of Steel"". The movie is very solid, good acting, impressive effects and a very good soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (one more!). Yes, we have a different version of Superman (cold and darker - influences of Nolan, not a boy scout), but the whole plot is really good!The only two things I didn't enjoy are the fact of Lois knowing Clark Kent real identity, and the way how Superman killed Zod. Mostly, this last part seemed to be a bit of nonsense.Apart from these two aspects, the movie is AWESOME!!!At this point, my opinion is:Looking forward for the Justice League!!!!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Stan Lee did his infamous bit performance here, so he probably approved the outing. Or is it perhaps that he is becoming desperate. No matter, he is becoming a liability rather than the anchor he once was in the Fantasy genre.Man of Steel is chock full of action, but very empty in the areas of back story and character building. In this film no character is sacred, especially Superman himself. Relying solely upon visuals, there isn't any real story line to grab onto. We are treated to more astounding technological wizardry that isn't explained certainly, and scene after scene of monumental fighting and destruction, but only one or two scenes total showing the Superman soul...as I said in the Summary, just another remake that falls short.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is the Superman movie that I have been waiting for me. It combines kitsch with grittiness to make an awesome movie. For the most part the movie stays true to the Superman image, but does so in a modern context with a human touch. It will move you emotionally even though it is just a Comicbook action movie.

Man of Steel is an excellent movie, dulled tragically by some unfortunate blunders.For the most part, the story feels epic, and a rich and interesting world is created through elegant special effects, high quality camera work and a solid soundscape. Sadly, however, a never ending and oddly boring action sequence, coupled with an unbearably typical 'military control room' segment detracted heavily from my engagement with the movie.The majority of the casting was done well. In particular, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane and Henry Cavill were excellent choices for their characters, and played their parts well. Amy Adams, however, was a very weak Lois Lane, and her character fell flat at every opportunity. Also, it was unfortunate that Laurence Fishburne and Michael Kelly were relegated to little filler segments (it was like watching a high end sports car drive 5 km/h). Finally, there were one or two agonizingly cheesy lines from Clark Kent, which marred an otherwise interesting and complex character. I have no doubt that these were attempts to stay true to the Superman of old, but it was awkwardly placed and painful nonetheless. Ultimately, I am glad that I purchased Man of Steel. It was entertaining and inspiring, and I will watch it again. Unfortunately, however, I will always be left with the thought: ""Too bad... it could have been great""8 out of 10, but it should have been a 9.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Directed by Zack Snyder of 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009), Man of Steel follows the origin story of Clark Kent (played by Henry Cavill) when he was a child sent to Earth, after his home planet Krytonite is invaded by General Zod (played by Michael Shannon) and his troops. As a child, Clark quickly gains his superpowers, but struggles to deal with how they change him as a person. Clark grows up to become Superman and fend off against General Zod, who arrives on Earth in attempt to destroy mankind. This film was very entertaining and fun to watch. While it is not on the level of the Dark Knight trilogy, I was satisfied with this movie.I am very concerned by the negativity this film received from critics and audiences. Many didn't like this because of the origin story. I enjoyed the origin story because of how it shows how Clark Kent became Superman. I never knew he was born from another planet. While some are familiar with Superman's origin story from watching the television series Smallville (2001), this film does a good job at showcasing it for those who may not be familiar with it. The pacing may feel a bit rushed with the way it jumps from the origin story to the action, but I don't feel it hurt the film too much. Secondly, I enjoyed the action sequences; the visual effects and special effects were great like in Zack Snyder's other movies. Henry Cavill did an alright job as Superman. Michael Shannon also did pretty well as the main villain.Man of Steel does have its flaws here and there, but it is better than you might think. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

His hand-print is visible, as this is one of the darkest superhero movies. Maybe not as dark as Batman, in Gotham City, but take it as dark as in ""humanity is not ready to face an imminent global danger"". __Soundtrack is proof that Hans Zimmer is a dedicated specialist, a wonder, an expert, and his music does as much good as the motion picture does.

The flashbacks were good because at least we were treated to some great Kevin Costner scenes, but the way Ma and Pa Kent treated their son and hiding his powers sometimes was just odd, especially when he explained to him the whole saving the kids on the bus wasn't a good idea.It wasn't as bad as their Green Lantern movie, but it wasn't much better. Warner Bros/DC Entertainment has to realize not all their movies have to look like The Dark Knight with their bleak settings and lighting. The whole film was colorless and for that matter joyless.

But it is still too early to say whether Henry Cavill is the better Superman or not. Christopher Reeve was a master at playing both Superman and Clark Kent, simply because he was a great actor. But I'm sorry to say that none of the old film hold their own against Man Of Steel. The acting all around is pretty good. The story was complex and well adapted from the comics. The pacing of the movie was also well done. Furthermore, the opening sequence on Krypton really added depth to the story and added depth to the Jor-El character, which was an important factor in making the audience invest in the story itself. Moving on, This movie actually made Superman, the hero, the star and not the villain. Recently, many of the superhero movies focus on the villain more than the hero (Prime example: Nolanverse Batman trilogy. The only reason those movies worked as well as they did was because of the baddies. TBH Bale's performance deteriorated with each film.). Last but not least, THE EPIC FIGHT SCENES! This movie literally had the best Superhero fights of all time! The cinematography was spot on. The way the camera focused on every punch and always followed the action till the end, giving us close ups and making us feel each impact, was amazing. Overall it was a very well made film.

It's insulting to say that this is for fans and not critics, which implies that fans are less intuitive and more into mindless action (of which this film has plenty). I can't speak of anything I like about this movie, but some things to dislike:They are on Krypton for way too long. Superman is launched, planet destroyed. In the first (and best) Superman film in 1978, this was handled in about five minutes. Could have been maybe ten here, and the connection with his father would have been just as strong.The tornado scene. This is probably one of the worst scenes in film history. It tries to drudge up feeling out of an implausible and laughable situation that Superman could have easily solved. His identity is more important than a life? Please.Lois Lane has no reason for being. No reason for getting on the ship, no reason for Zod to want her there. She's purely a plot device, and for a person who loves that character in comics and beyond, it hurts to see her so misused.I could go on. Zack Snyder has done Brett Ratner-style damage to this franchise, and I just hope that soon they bring someone else in to clean up his mess.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The reason was that Superman had no deep and clear characterization, no where near Batman. This movie took me into the heart of the man of steel. Nolan receives all the credit in my opinion, in giving such great depth to the characters; didn't expect to cry in a Superman movie, I'm touched. (Don't expect Nolan twist/complications in the plot, it is not that kind of movie. It does the function of defining Superman and it does exceedingly well.)Action... WHAT THE FRAG!! How the hell did Zach even visualize these action sequences, camera angles, these awesome shot; let alone finishing it in film. Yet he EXCELLED! Those who complain that the movie has too much action... you don't understand Superman, this is the only way, the best way of portraying him. Anything less is unjust. The script explains every detail, so good is the explanation that I'm beginning to think it might really be scientifically plausible. Just perfect. This is more of a 'Clark - Kal' story than Superman; It however end as a Superman movie. Hans Zimmer's sound gives soul to the visuals and story, awesome.BOTTOMLINE: You will love the movie more every time you see it. Everything about this movie is great. If you manage to find mild flaws, its 'coz the movie is so perfect that mild imperfections (which you wouldn't mind in other movies) gets your eye.

I sat next to one of the most annoying guys and I could still enjoy the movie it was that good. It just had everything you wanted. It had action. It also had so thrill moments. I love that they gave so much emotion to superman. They made it as if he grew up on earth. It didn't make him seem like a robot. So I give it twelve thumbs up. I have actually saw this movie twice already and it impressed me every time. I will probably see it again in the future and I know for a fact that I will buy this movie as soon as it comes out. All the old hardcore fans who loved the old superman movies you have to realize that this movie wasn't made to please only your generation it was made to please this generation and the generations that love the action packed movie","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can totally see another one. I thought Russell Cr owe did a great job playing superman's father. I loved Lawrence Fish burg in it. I give it 4 stars. I now want to see it one more time to see it in 3D. I loved the whole movie.I loved seeing scenes that looked like NYC.

Great in many aspects and particularly in the beginning half where the back-story is explained.Acting here is good in some parts, bad in others. Everyone except Lois Lane was fine considering this is an interpretation of superman, not a translation. What I thought was unbelievable is Lois Lane and Superman falling for each other. A crush is plausible but Superman is here, there and everywhere. So how can a crush turn into love when he's hardly around Lois to develop anything? Story is also quite good except, again, Lois Lane appearing and going to places she'd never get near. The emotional content around what happens to Krypton is very, very good.A superhero movie that focuses on emotion, story, spectacle, and enjoyment is what I wanted out of this.

Instead I'm completely enthralled by Russel Crowe's Jor-El and his fight to save his planet, which ultimately becomes his fight to save his son's future. Part origin story and part continuation of the mythology, it's a smartly structured blend of Superman and Superman II that flashes to Kal's childhood, filling us in on adoptive parents, the Kents who bring him up as Clark. It's this that gives the film a real emotional depth, as Clark struggles with who he is, coming to terms with his powers in a film about choices and decisions on a massive scale.Steeped in the classic Superman iconography and acknowledging but not overplaying Kal-El's status as a god among men, Man of Steel is respectful to its cinematic predecessors without the need for the suffocating reverence that blighted Superman Returns. A properly menacing Shannon facing off against the perfectly cast Cavill is the backbone of a rousing adventure, while Amy Adams adds layers of strength and intelligence as Lois Lane.The action is truly cataclysmic, fully recognising the fact that these are near indestructible super-beings fighting, so when they hit each other, they stay hit, and entire cities crumble in their wake. It's stunning stuff, with director Zack Snyder gleefully taking advantage of the $200m worth of resources available to him as all memories of the disappointing Returns are wiped clean, and the best Superman movie since the first one in 1978 reaches the stratosphere.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

A complete waste of some excellent casting choices and one hopes they all return with a different director. I won't go into detail but to say one left the cinema feeling like I had been watching a poor quality video game, some of the cgi was so badly paced I'm sure that even on the biggest screen in the world you would not be able to see what was going on. Don't believe the hype, the trailers do an excellent job of hiding what this movie is.

It treats superman as god, and therefore asks the question of 'how would humanity react to god if he came out to us and how would they treat him if he weren't a vengeful god like superman is. Why would they feel the need to treat him right? Unless he was here to protect them from evil'. I loved all the scenes with Kevin Costner, some even left me teary-eyed. I also enjoyed the opening, I thought it looked great in 3D, maybe even better than Avatar.What I didn't like about it was Henry Cavill, his performance was dull and made it harder on the rest of the actors who were all doing as best as they could with the script. I hated the unnecessary scene at IHOP and the way they underused both Laurence Fishburne and Amy Adams.I noticed a couple of problems with the script, like how did Lois Lane go from one place to another during the fight scenes? Its as if writer David S. Goyer forgot he was writing a movie about Superman and not a sequel to his movie ""Jumper"". I liked the flashbacks though, they were kind of cheesy, but they did get me all emotional, specially the scenes with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. Besides all that, the opening was amazing, the effects in it were great, its just the dialogue wasn't as epic as the visuals that kind of got me down.To all the people that hated it, come on, what were you expecting? Its a lot better than Superman Returns, thats for sure. What I find ironic though, is that superheroes, who do good for no self benefit, are being used to make a lot of money. The thing is, where will they go from here? Why is the Justice League necessary? Why can't they just stick to superman like Nolan's batman trilogy did, while making a great amount of money. Why do they feel the need to rush the sequel? They're planning to release it next year, just look what happened to ""Green Lantern"", my advice would be to stick to superman only. They've got a good thing going. Why risk ruining it?I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Batman Begins"", ""Star Wars"", ""Avatar"", or ""The Avengers"". Its definitely a must watch this year, unlike most movies that have come out, specially other superhero movies.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I am pretty sure most of you know this is the story of Superman (DC comics). If you have seen previous movies, this movie somewhat combines Superman 1 and 2 together into it's own stand alone movie. In a far out galaxy, a planet that has been depleting it's resources is doomed to implode and the only chance for the race survival is in one natural born child, Kal-El (Henry Cavill/Superman) At the brink of the planets destruction, Jor-El (Russel Crowe/Supermans father) devises a way to send his son to Earth in hopes to save the human race and keep the legacy of Krypton alive. In a coup, General Zod (Michael Shannon)kills Kal-El in his own hopes to lead the people of Krypton to salvation, but instead is imprisoned and sent off into a dark land for all eternity. But not before Kal-El can send Superman off to Earth. Here we follow Cal (Clark as most of you know him by) as he must adjust to life on Earth along with the power and responsibility of possessing it. The movie spends an exorbitant amount of time showing the trials of being a superhero. That being said, it is done very well in script and acting. Throughout the course of this, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) character is introduced and is set on finding out who Clark really is. This of course leads to the romantic involvement that was destined to occur. If this sounds like a romantic drama, it pretty much is. But of course, Zod(and his counterparts) comes after Kal (Clark) to retrieve the DNA data from his now destroyed civilization which will lead to the action and summer blockbuster worthiness of this film. On the drop of a hat, the movie shifts the serious undertones the first hour or so had, and turns into a free for all of special effects and explosions that may make Michael Bay take notice (ala Zack Snyder). I do believe the drama and completely contrived romance was a bit long and drawn out. But the way this movie dismissed it completely to obliterate the city was more of a distraction in the storytelling to me. Sure it looked and sounded great in the theater (twice already this year to a theater? not sure what is going on with me) but overall the balance of drama and action just was not handled very well. I also believe with the sheer amount of material they tried to cram into the 2 hours and 20 minutes, they did the best they could. All the pieces were in place to deliver an epic story, but it fell just a little bit short in the presentation. Overall, I did like the movie, and would recommend it. I would be failing if I did not mention the obvious correlation of Kryptons demise being compared to what we have been doing to our own planet. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is worth, solid acting and story for one half, complete mayhem in the form of action and destruction in the second half and with that being known in advance, I believe you will like this movie. 7.6/10 IMDb 7.9 Thank you Ali and Jayden for a nice movie night and also a big thanks to the dude who gave us free passes on the way into the theater to make this a nice and cheap night out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A Movie that showed another massive visualization for a super hero with a dramatic casting and an enlightened performance with a highly memorable screenplay and a perfect direction.Zack Snyder made a remarkable effect and it has given a brilliant output on the screen, yes i bet this movie won't fade out like past superman movies. Lot of transformation for Superman itself, his origin explained in a ultra modern way that stays in our mind forever.Man of Steel is turned a lot due to the extraordinary visual effects that made a movie stunning and solid look. The destruction was highly enjoyed by the viewers that made this movie a far better then marvels Avengers. A punching story with class of screenplay that's what this movie about as i said this movie won't fade out because of the narration and few flashbacks and the movie continues in the same phase and this made the movie reasonable and highly acceptable by movie goers.Casting was another perfection for the Man of Steel bringing in Kevin Costner for few scenes as well as Russell Crowe was well balanced in the story and they made the mark through their performance. And Henry cavil's performance was solid and yes steel. He is well acted perfect expressions in action scenes as well in the emotions. The Superman suit was different with a new look and everyone liked it.And so we can wait for the sequel with additional and heavy efforts by the team. So final words on the movie.A super hero movie which is not bored on any place with a solid story and edge of the seat action sequences with a well balanced casting and a brilliant performances that astonished most of the superhero movies in recent years...I give 8 out of 10...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"3","/10","You Won't believe a man can be this boring...(Or Can Fly)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3014395/?ref_=tt_urv","Clockwork-Avacado","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36296455/?ref_=tt_urv","12 May 2014","I refuse to believe that ""Man of Steel"" was really anything to do with Christopher Nolan, for the simple reason that it sums up the very worst things about contemporary superhero films, which the dark knight trilogy so carefully avoided. Instead, we have a creative collaboration from the guy who wrote the ""Blade"" films and the director who brought us the screamingly over the top campiness of ""300"". So, instead of a mature, intelligent measured take on a classic character, we have an over the top, dingy, poorly-told, horribly-filmed CGI cartoon of Super-Codpiece taking on another generic giant space invasion of the ""Avengers"" mould.For the first half hour of this next-generation attempt to make a Superman movie, you're not quite sure whether this is a decent movie or not. In part, Hans Zimmer's relentless, percussion heavy soundtrack adds a gloss to Snyder's tacky imagery, and Goyer's mind numbing script, but, as soon as arch-villain General Zod comes to Earth, things devolve into a gigantic demolition movie, in which story, characters, well-choreographed fights and super heroic stunts give way to an hour of sheer, mindless destruction of poorly computer generated glass skyscrapers – seriously, the CGI in this movie is amongst the worst I have ever seen, just in its' simple aesthetic, let alone in Snyder's addiction to it, as he smothers virtually every scene with computer imagery of some kind.The story itself seems desperate to distance itself from previous versions of this iconic character, and perhaps, wisely so. Beefcake Henry Cavill screams his way through his Superman scenes, and spends the rest of the film moping about in scruffy designer clothes and a baseball cap – and stubble. Seriously, where does his stubble come from? How does he shave it off, when his hair will be indestructible? Did they stop to think about this basic stepping stone of super-lore, or did they just think that it would be cool to show Kal-El in his degenerate, mopy posing phase, smashing up trucks, drinking beer, watching rugby, sniping at his dad, and generally wasting time doing totally un-Superman like things? It isn't the fact that this takes a pitch-black look at Superman's character that annoys me. It's the stupid lengths to which Goyer goes to to make everything so artificially dismal and falsely morbid, combined with the utter lack of sense in the script, the general poor abilities of the cast, and the totally useless fight scenes. How difficult is it to make Superman a mope? He can do anything, for God's sake. The character was designed as a piece of wish fulfilment, the ultimate fantasy character. Why do we need to see a horrendously camp young Clark sniping at his dad? ""Oh, I wish I didn't have super-powers"" Yeah, really? That's totally how we'd all feel isn't it? And, how ridiculous is the scene in which Kevin Costner's Jonathan Kent dies? How contrived is this drama? Is it really feasible that Clark would just stand by and let this idiot risk his life, when he can do it without personal risk to himself? Or, maybe it's because Jonathan is the worst Dad in the world, who lets his ""son"" get bullied by local kids, because it builds character? Why is it beyond any superhero film these days - or indeed, any film – to show a normal child/parent relationship, without resorting to soap-opera bitching, and contrived fake drama? Apart from probably being the best actor in the film, Costner sticks around long enough to provide a few whispered, posing quotes to stick onto the trailer, and then he's gone. His mother is just a waste of space, who stays alive only for Goyer to not really be exactly sure how to use her.So the first hour of the film is contrived, moany drama, with a handful of horrendously filmed ""action"" sequences – the tanker scene is so pointless, and badly executed, I'm not sure why it's even here, and Snyder films it so badly, all we get is Henry Cavill's bulging torso – not actually any super-heroics, which I think is what we should be seeing here. After this, things shift to mass destruction, with computer-generated Kryptonian villains smashing everything in sight, until you will have seen so much computer-generated glass smashing, that your eyes will hurt. Michael Shannon is your standard, screaming, posing, I-love-myself villain, who has no presence, and his sidekick, Antje Trau, is a concession perhaps to the Bechdel test, and makes the most of her unusual features to play a good, completely one-dimensional villainess, who spends most of her time as a computer cartoon. In fact, at the risk of sounding like a hard-core fan, the visualisation of these Kryptonians is infinitely worse than back in the first two Reeve movies, where we actually had real people doing these things, not terribly animated, zooming about, smashing everything computer characters. I do not exaggerate when I say that the last hour of this film contains some of the worst fight scenes I have ever seen, because they do not present the characters in any way – you can barely see what's going on most of the time, just endless tinkling, shattering and smashing. No excitement, no sense of heroism, or joy in these titanic struggles.This is one of those movies, where it seems that an immense amount of effort has gone into making everything this bad. And, the terribly contrived ""dark"" ending – it's so, so overdone and stupid, just to justify indulging in more carnage and destruction, it's laughable. Best line in the entire film, comes at the very end – Lois to a finally bespectacled Clark; ""Welcome to the planet, Mr Kent."" Yeah. That was worth the entrance fee alone. Please. For Goodness sake – just stick to Superman and Superman II, to see what the real appeal of this character is. Can't wait to see Snyder cock-up Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, etc., etc","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

There were action scenes from beginning till the end.the movie didn't lack on action scenes,it rather lacked some humor.Their was just fast paced action scenes which really would make you bite your nails .The sci-fic part especially when the plot started on planet krypton was really amazing.the four winged birds,the space shuttles,the war scenario all looked very real. The plot didn't have too much of twists.it was straight rather the screen play was good.The actors were fit to their role and the whole cast was perfect.Michael Shannon in the negative role of general Zod was remarkable. the movie really focuses on mass destruction,first on planet krypton and then on earth. lack of humor was the only thing that tied me to give full marks to the movie.Believe me the movie has ample amount of action scenes to enjoy and the 3D effects were magical. I suggest every one to go to the theaters rather than waiting for the DVD version.Believe me this movie wont let down any action and super hero movie fans.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As a visual effects artist myself i can say the level of detail and techniques being used are exemplary for this industry and extremely impressive. The dramatic moving camera shots pan through impossible angles and throughout vast destruction, the fast paced movement rapidly escalates in a way that could only have been planned second by second by a very talented art director. In fact i'm sure if it wasn't for recent advances in robotics and motion tracking this wouldn't even be possible.As far as the story goes, it is only in the final battles that it really feels like a superman movie. So much has been changed since the previous films that its not even really the same thematically, and only when he is fighting Zod mano y mano is when it truly represents the characters. The entire thing has been re-envisioned, Kryptonian technology works differently, his childhood seems much darker, the whole sailor espionage thing seems like a mix of Jason Bourne, the matrix, alien and transformers, but definitely not superman. The suit gets a nice redesign but the Kryptonians are wearing a new high tech armor which looks like the iron man suit. Very beautiful but not what i remember.As for character development the entire thing was too fast paced and tried to cover way too much to fit into the timeframe. the use of flashbacks is shoddy and awkwardly placed, and i would have preferred they left out smallville or put it into a separate origin movie. There is not a whole lot of room for characters to grow or really even interact, they just get swept up in warfare or explaining things. They leave some important things unexplained, such as why the hell clark is conveniently in a bar where they're mentioning the strange craft or how lois lane was able to travel across an entire demolished city in 5 minutes. Characters are introduced that don't get more than one line yet are supposed to play important roles in Clarks life. It also treats the viewer like they're stupid in some parts. I think the longest dialogue in the entire movie is Jor-El re-explaining about krypton, a story which is already introduced in the beginning. At one point they even try explaining what terraforming is to a clueless girl who's obviously never seen a scifi film in her life.When it comes to being ambitious, this movie definitely hits the mark visually. Its a great watch even just for the visual effects, however, their ambition is not quite met when it comes to the story. Most of this is just from trying to have such a rapid sequence of events without giving them time to fully express themselves naturally. They REALLY wanted it to be 2 hours long, but this is not that kind of movie. Had they extended this movie out as long as it needed to be to have the proper character development and fill the holes in their story, i'm sure i would have liked it much better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It brings in a lot of knuckles and hits you a couple of times straight through the heart.TRAILER: The film's trailer got mixed reviews, some claiming it ain't enough to increase the viewers' cravings. Nonetheless I think it had just enough mix to set the right expectations for the film. From the looks of it, the trailer tells us that this film will not feature the Superman we are used to. There will be changes, big changes as to the storyline and other stuff.CAST: Cavill is the right man for the title. No questions on his built, he was clearly ready to portray a steel-like physique. He exceeded expectations with superb acting and that Superman-stare. I wasn't sure at first if Amy Adams can do it, but she did a pretty decent job to play a stronger and fiercer Lois Lane. Michael Shannon may have some overdone tricks but it worked just right for most parts.EFFECTS: Man of Steel was a roller-coaster ride. CGI played excellently, with every fight scene keeping us from breathing. Though some tracks may be similar to what we heard before from The Dark Knight or Inception, those booming instruments surely helped keep the thrill up.It won't be surprising if this film will get mixed reviews, but Man of Steel may just be the right stuff to kick off the Justice League. It had the action and the perfect heart pinch to make it one of this year's best Superhero films.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But after watching Man of steel this is the best of best Superman movie I've ever watched. It is so realistic in every way. It shows if Superman was real in the world we're living in and how powerful these god beings can be in a world like ours. The movie shows the two sides of Superman perfectly. The smiling side and struggling side. Trying to find his place in a totally strange world with powers enough to level that world. The cinematography was used in the best way you could ask. So an inspirational movie. Watching this movie, again and again, makes you realize some people hate it only because of personal issues. There's absolutely nothing to hate it. A Ture Superman Movie. Movies' tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller, and actions are so good in every way.

The score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic. Russell Crowe is amazing as Jor-El and he is in the movie a lot more that you'd expect. Michael Shannon was good as Zod and he had great motives. Retelling the origin story through flashbacks was smart. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are the best on- screen portrayals of Ma and Pa Kent. Henry Cavill is good as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman, making the character relatable, and updated perfectly into modern times. The film shows how people would react to a godlike alien being on Earth, people initially would be freaked out. Superman working with the military was great. Amy Adams is good as Lois Lane and her knowing Clark Kent is Superman was smart. Laurence Fishburne is amazing as Perry White. The action is fantastic and it realistically portrays how godlike aliens fight each other throughout an entire city, buildings get destroyed and people die. Tons of cool DC Comics Easter eggs as well as homages to other Superman comics. CONS: There are some lines of dialogue were a bit cheesy. Lois Lane sometimes felt conveniently there a little too much. OVERALL: While it's not without flaws, Man of Steel is a great movie and for me it's the best Superman film made yet.

I thought the story line was hap hazard with little to no chemistry development between any of the characters and way too over the top destruction of things in the movie. It seemed the writers formula was placing characters here and there with little to no substance or reason. They went with a darker character development and just stripped Superman of anything that made him Superman. And WTF?.... no Clark Kent until the very end???? Big name actors.... Russell Crow, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and the biggest mistake of all..... Laurence Fishburne as Perry White?.... None of these actors could save this movie.

I mean, come on, it's not a bird & it's not a plane. It's Superman! Man of Steel was actually my most anticipated movie of 2013 and while I hate to say it, I was somewhat disappointed. I didn't get that special spark that I was hoping for, which I got from the Dark Knight movies. And I'm probably gonna compare it to that too. However, I still like this movie a lot. If you didn't know, Man of Steel is the reboot of the Superman franchise. It's actually a great start for the hero, but it's not perfect. Henry Cavill actually owns the role of Superman, and Amy Adams as Lois Lane is convincing as well. But the show is stolen by the fathers, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Michael Shannon as General Zod was great, too, but he lacked the emotion and intensity that I was expecting to get from him (especially showcased in one of the trailers). He was great in the role, but he's not the definitive Zod. Nonetheless, this movie still housed a ton of awesome sequences. Essentially every fight scene in this movie is done well and I just can't deny how much I enjoyed every second of them. Director Zack Snyder's visual direction of this movie is so great. However, I felt at times that there was too many action sequences in comparison to how much time is spent developing characters and emotion and all that stuff. While the movie has it's emotional scenes, it's not wholly inspiring or at the caliber of emotion that I was hoping for. But it's more so on the level of action-packed summer movieness. But I still enjoy this movie a lot and I'm so excited to see where the franchise heads (especially with the inclusion of Batman in the sequel!)","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The ending was not up to my expectation, there were a lot of destruction and blasts and lacked emotion in the end which kinda makes it forgettable. It was nowhere near Dark Knight Rises or even Batman Begins. Yeah it was an alien movie and alien on earth there had to be a lot of explosions but it certainly did missed the emotional aspect. But it defo a new launch for the best superhero, as the previous Superman movies sucked...so if there's a sequel to be made then am waiting, maybe this is just the starting and launch pad for the sequels and no surprise if this happens to be another great trilogy like Batman series (of Nolan).

The newborn lands on Earth and as he grows older, is told to keep his powers a secret, for if the world found out, they would reject him. He travels the world looking for answers as to who he is and where he came from. He finds those answers when General Zod arrives, another survivor from the planet Krypton. He has the same goal as Jorl-El did, preserving the race...even if it means destroying another. Man of Steel is Warner Brother's attempt at getting another franchise off the ground. Now that Harry Potter and Batman are done, they have nothing. so they go to the one man from their past who they know can resurrect a dead franchise: Christopher Nolan. With Nolan as the Producer, veteran comic scribe David S. Goyer behind the screenplay and the visual comic book flair eye behind the camera, Zack Snyder, it looked like WB had put all their eggs in one basket. For the most part, it paid off. Man of Steel has it's fair share of problems, I walked away from it with the same feeling I had with The Dark Knight Rises (which was I really enjoyed it, but the problems it has were very apparent). This is a new take on the traditional superhero. This time, Nolan brings in his dark and brooding style to this franchise. Some people dislike this new look and feel, Superman hardly smiles, the world does not love him and the film is dead serious. There are little to no moments of humour. Nolan is taking a...wait, THE, definition of a Superhero and planting him into a real word realm, much like he did with Batman. While some people will be turned off by this, I actually found it kind of refreshing. Yes, we have another superhero who grapples with issues, but these are issues that he should be struggling with. Who is he, where does he come from, what is his purpose. Nolan and Snyder explore this notion and they do it well.The narrative of the film is told in two segments, the present timeline which is Kent looking for answers to his past and the other timeline are flashbacks to pivotal moments in his life growing up. The flashback sequences feel like segments from Malick's Tree of Life, which fits the Kansas setting perfectly. Costner and Lane play Superman's Earth parents. Costner feels the need to hide Kurt's powers, he fears the world is not ready for someone like him, but he's Superman after all. So that need to save people, no matter what is there. Lane is given the short end of the stick here and is given very little to do. Superman's other parents are played by Russel Crowe and Ayelet Zurer. We are introduced to them in an overly long prologue sequence set on Krypton. It feels like a scene that could have been told in ten minutes, instead it feels like twenty. The look and feel of Krypton is lackluster in the sense that we get an Avatar/Matrix hybrid of sorts with flying winged monsters and test tube babies. So the film kind of starts off on a misstep, but once we get to Earth, the film finds its footing. Goyer finds a way to keep Russel around much longer than he needs to be. Although Crowe does bring a bit of charisma to a nothing role. Things get a little harry for Superman when a being who calls himself General Zod arrives. From that moment on the film feels less like a Superman film and more like an Alien Invasion movie and I feel like that was their intention. There is more destruction in this film than in last years Avengers or any of the Transformers movies. The last hour or so is relentless action and destruction. To the point where I didn't know if I could take it anymore. You can only throw a guy through several buildings so many times before it gets tiresome. Snyder is a visual director and he manages to keep the action going with some beautiful shots. These characters move at incredible speeds, so the fight sequences are CGI heavy. Usually when a film has to animate a human, it looks fake, here they seem to pull it off nicely. General Zod is played by Michael Shannon. He plays up the bad guy role well enough for me to give a pass to. We know his intentions, we know he is a threat and Shannon seems to be having some fun with the role, despite the seriousness of the tone. He goes over the top and it works. Cavill is great as Superman, he has the looks, the build and the charisma. He's just never really given that one moment that I think he needed to really ""sell"" that Superman role. The one thing he seems to do different (other than brooding) is scream a lot. Unfortunately one of the biggest problems with the film is the chemistry between Adams and Cavill. Lane and Superman seem to have none of it and their moment at the end felt false. Although she does a much better job than the train wreck that was Bosworth. Man of Steel is a great Superhero movie. It follows in the steps of Nolan's Batman series more than what Marvel is doing with their characters. I urge people not to expect that Superman from the past, goes he's gone. This new one is here to stay.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After numerous versions on stage, screen, and television, Superman has returned. This latest reincarnation, entitled Man of Steel, brings us a more brooding and realistic superhero, with more advanced CGI and less comic book humor. It follows past stories of our superhero and his myth with a earnestness and devotion as not to offend any fan base. In fact, the film takes itself too seriously. What it doesn't do is thrill those die-hard fans or anyone else either. It's all so deadly dull.Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill as Clark Kent a.k.a. Kal-El a.k.a. Superman. Physically, he's perfectly suited for the role. With flowing cape and form-fitting blue spandex (minus the red underwear this time around), Cavil makes a believable hero that could cause serious damage to any villain but more probably cause excessive drooling by most women and gay men. He is super eye candy, cavorting around Metropolis with his low body fat index and rippling muscles on display. (There are many scenes showing off the actor's naked torso and manly physique. We call that in the biz: the money shot.) As for his acting, he isn't given much to do than strut his stuff, which he does handsomely. With a formulaic script by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan (yes, one and the same), the set pieces for the legend to unfold are all there. From his escape from Krypton as an infant, to his days as Superboy with the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, easily the best part of the film); Clark's subsequent meeting with Lois Lane (Amy Adams); his on-going fight for truth, justice, and the American Way. Yet the way they're assembled is strictly rote filmmaking, or not well wrote, pardon the pun.Superman's love interest has been modernized for the 21st century too. The dependable Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, now a Pulitizer Award winning investigative reporter. The actress has the necessary spunk and tries valiantly to pump some energy into her sidekick role. The chemistry between her and Cavill is totally lacking any real heat. Supporting cast members include: Russell Crowe (in a non-singing role, thankfully) as Jor-El, Christopher Meloni as Col. Hardy, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White. All of these competent actors are wasted in their underwritten roles. That their roles are short is merciful.Of course, to make an action film work, one needs an evildoer to counter-weigh all the heroic good. That chore falls on the broad shoulders of Michael Shannon as General Zod. Shannon has proved himself to be a strong actor in past endeavors. Here he brings on the menace in dollops of overheated ham. (Hold the mustard!) Let us hope this misstep will be a learning experience for this talented actor to choice his next project more wisely.I won't belabor the story, as it is known by most moviegoers. In fact, the familiarity of the plot creates some of the boredom. Director Zach Snyder (whose previous track record includes awful movies like Watchmen and Sucker Punch) still hasn't learned much about restraint and character development. He stages his action sequences with no real flair and continually stuffs his film with so many special effects and so much frenzied camera-work that the actors just seem dwarfed in their surroundings. Too often one cannot distinguish the special effects and stunt-work with the in-your-face shaky photography. (The anti-climactic slug match between Superman and Zod goes on far too long, becoming a slog fest.) The blatant product placements seen throughout the film (BP, Sears, IHOP, etc.) is even more dizzying. (I can't wait to visit IHOP for their Superman Short Stack Special, sure to be coming to a restaurant near you.) That the director elicits three of the today's finest actors (Adams, Shannon, and Fishburne) to deliver their worst performances in years however does make Snyder a triple threat indeed.Synder also get sub-par work from production designer Alex McDowell, who seems to be lost somewhere in the Art Deco years and Futurama, and film editor David Brenner who cuts the film for the ADHD video crowd. Costumes by the team of James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson are in search of a time period and some subtle wit. The usually gifted Hans Zimmer provides the loud and obtrusive music. Wholly spandex, this film is so synthetic. Man of Steel may be one of this summer's biggest blockbusters, but for me, it was just one of this summer's biggest bust.

First thing is first i'm huge DC fan over Marvel. Also i'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder. I'm one of the rare people who really enjoyed Sucker Punch (Directors Cut version is wicked awesome). So it would seem like a perfect fit for these two to pair together with the screen play written by David S Goyer. So how did the man of steel pan out? Is this the superman movie we have been waiting for? The answer is quite simply yes!This version of the superman reboot is a dark one, much like in the vein of the new batman trilogy. There is a back story here but what I really enjoyed was that it didn't take a full movie to flesh out how superman came to be. Instead it is told through flashback scenes. I don't want to give the plot away but wow what an awesome performance from Michael Shannon as General Zod. The action in this movie is plenty and very well done. I would recommend not paying the extra fee to watch this in 3d as you won't even notice it. Now this movie does have a few flaws. The movie is very long running at over 2 and a half hours however the length is fine and you won't even notice how long it feels, the problem is simply there are a few pacing issues in terms of moving the story forward. By this I mean things seem to happen very fast in certain scenes and drag out a bit in others. Also Henry Cavill looks the part as superman however his acting is just alright. I find it really hard to believe that a lot of critics cannot enjoy this film as much as I did. I would almost put this on par with the dark knight. It's also way better then the dark knight rises, a movie i did not care for. It's also a hell of a lot better than the avengers or the lacklustre Iron man 3 this summer. It's been a mostly disappointing summer of movies so far. Hopefully this can now change that. So if your looking for a kick butt action flick, look no further.

The villain is generic and not interesting and the plot is very slow and not interesting. There are good things at the movie: Henry Cavill is a very good superman, the CGI effects are good and the actors were not bad. Man of steel is a horrible movie and a bad opening for the DC universe. Even if you're fans of superman you shouldn't watch this movie. It's to boring.

In Man of Steel, this simply isn't the case; through a powerful narrative, stunning visuals, intense and creative action, and a beautiful score, Zach Snyder renders a Superman film that asks the realistic questions of how humanity would react to an alien living on Earth while setting up a villain whose intentions are set in his loyalty to his people. The film is not without plot holes and problems, but the critic hatred towards this film is absolutely unwarranted. Perhaps many of the people who dislike this movie simply cannot tolerate a unique take on Kal, one more grounded in reality than ever before. Henry Cavill proves himself to be the perfect Superman, and Michael Shannon gives a certain vibe to General Zod that no other actor could bring. Together, the cast and crew of the film have brought us the greatest rendition of Superman on the big screen: one that will probably never be surpassed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I believe the film will be super cool for kids around the age of 11 - 12 because of all the action and ""cool"" scenes but for those that look at the acting, the plot and history you should not see it.

Man of steel perfectly encapsulates that thought. While not as cheery as the Christopher Reeves films, Man of Steel is still a joy to sit through and as someone who has watched this movie multiple times, I still enjoy sitting through this movie with each viewing. The action is top-notch, each of the main characters (with the exception Pa Kent) is very well written and well acted, and apart from the ending arc which is a bit too much, it is fantastic in every other category. You need to watch this movie because in my opinion it is one of the better superhero movie out there and something everyone should give a chance to.

Trying to fit so much back story in, have a conflict in the present and develop some kind of relationship with Lois & humanity is a lofty goal. Let it develop and let it take another 25 minutes. I felt rushed to accept this new reboot of the Superman story. I wanted to enjoy the journey more. That being said...I like the actors A LOT, great choices. Everyone complemented their roles and did not outshine the other actors in any given scene. The story of Zod and his motivations was well done. The end was rough and I am not sure I agree with the choices but I felt the emotion and that is good.All in all if this is your first time in the world of Superman it will give you a great understanding of the character.

It is watchable for non super hero fanboys/girls, and that is saying a fair bit as so many others are just not watchable (e.g. Batman vs Superman, Venom 2, Morbius, etc).

It was in 1978 that director Richard Donner brought him to the big screen and the film saw such great success, it went on to be nominated for 3 Oscars. Superman II was released in 1980 and many consider it to be better than the first. The first two Superman films contained state-of-art special effects and much excitement, for their time. The films were fun, even joyful. In 2006, director Bryan Singer gave us Superman Returns, which unlike his X-Men adaptations, received much criticism and negativity. Singer seemed to be trying to revive the fun and excitement of the original Superman films but with a script that a 5 year old might have conceived. The film was filled with embarrassing attempts at comedy, romance and a story lacking interest in itself. Now we have Christopher ""Dark Knight"" Nolan's re-imagining of the Superman story directed by Zack Snyder.Man Of Steel works much like Batman Begins, we go back to the beginning of the story and start all over again but this time it's darker, gritty and more real. With Batman, we had never seen how Bruce Wayne became Batman on-screen before. There were only ever flashback sequences in the Tim Burton adaptations. Bruce Wayne is a human and even though he is a millionaire, the script allowed us to be able to relate to his struggles and want him to succeed in his mission to save Gotham. Superman is an alien who's struggle is whether or not he should use his powers to try to save humanity or stay hidden away from the world and let us work things out for ourselves. It's not a struggle we can easily identify with. The screenplay does the best it can with the source material but where everything goes wrong is in the direction.Zack Snyder came into the spotlight as a director with his remake of George A. Romero's classic horror film, Dawn Of The Dead. Other than an extremely intense opening sequence, Snyder's version had the production value of a made-for-TV movie and overall, was an insult to the original. His next feature, 300, was an overly praised promotional video for Adobe after effects based on Frank Miller's graphic novel. He did make one excellent film adaptation based on a graphic novel with Watchmen but every film since has gotten worse.Man Of Steel is completely unbalanced. The special effects are excellent in some scenes and laughable in others. Superman's home planet, Krypton, looks like something out of a music video while scenes of the young Clark Kent growing up are as beautiful as something out of a Terrence Malick film. Some performances are questionable while others are excellent. Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon look great but do not seem comfortable delivering their dialogue, almost as if they are not being directed. Superman's space dad, Russell Crowe, and earth dad, Kevin Costner, both do an excellent job but it's Amy Adams, as Lois Lane, that ends up being the best part of the film.Man Of Steel suffers because of Zack Snyder's lack of talent as a director. Pointless shaky cam, blinding lens flares and quick zooms all add up to an annoying cinematic experience. Worse of all is the amount of product placement. It's a series of advertisements interrupted by aliens punching each other into and through bad CGI.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have to say I completely enjoyed watching this visually magnificent, stunning and sumptuous movie.To start off with the story this is not a usual fantasy movie where the super hero appears to save the people from the hassles created by the villains. But the director has tried to present us this plot with connecting humanly reality stuffs like sentiments and a strong historical base for this superhero's evolution.The movie has got everything to fulfill the expectations created starting from the VFX, Cinematography, stunts, thrill and obviously the strong star cast of the film.You will witness a complete movie that is a perfect mix of magnificence and brilliance in visual effects. You could easily observe this movie has portions which has a cliché from the movies Independence day, 2012, avatar, Iron Man, Avengers, spider man series and alien series.The director has given the comic a whole new dimension with all essential ingredients. Making this movie to standout and comparable to the veteran directors James Cameroon and Spielberg movies. Loved the way the story was presented.Coming to the casting starting from Henry Cavill as Superman has done complete justice to his role. Amy Adams of enchanted fame as the lead heroine has done picture perfect. We can see some of the Hollywood's finest talents like Russel Crowe, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Micheal Shannon in Pivotal roles.Verdict: Fasten your seat belt for an enjoyable and super fast fantasy movie of the year. Watch it in theaters.-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandranbsiva84@gmail.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Say what you will about the original and yes, Christopher Reeve was great! Giving credit where credit is due. Man of Steel is simply the best! Yes, it's fiction but this take on the story and the explanation of how the krptonians absorbed the yellow suns radiation takes it to a more scientific level. The actors are far better than we've ever seen before and the fact that they actually picked an actor that is in shape brings it all home. 
What makes me disappointed in this reboot is the fact that they felt it necessary to compete with Marvel and introduce, Batman vs. Superman and now the justice league. What a joke! Drives me crazy!! Superman would absolutely crush Batman! All he has to do is fly hundreds of feet above him and either blast him with his heat vision, freeze him with his artic breath, or just drop a freaking building on him. That's not even mentioning the worst portrayal of Lex Luther ever! They took what could've been an amazing new reboot for Superman and turned it into a multimillion dollar soap opera. So sad! Five years after Man of Steel and they only produced two flops with Superman. At least Wonder women was a success! Don't have much hope with the direction they're taking this DC franchise. Give us a story DC and hire a freaking director that can bring it home. Batman has his new saga, why couldn't Superman have his??","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder showed us an great monument of superman also of all superheroes. It is an epic for Superman which embodies a picture of vastness and magnificence. 
Recently, some other exciting trailers were released, which motivated me to write something for my superhero. Without unexpection, I feel heartache. Because I know the pure joyance of Kal's first flight has gone, that placid and boudless region won't come. But THIS is what MoS showed us, and for THIS it is unmatched even we dont talk about the figures. It seems that it is never pleasing to talk about serious topic in a serious way especially in superhero movies. But I want a severe attitude of movies.
Too much analysis of superman has been done, I just want to quote a short para from the MoS art design book""THE SINGLE POINT AT WHICH everything we know and everything we question exist in one place; the ultimate crossroads in the journey of discovering the true meaning of ""self""; the collision point of science and religion, tangible and ethereal, physical and philosophical; the place where a question that may never truly have an answer can be embodied in a singular character--in many ways, that is the why of Superman.""HE DID IT AND DID IT WELL","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Noisy destruction","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3795355/?ref_=tt_urv","Quinoa_Chris_Kirk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3347003/?ref_=tt_urv","1 September 2017","I grew up with the Superman movies of 1978-1983. I may feel differently about them if I watched them now, but at the time they were gospels for a secular age, epic stories of good news in which we are saved from death by a superior being from space. Were these films really better than Zack Snyder's noisy and ridiculous Man of Steel? There was perhaps some charm in the characters, particularly Christopher Reeve's awkward Clark Kent. But there was one element that rendered those films transcendent, and that was the music of John Williams. Regardless of the artistic integrity of his compositions, his music has an undeniable power to lift a movie into a mythical realm that we humans find ourselves swept up into. One of Williams's techniques is the theme song, introduced at the beginning, woven delicately through the bulk of the film and then exploding upon the viewer in the exciting climax. It not only accelerates the urgency of the film's climax, but it brings the heart. Everything that is important to protect in the world is projected onto that music, and when we hear it thundering at the climax, at that crucial moment, in our hearts we know it will be okay. The careers of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas could not have happened without John Williams. He is the master of manipulation.Man of Steel is said to be the Superman story of our age, of the 21st century, our time of utmost scepticism and cynicism. In Zack Snyder's film the score is indistinguishable from the sound effects and I could sum it up in one word, noise.While there is an attempt to expand upon the story and the world by fully incorporating the destruction of Krypton and bringing its spiralling failed technocracy down to threaten Earth, the film spends most of its 143 minutes in noisy destruction that can barely even be called violence and that I would call silly if it wasn't so humourless. Sometimes statistics can be helpful, and it would be a sufficient film review if someone performed the simple but laborious task of calculating the percentage of the film's running time depicting a few almost invincible beings punching each other, banging into each other and just generally smashing their own and each other's bodies into as much human infrastructure as possible, resulting in the spectacularly banal destruction of first Smallville and its familiar chain stores and then New York and its skyscrapers. Things get smashed and crumble into dust. If that's your thing, you've found the right movie.This type of violence cannot be considered dangerous or irresponsible, it is simply senseless and tedious. It is like an incoherent fascist ballet of utter abstraction, with bodies flying, falling and colliding. I suppose some people like this type of audio-visual stimulation. I can only assume they find it exciting, though I'm not sure what's exciting about it when there is no sense of coherent danger. It is noise. It is as gratuitous as any porn film. If it is the Superman film for our age, it is because, short of the character and plot sophistication of a Christopher Nolan film, it is more noise than you have ever experienced before, and in faster succession, and for longer; more smashes, more bangs, more whacks. A more appropriate comparison than The Dark Knight films would be the Batman TV series of the 1960s with its ""Crash!"" ""Boff!"" ""Bang!"" fight scenes. Those words are replaced by extremely complex computer graphics, but the experience is ultimately the same. Like any good porn film, the scenario that justifies the action is quickly swept aside for prolonged sequences of bodies pounding against each other.Regarding the plot, Krypton was destroyed by inept committees, but the film adamantly rejects fascism. The military coup led by General Zod understandably wants to save the people of Krypton at any cost, even the genocidal colonisation of Earth. The benevolent line of Jor-El and Kal-El (Clark Kent) prefer instead to preserve truth, justice and the American way, by fighting fascist-inspired colonisation with the support of huge amounts of ammunition courtesy of the American government. And the Americans keep firing their guns, even though their enemies are totally impervious to them. Having justified the prolonged sequences of noisy destruction, the second objective of the plot is to create the hope and desire for a sequel, and you can bet $250,000,000 there is a sequel.http://www.quinoablessed.com/2017/08/man-of-steel-2013-by-zack- synder.html","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It lacks the comic-book charm of the Christopher Reeves Superman era. There are 4 Superman films Christopher Reeves stars in. If you own these 4, then there is definitely no need to see this film.Henry Cavill is unconvincing as Superman. Even casting Veteran actor Kevin Costner Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father, doesn't lift this film above mediocrity. As does veteran actress Diane Lane, who also has a small part in the film as Martha Kent, Superman's adoptive mother.Plot of the film starts of the same way as Superman 1980, General Zod and his followers are banished to the Phantom Zone, Kal-El is sent to planet Earth, Planet Krypton is destroyed along with Zor-El and his wife. The story then merges with Superman 2, Zor-El returns from the Phantom Zone with the object of becoming Earth's supreme ruler.The best special effects of the film are saved for last. The opening and middle parts of the film are lack luster. The scene to look out for is when the Kryptonians terraform Earth and when Zod battles Kal-El.Among the better actors in the film is of course my favorite, Kevin Costner. Though his body has aged, he still shows that fire in his eyes as I have seen in films like The Bodyguard, A Perfect World and Waterworld.Verdict: if you're a fan of Superman then I recommend you to either download and watch it online, or rent it from your DVD library. Then if you like it you can go see it at a 3D/THX cinema of your choice.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

A lot of critics are upset about the lack of Superman/Clark's wit, charm and humor and yeah I missed it too, but on the other hand the film amply compensates with stuff that we always wanted to see in Superman movies but never could. I remember way back when I was watching Matrix Revolutions I so wanted it to be Supes and a big baddie from outer space to level the skyline of a metropolis than Neo and Agent Smith. Yeah this movie delivers that in aces. A lot of people are complaining about the 45 min action set piece in the end, but come on: this is what me and the millions of fans worldwide paid their money for. I seriously don't want Superman matching his wits with an evil megalomaniac anymore, I wanted him throwing his fists against someone equal to his power in sheer physicality. Here we see that but not just against Zod but a multitude of others as well and how Superman fights against the insurmountable odds and attains victory in the end. Snyder took the right decision to steer away from previous Superman movies in mood and present us something that was never touched in there. The absolute power and physicality of Superman. Now that it has been established I believe the next movie will be more about the Superman we know and love and like all successful franchises the next movie will be the biggest and the best Superman movie ever. My two thumbs up for Man of Steel, a must watch for everyone.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They don't really, there are several flashbacks to his youth and his difficulties growing up which provide many of the best scenes of the film but once he dons the famous cape and the action really starts, the film has nothing new to offer other than really, really good CGI and an epic scale which earlier film couldn't realistically create.The cast is a varied bunch, Henry Cavill provides a physical presence and is actually very capable in the role. Amy Adams as Lois Lane, not so much. If she's a Pulitzer prize winning journalist, then I'm Vladimir Putin's favourite hunting rifle. Laurence Fishburne is really quite good in a small role as Perry White and Ayelet Zurer provides a nice evil henchwoman to the General Zod antagonist.And whilst we're on the topic of General Zod, it must be mentioned that is a really, really good villain. His portrayal by Michael Shannon is intimidating, honest and nuanced in ways you wouldn't have expected it to be. His character is easily one of the more outstanding parts of the film. The other standout character for me is Kevin Costner, the 'earthly' father rather than the smug, superior Jor El (Russell Crowe). Costner's Johnathan Kent is the main reason the 'young Superman' scenes work so well, providing an honest and human voice.But as I mentioned earlier, once the costume is on (no red pants on the outside anymore), the non-stop action really begins. It's visually stunning but lacks force or threat. It's like watching the fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith towards the end of Matrix Revolutions, in the sense that there's a lot of impressive effects, being thrown about the place and loads of collateral damage but very little honest threat or drama. Having these super being fight each other and throwing themselves hundreds of yards, or destroying buildings all over the place is very impressive to watch, but it just underwhelms in almost every other respect.I think it's the weaknesses of the character that let me down, Superman is just not interesting. The secondary cast is interesting (Zod, father Kent, etc) but Superman himself, even when shown his moral turmoil as a youth, is just very one dimensional. There's none of the lovable rogue of Tony Stark, or the moral darkness of Batman. Even goody two shoes Captain America has an honest appeal to him, a humanity. But Superman isn't human and his powers are godly.The other oddity about the film is the universe that's been created for other DC heroes to fill. There's other planets, super beings and absurd technologies. How's a hero like Batman (Nolan/Goyer Dark Knight type Batman) going to have any real impact in a world like that. The answer would be a re-introduction, a new actor, having the character reinvented into this universe with new toys, tricks and powers. When leaving the cinema, we heard another patron say ""The film would have been good if Joss Whedon had directed it."" Whilst harsh on the visual genius of Zack Synder, it does highlight just how Marvel still have a large advantage in the cinema stakes. Even Gods in the Marvel films have very human flaws, something that Superman for one finds hard to replicate. Despite the last 500 words saying otherwise, I didn't dislike the film. I was just hoping for so much more. I was hoping that the film would bypass the flaws of the character and deliver an emotionally engaging Superman. Instead, you get an emotionally engaging young Clark Kent and then forty five minutes of CGI cities falling apart.It's also painfully unfunny. Seriously. They try to put some jokes in there that are so flat, so badly timed. They'd be funny if Joss Whedon had directed it.Further reviews at: http://thegiff.typepad.com","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was literally bored of all the action going on in the movie. It never engaged me into the movie. The character isn't developed at all, its just like we see ordinary hero in the movie. Maybe the first movie should have been just built around superman's making, then take all the actions into the sequel. It was just like watching transformers movie, with no great screenplay or story, just some action and thats all u get. In short summary for this review, this is one of the worst superhero movie have seen in my life.

Man of Steel deserves to be ranked with some of the best movies in history. This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen, in all regards. The storyline goes above and beyond in ways other movies can't even begin to. Superman is finally made into a believable, realistic individual. Man of Steel completely shreds all of the unrealistic fantasies of a god-like infallible, which in my opinion is necessary considering Kryton's less-than-perfect civilization. It goes above and beyond in detail-work with tiny details adding up to serve an ENORMOUS understanding. The plot serves to answer all questions of how, why, and when to an unprecedented extent in cinema. The background story is equally balanced with full-scale action cinema, as the antagonism ties into Superman's origins. And what could tie it all together better than one of the best casts I've ever seen? An exceptional first movie in a reboot. This movie has clearly set one of the best foundations for a saga that could go on as long and far as filmmakers could dare to dream of.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

There are few moments when Cavill does act. The others are just moving from one place to another and SFX. As for Amy Adams, not her best work. She simply does not look the hard-on investigative reporter that goes through everything to get a story clear.Kevin Costner plays Cliff Robertson times 10, as does Diane Lane with Rosemary Harris. their parts reminded me a lot of Spider-man.Michael Shannon does a good job, being menacing, but nothing that stands.All other characters were there but were not necessary.Music. It feels like The Dark Knight score just a little changed. While it was certain that the score could not match the original John Williams, it should have some upbeat parts. instead, Hans kept it in the same down on the ground, without high notes score from batman.Directing. I believe Zack lost it somewhere between Watchmen and Sucker Punch. The cameras zooming in the space or far scenes like it was hand-held reminded me of Battlestar Galactica (2 regulars from the series appear in the movie). I don't know why do directors think this is cool for action movies. It just increases the SFX budget, without any return. Scenes with dialogue are cold, lacking spirit, but actions are still Zack Snyder good.Screenplay. 2 words. Plot holes. The movie starts good at Krypton and develops well until we see Clark grown-up. Like Batman Begins, we see scenes not in chronological order, but through some flashbacks. But when action kicks in, all is left behind and we don't get anything new from the story.Maybe we want something different for such a great hero (Superman turning the earth backwards in the original Donner movie was pure cool awesomeness), but this movie lacks it. It seems the movie was made in a rush to get on the wave of superheroes billion grossing market of nowadays.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The direction by Zack Snyder who also directed films like 300 and also watchmen did an amazing job directing man of steel because Zack Snyder is familiar with the way a comic book adapted into a film should be directed. The film was very well casted with actors like Henry Cavill and Amy Adams as Lois Lane.With many others like Lawrence Fishburne Diane lane, Kevin Costner,Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe who all make their perspective rolls their own. Overall this movie is,in my opinion,the best movie of the summer.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's a shame because Zack Snyder's view is interesting (i'm sure he's not the one responsible for that, shame on him for having his part in it anyway ), the main actors are good.Well, that's it, the scenario is terrible, dialogs are tasteless, the main story is inconstant. well, you watch the entire movie and what's left ? Almost nothing, some good scenes from the beginning.I wanted to make it short, it's already too long, this movie is a big disappointment.

Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic have lost the power of reviewing, rating, or even watching a movie from critical perspective. Why? It is because the critics are connived, conceited and paid by opposition to write bad reviews (?). We are living in a world, and at a time where reviewers review the movie to garner more traffic to their website or get more attention. Never have i ever been so distrustful of anyone, as i have been of MetaCritic and Rotten Tomatoes after watching this movie.To Begin with, Man of Steel is a solid movie. Solid and more deeper than Iron Man 3. Sorry to compare Iron Man 3 with Man of Steel, but i think it is a fair comparison, because both are pitted against one another for the Top Earning Movie of the Year. Iron Man 3 looked like a gaudy set piece, with mediocre action, and really unexciting climax scenes. The point of Iron Man 3 seemed to be to engage audiences, and then make Iron Man more darker. Well, Iron Man 3 wasn't dark, nor did it seem anything different from Iron Man 1 or 2. In totality, it was a mediocre movie.Man of Steel in my opinion the most exhilarating ride, the most pulsating panorama created for the screen. I didn't say it is the best movie, i just said it is breathtaking. I have never been more involved in anything, never been so enamored by anything other than the action that is wonderfully woven throughout the movie. On the flip side, the emotional connect between characters is a little less, but we never wanted a brooding Superman. We needed a Superman who can kick someone's ass, someone who we can believe is closer to god. This movie presents superman as the quintessential Avatar of God, but not at the expense of vanity. There is always a second movie to develop characters and take forward some other questions and deliver answers to those questions. I am waiting for the Sequel.Henry Cavil, looks like Superman. His face, acting, voice etc. He exemplifies Superman. Russell Crowe was brilliant.WE LIVE IN A WORLD, WHERE WE ARE BRAINWASHED BY CRITICS AND REVIEWS. WE BELIEVE IN THEM SO MUCH, THAT WE HAVE LOST INDIVIDUALITY, WE DEPEND ON THEM TO MAKE US LIKE OR HATE A MOVIE. THIS HAS TO CHANGE. CRITICS Don't MATTER, WHAT MATTERS IS YOUR OWN MIND, FOR IT IS THE BEST CRITIC.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

And Superheroes. And ten minutes. Else PLEASE proceed to the next post.I am a huge, huge, hugeeeee superhero fan, Marvel, DC, all superheroes. And I LOVE Nolan, whatever, whatever he makes.Superman is the world's grandest, most loved, strongest, best and awesomest superhero and Nolan and Zack reinforced this status-quo again!!!The first half is a frame-by-frame, step-by-step introduction and tutorial about Superman, who, why, how. And what. Its not about choice of being a superhero but your decision when you ARE one and when you would show the world YOURSELF.It starts with the heart-rendering story of a baby, who as an infant is forcibly separated from his parents & planet, the love his teary-eyed mom showers on the just born baby who is flung into space, the kid who is an alien & outcast on earth, teased by all, becoming a 12 year who is more interested in Plato than baseball, who learns to control his anger and channelize it, a father who lets himself die rather than reveal his son's superpowers before the right time!The second half is so full of VFX, so many effects, so tremendous, so inspiring, so awe-filled, so fast, so overwhelming that you simply get blown away!!! You would feel like a kid in a candy store or a guy in a gals-only swimming pool. The scenes are at times so fast you get a feel Nolan went to Krypton with Weta Digital staff to shoot the gravity- defying scenes!In retrospect you feel not Zach, but Nolan has directed it, at least the first half. Hans Zimmer's music pumps more adrenaline in your blood than Dark Knight ever did, would make you stand up and scream and cheer for Superman. VKX beats 2012 & Day After Tomorrow movie and the hand-held cameras give a much real feel. And the fights make you feel, stand up and kick their ass. The resilience and the power NOT to hit back is brilliantly showcased.The movie has deep one-liners (Joker & Batman kinda) both humorous and inspirational, which are Nolan's USP, again reminding you of Batman; General Zod wud remind u of Joker at times, exuding brilliant charisma and yes, unlike what you might have read, Superman DOES crack jokes but with a straight face and you will laugh hard on it, esp. the scene in the interrogation room wid Ms Lane. Romance exists but very subtle.The bottomline is the essence: We all have to wait for the right time for the right thing to happen. Even if you are Superman.Its perfectly showcased right from Clark's marvellous entry where, in just a few seconds you know his potential and intention till the climax which sets the scene for future parts. Also, the way the earlier childhood scenes blend with the current reality would amaze and Marvel (not DC :P) you.Henry Cavill is OUTSTANDING in both roles. Looks like this role was waiting for him !!! General Zod is an angry patriot but not ferocious enough and Ms Lane could have been more hot. Russel Crowe plays more of a guide to his son than the role of a father.4 stars for this piece of gem, don't be jealous even if you are the CEO of Marvel. This deserves it.I am sure Christopher Reeve would be smiling from above","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You either love it or hate it, there's really no in between with this film. I fall on the love side. There are problems with the film as it's by no means a perfect film. But it may be as close as a superhero film could get to being a masterpiece.Zack Snyder is very much the auteur of this project. Christopher Nolan and David Goyer's hands are definitely in the script and tone, but Snyder's direction is among the most inventive and visually stunning in this genre. Snyder takes the campy tone of some of Superman's previous entries and flips it into a bleak, grim, and destructive story. But it works for the film they were going for. In many ways this is the truest to comics form of Superman we have ever had. Henry Cavill's physique resembles the comics more so than Brandon Routh's or Christopher Reeve's, and he's never been more powerful than seen in this film. Snyder also crafted an incredibly detailed Krypton for the first 20 minutes of the film, which tended to be one of the many things everyone agreed to be a positive for the film. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon kick off the film with a great Jor-El/General Zod fight which makes for the centerpiece for the rest of the film as Zod attempts to stop the launch of Kal-El (Suprman) to earth. I loved the way they switched the mythology to make Kal the true last son of Krypton as the first natural birth in centuries. The rest of the film entails Kal's adapting to earth and Zod's search for him.The heart of the film comes from Kal's earth family, the Kent's. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane play his parents and share some of the best scenes of the film. Again, they flipped the history a bit in the death of Pa Kent being an event Superman could have prevented, but it makes for one of the most emotionally devastating scenes of the film. The relationship between Clark and his mother tend to be my favorite scenes as they are both written incredibly well and heart-warming in feel.The action and destruction is some of the more controversial aspects of the film with both the Smallville fight and the infamous Metropolis ending. I've always been a fan of Snyder's unique take on action and fight choreography but the destruction is a complaint I can sort of understand. But everyone should remember that this was the first few days that Clark/Kal realized his abilities as Superman. He didn't have time to think about and strategize how he fight the Kryptonians. Give the guy a break. Those Krytponians, however, do give him their best shot, including Antje Traue's ferocious Faora-Ul.There are moments of Man of Steel that could have been cut down like the Terraforming snake-like machine scene and a few expositional scenes, but the bottom line is that Snyder creating something in Man of Steel that transcends the superhero genre. He gave us one of the more visually stunning and morally thought provoking entries in this genre, and that's an achievement. Hans Zimmer's score is among the greatest for any superhero film, perfectly balancing the grim tone with a heroic center figure. I expect the romantic chemistry between Amy Adams and Henry Cavill to be improved in Batman v Superman and the destruction to be addressed. To me though, Man of Steel is a force to be reckoned with for all superhero films.+Heroic Zimmer score+Visually stunning+Intricate story by Nolan+Snyder's attention to detail+Cavill is the definitive Superman+Father figures+Diane Lane-Romantic chemistry-Run-time could have been cut down10/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Well, from the opening of the movie until the end I could not take my eyes off the iMax nor move. The movie was way beyond any expectations I had for it, it literally blew me away in every possible way. The music played by Zimmer matched everything i watched and gave me goosebumps at some scenes. That electrical shock through my spine, down to my arms that I can see my arm hair stands.Few movies had such an impact and one of them was The Dark knight Trilogy, the common thing between the two is not the justice league .. It's Nolan!I think he was a genius coming up with the unexpected as everyone was looking for a reboot of the old movies. I watched the 1978 movie after Man of Steel to know what was all the fuzz about and it looked to me more of a shattered pieces of everything Superman did in comics collected in a movie.He did not follow the others steps (why would he?) and came up with a brilliant movie that was awesome in everything. From choosing the cast of the movie, the music, the story line .. Man I just can't say enough ..","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

We get to see more of Krypton in this movie than any other. It's a rich full world and gives us more incite to these people. The action is practically nonstop and slows down just enough for us to catch our breath. During those times it gets pretty emotionally charged and at times brought a tear to my eye. This is the Superman everyone has been waiting for since Chris Reeve made us believe a man can Fly. Cavill does this but also the responsibility and the burden it carries of being all powerful. The stable full of high caliber actors only proves it's not just the effects we crave but good acting and a great story. This does all that and more. It brings us that much closer to a Justice League us fans have been waiting years to see.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It doesn't developed the characters, Clark constantly swifts from wanting to live is life like a normal to help the world with his powers, the chemistry between Clark and Lois is none and the romance is awful, the action scenes are actually too much, what makes them boring and takes focus from the history.They had the power to make a masterpiece and instead we have a mediocre film, with poor story telling, that builds no emotional connection between the audience and the characters, and with unnecessary action. A complete disaster!

A very good reboot compared to Superman Returns which had nothing to do with any of the original Superman Movies before years before, it was a pure waste of time and money. Moving on Man of Steel was different in every way from Christopher Reeves version. I'm glad it was different to me that's point of a reboot be different from the previous version. Richard Donner did a fantastic job on the original Superman Movie I still love watching it till this very day. That was a different time and a very different era. Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder did a fantastic job of making this there on version of Superman witch gave us a more detailed view into the history of Krypton. The Christopher Reeves Era ended with last episode of Smallville as it should have. Man of Steel was darker than any other Superman Movie has been and I thought is great being seen in that type of light.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The only way you can tell which are the bad guys and which are good is by what color costume they are wearing. But all of them seemed like a lot of stupid jocks.The Dark Knight series was inspired.

So I just went and saw this movie with my brothers.It transcended my expectations and superhero movies in general are pretty much totally changed in my eyes. I've never seen anything like it. Somehow they made it so intensely emotional and I don't even fully understand.I cried through the whole movie and I never cry. I'm not ashamed to admit it. It was the story- and Clark as a character. I could identify with him on such a deep level. When he was hurt, I was hurt. The acting was so real. It wasn't just what they did it was the emotion they were able to express in their eyes and face. Confusion, fear, hope...all at once! Like I said, I cried the whole time and most of the time I couldn't tell what emotions i was feeling because it was just overwhelming. I have never in all my life been so emotionally invested in a movie.And the ending is just beautiful.

However I was very pleased with this version all in all. It was very emotional in parts and had some great moments. Grumbles......there was no superman theme!!!! very disappointing! my kids and I were ultimately waiting for the proud moment were the superman music broke over the speakers and soup took flight, but alas we were let down. Grumble 2....there were no 'shirt rips' revealing the 'S' however the storyline did not allow for this, but probably will in a second movie, however that itch was scratched a little when Durrell showed his symbol in this fashion. All over though an excellent re do, very well cast, but I just hope that there is the good old Superman theme in the next one.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Of course, who in reality, is an alien named Kal-El; one of the last surviving Kryptonians, and found and raised by an earthling couple from infancy. If you haven't seen the Superman movies with Christopher Reeve, or at least the very first ""Superman: The Motion Picture"", that's okay. This movie contains his entire origin, as well as a pretty decent write up of the events leading up to Kal-El being sent off to Earth, and the eventual destruction of his home world of Krypton.Where it gets really interesting, is in how the producer went about showing Superman's abilities. In this reboot, Superman doesn't fly off with the usual smooth ""wooosh""... here his take-offs are generally in the neighborhood of Mach 1 or faster; and they rock! There are even a couple well north of Mach 6... It's a superhero movie. Skyscrapers get smashed, entire city blocks are blown to bits, serious kick-ass at the speed of sound, and yes, Superman & the bad guys, they're all bulletproof. Oh yeah, there's a bad guy hottie, playing Zod's right hand... and she kick's serious butt.The only complaint someone came up with, which was misplaced, was that Michael Shannon's character, general Zod, was more like a sidekick... But that person was comparing Zod to Kahn from Star Trek: Into Darkness - a completely different persona - Kahn being a genetically engineered genius/super soldier; whereas Zod is a genetically engineered soldier - period. Of course he doesn't have Kahn's brilliance, as a soldier who's only task is the protection of Krypton and to guarantee the continued existence of it's people, he was not designed to be brilliant in everything; Kahn on the other hand, was; which is also the very same thing that made him such a nemesis. Not that Zod is not very good at what he does, mind you; on the contrary, he gives Superman quite a run for his money; make that every cent. He doesn't care about the body count, as long as he accomplishes his self-proclaimed mission while annihilating billions in the process, to save the Kryptonian legacy. The movie is worth it; go see it.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

But this movie has dug deeper into his feelings and the director was very successful to portrait them in a classy way. The struggle of Super Man to find what he has to become is very well presented in this movie unlike the previous cartoons/movies. The movie doesn't concentrate on showing off his powers (what most of us expect to see) rather it focuses on his origin, his emotions and his feelings. This movie is mush informative on Super Man's background than any other.There is no need to talk about the visual effects as all the movies of this category are very good at it.

Thirdly, Superman itself is a difficult super-hero to relate to Modern audiences as Batman (no Powers, Human), Spider-Man (Mutation, Human), Iron Man (Technology, Human) have all been made with some logic to add to fantasy, so there is suspension of belief still, but these stories don't have a steel alien, flying superhero with cape, with tag-lines like IS THAT BIRD...Not extending this narrative hurdle and now reviewing the movie itself, I hope everyone got the point...So the movie started, and I expected Fireworks, and a child who will be flown to earth and blah blah..though it is done as such, after 15 mins, the movie does change pace to Nolan's style, the story-line is edited between time-lines for character development and making us believe what is to be a Man of steel, the movie then flows smoothly till the action packed climax, which glued the audience till the very last scene, not detailing or spoiling the story, I will say that what makes this super- hero movie different from others, is that it is NOT ABOUT FINDING YOUR POWER, BUT KNOWING IT..(No time is spent on surprises so typical especially in Spidey movies when he cheesingly tries his powers after discovery)..Regarding the performances, to be honest Henry Cavill didn't have a comparative hurdle faced by Christian Bale (Michael Keaton), Andrew Garfield (Tobey Mcguire), but Chrisopher Reeve though not a great actor, but still he is most loved SUPERMAN, so how did Mr.Cavill perform, I will say outstanding as he fitted the persona of Superman perfectly, casting decision was proved perfect and in those NOLANISH scenes when he had to show emotions, he kicked Routh's Superman out of the park...Hope to see Mr.Cavill in sequels as 2nd movies in such series are now almost the best ones...Amy Adams as Lois Lane, well I have always respected her as an actress, but she didn't fit as as bolt as Magie Gyllenhaal, Kirsten Dunst or Gwyneth Paltrow did in their movies, being honest and comparing with same series, Margot Kidder in original Superman movies was very good and one of best thing about the series, and Kate Bosworth was awful in TSMR, so Miss Amy lies in between, she did exactly great in emotional scenes as she is great actress, but lacked the visual punch needed in Super-Hero girls...need to see more of her in sequels where story is more focused on the relation between her and Superman..The supporting cast were highlight of the movie, Michael Shannon was much natural villain than Spacey, Diane Lane was perfect, veterans Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Lawrence Fishburne all played their parts with honesty, among others Ayelet Zurer should definitely be mentioned for her negative role played with perfection..Directing this movie as I have mentioned before had hurdles I mentioned before, after 300, which actually was fun to watch in cinema, A story full of action and style filled with message of courage, and Dawn of the Dead, with its execution, were great starts but Watchmen disappointed in in its overlong bland narrative and Sucker Punch , though visually beautiful was more cartoonish as a final product, this always worried me since the project began, will Mr.Snyder give us a cheesy Man of Steel, well now I will say that NOLAN+SNYDER is really a dream duo for a super hero movie, with narrative decisions which work perfectly, suspense that is not so puzzling but keeps interest and the main character which is not just a FLYING-MAN-OF-STEEL-WITH-CAPE, we really feel about the protagonist..The action scenes were perfectly directed but Snyder never had problem there, I watched the movie in IMAX and it really had one of best effects I have seen, the highlight is the humanization of Superman, something done perfectly before by Nolan..Some facts in the movie are really interesting, though no super-hero movie is and can be PLOT-HOLE proof as it demands fantasy , but we do get logics in questions modern audience ask, like ""why does Super Mans suit not burn"", ""He is from another planet, why the S of Superman then, is there English in Krypton"" and many others have been explained and David Goyer should be credited for this for his screenplay..Ending my review that why I rated it 10, Well I always knew Nolan would humanize the character, but didn't expect the connection I felt with Man of steel, I enjoyed every second of the movie, so why strip stars, aren't superhero movies targeted to be such, don't take biased view while watching this movie and benchmarks like Shawshank Redemption, Godfather etc, see it as it is and you will love Zack-Nolan's Man of Steel !!!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Not only was the story superbly written, the action and effects matched the movie's great story, and definitely out-shined any superhero movie that came before it. I rated Into Darkness as a 10 and this movie I would rate as 11 if the option was available. Definitely the best superhero I've ever seen, it exceeded my expectations and then some!

"3","/10","Need to replace David Goyer ASAP!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2822452/?ref_=tt_urv","mynameisibrahim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41441740/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2013","Man of Steel, the latest rendition of the premiere comic book superhero, or the reboot of the relaunch, flies into a cinema near you. Following the lukewarm response to Superman Returns (2006), this represents another attempt by Warner Brothers' to resuscitate the Superman franchise. Zack Snyder, who has helmed action capers like 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009), is the man responsible for Man of Steel while Christopher Nolan, creator of the Dark Knight trilogy, is involved in a production capacity.Man of Steel tries to establish its own identity and is a significant departure from the Richard Donner films. Most importantly, the movie features a new look for Superman (sans the infamous red briefs), based primarily on his appearance in 'The New 52' line of DC Comics.First and foremost, Henry Cavill is the ideal Superman. He exhibits a fascinating embodiment of both Clark Kent and Superman as well. In the guise of Clark, he exemplifies the ultimate outsider, bereft of any belonging. He is lost and delirious. Donning the iconic cape gives him the opportunity to discern his true destiny. This realization is depicted quite well and is ultimately the saving grace of the movie. Henry Cavill deserves all the plaudits and praise for his portrayal of Kal-El. Having narrowly missed out on leading roles in Casino Royale (2006) and Twilight (2008), Cavill makes full use of his chance and is the standout performer in Man of Steel.Moreover, Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent) and Antje Traue (Faora-Ul) shine in their respective roles. Costner is afforded fleeting moments but he leaves an indelible impression as Clark's doting and protective father. Antje Traue, a relative newcomer amongst seasoned veterans, plays the psychopathic aide of General Zod and exudes menace throughout. Also, the background music is supplied by Hans Zimmer. A frequent collaborator of Christopher Nolan, Zimmer's stellar score is almost like a character in the movie.Unfortunately, that's about as good it gets for Man of Steel. The flaws are aplenty, disseminated throughout. Superman's most distinguished love interest, Lois Lane, is played by Amy Adams. While it may be foolhardy to question the caliber of her acting talents, given that she is a four time Oscar nominee, Adams is miscast as Lois. One qualm of her delineation is that she looks considerably older than Henry Cavill. Consequently, it results in the conspicuous absence of any tangible chemistry between the pair.The blame for several deficiencies in Man of Steel can be apportioned to screenwriter David Goyer and also director Zack Snyder. While Goyer initiates the smart maneuver of emphasizing Superman's relationships with his biological and adoptive fathers, each with his own beliefs, there is little else Goyer's writing flourishes in. Goyer is culpable for rushed first act, which suffers from disequilibrium. On the flipside, the climax of the movie, which comprises of breathtaking fisticuffs between Superman and General Zod, is ultimately a stretch. However, the Special Effects team deserves credit for the CGI, which are top notch.Given that Christopher Nolan is attached as producer, one can be forgiven for believing that another epic saga is in store, similar to The Dark Knight. Sadly, in trying to create a dark and gritty Superman movie, Man of Steel takes itself too seriously and the outcome is an in vain attempt to emulate the blue print of The Dark Knight trilogy. Goyer also fails to evoke any palpable emotion at crucial junctures of the movie. The dissonance between writer and director is felt at such instances, exposing weakness in Man of Steel. For instance, The Dark Knight and The Avengers, widely regarded as the best comic book adaptations, benefited from having the same writer and director, enabling them to execute an effective movie. Snyder is in his element with regards to the action sequences but is unable to influence proceedings otherwise. A combination of poor writing and his shortcomings result in the emotive elements of the Superman mythos getting short shrift.While the makers are reprehensible for the aforementioned drawbacks in the movie, Man of Steel is watchable for a bad ass rendition of Superman, who is not afraid of engaging in aggressive combat, something rarely seen in five previous Superman movies. All in all, Man of Steel represents a missed opportunity to carve a truly classic movie. The makers are guilty of compromising character development for wholesale obliteration.The 'S' on Superman's crest now stands for 'Hope' and as a childhood fan of Superman, I can only hope that the sequel improves on this origin story.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In this film we have the Superman is the superhero who still tries to find his place in the world, ie is the beginning, the film is taken before the threat of General Zod and his soldiers after they banned krypton solids eventually escaping; due the oath to pursue the son of Jor- El, Zod then search during the last decades son of krypton. hitherto Superman is still discovering itself and here comes the threat on earth. what we can say is that the film will please any fan of Superman, the vision that the film shows krypton is a realistic and never seen as alien, the special effects of the film are the best in terms of destruction ever seen, when i watching while the film felt the power range Superman and Zod, the film is gorgeous along with an extremely strong storyline have a great emotional appeal and that helps build the atmosphere, the soundtrack is raised to the top with orchestrated songs that show a Alien climate and excellent sound effects. the story of the film is also strong see many seeds sown in the plot that can be used later on, the very action of henry cavill is convincing, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) has an important role in building character, and Zod is simply well giving the appearance of villain; unfortunately for hardcore fans will not have the phrase iconic villain, a strong point of the film is also as the film is told mixing memories of this character and also giving a more harmful to the events. a single point that I disliked was how Superman movie this is serious, this is the most worthless before the greatness of the film, the 3D film is weak does not have that sense of immersion that we have in other films, which is transmitted images are deeper and nothing more. In order Man of Steel is the film that any fan of Superman always expected, we clearly see the power of it in action, everything builds the film is strong thanks to the plot and story very well developed, is the chance to see an unprecedented krypton before and feel that this movie shows is that it is the most expensive film ever made, but the film is amazing and not only fans of the character will enjoy but everyone who sees this amazing movie!.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I have to say that I greatly enjoyed myself with this film. An interesting twist on what is normally done with the story. Without giving away too much, what I'll say is this...I think someone has to go into this without thoughts of what can be found in the comics and previous movies/shows. Without these preconceived notions on what the story SHOULD be, one can greatly enjoy this rendition of the story of the babe from Krypton. Yes, I do agree that there are parts that the major fan-boys will cry out in disgust because it doesn't follow canon. But take it for what it is. A new telling of a classic tale. Bring your young children that do not know much about Superman and the young child within you and enjoy one of the greatest tellings of this story.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't hate Snyder and David but if you are going to create a film franchise, make sure the opening dish is great. The film lacks what made Nolan's Batman Trilogy a success: a sense of depth and thematic elements. Its straightforward and bloated presentation kind of ruined all the wasted potential this film could offer. The third act of the film is filled with nothing but loud noises, one liners, yet impressive set pieces and visual effects. Snyder is known for his style and I like that. However, after leaving the theater, I never bother to think about the film that much. Unlike The Dark Knight, where I spent days thinking about how good and deep the film affects me. I think we all got fooled on how they keep mentioning Nolan's involvement in this film. The reason on why Iron Man films were a great success was because of its humor, and X-men is the thematic elements it carries. I hate to compare this film to other comic book films but how can a film be successful if it doesn't stand out among the rests. I think the greatest thing about this film is its musical score. Some may disagree with me but I think Zimmer did a brilliant job, even succeeding John Williams if I may say so.Conclusion: It's a good film but I wanted more. Maybe Nolan should have directed it himself.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Well this origin story begins as a Superbly Magnificent retelling of one of the most recognisable fictional figures on the planet today. Man of Steel remains consistently loyal to its title, showcasing Clark Kent's perceived misplacement into a world unknown to his abilities, introducing Kal-El as the lost part of this misunderstood Man, who finally Steels the show once a threat to Earth results in his acceptance of his freedom to do right, and become the shining beacon of hope for mankind: Superman.With Henry Cavill as our nearest, powerful star, and a near unfathomably remarkably talented and irreplaceable cast to play the supporting characters orbiting him constantly, Man of Steel is nothing but awesome to watch from just an acting and characterisation aspect alone. Director Zach Snyder, Writer David S. Goyer and Producer Christopher Nolan, along with the perfect casting of Cavill, all manage to converge the three parts of the protagonist's identity (Clark Kent, Kal-El and Superman) with such delicacy and flawless excellence that makes the titular character, the Man of Steel himself, the highlight in this comic book film. Narrative, visual effects, music and everything else aside, Man of Steel is carried through galaxies because of its tremendously executed character study that cements itself firmly into the realms of other great superhero films including Spider-Man (2002) and Batman Begins (2005). Of course, the existence of a star is meaningless if the satellites orbiting it are not naturally flourishing with life, but oh Man do the supporting characters make gazing upon on screen stars a privilege to be a cinemagoer. Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Antje Traue and Michael Shannon among others, certainly collaborate as their own glowing constellation, and you cannot help but gape in enjoyment, and in doing so you might attain heat vision with how intensely enchanting the actors are.Structurally, Man of Steel adopts a fairly unique craft in presenting Clark Kent's craving for a legitimate identity, with flashbacks to expose the routes of his anguish set upon him by his paternal father Jonathon Kent (Costner). These scenes are surprisingly amongst the greatest that the film offers, with Superb character development and emotional depth that has yet to be reached by any other comic book adaptation other than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. As someone not at all fond of the Superman character before seeing Man of Steel, I was captivated by Snyder's and the cast's ability to provoke such emotion from what I thought would only be an action film, though I could not have been more incorrect, as it is so much more.The main narrative is by no means unique. Primary villain General Zod of the Kryptonian race, attempts to carry out plans we have seen a number of times before, but his motivation behind this is extremely convincingly elaborated and explored through Shannon's portrayal. Though at times slightly overshadowed by his sidekick Faora (Antje Traue), Shannon is worthy of the title General as it is in his DNA to be so. This is what sets him apart from Cavill's iconic character. Superman's DNA enables the freedom to decide what is right and wrong, but is primarily nurtured by the presence of biological father Jor-El (Crowe) and both Kent parents.There are honestly too many features to applaud throughout Man of Steel. The film is undoubtedly a masterful work of filmmaking in its aesthetically astounding set-pieces, which while very much overloaded into Man of Steel, are still appropriately contained by the visual prowess of Zach Snyder and the special effects team. Additionally, Hans Zimmer yet again delivers his trademark composition; that trademark being majestic excellence that is simply a pleasure to listen to, with or without the Super images to accompany it on screen. There is almost no escaping the beautiful visuals and sounds that make up this 144 minute feature, not that you would want to miss a second. Watching Man of Steel, you feel like Superman taking his first flight, taking in the incredible sights with an enormous grin of delight in spite of the fright that the experience might not have reached the height of your expectations. Well right from lift off, Man of Steel is a truly thrilling and enjoyable cinematic experience, frame by frame, scene by scene, act to act, Man of Steel is immensely wonderful until you feet get back on the ground and the last credit scrolls out of you vision.Even though towards the film's conclusion, the title Men of Steel feels more appropriate as seemingly unwanted characters begin to overshadow General Zod and the Man of the hour (well two hours, twenty-four minutes), indeed, Superman Returns (pun intended) and the on screen revival of the character comes to a most satisfactory end. This is a thankful return, as without the core character to standout amongst the features that orbit him, Man of Steel would not have been the phenomenal film that it is. You could pause Man of Steel at almost any moment and witness sensational cinematography. You could close your eyes and just listen to genius Hans Zimmer composition. You could even just walk into the theatre midway through the screening and avoid the character development, and appreciate the jaw-dropping action sequences. Doing any of these would result in substantial enjoyment I can almost assure, but you would also most likely miss out on the Man, who is actually quite Super even without the cape.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Three times ideally for the non-Sci Fi enthusiasts.I have two friends who weren't keen the first time round, but after convincing them to come see it again, they absolutely loved it, LOVED it and actually wanted to go see it again. They saw loads of things they didn't the first round. The movie flowed better for them as they could concentrate on the things they missed, which in turn helped tie the movie together into one awesome package they just didn't see before.Half the critic reviews I read clearly come from people who really didn't get what was going on, like there mind was just frazzled by non-stop action.I can only say this - to all the critics who hated on it, go see it again, I implore you.﻿ And open your bloody mind this time.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder seriously made Superman into a realistic superhero in this contemporary world.Speaking of which, me and a friend of mine saw the midnight premier showing of Man of steel.The film contains the story that is loosely based on the Superman comic books but, the film shows some differences that is not related to the comic books.The picture is very well casted with major actors and actresses like: Henry Cavil, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Larry Fishbourne, Michael Shannon, Ayelet Zuere and Richard Schiff.Man of Steel tells the story of a newborn baby named Kal-El, who is transported on a small spaceship by his parents Jor-El (Russell Crowe) & Lara Lo Van (Ayelet Zuere) from the dying planet of Krypton to Earth.After the small spaceship landed in a Kansas small town called Smallville, Kal-El is found by a two farmer couple Jon (Kevin Costner) & Martha Kent (Diane Lane) and they both adopt him as his parents.They of course named him Clark Kent. About 10 or 11 years later, Clark discovered that he has unusual unique powers and he feels that he is not from Earth.Then about 20 or 22 years later, he finally discovered that he is an extra terrestrial from the planet Krypton. Then, Earth is being threatened by a group of humanoid e.t. criminals that is led by General Zod (Michael Shannon).They are also from Krypton and have the same powers as Kal-El.So, Clark Kent becomes a hero named Superman and he uses his powers to save Earth.Amy Adams portrays a journalist named Louis Lane, who works for The Daily Planet newspaper company in the fictional city of Metropolis.Louis Lane is actually fascinated of Superman's powers and home planet.Larry Fishbourne portrays Perry White, who is the editor in chief of The Daily Planet and boss of Louis Lane.Richard Schiff portrays Dr.Emil Hamlton. The cause of Zack Snyder making Superman into a realistic superhero is the way that Henry Cavil looks like Superman due to his hair and muscles.Another reason that made Superman look realistic is the costume of his.Speaking of costumes, the costume design of the film looks very realistic.Zack Snyder's film direction of the costume design made it look realistic.Hans Zimmer's film score in the whole movie and the action scenes made the film entertaining.The film score has the same great quality as The Dark Knight Trilogy because the loud sounds of the epic film score is played during the action scenes of those films.The special effects of the film was stunning.The cause of this was the way that the special effects looks very detailed.One of the CGI special effects is the metallic liquid that is shown in one of the computers in Krypton.I find the cinematography to be enjoyable.Every time when the film camera follows Superman flying, it makes the cinematography enjoyable.Zack picked the perfect cast for this film.The thing that makes the cast perfect is the acting of their characters.The whole 143 minutes of the film is overall awesome due to Zack Snyder's whole direction of the film.I highly recommend that movie for comic book fans and people who want to see the movie in the movie theaters. I give the film 3 out of 4 stars.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I've always felt that Superman had one of the more tragic of backgrounds and the more uplifting and happier stories never felt genuine. Richard Roeper's criticism that ""There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story"" or Rafer Guzman's criticism that ""this reboot skimps on fun and romance"" shows just how many critics missed the point. This isn't a kid's story, period! Leave all of those childish and whimsical expectations at home. In my opinion, this grittier version really hit home and took the drama and intensity to whole new levels. While it failed to deliver on the level of the some of the Avengers: Phase One films and definitely wasn't on the level with any of the movies from the Dark Knight Trilogy, it was still a great movie. The acting was really good, especially from Amy Adams in her supporting role. She managed to turn a character without a lot of development into one with a surprising amount of depth and believability. And Henry Cavill was great as Superman/Kal-El, probably my favorite yet. The supporting roles by Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and so on were all also fantastic. I don't think I can remember a movie where all of the supporting roles were played by people more famous than the protagonist but that was the case here and it worked because of Cavill's performance and how the movie was laid out. The action sequences were great, as was to be expected, and the way the plot developed was not annoying as most critics claimed. Many felt like the constant back-and-forth hurt the film's progression but I actually quite liked it. It kept the two and a half hour movie from dragging and felt fresh. The one flaw that I felt actually took a bit away from the movie, however, was the shaky-camera cinematic effect. I'm sorry but this isn't a world where the audience is going to feel the ""we're there"" and in the actual scene itself. All that did was make you wish it wasn't there. Overall though, this was a great movie and while I've never been a big fan of the Superman lore, if you can remove bias and suspend quite a bit of disbelief I think most would really enjoy it.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The scenes were scattered and cut certain interesting aspects about his life too short. It would have been interesting to see what happened when he landed on Earth and see more of the story about his life growing up. There were some nice scenes in the beginning where the style of filming really captured the atmosphere of the various places he was in- the clothes on the clothesline, raindrops in a bucket, hitchhiking on a mountain road. But those nice scenes that were seen in the trailer kind of gave me a false impression and ended up being very little of the actual movie. I had seen trailers and interviews about how they were trying to make this movie more ""real"" and that it was meant to have a very human aspect which should have been more about his life experience on Earth and his loneliness and the way he felt about being so different and not knowing where he came from, but you could tell that what the makers of this film really wanted was just to hurry up and get to the action. I expected a certain amount of impressive action scenes, but expected it to then go back to an interesting storyline. Instead, they basically dragged out the destruction of buildings through the rest of the movie with a few scenes of dialogue here and there. I think it had potential to be more of an interesting science fiction story with a human touch but I guess the people who love to see buildings blow up will not be disappointed.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was delighted to find it well written. It makes the Bryan Singer version and the Donner produced versions seem comic bookey and disorganized by comparison. Examples:It makes more sense Lois knows both identities at the start than any other way to set things up, more tension this way. Jonathan Kent is written out (dies) with purpose and usefulness. Keeping the mother alive makes good sense; tho, it strongly reminds me of Spiderman. Pete Ross is a good option for later. In all the movies Kryptonite was never more than a cheap negative deux ex machina. Good riddance unless it can be tied into a believable character arc with permanent consequences. The ""S"" for hope is brilliant as others have noted. The Zod story is recycled in large part to reveal--showing not telling--Supe's origins, cultural background on Krypton (new and sensible). The limits of Supe's invulnerability are handled sensibly and not over-defined either way. He has a beard in parts, so scissors are not breaking to cut his hair as occurred in the Mort Weisinger era of the comics, if I recall correctly. So overall, this is a far better, more coherent, more engagingly written Superman than any prior on-screen version. I have not kept up with Supe in the comics the last 20 years. Is any comic version as, or more, coherent than than this latest movie version?One critic said he felt the movie was an advertisement for itself and emphasized the ""product"" nature of the project. I did not have this impression, tho I have with many movies, such as Transformers 2. I felt this was a very serious attempt to modulate a series-starting franchise. It parallels similar seriousness applied to Harry Potter #1. This makes pretty good logical sense given the relatively poor reception Green Lantern received. I liked the GL movie very much too. It made its money back plus extra, but this Supe movie is much more serious effort at a quality script. If you don't make an all-out quality effort in scripting Superman, who do you make a quality effort for?","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

What this film lacks is heart and story line. I just don't get how people can really enjoy this film? I was bored half way through.

Some parts were good but most were not. I'm sure once the average joe watches this film and reviews this film we will get a fair average review.

The first two Christopher Reeve movies were far superior and enjoyable. In fact the George Reeves TV show was more enjoyable that I watched as a kid. In an apparent quest to make Superman darker (and I noticed Christopher Nolan's name somewhere in the credits)all this film really did was to make the character soulless and completely without humour or any real personality. Whether that's the fault of the director or actor or scriptwriter or anything else I don't know but I really didn't care one way or another about the Superman character. In fact I was rather sorry that the great Michael Shannon (so good in TV's Boardwalk Empire) as General Zod suddenly and inexplicably met his demise. Or perhaps it was explained, but I was too confused by all the special effect to really care at this stage. I thought the first hour was boring and too wordy with wooden acting, especially by Russell Crowe who is normally much better than this, and was pleased when some action started which at least kept me from falling asleep in my armchair. I thought the script was full of holes and disjointed (or the editing was) and too childish for a film that was trying to act more grown up. Either it's an adult film like Batman or it's a kid's film, a clear demarcation should be made but it wasn't to me. On the plus side, there's a very minor part but wonderfully acted piece by Kevin Costner as Superman's Earth dad, the only semblance of humanity in the movie. Amy Adams is always a big draw for me as I love her, but this was a minor hiccup in her career. If only she'd got American Hustle first, she might not have bothered. I must say I did like the German actress, Antje Traue as Zod's sidekick who I have never seen before, she kept me watching. As for all the people who would have died through Superman's pursuit of Zod, smashing through buildings etc, well I thought Superman was supposed to care about people. Not in this movie! They would have needed a big graveyard at the end of this fiasco.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is incredible! Finally, a great Superman movie! There has never been an actual good live-action Superman movie until now. If you liked those old Christopher Reeve movies or Superman Returns, then I'm sorry, but you know nothing about Superman. In all the Comics and cartoon, Superman always had very Sci-Fi stuff involved with a lot taking place on other planets with different technology and had a lot of action and destruction. None of this awesomeness happened in those older movies. Instead, a bunch of stupid crap happened, like Superman flying around the world to turn back time and him sleeping with Lois, which he would never do. The series should've been rebooted a long time ago, and finally it has been. This movie is just as good of a reboot as, if not better than, Batman Begins, The Incredible Hulk, and The Amazing Spider-Man. This is the first time I actually felt like Superman in a live-action movie was actually super and awesome and actually had a threat that was worthy of him. And this movie had one of the most exciting and shockingly fantastic climaxes to a movie ever.

It's good, it's exciting, it's a wonderful start on a very promising story to be developed (undoubtedly) in other sequels and I loved it! Highly recommended!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I have yet to see a Superman movie that I liked, and I was sure that if anyone could do it just right, then it would be Nolan. He absolutely ""got"" what is cool about Batman, so surely he could see what's cool about Superman and make the best Superman movie ever, right? Unfortunately, it turns out that the ""new take"" on Superman is by approaching it as a ""first contact"" film, about aliens invading from outer space. What a let down. Superman's alien heritage is the least interesting, the silliest, and the most dispensable aspect of his character. While Batman's back-story adds something absolutely vital to his character, Superman's does not do the same for him. Perhaps it might seem to help to give him motivation to help puny earthlings or to give him complexity as an outsider, but actually, these aspects of the character would be there even without the alien back-story simply because a guy who is really really strong and flies and shoots lasers from his eyes is already different and in a position of power over everyone else. He would be in the same position character-wise if he was created through genetic engineering, through nuclear radiation, through an act of God, or anything else. Who cares where he came from? What's interesting about him is here is a guy who is so average and boring, but secretly can do things that make him almost God-like. How cool is that? Think of the people he could save, the bad things he could stop, all while pretending to be Joe Average. What fun you could have with this concept if handled right, and with today's special effects technology! (And by the way, ""fun"" does not mean ""camp"". The Bourne films are fun, Mission Impossible films are fun, even parts of Nolan's Batman trilogy are fun, because Nolan has some real fun with some of the interesting aspects of characters and ideas). Unfortunately, this film shows none of the interesting aspects of Superman/Kent's character and just makes it a sort of Star Trek-type film (nothing wrong with Star Trek, but I already saw that last year. Where's my Superman film?). And it is boring to boot. Strangely, even though the film is really overlong at 2.5 hours, everything that happens in it is shown in the 2 minute trailer, so there are no surprises or intriguing developments. After Superman Returns, I had thought that the filmmakers would really try to avoid anything that moved the film into that sort of territory, but the experience of watching Man of Steel gives you the exact same sinking feeling as you got watching Superman Returns. It's hard to believe that someone screwed up Superman AGAIN, but they did. Snyder, Nolan, and Goyer really dropped the ball here.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Directing the movie is Zack Snyder, who is known for directing Watchmen, 300, and Sucker Punch. Producing the movie is the director of Insomnia, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises.With the perfect cast, plus, the director of Watchmen, plus, the director of the Dark Knight trilogy, this movie has got to be good. And sure enough, it did not disappoint. In fact, it is the best movie of the year, so far. Hans Zimmer, who composed the music for the Dark Knight trilogy, and the Lion King composed the music for this movie as well, which made me pretty confident that the music would be pretty good. And it was.This movie was getting chewed on by the critics, which made me lose just a little bit confidence for this movie. But the 7.8 rating on IMDb brought all of that confidence back. I read the critic reviews and they hated the movie, which doesn't make a lot sense because they loved Superman Returns, which is an awful movie.But on with the review. The movie starts off on the planet Krypton, and Krypton is basically falling apart. So Kal-El aka Superman is launched from Krypton to Earth. The rocket that launched Kal-El drops into Earth. The rocket lands and Diane Lane and Kevin Costner find Kal-El inside (as a baby). They raise him as though he is just a normal human.Russell Crowe was Kal-El's biological father. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon were enemies, so Michael Shannon goes to Earth to try to find Kal-El. Kal-El finds out who he is and where he came from, and in the process, becomes Superman (Henry Cavill). Michael Shannon comes to Earth and demands Kal-El/Superman to surrender, but Superman has other plans.Man of Steel is the perfect summer movie. I would recommend it to Superman/superhero fans, or just anybody looking for a good movie to see this summer. If you have children, you can bring them along, too. Henry Cavill gives a great performance as Superman. I was pleased that this movie wasn't all slow motion, just like every other Zack Snyder movie. Everybody looking for a good movie should definitely go see this!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Now throughout the movie it keeps reiterating the point that earths atmosphere is allowing him to be more powerful etc and that krypton had harsher air and so what.... but then suddenly he can fly throughout space breathing in NO air and shoot laser beams out his eyes. Now i know in the old ones he can do is and so what but they go through the whole hassle of explaining how he naturally occurs hes powers and so what. Seemed like they got tired of explaining.Also seems like it doesn't take long for the ""baddies"" to adjust to earths atmosphere and it takes superman bloody ages. And personally if he was on krypton he only a year at BEST of his life, i would of thought hes body would settle down to earths atmosphere.

I never saw so many ugly noses so pointed out by lights and camera angles, without intention, I mean. Besides this, any moment I expected this Steve-Carell-Superman to do something funny. I suppose it is because of his small jaw. He has the muscles, but the face is just not Superhero material. He certainly looks funny in some of the rare quiet moments. But then he never did do anything funny and that made it some kind of disappointing. Anyway, the effects are well made, but thats about all that I can say about this movie. It is just a big waste of opportunity to tell a story which for once would contain more then just the usual bashing and exploding. It is beyond me why they produce a new take about Superman again and again and each time just do it worse.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This installment stars Henry Cavill in the title role and Amy Adams as his love interest Lois Lane. The movie goes back over Superman's origins as he was sent to Earth by his parents and his coming to terms with his destiny as a savior of mankind here. The film also stars Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne. It was directed by Zack Snyder, produced by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer. The movie is action packed and visually spectacular but it's also lacking in the emotional depth department. An entertaining blockbuster but definitely not without it's flaws.The film begins with war breaking out on the planet Krypton as Jor-El (Russel Crowe) and his wife Lora Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) send their newborn son, Kal-El, away to safety on Earth (shortly before the planet explodes). Traitors General Zod (Shannon), Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) and their followers are also imprisoned and sent away, shortly before Krypton's destruction as well. The movie flashes forward to Kal-El (Cavill) as a young man (in his 30s) traveling from town to town working at various jobs while dealing with his past (through flashbacks) and future destiny as a hero of this planet. The safety of all of mankind is threatened when General Zod locates him on Earth and starts a war here in an attempt to make Earth their new home.The film is full of breathtaking visuals and highlighted with a beautiful score by Hans Zimmer. Scene by scene I found it to be a very satisfying and fun movie (almost everything you could ask for in a Superman film) but looking at it as a whole film it just doesn't quite seem like a complete movie. Lois Lane is never fully developed and her relationship with Kal-El/Clark Kent is never completely flushed out. The supporting actors are all decent in the film and Cavill is the perfect Superman (despite his lacking in acting abilities). The filmmakers did away with the nerdy glasses wearing Clark Kent alter ego in this film (seeing as that was one of the most ridiculous parts of the character's mythology; the idea that people don't recognize him because he puts on glasses and acts like a bumbling dork). A lot of the magic and awe are gone from this film adaptation as well as it centers a lot more on the action (there's almost too much action as it does become a little boring at times). David S. Goyer's script is probably the weakest part of the film as Snyder's directing is once again amazing to watch. While I don't think it's as good as the original 'SUPERMAN' film or the Bryan Singer sequel 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' I still did enjoy it quite a bit despite it's flaws. It's not a perfect film but it is a satisfying action blockbuster all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They won't let this film alone and compare it endlessly to the Christopher Reeve's Superman directed by Richard Donner, well news flash the director loved it, he gave an interview in 2011 and advised Zack Snyder regarding the film ""I look to them to show me something NEW and something DIFFERENT"", and if Christopher Reeve's was alive to see it he would have loved it why? He disliked the lack of progression in the superman, he always played the bubbling fool. He gave an interview about it,Christopher Reeve:""...I felt that after two films with bumping into the doors, by now I should know where the doors are -uhm and the elevators and the -eh street crossing [...] I played it like the ultimate migraine headache, you know this his demon within him and the demon within him is the good Clark Kent who is like the albatross around his neck you know this guy who limits in this guy this this fool that he has to act these glasses this thing and for Clark Kent Superman is the demon within him.""In this film, we get to explore all those elements of the real Clark Kent and the real Superman, it seems most people that hate this film have never lifted a comic book to read how can they, they're too lazy, to do anything called understanding this is the superman we would get if he ever came to this planet.All in all, the entire team did a fantastic job at bringing this iconic, beloved character to life and treated him with the utmost respect.This is our Superman, our Man of Steel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I feel i need to defend the movie because i loved it soo much. for every point they have stated i, as a huge Superman fan have a counterpoint. There was certainly a lot of action but that added to the experience! that is what Superman is! There was soo much destruction because Superman is soo powerful its almost impossible not to destroy things when he can punch people to space. Add a plethora of more Kryptonians who are hell bent on destroying everything and you obviously are gonna have trouble and destruction. I thought the flashbacks were a neat touch and i liked the new suit. As far as character development i understand there wasn't a whole lot but this movie was about Superman and his origins and first experiences as Superman, not about his relationship with Lois or the other employees at the Daily Planet. I can guarantee you the next film will have more development because Kal-El will have been on Earth more and met people from Metropolis and built relationships. The film isn't as lighthearted as previous films because he has not gotten used to his identity and responsibilities plus this is a new and more realistic take (i loved how much he was enjoying himself when he was first learning to fly! Like who wouldn't be smiling their butt off??). Last critics need to stop comparing this to the old films and TV shows. There is a reason it is called a reboot and this is a new adaptation! It is also very true to comic book lore (see Birthright -Mark Waid, very similar). I personally think this is the best superhero movie made so far and it does justice to the Man Of Tomorrow.! 10/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This, combined with the discovery of alien technology under the ice, could have made for an ""X-Files"" type of movie. However, the risk is that this would bore many fans, so we get into the action pretty swiftly.The Director's urge to ""get on with the action"" does mean that the plot feels a bit rushed. We trot through the sub-plot of an alien superman living amongst us, without really focusing on how the world would really react, so that we can get to the main theme of the movie, which is General Zod vs Superman with humanity enduring all the collateral damage.Personally, I found the almost Gothic design of the Kryptonian armour and vessels to be rather reminiscent of the ""Necromongers"" from ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". This is not a problem, however, and is a nice change from the ""ice crystal"" Superman technology of old.All that said, there is one huge problem with the movie in particular: the cinematography.The cinematic cliché of using a hand-held ""shaky-cam"" technique, together with fast pan & zoom and quick cut editing in action sequences has been done to death. Not only that but when it's overused, it turns the movie into a blurred, nausea-inducing mess.And that's the problem here. Almost incessant queasy-cam techniques, fast two-stage zooms, rapid pan...all with the CGI ""light bloom"" dial cranked over to 11. I quite literally had a dull headache by the end of the movie.We saw this in the cinema and we were unanimous in our opinion that the queasy-cam and pan-blur made the film almost unwatchable. Perhaps it was made worse by the projection (as projections on screens tend to exacerbate pan-blur) and a good Blu-Ray print would be better? Anyway, the overall premise is good and it's definitely one of the better Superman movies. However, the occasionally mediocre acting and, in particular, the disorientating overuse of queasy-cam ruined the movie for us.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

But, do you really know Superman? Director, Zack Snyder put his best foot forward in capturing the man that wears the red velvet cape in his 2013 rendition, Man of Steel. Starring Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/ Kel-El and Michael Shannon as Master of Destruction, the Fallen Angel of Planet Krypton, General Zod. Snyder takes his audience on a 2 hour and 23 minute journey into bridging the gap between Planet Krypton and Planet Earth.Historical Context of the Man with the Red Cape 101:Superman originated in 19th century by German Philosopher, Frederich Nietzsche. Nietzsche's interpretation of this superhuman we know as Superman was translated from the German word Ubermenslch meaning over-man or beyond-man. In creating Ubermenslch, Nietzsche's philosophical vision is to create an ideal man of integrity who would rise above evil and represent the good in human evolution.It's not until the 20th century (1938 to be exact) that the first Superman comic strip is published. DC Comics takes a chance on Superman and fights for it's creativity in its entirety. DC Comics takes no prisoners when filing lawsuit after lawsuit to maintain and own Superman's rights. And, in 1950 Superman joins Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lateran, Captain America, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Captain Marvel, Robin, and The Flash in the superhero populous. Finally, in 1978 the first Superman film directed by Richard Donner reaches the big screen.Superman's Powers:It is throughout Superman's existence that the audience learns full force just exactly what Superman's powers are: (1) Living Solar Battery, which is the ability to metabolize solar energy from stars such as Earth's sun; (2) Superhuman Strength; (3) Invulnerability (immune to all forms of harm including extreme force and excruciating temperatures); (4) Healing Factor; (5) Flight Capability; (6) Superhuman Speed; (7) X- ray Vision; (8) Superhuman Intelligence; (9) Eidetic Memory; (10) Heat Vision; (11) Superhuman Breath; (12) Superhuman Healing; (13) Superhuman Vision; (14) Superhuman Hearing; (15) Master CombatZack Snyder's Man of Steel:Regardless if you're a believer of creation, evolution, or that humans exists by the pure implication of technological advancements of aliens, Man of Steel, should be right up your alley because there is a little bit of everything for everyone. Snyder does Superman justice in his visionary of re-creating a masterpiece with a loaded cast. Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Christopher Meloni and Kevin Costner are few of the A-Lister's that appear in this film.Snyder fairs well with capturing his audience's attention from the birth of Kel-El, his birth right on Planet Krypton through his transcendence to Clark Kent on Planet Earth while transforming into Superman as a vigilante whom wins the respect of the militia and Lois Lane, an award- winning journalist for the Daily Planet.The underlying message in Man of Steel lies through the symbolism of the letter S branded on the chests of scientist, Jor-El the biological father of Clark Kent/ Kel-El. The letter S from Planet Krypton is representation of Hope. There is hope for change. Hope for two universes working together as one. A hope that one day that this solar power escalate will in fact become a reality in creating something extraordinary.Jor-El is not only a scientific genius, but a man of wisdom as he tells Kel that he must, ""keep testing his limits for strength."" It is necessary for him to understand what it is like to be human in order to bridge the gap between two universes. This lesson is a lesson that humanity can resonate with. For instance, life is messy so it is essential that we humans look inside ourselves and discover the true essence of mental, emotional, and physical strength in order to conquer whatever DEMON ails us at the time.Kudos to Snyder for his clarity in conveying an important message of superhero strength and superiority. However, Man of Steel could eliminate at least 10 to 15 minutes of the KABOOM factor. I lost count of how many battles Superman had with General Zod before the Dark Angel met his death and Planet Earth is saved by a vigilante whom is ubiquitous and can be compared to James Bond in saving a damsel in distress.Man of Steel is quite entertaining in grasping the enormous amounts of information about the have's and have-not's of Superman. To be able to capture one man's journey in a historical context from birth to his manhood in a feature length screenplay is commendable. The epic battles of destruction isn't necessary in telling a story of strength and superiority. As with the majority superhero clichés there lies a love story. However, one of Superman's weaknesses is his dire love for Lois Lane considering he is always rescuing her from everyday reporting hazards for the Daily Planet. Perhaps a journalists quandary, one in which viewers experience with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher in the (1993- 1997) television series, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was young and hadn't seen Superman on the big screen in years. Even then I was disappointed. This was a Superman movie, but it didn't feel like one.The problems start right away. I'm fine with retooling the mythos, but the movie just spends too much time on Krypton. The drama there is minimally interesting and when I watch it I just want to skip it.Then we get Superman's childhood on Earth through flashbacks, which I guess is fine, but we don't really get a lot of insight into his character. The things we do get to see only give us the bare minimum in terms of development.The acting is all around pretty good. I think Henry Cavill is good, I think Amy Adams is good - everyone's good, but no one stands out. It's shot professionally, but everything is so desaturated and dark that it just makes everything feel gloomy.The action might be the biggest problem here. With the technology available today, a Superman movie where he fights against other Kryptonians should, at the very least, have some entertaining fights. These action scenes are just plain boring. Each one is almost exactly the same: Superman and another Kryptonian throw each other into buildings and punch each other in the air. It gets old really fast. Sadly, action makes up the entire second half of this movie.Maybe this is the natural answer to people's dislike of Superman Returns (which I actually like, but I know I'm in the minority on that one). People wanted more action. They got it, but it came at the cost of just about everything else. And every subsequent Zack Snyder superhero movie has had the same dull, boring, bloated feeling. This really was the start of the downfall.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

Its a masterpiece, way better than The Avengers...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814273/?ref_=tt_urv","leedirectsmusicvideos","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31429861/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","Wow, I am still mind blown from this movie. Its a true masterpiece. Zack Snyder is the only film director that can truly make a perfect Superman film. Lets get down to the review now shall we? There is nothing bad about this film, there were no flaws at all. This film had such a strong story, it relied on what made The Batman trilogy so successful and that was to create a realistic and grounded superhero film. This script was amazing, it is rare to watch a super hero film and believe in it, and feel like you were there, or could witness such a thing. This super hero film was very realistic, they did a great job at portraying of what it would actually be like if Superman did make himself known on earth. You get to see Superman as a person, not as a fictional comic book character. Henry Cavill is the most perfect person to play Superman it was like that it was his destiny to portray him. The acting from everyone in this film is superb. Michael Shannon did an excellent job portraying Zod, because you don't view him as an arch villain, but as someone willing to do whatever it takes to save his race and planet. The cinematography was so artistic. This owned The Avengers, the story was so much better,etc. I feel like the Avengers was the most over rated movie to come out last year. It was unrealistic, very weak story, and it just all around sucked compared to Man Of Steel. I just thought that this film was shot so well, Zack Snyder is such an amazing visual artist. The imagery and visual effects used in this film was so powerful. Not once did I feel like that hokey CGI was being used in this film. This has either become my favorite movie of 2013 or its second to Oblivion. I just thought that this is the way you create a superhero film, something thats truly believable and realistic. This was so well done, I just don't see how anyone could hate on this film. If you hate this film then you are an idiot. Russel Crowe was awesome like always, every actor did a great job in this film. The special effects were so great, it was so much better than seeing a lame incredible hulk in CGI. The lighting, set design, art direction, the music, the editing, the cinematography, and pretty much everything about this film was magnificent. I am so glad that they finally got a director and creative team to finally get a Superman film right. This is just such a flawless film, I don't respect anyone who would hate on this. I could go on and on about this film, but you need to go out and experience it for yourself. Get off your butt, and go see this now! Lets get this more box office than The Avengers did! Trust me when you see this you will be like who cares about The Avengers anymore. SERIOUSLY GO SEE THIS NOW AND LET US MAKE THIS FILM A NEW BOX OFFICE RECORD! I want Justice League, if you want that to happen we need to all go see this and get a high box office!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

They also relied too heavily on flashbacks and more flashbacks.Antje Traue as Faora-Ul had a nice evil look.I would like to tell you that there are interesting DVD extras.

But it is a bit messy too; however my expectation might be higher a lot!!!! Zack Snyder seemed floppy in his path of direction which might get his less concentration than casting dark action effects. Screenplay could not satisfy me also despite a fantastic modern reboot story. I am admittingly disappointed for such loops!!! Coherence and 3D output had also aches___Henry Cavill passed darn well as a macho Man of Steel and made good countenance in some places. His struggle against his insurmountable alienation in the society gripped realistic approach to portray. Amy Adams was not given much slots to act!!! She should be used profoundly in the film. Russell Crowe gave extreme charm as Jor-El in the beginning to heave the hype to top. Planet Krypton's framework was so angelic in view!!! It was visually blissful and whimsical. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, as Kent couple, rendered emotional touch in the character development of young Kent. Michael Shannon as General Zod was superb in his clash with Superman. But his villainy was perfectly justified for his desperation and cruelty to save his own race, Kryptonians. This part of the script enthralled me :)) Zod's sidekick Faora-Ul also showed amusing aggression towards Superman :p___The action sequences absorbed tantalizing pace to stun my eyes. Supersonic battle of mights between Superman and Cryptonians was as ferocious as spectacular. For sci-fi action flick lovers, it is an obvious recommendation. Moreover, Hans Zimmer did not frustrate as usual. His musical score enhanced steering the thrill :)))___","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is a new fresh take on the character. It is fresh and bold and from the onset you must jettison most of your preconceived notions about the Last Son of Krypton. This is Kal El as we have never seen him before.This film takes our hero and drops him into a world where being different and powerful doesn't make you idolized and worshiped but makes you tragic and alone. Clarke's youth isn't shown as a nice slice of sweet apple pie Americana but as time of uncertainty and anguish about who he really is and why he is here. And that is where some of the films major strength's come to the forefront. It's a film that deals with fear. Whether it's Pa Kent's growing apprehension about his son's growing powers or Ma Kent's worry that someone somewhere is going to take her son away. But also hope. Jor El's belief that Kal will save his people and that he will grow become something more and save the human race. This central themes are helped by some stellar acting. Cavill embodies Clarke's growing acceptance of his destiny wide both wide eyed wonder and an aching vulnerability. Costner excels in his role as Pa Kent playing against tradition with his reluctance to exposing his son to the world. Also playing against tradition is Crowe's Jor El now a more hands on and determined figure than previously portrayed. Adam's brings Louis to life and in my opinion finally shows the character as being a capable strong rather than a damsel in distress. And every hero needs a strong villain and that's what we are given Shannon's Zod is worthy adversary for the Man of Steel. His single minded determination to protect his peoples heritage makes him both sympathetic and threatening. The stand out is Antje Traue's Faora who's beauty is matched by her sheer brutality in combat.And with that we come to the action. Some reviews have been critical of the amount of action in the movie. Which can be a valid point but here the carnage is shot so beautifully and staged so perfectly it's just a joy to watch. Snyder has finally captured on screen the visual impact of two gods fighting for the fate of the world. Punches are thrown to thunderous booms as entire stretches of the city are laid waste in gloriously executed mayhem. Finally we see Superman's power in a way that we have never seen before.Despite statements to the contrary there is humor in the film but spread out unlike other superhero films which incorporate the comedy element more overtly. But these moments do not, unlike the rapid fire quips of the Avengers, undermine the tension of the battles or the films central conflict. There are flaws in the film. The flashback structure of the beginning of the film can be jarring at times and one action sequence in particular could have been toned back in my opinion but these are minor quibbles that don't take too much away from the overall quality of the film.This is the Superman we have been waiting for and the creative team behind it has delivered in spades. Superman on his own has in my opinion defeated the Avengers juggernaut in one fell swoop.In my opinion one half of the World's Finest betters all of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.Go out and decide for yourself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have not seen the '78 version of Superman but Henry Cavill has nailed the character of Clark Kent/Kal-EI. This is truly Zack Snyder's best movie by far. At no point did the story seemed dragged. Just remember this is the origin story of the supposed trilogy so the ground work has been laid for a sequel to follow, whether it's going to be Justice League or not.. I am not sure. The first half provides viewers about Kal-EI's true origin starting from prologue of Krypton's dying mythology to his upbringing by the Kent's on Earth. Kevin Costner has really provided the humane essence that was essential. Amy Adams was good as Louis Lane, her character got enough screen timing rather than what others have complained being just damsel in distress. Finally Michael Shannon as Zod has been good but there was opportunity for him to shine knowing his stature of being a terrific actor; watch out for his side-kick Antje Traue who played Faora-Ul, she was simply awesome. As goes for action what would you expect from Snyder, it was nothing short of spectacular. My final Verdict: do not miss this at theater. This movie truly deserves the praise it received from the audience. Just go & watch it...this is how a Superman movie should be like.Note: One small advice there is nothing great to watch this in 3D as the transition from 2D to 3D was minimal.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill does a fantastic job portraying a very somber, conflicted, and likable Superman. The writers traded the stereotypical ""truth and honor"" and very American Superman for a more realistic one, which allows the filmmakers to richly explore the idea that this somewhat invincible hero is very conflicted in his morals and emotions. Although some say too somber, I think Cavill brought out the Superman charm a couple of times throughout the film, making it less of a staple to the character and more of a genuine action. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe deliver lights out performances as well as this man's two fathers. Costner provides a Pa Kent that is just as conflicted about his son and his son is. Lois Lane and General Zod, although somewhat flawed in their character development, are both portrayed fantastically by the very talented Amy Adams and Michael Shannon (whose acting prowess I felt was underused). The action scenes were truly a spectacle. High octane, in your face action that continues to pound the screen throughout. I was perking up in my chair with wide eyes on numerous occasions throughout the film. While this might seem troubling, Zack Snyder and company provide a series of flashbacks that not only give the audience a look into Superman's past but also give their eyes and ears a break. The smile on my face was not broken throughout.Unfortunately, no movie is perfect, and Man of Steel definitely has some major issues that hold it back from being great. Although the idea of General Zod being presented as a villain who thinks what he's doing is right, he was just missing that extra something that would have made him menacing. I wanted to see more menace in his presentation because at times he felt a bit generic. This is especially disappointing when you have such a talented actor like Michael Shannon who definitely knows how to pull off a good anything. Lois Lane's character was presented as a very strong character right off the bat, which is fantastic, but her hard journalist side seemed to completely dissipate whenever Superman was around, making her just another damsel in distress. Some of the other supporting characters seemed to lack the development needed to care for them in the end. On top of this (and also my biggest problem with the film), although the flashbacks were a very interesting way to tell us about Clark's childhood, they created a major issue with pacing where nothing felt connected. It just seemed like they were using the flashbacks to just from major action scene to major action scene, which at points was jarring.Minor issues aside, Man of Steel is the definition of a summer blockbuster, which I honestly consider a good thing. Coming off of such a dull installment like Superman Returns, audiences needed to see a Superman who knows how to throw a punch. The story is there, but much like Clark with his true origin, you really have to search for it. Cavill portrays a Superman whose conflict is much more internal than we've ever seen which is a concept that might not be met with open arms. Nevertheless, grab you big bucket of popcorn and hang on for the ride of the summer. This is the Superman film I've been waiting for and a great start to what could be a fantastic series. 8/10It does upset me that a film like Superman Returns has a higher rating from critics, but oh well, different topic for a different day I suppose.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To begin with, as Snyder should've, why does David S. Goyer cloud, convolute and dampen up an origins story that has held up for 75 years, and why would Christopher Nolan be so enamored of doing so that he would spearhead a whole new franchise? Muddled, uncoordinated flashbacks lead a displaced Jor-El to Metropolis in time for General Zod's arrival on earth to destroy it withsecretly hoarded genetic codes? No trademark costume change, no dumbfounding earthlings with his superpowers and no rapport with Jimmy or Lois Lane. Here, the Daily Planet is as gloomy and underwritten as the obits.The last hour is a thoroughly exhausting, wearyingly preposterous binge of super-colossal devastation that makes you want to escape the movie, for it to just be over so you can leave and go home and watch the original films, a range of equal portions humor, sentimentality and spectacle deftly measured through and contrasted by the grandeur of Krypton and its ultimate destruction, Clark Kent's Spielbergian growing pains and finally his saving of the world from one of its own. Superman is so winning and indelible because despite being invincible, he's trusting, awkward and virginal. And that crucial element makes even those movies' cheesiest moments credible.Crucial to this re-imagining being the antithesis of those classics is Batman apostle Nolan. Whether he's to blame for the movie's overwhelming vainglory and conceit is hard to know but easy to assume. It's so somber, the humor can only ever be from our ironic detachment. One thing is for sure. It's no fun, whether Superman mopes and ponders or he's constantly finding himself in proximity to an unusual amount of disasters. Not only is it perpetually frowny-faced, it's monotonous, unthinking, smothering and so endlessly brimming with explosions that one can't help but flip the bird at the screen on cue.As the obvious, laden and trite dialogue suffers under Snyder's pedestrian helming of quieter moments, the director---with the subtlety of a baboon---ignores pace and running time almost as much as he ignores character and audience appeal as the uncontrolled ""climax"" elongates into oblivion, literally, leaving Metropolis an irreparable pile of debris. It needs to be said that the visual effects are as authentic as anything you'll see at the current multiplex. But under Snyder's watch, it's like being constantly clubbed with a Mona Lisa.Above all and more than anything, I so badly wish the movie would have suspended the inundating cavalcade and carved out more than a little wit.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can safely say, don't listen to the egghead critics. This isn't Shakespeare, it's comics in motion.The Good News: The special effects are galaxy class, no complaints there. The basic storytelling, direction, photography, and editing are all first class as well.The Bad News. Yes, the dialogue is weak in places and doesn't do much to help us bond with the characters. There's no conversational exchanges that are memorable, so I didn't walk away with any one liners. The acting isn't bad, but there isn't any dialogue or scripted moment to really let anyone shine through. So, whose fault is it that Henry Cavill comes across as a bit stiff or awkward? And playing Superman is a bit like playing the noble savage. One has to play it with dignity and a certain abandonment at the same time, not easy to do. Yes, if I could get every superhero movie to deliver what The Dark Knight (best superhero movie in history) delivered, I'd do that. I wish the dialogue and acting were better, but it certainly didn't stop me from enjoying the best Superman movie to date.I say rent it if you haven't already.And if anyone connected to the movie happens to look at this, build from here, don't start over. Batman Begins, wasn't ""great"" either. but it was good enough to keep the franchise going and look what it lead to.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Of all the reviews and opinions of this movie, the majority of people seem to agree with this. He has a child-like innocence but is shrouded in masculinity and his hard work and effort in preparation for the role shows in abundance on screen. Henry Cavill is a good Superman.And now to the other point - This movie is awful. I hate Zac Snyder movies, in my opinion (and it is my opinion) his movies are all shallow, pointless CGI clad outings with zero effort, and this movie is no different.With a script co-written by Christopher Nolan, I had slightly high expectations of Man of Steel but it just doesn't work. He tried to go all Dark Knight which completely removes any of the warmth and humour that made the original Superman so watchable. If it worked for Batman, it doesn't work for Superman, they are very different superheroes.Aside from Superman and his scrotum faced nemesis with bronchitis Michael Shannon, every other character exists simply as filler and none of them are remotely interesting. Shannon, who I usually enjoy watching, is so over the top that I found him fairly painful to watch, though he had little to work with.The last 40 minutes of the film is a complete CGI endurance test, so much so that it seems like an extended cut scene from a computer game. I don't care what anyone says, CGI should be utilised to complement a film only, not to tell the majority of the story. Even if that story is just two cartoons slamming each other through cartoon buildings. (not a spoiler, its in the trailer). These are the reasons why the new Star Wars trilogy is so hated the world over.This movie will divide opinion, I'm just tired of being conned out of my hard earned peanuts to watch a cartoon billed as a big blockbuster. That's all folks.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can sit and watch this film once a week and not be board. I will admit I'm a DC fan through and through, with Batman and Superman being my favourite comic book heroes. Living through the hype of The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises I felt complete with Batman, he was finally given the justice he deserved. Christopher Nolan gave me everything I could of asked for, of course Rises has its faults but it's still a great film with amazing ending. Then on hearing Nolan was going to tackle Superman, I knew something special was on its way. I more realistic and grounded take, shedding away the silliness and red pants. Now Henry Cavill was born to play Superman, he's performance is subdued and understated. He conveys a man struggling with absolute power. Living isolated from the rest of the world, while hiding in plain sight. Michael Shannon is a great villain, coming across as intelligent and eloquent, a man with a purpose. Amy Adams is brilliant as Lois Lane, who's not the damsel but character who drives the plot forward. Now the destruction of Metropolis and the neck snapping scene, are of course shocking. But it was the right choice, the consequences are clearly seen. Of course you would get casualties, this is not a kids film. Superman is not a wimpy boy scout, he is a man of action who he fights for what he believes in. Many can and have said differently, and I respect everyones opinions.I highly recommend this film, it's really well acted and is full of action.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think the main appeal to Superman is that he is also the only non-human superhero who really is more human than most humans, if you're following me. What I'm saying is that his love for humankind and Earth is ironically stronger than what most humans feel towards each other and mother Earth. In this latest re- visioning of Superman, directed by Zack Snyder, 'Man of Steel' is darker than the Superman of the past in its explanation about how Superman's home planet, Kryton was destroyed. We also learn that the 'S' on his uniform is not just a mere letter, but a symbol of Hope from his world. As the soul survivor of a dying planet, Kal-Al/Clark Kent/Superman was shipped off to Earth to live a full life and be a productive member of Human society and to help them one day when they need him.Henry Cavill breathes much needed new life into Superman and in this darker version of Superman, we really see the other-worldly powers that he possesses. The fight scenes with General Zod and his posse are incredible. But Superman faces a heartbreaking dilemma in saving Earth or keeping the last vestiges of his race alive.Ignore the questionably negative critical reviews of Man of Steel, and go see it for yourself. It is an excellent adventure for mature minds in the Superhero genre. I can't wait to see this again!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jor drew upon Greek/Roman myth movie for a god like countenance. All misplaced and stereotypic. Fishburne must have been the ethnic diversity quota because he just didn't have credibility as a news dept. head. 2. Cheap, unimaginative graphics borrowed (stolen) from lots of older fantasy movies especially those with floating cities and other floaties. The space craft looked more appropriate for cartoon fantasy with zero basis in reality. 3. Old storyline of bad guys chase good guy; a couple battles ensue; good guy ekes it out in the end. Ho hum. 4. Dialogue that only cloistered Hollywood writers could unimaginatively come up with. ""As a result our natural resources became unstable. We exhausted, our planets core."" Huh! That makes no scientific, even middle school level, sense. There is no connection between the two. Or this tripe ""Eventually our military leader, General Zod, attempted a coup."" He must have been inspired by events in Central/South America or Africa or Far East. Finally ""I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you."" That is a terribly misplaced metaphor for our Universe.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Critics bash the film for it's generic special effects but it ends up being able to co-exist with the characters and gives your eyes an amazing treat once the action starts. The script does not contain as many laughs as you would expect from a Marvel film(there are still a few chuckles to be had) it focuses on the plot which is a positive thing, and where it fails in comedy, it makes up for in action. This film seemed to be able to out-do it's DC predecessor, The Dark Knight Rises, in intensity due to the fact of the genius Hans Zimmer whose score was able to completely embody every single scene with different tones, from triumphant to depressing. The fight scenes were as fresh as can be, with inventive choreography and cinematographic wise, the old stylish look highlighted every single detail. Emotions flare up not only to the characters but also to the audience, it's able to reflect the mood. There was no flaw in the performances but will still most likely not be awarded any Oscars. The franchise has taken a turn for the better, there is not one second you will be bored and with over an hour of all action the story and the stunts will be able to off-set. For a first time Non-American Superman, Henry Cavill is able to bring justice not only to Earth but to the Superman franchise itself.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

After an almost 2 and a half hours I was really happy to see that the movie did good,actually very good.The story of Kal-El(Clark Kent)was told in a series of flashbacks that made his character more flushed out and likable .Since they were going for a more realistic approach about how the world would react about having an alien among their midst.The first half was done brilliantly for setting up Kal-El's arrival to Earth and portraying his troubled childhood in a series of flashbacks where he struggles to keep his alien origins a secret from the world as he is now lost in the world figuring out where did he come from and what is he destined for.Everyone gave a standout performance I particularly liked Michael Shannon as general Zod,Kevin Costner as the father figure that guides Clark through his troubled youth and Russel Crowe the real father Jor-El.By the time everything is set up the amazing second half begins with all its superpowered CGI desturction glory and mayhem as Zod comes looking for Clark(Kal).I just had one problem with it and that's the too much in your face destruction,don't get me wrong it was awesome but sometimes you get to question how much people died in that epic clash.I generally liked the movie,gave it an 8 out of 10 although it isn't perfect,it's certainly a great Superman film ready to stand on its own and create an amazing franchise destined for something truly special.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For this generation are lucky to have the man of steel in his full glory. For fans of the comics, older movies & TV series, the origin has been done & shown in many different ways but all share the one fact that Kal-el was sent to earth as a baby. I personally like this beginning & have to applaud the writers, Goyer & Nolan, and Snyder for executing it extremely well & also showing us a more realistic Krypton. I was not expecting a Dark Knight kind of film which is filled with intelligent dialogue, but was delighted the approach was more centred on a young and growing Clark, who is struggling to understand who he is & the many questions he has about his origin. I also felt this allowed me to understand him on a more normal scale & relate to him & as much as he had super powers, yet had the thinking of humans & that is because of the morality that was instilled in him by his adoptive parents Martha and Jonathan Kent. I found the movie to be more engaging as it went on & when the battles began, I was in DC comic's fantasy Universe! I absolutely loved the action sequences & was totally in awe of the realism of the fights. Beings that are made of steel when in battle will cause destruction within a city and Zack Snyder totally delivered that too! Overall, its an excellent start for a new series of Superman movies & I am extremely excited to see whether these movies will lead to a Justice League or maybe a Superman/Batman film. The Easter eggs were nice! 10/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is a totally different take on superman and its refreshing. People have to understand this is about the golden age superman and not the campy silver age superman in the donner films. The donner films will remain classic but you can't compare these two films because its too different times and its a different interpretation of the story of superman. I really hope Zack Snyder decides to do a different villain in the next superman such as doomsday or brianiac. No One has attempted doomsday on the big Screen. Doomsday was only in the TV show smallville which did it no justice and in the animated Doomsday movie. I think lex luthor has been overdone. If they decide to do a lex luthor in the next film then it really needs to be legendary like what heath ledger did for the joker. Anyways go see it, enjoy it, and don't over analyze the movie like the critics are doing. I think the movie graphics are top notch and the battle scenes kind of remind me of metal gear rising. The actress who played Faora did a phenomenal job on those fight scenes. I also hope that christopher nolan continues to play a part in the shape of the future sequels to man of steel.

You can't really see what the hell is going on with the fighting scenes because there is way too much happening. Anyway, I missed the wit from the original Superman, in this reboot, and guy that was playing Superman wasn't the best choice for the role. As a man who grew up with watching the Superman franchise, there some always something for everyone in the movies, but this seemed way too serious and in some ways, quite complicated. I was also surprised that he was walking around as a normal person and Superman, without being if disguise, so everyone knew who he was. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with the film, but some of the scenes action scenes looked great. Watchable!Round-Up: Sue singly enough, the best thing in the film for me, was Russell Crowe who plays his part extremely well. Michael Shannon also put in a great performance as the baddie, but it was the storyline that let this film down. It seemed like the director was trying to pack everything into one movie, when he could have spread it into sequels. He didn't really give you time to try and get to know the characters, like the originals did, and you don't see the Clark Kent side until the very end. You can really tell that Christopher Nolan had something to do with this movie, because he likes showing the dark side of the comic heroes. I just hope that the next one is more like the originals which we have all loves throughout the years.Budget: $225million Worldwide Gross: $663million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into the whole Superman legacy, but done expect it to be like the originals. 5/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The director very clearly compensated for all shortcomings in the plot by adding loads of unnecessary special effects. Some of which were great, but went for too long. In doing so, the love story between Clark and Lane, felt like it came from nowhere and it had no merits. Clark's life as a child also didn't mean a thing in building the story. Killing the villain the way it was done in this movie was not well thought off. Super-Aliens with Super Powers, don't simply get tired half way through a battle and lose their power to fight. The acting was not good.Other than the big names in this movie, the acting of the three main characters was in many places ""cold' and just horrible. I like Superheros movies, but for some reason, no one is able to make a good ""Superman"" movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Being a huge fan of Watchmen (that still remains one of the most underrated movies ever), I had high hopes for this movie. However coming out of the theaters I didn't really know what to think of it.Let's start by saying that choosing Snyder as a director was a good choice, the man had proved that he is familiar with the world of comics and graphic novels, combine this man with David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan and you should get one of the greatest comic adaptations ever. However why didn't it feel like that? The answer is quite simple, despite the fact that I love this movie, it is just to dark. Superman is contrary to batman not a symbol of darkness, revenge and bitterness. The man of steel represents hope and showing hope in a dark and destructive movie like this is just not possible. And I think that's why most people say this movie isn't that good, well that and the enormous amounts of destruction that is at display. However if you can get over this darkness and over the destruction, then you must admit that this is a really enjoyable, highly-entertaining and actually very good movie. The casting is simply put perfect, Fishburne plays a very realistic Perry White, Costner and Crowe each perform tremendously the role of loving father (although it's quite funny that superman has in this movie two robin hood fathers). However the real star of this movie is Shannon playing Zod. In short if you expect to see a superman comic than you shouldn't go watch this, because well it isn't. If you however desire to see a bad-ass movie that is highly entertaining and happens to have superman in it, then you really should just go and watch this.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

By the time the action starts I'd sort of lost interest in the movie. I think it's the worst of all superman films I've seen and wants to be too serious for the subject matter. It needs a good actor to play superman and some good dialogue, a bit tongue in cheek, is always good. Neither of these were in this film. If a director wants to make a more serious film about superman, like they've attempted with Batman they need stronger actors, a better love interest and a better storyline. Falls into the trap of a lot of movies these days. Too much reliance on special effects to the detriment of storyline.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The Movie is action packed: Superman Really Kicks some asses in this movie, the cast and the acting is incredible, there are so many emotional moments (i shed a tear more than once in the scenes with Kevin Costner ), the score is great, and the CGI is stunning, this movie has so many Epic Moments (the first time you see Superman in costume you'll know what i'm talking about). I Seriously don't understand why the negative reviews, i fell like if they just wanted to hate the movie for no reason, here's the negative things i've read about it:-""Too much action"": Serioulsy? i can't believe it, when Superman Returns Came out everyone said ""ohhh that movie was so boring, there was no action in it"" now Znyder delivers an action packed movie and people are complaining about it? yes the movie is action packed but i never felt like ""ohh my god this is boring"" it was awesome all the way, Besides, wasn't that what we all wanted for? when was the last time we saw Superman kicking asses? This movie delivers all that.-""Too much violence"": Just to start, this is a movie, it's fiction, no one died and people died in the movie because lots of Aliens came to invade the planet with huge weapons, superman can't save them all.-""Too much CGI"": It's Superman! a dude that can fly and shoot laser beams trough his eyes! how did they wanted the movie to be made?-""No Romance"": Oh my god did they wanted a twilight movie or something? the movie had some romance between Superman and Lois Lane, i felt that is was the correct amount.-""Too rushed"": I Agree on this one: the mayor issue with this movie (and also the same The Dark Knight Rises had) there are so many characters, so many things happening and also so many things that were left out, i felt that the way Kal-El becomes superman was very rushed, i would have loved to see more character development. I've heard the first cut was 3 hours long, i hope WB releases a directors Cut in the Blu Ray.But overall i had a huge smile when the movie ended, i'll go see it many times and i'm definitely getting the Blu Ray. Way Better than The Avengers but not as good as the Nolan's Batman Movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To me this movie is trying to hide he lack of proper storytelling behind tiresome special effects and high paced action scenes. Iv seen it many times before, and this movie brings nothing new to the table.What is it with these big budged movies? All these millions of dollars and no money for storytelling or character development. For me Superman the movie from 1978 sets the standard, and no other superman movie has been able to come close yet. Go and rent the original instead.

Goyer-written Superman reboot, I returned to Superman Returns from 2006. Bryan Singer's take on Superman was a 2.5-hour love letter to an unashamedly Christ-like saviour. While the one-dimensional villainy and whizz-bangery was kind of a drag, the human stuff was affectionate and soulful. It was also humorous, something that Man of Steel certainly is not. It's like producer Christopher Nolan scoured the script for jokes, surgically removing them - and all the fun - so we're left with an turgid, mechanical, over-plotted, gloomy, deafening bellow of a movie that's shorter than its predecessor but feels twice as long.The film starts with a war on Krypton, during which Kal-El is hurled in the general direction of Earth. He's raised on a farm by Ma and Pa Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), urged to keep his superpowers a secret. Little does Kal know, he's being pursued by General Zod (played unusually blankly by Michael Shannon), the super-villain who wasted his homeworld.So we have a racist fundamentalist threatening the American way of life, who when offered the chance to join civilised society and integrate refuses, choosing instead an apocalyptic cleansing, starting with New York. I mean, Metropolis. This is a new Superman for a paranoid world, cowering under the shadow of terrorist outsiders. Big themes. Unfortunately the script is a freakshow parade of glum portentous exclamations, convoluted sci-fantasy references, how-why-what exposition, and stillborn attempts at aphorism.Change is good. Comic book characters are necessarily reinvented throughout the ages to reflect the society that puts them on the page. But the changes have to work, and most of them don't in this film. It doesn't really matter that Clark Kent (played by Henry Cavill, with a perennial slight frown) has gone from awkward goof to smug beefcake, because we barely see him interacting with humans as an adult. But changes to other characters, in particular Lois Lane (a miscast and/or misused Amy Adams), serve only to further deny any semblance of humour from encroaching upon proceedings.The film isn't a complete disaster. Costner and Lane provide some softness and soul in their small roles. There's some pleasing John Carter-esque production design on Krypton. And while it might not be The Last Temptation of Christ, Goyer does at least glance in the direction of understanding the psychology of being The One.In the last reel, the final confrontation(s) outstay their welcome, but they're welcome relief from the lousy dialogue, and the mass destruction is certainly on an appropriately vast scale. (No need to hide your eyes - it's only implied that hundreds of thousands die.) It is telling that the best set-piece in the movie, which involves a tornado, occurs earlier on: well-choreographed action with an emotionally dramatic core. If only the rest of the film had worked on the same basis.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Also props to Micheal Shannon on his Zod character who was pretty entertaining and special props to casting Russell Crowe as Jor el because he nailed it. It was a good decision by the director to finally give Jor el a face instead of just a voice in all the other movies. i know that people wanted all the classic campiness with the cheesy one liners and the nerdy Clark Kent but for the most part the film is better without it. I agree that the movie may have needed to lighten it up a bit a times but it is forgivable because it would have been out of place in this movie. Another controversial part of this film is the exclusion kryptonite. while kryptonite is a huge part of superman history i was glad to see it go and take a back seat to the great powers of superman himself. Superman returns over use of kryptonite makes me even more glad it was not in this movie. also when you take out kryptonite you are better able to show off Superman's god like powers without him keeling over because of a green rock. It is also important to remember that this is the first movie in a new franchise so the squeals have the chance to hone in on some of the more well know things about superman. why people think that this movie is anything like Micheal bays disastrous movies that are transforms is beyond me. this movie is not perfect but it sets up nice template for an even better sequel. also just because Christopher Nolan was part of this movie does not mean you should expect a dark night type movie. these are two very different themed characters and it would not have worked. I also believe that this film has fallen victim to the over hyping machine so that is a big reason why critics are so hard on this movie. my advice is just sit back and enjoy the movie and stop being so damn critical because this movie is pretty darn good entertainment on its own 8/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And in many ways this isn't a Superman film, this is a Clark Kent film. Man of Steel is a lot more about Clark/Kal-El and his supporting cast of characters than it is about superpowered antics. Not that the film is without action, heroics or fights, it has plenty; but the film is essentially a coming of age film for an outsider asking questions about identity, responsibility, family and acceptance. Some of these questions are raised more directly than others, but all are prevalent themes throughout.The film is what you would expect in tone from the Nolan-Snyder team-up, especially if you have seen trailers or posters, it is a lot darker than any previous outings and the few attempts at humour feel noticeably out of place and awkward. But for anyone afraid that ""going Batman Begins"" on the usually cheerful boy scout, do not fear, the tone feels appropriate for the story being told. And despite being an origin story it doesn't feel like retreading old ground, it is true that everyone knows the back-story of Superman, but this film tells it with more attention to his true origin – his home planet, Krypton – and focuses on the struggles that growing up with such extraordinary abilities creates. This is something it does effectively.The opening section takes place exclusively on Krypton, and it looks beautiful, the whole film is very stylish but the Krypton section really stands out. Using Birthright's explanation that the 'S' symbol is actually a Kryptonian symbol that represents the House of El was a good touch that gives more back-story to his outfit (including the symbol change and loss of red briefs). It is impressive how the film makes each location type feel different, Krypton and its ships are instantly recognisable by their futuristic sci-fi feel, Smallville feels like sleepy small-town America and Metropolis feels like exactly that: a vast generic city with skyscrapers at every turn. The time shifts are also dealt with smoothly, there is never any confusion what point in time we are watching, and their use for his childhood moments spare any lengthy rehash of seeing Clark growing up.Where the film both excels and falls is in its action scenes. They are some of the most destructive and brutal you will see in any modern blockbuster, but this in itself brings a problem. For a man who dedicates himself to saving the world and the people in it, the action destroys a lot of buildings and presumably the people within them. This could of course be explained away when Zod does it, as he has no regard for human life anyway, but when Superman is willingly destroying buildings instead of trying to defend them it really ignores Supes cause. It is this approach that lands this film very much into blockbuster territory, as opposed to a genre-crossing comic book film like The Dark Knight, Man of Steel seems content to embrace being nothing more than a blockbuster.Overall, Man of Steel builds a great foundation for the Superman franchise relaunch, bringing a strong Clark Kent in Henry Cavill and a good cast of supporting characters.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Personally, I don't blame the actors, they're just not right for the part, The director chose the wrong set of people for these characters.Now, for those of you who've watched the series 'SmallVile', you're probably gonna hate this movie, because they just jumped the introduction.That's one of the things this movie lack: an intro that builds up to the main plot, which in this case, they might as well just skipped the flashbacks of his childhood, which were also unconvincing to me.If you're a person that's a newbie to Superhero movies, and doesn't pay attention to realism, then go ahead, watch it, the special affects we're AWESOME.Else, don't bother, it's just as lame as every movie produced this year, and even lamer.I don't usually write reviews, hell, this is the first time I felt obliged to, because I read a few that said this movie is awesome and the best, but then I was greatly disappointed, and the villain character is all wrong, the actor they used would be more suitable for a quiet secretive villain, not an angry villain with a temper.4/10 -- not worth watching on the big screen (like most 2013 movies).Sincerely RonnyM","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I like just about every movie better than this the worst comedy's are better than this. I like Meet the Blacks better than this , Spawn, all the FF movies including the 2015 reboot better than this movie, superhero movie with drake Bell.

It would be ludicrous to judge ""Predator"" with the same criteria I would judge Twelve Angry Men"" by, and it would be insane to judge Man of Steel by the same criteria as The Godfather. Man of Steel should be judged as a superhero action movie, and by God does it do a magnificent job of it!First of all, Man of Steel is a very different beast to Donner's Superman, which was a whimsical adventure movie (a great one at that!). Superman and his world have changed dramatically over the last 35 years, Superman is no longer the boy scout who pulls his punches and makes witty quips. If you want to see that Superman go and watch your DVD of Superman The Movie, but for the Superman fans who want to see Superman as he's been in the comics since the '80s, this is the Superman movie we've been waiting for.Many ""critics"" have complained that Superman is too dark in this movie, I for one couldn't disagree more! Whilst the world in which Superman exists is much darker than Donner's the character of Superman is still the fundamentally good hero that we all love. His every action is driven by his desire to help others and his love for human kind, with no concern for himself. The darker world of Man of Steel makes this movie so much more powerful, for it is in the dark that the light shines brightest.This of course is not to say that the movie is entirely dark and brooding, as many ""critics"" have claimed! After reading a number of reviews (always a mistake) I entered the cinema expecting a movie with the tone of The Dark Knight or Watchmen and was delighted to find a number of humorous moments alleviating the tension of the action, although not so many as to break my excitement as the story progressed.The actors in this movie are, in general, excellent in their roles. Henry Cavill IS the new Superman! In the same way in which Christopher Reeve perfectly embodies the Superman of the '70s, Cavill portrayed the modern Superman; one always driven by his innate goodness, but also capable of great anger when presented with Zod's atrocities.Amy Adams was also a far more satisfying Lois Lane than has been portrayed in the many iterations of Superman over the years, this Lois isn't some ""damsel in distress"", she's a real feminist woman, a dogged reporter and a brave and heroic woman who actually plays an active part in the defence against Zod's invasion.Michael Shannon was exceptional as Zod. He was a menacing figure throughout the movie, although he is principally driven by his xenophobic and racist views (one of the core themes of the movie, something which many of the ""critics"" seem to have overlooked when dismissing MoS as ""shallow"" and lacking in ""substance"") Shannon plays the character so expertly that one can also feel sympathy for his desire to revive Krypton even though we disapprove of his methods.This isn't a flawless movie by any means. There was room for some more character development (although not to the extent that some have suggested, this is an action movie for Christ's sake, not high drama! I also think that now we have covered the Origin Story, the sequel will have plenty of development), and some of the fight scenes did drag on slightly, but ultimately I didn't really care because it was fun, and I was emotionally touched by the movie; I was overwhelmed by feelings of joy and excitement as Superman first stepped out into the snow in his costume and slowly learnt to fly, I felt Superman, Jor-El and Zod's pain as they each had what they loved taken from them and I felt an all consuming feeling of hope as I left the cinema. This, for me, is what I want to feel when I go to the cinema.TLDR: MoS is a really cool and touching action movie, just don't go in expecting another Reeve movie, we already have plenty of those!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Man of Steel Sets the Stage for New Adventures","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2820749/?ref_=tt_urv","seaview1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0774754/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2013","DC Comics has rivaled and preceded Marvel Comics for many decades with its roster of super heroes and is now attempting to reestablish their greatest character, Superman. Having been previously depicted in movies and television, Man of Steel is the biggest production to date. Is it any good, and is it better than Superman Returns? Yes and yes. Despite a darker tone, (courtesy of the creative tandem of producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer from The Dark Knight films and director Zach Snyder of Watchmen), this adventure is an entertaining action piece with a deep psychological subtext. The planet Krypton is dying, and scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara launch a spacecraft to send their newborn son, Kal-El, to a promising world, Earth. General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose attempted coup is thwarted, is banished into a wormhole. When Krypton is destroyed, Kal-El lands on earth, and through a series of flashback vignettes, we see the school boy named Clark struggling with growing pains and the values instilled by his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) who try to hide his superhuman strength and abilities. As an adult, Clark (Henry Cavill) takes a series of jobs and remains anonymous, off the grid until odd reports begin to circulate of a mysterious man who saves lives with remarkable powers which brings reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) hot on his trail. The setting shifts from the cornfields of Midwest America to Metropolis. As General Zod reappears to claim earth for his race, the stage is set for a grand battle with the fate of the world in the hands of a true blue hero.There are some fine moments such as the young Clark befriending a former bully and being repaid in kind. There is the tornado scene that brings Clark's non-use of his powers to a turning point. Later, when the military first meet Superman and question his intentions, he responds by rescuing scores of people and is vindicated in a touching moment. This Superman (with more than a passing parallel with Jesus) is depicted as an emotionally vulnerable soul, and although he possesses great powers and invincibility, he does feel pain especially when meted out by his own kind. The whole film is ultimately a moral struggle and contrast between two fathers and whether their son's powers are meant for good or to be kept hidden no matter what the cost. It's also about his personal journey to find his purpose amid a normal life and search for his origins. Can he embody the best of both worlds, and to what lengths will Superman go to save humanity? Cavill is quite convincing as Superman, certainly an improvement on Brandon Routh's turn in Superman Returns. Adams shows a thoroughly capable yet vulnerable Lane, a strong reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner to boot! Her scenes with Superman work quite well especially in the quieter, intimate moments which one hopes will lead to much more in future installments.The supporting cast excels. Crowe lends gravitas to a subordinate role, and he registers every time he appears. Diane Lane is good as the compassionate Momma Kent. (Ironically Lane starred in Hollywoodland about TV's Superman, George Reeves). Costner makes a strong impression as the resolute, adoptive dad who is willing to risk his life for a principal. Laurence Fishburne is a more three-dimensional Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is effective as a hardnosed military commander.Special visual effects have come a long way since 1978's Superman when the slogan was, ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" Some of the effects show incredibly fast motion which makes you wonder how cool it would be to realize such DC Comic characters as The Flash. While Hans Zimmer has the appropriate, heroic musical score in place here, John Williams truly memorable theme song is a hard act to follow.The action is not the cartoon variety; people do get hurt and some perish. Regarding that final battle in the streets of Metropolis (previously depicted in Superman II), enough already! We've seen The Avengers decimate New York City and The Transformers wreak havoc on a massive scale. These scenes are becoming old hat (even in a post 9/11 world), and are starting to seem repetitive overkill. Don't get me started on the obvious product placement; when it begins to be noticeable, it becomes annoying. Perhaps the only disappointment here is the lack of much humor or lightheartedness. There are a couple funny moments; the film could have used a few more. One hopes a lighter tone is in store for the next chapter. Maybe we will see Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen who are both missing here. You barely see Clark Kent get his gig at The Daily Planet before the credits roll. Oh, and contrary to the Marvel films, do not bother staying through the credits in hope of a post credit tease. The film's greatest accomplishment is setting a strong foundation for the next Superman adventure and possibly the beginnings of a Justice League of America (emulating Marvel's The Avengers). Wouldn't that be cool?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

One I first seen the trailer I was instantly drawn in. They had released in such a effective way that it had every expectation that it would be a great movie. The movie looked great to me in the trailer. It had the effects and the realistic looks that made me really believe that this movie was going to be amazing but that was crushed in a instant one I watched the actual movie and not the trailer. It still had the amazing effects but the movie it self was far too much action and not enough storyline. But don't get me wrong the action fight scenes in the movie are astonishing to me but it was the storyline that made me disappointed but the action scenes and effects are amazing. Trust me they are but the storyline is just to me doesn't do superman any justice at all.But this is just how I feel about the movie.

It was all that the DC Comics and its fans had after it held the lantern for its challenge against the Marvel world. While Darkness prevailed alternatively, it all seemed bleak until the producers summoned the main character. He was the one that added the 'super' to hero and his revival is set to define the fortunes of the enormous Justice League's making. Hope finally left Krypton to arrive in Kansas, to give our planet and audiences, the one hero we have been waiting for in a new iconic form. The powers of our superhero are not just those derived from our Sun or his alien molecular structure. His belief in his Earth father's ideals and those ideals he learnt from his Kryptonian father about becoming greater than the society's intent and to realize his true potential, made him the righteous hero. From the discovery of these ideals, Zack Snyder ('300', 'Watchmen') elevates Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel; the symbol of Hope. What follows thereafter, is epic cinema that is exhilarating in its delivery of high powered action and the display of Godly powers. This is The Superman we have all been waiting for.Krypton was soon going to face annihilation owing to its unstable core. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara give natural birth to a son, Kal-El against the norms of their world, imprinting Krypton's genetic codex into him and setting him off in a capsule that is Earth-bound in a bid to save their dying planet's legacy. General Zod (Michael Shannon), a rebel warrior, seeks the codex to recreate Krypton but his angst leads to Jor-El's murder and thereby his group's incarceration by the Science Council into the Phantom Zone. Meanwhile, Kal-El's childhood years as Clark Kent have led to awkward discoveries of his powers and knowing this, his father Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) urges him to keep them secret as the world wasn't ready for him. Thus, he exists in anonymity, traveling all over the country to find suitable jobs but always wanting to find out what the reason for his being on Earth was. He ends up being a guardian angel for some whose lives he saved with his powers and that attracts the attention of Daily Planet's reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). While discovering a Kryptonian scout ship, Clark is introduced to Jor-El's hologram that educates him about Krypton, General Zod and the purpose of him being on Earth. Clark is thus introduced to his costume and the power of flight. What follows is General Zod's escape from the Phantom Zone, and his subsequent arrival upon Earth in search of the codex and Kal-El. He demands Clark's surrender while preparing the terraforming of Earth for Kryptonian revival. The Man of Steel duly obliges to stand between Zod and Earth. Snyder spends no time in further development and no mercy onto the buildings in Kansas and Metropolis. As he gets down to business, we witness the fury of their flight, the power of their impact onto each other as well as their surroundings and a raw portrayal of each character's stand on his individual belief. Amy Adams is a departure from the lois Lane from earlier films as she is on the hunt for the guardian angel right from the beginning and directly confronts Clark about his true identity. Russell Crowe as Jor-El is very good at being a guide to Kal-El. His conviction in his son's powers and his dissuasion of Zod's plans gives the film a soulful being that furthers the individual motivations of both characters. In their brief roles as Clark's parents, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner leave a lasting impact as they influence the humaneness in their super-son through righteous beliefs and cautious exposure of his existence to the world. Michael Shannon turned out to be a worthy adversary as Zod with his aggressive tone and menacing apathy for humanity.The biggest revelation has been Henry Cavill who is as good at being the serious Clark Kent as he is being the powerful Man of Steel. His delineation of Clark's conflicted childhood and youth as he comes to terms with his powers and the transition into a self-aware Kal-El is quite brilliant.The jaw-dropping visual effects, (Weta Digital- yet again!) Amir Mokri's Cinematography and Hans Zimmer's epic score make each sequence an astounding work of cinema. While the initial flight may look like a video game, the flights during the action scenes are unbelievably executed. The sheer pace of their movement and the scale of their fury form the basis of compelling action sequences which are among the best ever. Zack Snyder, David Goyer and Christopher Nolan's to-the-point, serious approach to re- introducing Superman will disappoint the fans of the light-hearted, romantic and campy hero of the 80s. The action is fast and destructive, offering little time to even munch on popcorn. In fact, there are several scenes where the action is so relentless that you need a second viewing just to digest the scale of devastation that Snyder's visualization has caused. He excels at building up the audience engagement by crescendoing the sequences one after another for a very long time. The gifted and powerful Kal-El, together with the nurtured and humane Clark Kent form a protagonist whose strengths are incorporated from the guidance of the Krypton father and the ideologies of the human father. These attributes make a formidable force to reckon with even for Zod. When given a chance to discover himself, the child who grows up to become a hero for the greater good stands as an ideal for humans to strive towards, a symbol of hope against all odds, a protector, a moral shield, a Man of Steel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But I am afraid to say that not only has superman attained such height, but has surpassed them in a single flight, and without having the audience giggling with laughter. It is a serious and superbly woven story, starting in Krypton, then departing for earth, and then melding the two worlds. The action scenes are breathtaking and more importantly, they are very well blended within the story. THERE ARE NO RUSHED ACTION AND FORCED action scenes, and that it is a little jewel in a crown full of little diamond scenes. The acting is TOP notch. Crowe has so much panache. He made the first quarter of the movie regal. Handsome and never losing his well put haircut. Not many men since Bradley Cooper have been able to rock long hair but oh my, crow does it like he reared in into style aeons ago. Cavill is a serious often morose never perky but self-assured and determined superman. He takes no prisoner in his approach to handling a tricky situation, most of it instilled by the sound bits of advice dispensed by his deceased father. He is SUPERMAN. A man that never wavers in the face of adversity. My only little disappointment was how blandly the urgency of an imminent alien attack was handled. The president of the USA, that ever ubiquitous face when calamity comes to sow was conspicuous by its absence. There was no sense the authorities were bothered by the happening befalling earth. But all in all, SUPERB ACTION. SUPREME ACTING MENTION TO GENERAL ZORD. GENERAL ZORD BY HIMSELF IS ONE REASON TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE AFTER CROW. JUST SUPREME ACTING FROM THIS GUY WELL DONE SIR. Even the supporting cast (the kryptonian one) acts as if they were born and bred in Krypton. Very roughshod, life battened and hardened people (dour like the Scots). SUBLIME ACTING REALLY!

Henry Cavill is good here, but he is one of those actors who I enjoy in almost anything they're in (I even thought he fared well in that God awful Hellraiser flick he did early in his career) Amy Adams is cute and does well as Lois Lane, and has enough chemistry with Cavill, Michael Shannon is okay as General Zod (but Terence Stamp set the bar high with his performance in Superman II) but the screenplay bounces all over the place, with numerous flashbacks at odd times, and an overall feeling of doom and gloom throughout.The climactic battles amount to little more than Superman and Zod and company throwing each backward into things endlessly. After a while, it really does look like a repetitive, numbingly violent video game, with no heart or soul. Here, the colours of Superman's suit are so muted, faded, that it looks grey/ black, like they colours of the suit after Superman ended up in the vat of acid at the end of Superman III, which only adds to the depressing vibe I get from this film. Christpher Reeve's Superman I and II were fun fantasies. They had a child-like sense of wonder and awe, spectacle, charm, class, all things which this film's quarter of a billion dollars budget cannot buy.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Here, as soon as mandatory subjects like origin and journey are hurriedly covered, we are thrown into what Superman can actually do, and the makers start breathing easy. This film becomes an excellent example of not only how Superman saves the Earth, but also how effects take the place of coherent storytelling of human emotions, and can still come out as a movie. Its ironic how the one thing that Superman fights for is actually missing, the human beings. The one thing I actually miss about the Superman of simpler times is simplicity.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So if I catch a movie in 3D it's only because it was the next showing version of the movie at the theater by the time I arrived. So that's how I ended up seeing Man of Steel in 3D and let me just say it was worth the extra up charge. The action sequences and the planet Krypton scenes would not have been as down right awesome for me in 2D as they were in 3D. Not since Avatar have I thought a movie was worth the extra charge. This movie brought elements and somberness and exuberance and balanced them perfectly. Every actor in this film brought their ""A"" game and I must give extra props out to Kevin Costner who was especially great. Henry Cavill owned the suit and from now on he will always be the quintessential Superman for this new generation. Much like Christopher Reeves was for me. I was also a regular watcher of Smallville. So I really appreciated the fact they picked an actor who closely resembles Tom Welling to play Superman in this film. He did a superb job preparing for this movie and he was a great Clark Kent, Kale El and Superman. He mastered all three of the Man of Steel's identities seamlessly. Amy Adams was the best choice to play Lois Lane because she can easily exude strength, determination and vulnerability. All must have traits for any actress to have for this role. As for the other actors in this movie. They were all memorable and cast wisely. It's obvious the makers of this film had a very strong sense of how it should be from the beginning of it's production.

These are all things I was thinking while watching Man of Steel. If you are a big comic book fan like I am, then this movie is for you. Man of Steel tells the story of Superman the correct way. The movie begins by telling the story of the planet Krypton. Krypton is facing destruction due to its unstable core, the result of years of exploiting Krypton's natural resources. The ruling council is deposed by the planet's military commander General Zod, and his followers causing a military coup. Scientist Jor-El and his wife Lara launch their newborn son Kal-El on a spacecraft to Earth, infusing his cells with a genetic codex of the entire Kryptonian race. After Zod murders Jor-El, he and his followers are captured and banished to the Phantom Zone. However, Krypton explodes some time afterwards, freeing them.Later on in the movie, Kal-El's ship lands on a farm on Earth. He is discovered by Martha and Jonathan Kent who raise him as an orphan. Kal-El is named Clark Kent by his orphan parents. Clark finds it difficult to live a normal life and as a child. As a teenager, Clark begins to help others using his abilities. Later on the story, his father Jonathan informs him that he is an alien and tells not to use his powers in front of people to avoid rejection from the public. As an adult, Clark spends several years saving people in secrecy. Later on in the movie, scientists discover a fallen spaceship in the Arctic. Clark follows and them and soon stumbles upon the ship himself. He enters the ship and meets his fathers preserved conscious. From there he learns about his ancestry and is destiny to save people and be a true hero. Meanwhile, Zod and his henchmen escaped the phantom zone due to the explosion of Krypton. He knows That Kal-El is still alive and is very furious. While Clark is becoming the hero we know and love, Superman, General Zod wants to restore Krypton and he wants to do it with the planet Earth! Will he be successful or will he be defeated by the boy in blue?","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Regarding MOS, I thought it was a very intelligent movie. That isn't to say that it didn't have its flaws (anyone can point to plot holes and the running afowl of physics here and there) but they were minimal and didn't take away from the film.I see so many complaining that MOS wasn't ""fun, ""funny,"" ""charming,"" etc. Not everyone wants a funny, wimpy, quirky, sissy Superman. I thought the character was portrayed in a realistic manner given how he was indeed an alien, coming to grips with his power, responsibility, and potential ostracisation. So he didn't have a curl on his forehead and didn't act like Mr. Bean (lite version) as Clark Kent -- that's a plus in my book. I truly appreciate the way this character was developed. Although I wish there were more scenes from his youth (the movie could have been longer like LOTR, etc.), I actually appreciated the flashback methodology.There are also many who complain about the destruction in the film. Am I missing something here? The villains were bent on doing far more damage to earth; the destruction added weight and reality to the film. If we were to envision this happening ""in real life"" do you think it would have played out with less destruction? I am not into gratuitous violence at all but the nature of the villains, their strength, and their purpose made the ""destruction"" level plausible.I think that if the producer would have thrown in some comedy, added some ewok/jar-jar type characters to the script, and focused on some awkward/fluffy romance between Clarkie and Lois (a la the Reeve films) the naysayers would have been more than satisfied. But again, not everyone wants to see a man of steel on the same level as the power rangers or ninja turtles... some of us want to see a film that is adult-friendly. Thankfully, there are enough people left in America (and hopefully the UK) who do not need their movies to be dumbed-down and ""cutesie"" to enjoy it.Man of Steel was impressive; those who wanted the curl-in-the-forehead version of the character... are not. Just my two...","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie let us feel what he felt. We didn't watch just a hero rising and saving the earth. We watched a man from another planet adapting to earth. The price for having super powers, keeping secrets, living with a low profile and all other sacrifices.I really like that. The character fits in to the role and also the cast was well chosen. Honestly, they were also a lot of questions answered in the movie. For example the suit or the ""S"" logo. Details were also very good. The atmosphere, gaining power from the radiation of the sun. Even the theory where they all set colonies and the idea behind that. Good chosen cast, good directed and acted. Well done.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

This will undoubtedly go down as more people see it but for now the reason is people that love superman are reviewing it, as for me I am indifferent. I like superman but he is not my favorite superhero and I went into this movie pretty blind. I had high hopes for this film in the hands of Zack Snyder and having Michael Shannon in there but sadly it didn't live up to those expectations. Zack Snyder has this talent for making films that are almost good but never quite there and that's how I feel about Man of Steel. It had great action that made you feel every punch and laser blast but too much of it. I don't care of Snyder was ""pleasing"" the fans, it was TOO MUCH. It didn't need to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, there was always things happening but oddly enough a lot of it felt like filler, in disposable scenes. The acting was decent but I felt like Michael Shannon wasn't right for this part. I love Michael Shannon but his talent is for the subdued menacing guy not the constantly screaming villain. It didn't work for me. The writing was pretty sappy at a lot of parts but a few good lines were in there, especially for Kevin Costner. I didn't hate it, and I definitely didn't like it. 4/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was a fresh take on the story of Superman, with strong performances from all the actors and a less campy story. Visual and sound effects were outstanding and new soundtrack was definitely in order. (note: I am a fan of John Williams' score, but a new scope on the origin of Superman required something completely different). Don't get me wrong, I loved Superman: The Movie. But as we saw with Superman Returns a few years ago, that concept is a bit outdated for a 21st century audience. This movie is a complete thrill ride. Performances are great: Henry Cavill really deliver's as the last son of Krypton, you can feel the inner struggle that the character goes through. Russell Crowe Kevin Costner and completely embrace the essence of both their characters as the true mentors of Clark/Kal- El. Diane Lane does an excellent Martha Kent and I really enjoyed Amy Addams as the new gutsy and go-getting Lois Lane (no more damsel in distress). Zod is excellently portrayed by Michael Shannon, a solid performance. Go see it, you'll be glad you did!

My Grandad took me to watch Superman: The Movie when I was 4 years old, It was the first movie I'd ever seen at the cinema and I left the theatre thinking I could fly, never mind believing that a man, or anybody else could for that matter, my imagination ran wild and from that moment on I was hooked.Sadly my Grandad was taken from me a few years later in a tragic car accident the day after my 9th birthday. To me my Grandad became synonymous with Superman and without him I may never have been introduced to the character and quite possibly would not be the avid fan I am today.Throughout my life Superman has come to mean so much more to me than a character in a book or movie. He's come to represent family, standards, ideals & values, and for me personally a nostalgic recollection of childhood memories, and of a time when I viewed the world with much more innocent eyes.I'm 38 years old now and a father with four children of my own and I see the world very differently. I still think it's a beautiful place however being a parent I'm only too aware of the dangers in it. Yet when I read a Superman comic or watch a movie, I think of my Grandad and what he came to mean to me in those few short years I had with him and of a time when life appeared so different.I know my Grandad would've loved this movie every bit as much as I did and I'll be taking my eldest son to watch it soon too and in years to come I hope we'll be able to sit down and remember the first time we saw Man Of Steel together.For me the movie conveyed everything I've come to hold dear about the character while delivering much more on so many different levels.This is the Superman Movie I've waited virtually my whole life to see and the movie that will hopefully create nostalgia and fire the imagination for a whole new generation of Superfans for many years to come.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He is my favorite character of all the DC and Marvel line up. He's virtuos, brave and loyal an outsider who puts others before himself with a high moral standpoint and a strong defense, he only uses when it's absolutely necessary. That being said I don't know much about the comics or history and wasn't a huge fan of the original movies although I did really like the first one. The one that I loved was Bryan Singer's now all of a sudden frowned upon reboot. Superman played by the perfectly casted Brandon Routh was heartbreakingly beautiful not just in his physicality but in his delicateness. Never before had his and Lois's relationship felt more prevalent or his connection to humanity felt more real. There was a real sense of awe and wonder in that film. Most people had an issue with that film because of the lack of action but most importantly the story was there and a real depth of emotional resonance. So with that I am sad to say that Man of Steel was such a huge disappointment to me. I didn't have the highest of hopes despite some amazing trailers the buzz began to come back very mediocre (not that you should always listen to it) and with the presence of a once promising Zack Snyder directing after many failed experiments( Sucker Punch, questionably Watchmen and even the visually strunning but ultimately souless 300. To this day his best film is still the Dawn f the Dead remake) I had my doubts. And it's kind of the same scenario here although not as huge of a misstep as sucker punch, Man of Steel lacks any real depth or story continuity. It feels rushed and forced with a ton of unnecessary action sequences and just not enough of anything that really counts to back any of it up. This is not the Superman that Christopher Reeve or Brandon Routh played. This version wants to be darker but ultimately comes off a bit too goffy with a frat boy sort of edge and a huge emotional imbalance. It doesn't help that the lead character is played by an actor that spends all of his time working out and none of it in the acting classes he should be taking. Not to say he was dreadful it's definitely a step up from his unintentionally funny turn in The Immortals, and he does have a few silent moments that felt just a little endearing. As for one of my favorite actresses Amy Adams as Lois Lane, she's not developed enough to be much of anything. Sure she's a bit feistier in this version and not much of a damsel but since there's no real emoitonal girth to any of it, it's hard to make any real relatable connection to their characters or their material. And they have zero chemistry. The wonderful Michael Shannon(so amazing in Take Shelter) hams it up as General Zod with some questionable performance choices as does Diane Lane as Superman's earth Mom. The only two people that stand mostly uneffected by the material except for a few goofy scenes are Russell Crowe as his real father and Kevin Costner as his earth father(the tornado scene aside). Oh and let's not forget the always dependable Chris Meloni as well. Despite an amazing setup the film slowly begins to fall apart into silliness from one shirtless Henry Cavill scene to the next. Everything thing feels rushed and none of it feel as engaging as it should be. The special effects seem to be the star here and they are impressive especially in Imax 3D, this is the first time Snyder had worked with a budget of this magnitude and he does have a bit of fun with it. As for the action scenes, they are cool but begin to get very repetitive and confusing. I can see that he was trying to do something new with all of it but it doesn't seem to translate as well as he hoped. And that really is the ultimate summation of this film. It's a decent effort but the direction is the real problem here it's ultimately to weak which leaves Man of Steel feeling joyless with no sense of wonder or emotional pull and just a tad bit dull. 2.5/5 LikeCommentShare","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't understand why this is being throttled by a lot of people it really is already a very underrated film. The acting is very good from Superman, Lois Lane, to Pa and Ma Kent to whoever Laurence Fishburne was playing. Go and see it if you have any interest in superheroes, science fiction and people being punched through buildings. And if anybody tells you this movie's bad, that's okay, because you know they're just being swept up in a tide of unnecessary internet rage.

The Krypton is a visual delight. Screenplay by David S. Goyer is fantastic & direction by Zack Snyder is superb. Background Score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic & perfectly blends with the scenes. Kevin Costner & Diane Lane proved to be good parents to Cavill as Jonathan & Martha Kent.The 3-D effects were nice and CGI were fantastic.A wonderful scripted movie beautifully executed by great actors. A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can relate to the character since they've given him a humanness lacking in other versions. No film before this has ever shown the problems he had adjusting to his powers. It was hey I have powers, time to be Superman. Amy Addams is my favorite Lois Lane and her relationship with Superman is perfect. I won't say why I feel this since it would be a spoiler. The cast is simply excellent. The entire Krypton part of the film, with Jor-El as a man of mind and action, and Zod's belief that he is the guardian of the Kryptonian race, was brilliant. In other films, as far as villains what do we get; Superman fights a missile, one of which he can't even catch. The Villains in 2 were horrid, with powers that Kryptonians don't have. 3 and 4 aren't even worth mentioning. Returns got the powers right, but again, Lex Luthor? I hope luthor stays a background or tertiary villain until at least Man of Steel 3. The movie. I loved the way it was set up, with an adult Clark Kent wandering the earth committing acts of goodness. Then when he discovers his heritage and the family shield meaning hope. All excellent, well done ideas. Some have complained about the end. What does the viewer expect when two Kryptonians battle? To duke it out over a chess board? This was as near perfect a Superman movie as one could be and I am looking forward to the sequel. Henry Cavill is officially my favorite Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. And Amy Addams was a great Lois Lane, she carried her role well. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Superman. P.S. I loved the costume and am glad the undies are gone.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

He didn't disappoint me with the writing he and David S. Goyer did for this movie. This movie has great action, a great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and a pretty damn good story. I do wish that they would have expanded a little more on the theme of distrust that we would have of someone with such immense powers as Superman. However, enough was done to satisfy me. I definitely say to see this movie in IMAX if you can. Don't trust the critics on this one, they love to bury Superman, because as with many people they see him as a bland character who is too over-powered. He may be kind of one dimensional but that's what he's supposed to be, a symbol of the greatness in all of us put into one person. This is also a theme that the movie tries to hammer home, the potential for greatness in all of us. The movie isn't quite as thought provoking as some movies out there but it doesn't really have to be. It's there to give you a great visual experience and perhaps inspire some of us to reach into the greatness that we have stored within. Enough of this review go out, see this movie, and decide for yourself!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The character has been stuck in the '50s since, well, the '50s and the world's gone through a few cultural shifts in that time so an update is overdue. His core principles remain essential, though, and in visiting such dark territory, Zack Snyder's iteration completely whiffs on that. There's a complete lack of joy, or even optimism, in this grim, sepia-swathed world, least of all in its noble hero. Saddled with guilt by his adoptive father, who adamantly stresses (even to his dying breath) the dangers of revealing his powers to the public, Superman seems defeated even before he takes flight. His biological dad, visited briefly in holographic form, merely points him like a weapon at the bad guys and evaporates. His relationship with Lois Lane is happenstance and hollow, more rendezvous than relationship, with a lack of mystery and next-to-no emotion. It's a drain to watch, a dysfunctional mess just to think about. The film is technically impressive, though, with a strong talent for emphasizing the magnitude in both the scenery and the inevitable superhuman brawls. I enjoyed the imagination on display during its brief Kryptonian prologue, too, and would welcome a little further exploration on that front, minus the austere gravitas of its impending demise. So the effects work is top-notch, if occasionally shaded by the nagging indulgences that continue to plague CG sporgasbords. Sadly, that's one well it visits too often, and by the climactic closing battle my eyes had glossed over. Troublesome and messy, this is a grand mismatch. Superman isn't just Batman with heat vision; he's a symbol of hope, of the power of positive thought. A counterpoint to Bruce Wayne's cold, isolated self-reliance. Lacking those nuances, the character is nothing more than a hammer with a red cape. Smotheringly bleak and stressful, I feel like I suffered mild PTSD from this experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Snyder tries to make the character developments as dramatic and epic as possible that it ends making them look idiotic or dimwitted... if it was the 70s or 80s i would have probably forgiven or ignore the screenplay, but... ugh... they could have at least consulted Grant Morisson or Mark Waid on how to make the dialogues more grounded and believable. i give special mention to Michael Shannon and Antje Traue as they definitely stole the movie, props to them.second, the action and battles: this movie won't disappoint, Snyder went out guns-a-blazing in all the set pieces for the movie. i advise watchers to never leave the seat on every fight scene, as they are definitely worth it... it's up in there with Avengers in this category.verdict: if you want a good non-sense superhero action destruction extravaganza that the nerdy comic-book reading-kid in you, and your kids (if you're married) would enjoy to watch, this is that movie. but if you're looking for substance/story and character development, do not watch and stay away like the plague, as this will make your brain ache and bleed.5/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie starts off with superman's father stealing something called the codex which has the DNA settings for everyone on krypton. Then stores the codex on the ship that he is sent to Earth where we then skip to him on a crab boat where a nearby oil rig is about to explode superman then leaps off the ship and saves the remaining men on board but then falls into the ocean were the rather unique story telling begins we fallow Clark as he goes from place to place saving people and doing good deeds but every time that he sees something that reminds him of his childhood we are launched into flash backs where we learn how he controls his powers and emotions. Half way through the movie we see that a small group of kryptonians has survived the planets destruction and want to capture Clark to answer for his father's crimes and revive the kryptonian races. Then the story reaches its climax the movie ends.

I like Hans Zimmer and his work with the last Batman series, but this time the chemistry doesn't work and the soundtrack doesn't help the movie. Mr JJ Abraham, please don't mess up with the music of SW! But as you didn't with the one of Star Trek I think that there is no worry about that.I can't say I didn't like it or really like.

While in Superman II, Zod is portrayed as pathologically arrogant and pompous, bored with the ease of overtaking Earth, and whose only motivation seemed to be that he wanted people to kneel before him, in this film, his honest intentions for the common good of his planet, and the struggle between an inextinguishable inner conflict that has continued to plague him, and his belief in the ideal of Krypton make him easy to identify with, and universal to an extent that will give viewers a powerful contradiction of emotions by feeling remorse for the fatal flaws that have driven him to react with evil. In short, Superman and General Zod epitomize everything that both a hero and a villain should be: complex and relateable.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This review is my personal opinion, I am not a movie critic, I am an ordinary person who loves films. I go to the cinema for the sheer escapism of film and to be entertained.So the question is ... did this movie entertain me ? My Answer to that question is a 10 Star YES, it most certainly did.As with the New Star Trek movies, this is a retelling of the Superman Story and it is done in a non-stop, action packed manner. The film is a shade over 2 Hours 20 Minutes and I have to say, it did not seem that long. There are flashbacks to fill in some of the character / plot background and I think this all works very well. All the actors deliver solid performances and I like the new Lois. I actually found the original Lois (Margot Kidder) a little annoying.The movie looks and sounds fantastic, the action scenes do seem a little frenetic at times, but for me this did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.I haven't seen Iron Man 3, but I have seen some good (in my books) movies this year including Star Trek, Fast 6, Oblivion and Flight, which up until today was the movie of the year for me. However, Man of Steel now takes that honour.I believe that films are a very personal thing, everyone has their own tastes, likes and dislikes. No matter what you read from professional critics or ""Joe Public"" at the end of the day only you can decide whether you like a film or not.However, I believe it is highly likely you will enjoy it too. It is Superman, a different Superman and all the better for being that bit different.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

An attractive lead star clad in a suitably cinematic outfit (he's even got a cape!) with some mind-blowing powers, facing down enemies with similarly nasty powers and some very big spaceships. And don't worry, there's plenty of explosions, rubble and torn up roads added into the mix.Sadly, that's about all this film offers, which relegates ""Man of Steel"" to, well, a generic superhero movie. I am not, of course, downplaying the superhero movie genre for it can indeed produce some truly brilliant films. But where ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy was dark, gritty and realistic and where ""The Avengers"" was ambitious in its concept and simply hilarious, and where ""Iron Man 3"" saw great character development of Tony Stark, ""Man of Steel"" offers nothing. The story starts of promising enough, touching upon what is a gripping and entertaining theme - with some spectacular visuals to boot – it goes downhill from there, descending into what is the very bare bones of any superhero move. Even the 'discovering himself' part of the film is too bland and too usual. While you can't fault the effects, there's very little other substance in the film, very little character development, very little emotion and even the 'problem' of the film is not really very problematic. There's no moment, unlike in, say, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" where we think 'hell, how on Earth is he going to get out of this one?' The latter point is particularly disappointing as director Zach Snyder had some great material to work with – the universally recognizable kryptonite – which could have really made us bite our nails in suspense at Superman's predicament.But there's almost nothing like any of that in the film. The vast, vast majority of the film you are simply sitting, unmoving and unemotional, watching explosion after destroyed building after explosion. You're never sitting on the edge of your seat, you're never shocked and you're probably never moved to even contemplate crying. The rare emotional moments come in a series of flashbacks of Clark's past life, which makes me think that this film would have been far better off as an origin movie, chartering how Superman came to discover his powers and adapt in this alien world in which he finds himself growing up.To sum up, this is a solidly entertaining film, with some fantastic effects and decent acting and a passable plot. Don't get me wrong, effects and action are great, but a film needs something more but this one does have any more. It lacks substance and has very little meat on the bones, as it were. Instead, ""Man of Steel"" tries to make up for this by adding in yet more explosions and other effects. Does it make up for it? No, it doesn't.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was a great story, the tear jerker scenes were amazing, the movie had great action and a fantastic cast. My only complaint would be that it was a bit too long at the very end and the fight scene seemed to drag on a bit. I assume if people from out of this world were fighting and had super powers it would be something as it was, but for me, just a bit too drawn out. Henry is stunning and Russell Crow just as handsome :) Def. go see this movie. Im not sure i can see it again, but glad i saw it once. Cant wait to see the follow up on this movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I couldn't even make it past the 1st hour it was so bad. Now I'm all for a multi verse setting but this remake is just pure fanfiction. Not only did Snyder change the topology of Krypton (Ice Planet) but Jor El flying babies from the Matrix, just had me thinking what the hell is going on here? From the poor choice of Zod, forgetting about the Phantom Zone and the slow pace of the movie, it's just not Superman. Sorry Henry Cavill, he tried to the best with the crap he was given. I am so disappointed in this and do't blame DC for saying this is not canon. It's just bad.","4 out of 19 found this helpful.

Every single element of it was brilliant. Yes, it did seem slightly jumpy at the beginning, but in reflection I think it just makes it more efficient, so as to avoid being slow, and yes, the Lois relationship did escalate quickly. There were slight imperfections, but nothing to get hung up on, this is an action movie after all. The second he hits Zod for the first time (outside his home) I went ecstatic. The action managed to be consistent and lengthy but at no point boring, nor did it seem overdone, the story and characters were at the heart of every battle, making it respectable and awe-inspiring. + The way the action was presented on screen was quite original and extremely effective, particularly the first flight scene which was just exhilarating. Anyone who refuses to enjoy this film, I feel bad for you because that was one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. Far from generic, it had no real plot failings and it was fast, beautiful, thrilling, funny(in parts), exciting, touching, mesmerising and most of all... epic. Beautifully epic. It had it all. One of the best films I have ever seen.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Is it going to live up to your expectations? Are you going to be okay with some of the changes? Are the critics completely off base with their reviews. The answer is absolutely, without a doubt, a resounding YES!!! So friends and fans, take off your Donner goggles (and if you don't understand that then don't worry the above paragraph and perhaps the rest of this probably doesn't apply to you), sit back, and enjoy my take on Man of Steel.I'll sum this up quickly folks, this movie isn't about a Midwestern alien farm boy turned superhero, it's about an alien finding his humanity in a world that might not be ready for him. I'll admit I do have to agree with some critics, the movie definitely has it's slow spots, primarily for about 20 to 30 minutes after we first see the suit, so be prepared. But, that said I will also say that there isn't a single second of this film that is unnecessary, every bit of it builds to the development of Superman as a character and to the fantastic climax in the end. So though there may be times where you feel you can sneak out of the theater for a quick visit to the concession stand or bathroom, I recommend you stay seated and focused so you don't miss anything important.The action is amazing, we finally, FINALLY get to see Superman let loose with years of pent up anger and frustration on a villain that can take a beating, and although the destruction that comes in the wake of those fights may be gratuitous at times, it's all perfectly placed within the story. If you thought the final battle in The Avengers was awesome, be prepared to have your eyes opened, Man of Steel manages to do with one hero what The Avengers couldn't do with a team of heroes.For fans of previous incarnations of Superman, keep a keen eye out for three specific scenes where to me, Henry Cavill looked just like Tom Welling and Christopher Reeve. I won't give away too much, but look for the Tom Welling moments in the first cemetery scene, and at the Daily Planet, and the Reeve scene well, let's just say that Superman is in the light you'll figure it out.As far as problems I have with this movie, there aren't any. As a die-hard Superman fan there is nothing in this movie that I felt was misguided or misplaced, and nothing was done without Superman first weighing the consequences. This movie does justice to our hero, but like I said before, leave the Donner goggles at home or you just might miss the point.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nolanists get disappointed that in fact it's far from being a Nolan movie, instead it's a more emotional and action focused than an intellectual and abstract attempt.It has a clear messianic vision about superman and not hiding it, the objectivism is throughout the whole movie and doesn't derail the viewers into making up their own interpretations, it's has family values, superman's unshakable virtues, spousal dynamic between Lois and Clark. All these might seem fiction to modern day people, but the movie keeps it in things that matter.Snyder has his visions rooted in relationship of the characters while not forgetting it's a superman movie, he didn't make a Snyder movie with a superman license.Nolanists review bombing this movie means they are not comfortable with the objective nature of the movie. They want to complicate things that don't need to in order to make more relative and interpretative ad nausea.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Man of Steel. A darker, grittier Superman for the modern age.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814633/?ref_=tt_urv","smudgeykins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44264886/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","So far, many of the reviews for 'Man of Steel' have been very mixed, ranging from those who loved every second, to those who walked out of the cinema in disgust.I believe 'Man of Steel' has delivered the Superman that we've been waiting for.While the Christopher Reeve films that we all know, are and always will be, classics, they don't fit into a world that has been through years of war, terrorism, economic decline and general hardship. Yes, there are many out there who, for those reasons alone, would prefer to see a light hearted take on Superman with un-wavering morals, but 'Man of Steel' is designed to throw us into a scenario where we can connect with Superman.Kal-El, the last true son of Krypton, sent to Earth to escape a dying planet by his father, magnificently portrayed by Russel Crowe. On Earth he is raised by his adoptive human parents, where he develops his super powers. A terrifying experience for a young child, and an alienating one for an adolescent. Eventually the young boy grows up, driven to do good ever before learning of his true heritage.However, Kal-El, Clark Kent, HAS been raised on Earth, surrounded by other humans, and as the film points out several times, he is as much a son of Earth as Krypton. So when General Zod and his followers locate Superman on Earth, launching an attack, the man of steel isn't going to be the Superman of the 70s. This is a man prone to all the normal human emotions, including anger.Much of the film is set over a short period of time, less than 24 hours. The action is intense and fast paced, but so is combat in real life. That's what we should keep in mind here, realism. This new Superman gives us a very real hero, not a being that is so impossibly powerful that emotions never factor into the challenge of saving the world, but someone who knows what has to be done and how to do it.Superman is violent, but justified. He strives to do the right thing, but is aware that the right thing requires more than just good morals.The final fight between Superman and Zod climaxes in a shocker which will leave you stunned. Again, this is not the Superman we knew. It is an emotionally charged scene when the gravity of the situation is realised by the viewer.Does it all work? Well, 'Man of Steel' is not a perfect film. It doesn't try to be. It's an introduction to a brand new Superman, not the slightly camp version we knew, but a Superman for the present day and age, where battles are violent and fast paced and people die but remains a true hero story where good can triumph over evil when good people put aside their fears and aren't afraid to get their hands a little dirty. People expecting to see the Superman they grew up with, will be disappointed. People wanting to see a Superman who can and will fight and want to see some realistic action while being inspired will love every minute.Henry Cavill is excellent in his first major role, taking on one of the most well known and respected characters in movie and comic history and is supported by outstanding performances from Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe.See this movie!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Little substance, mostly enjoyable and better than Snyder's Sucker Punch.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2815985/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2013","In 2005 Christopher Nolan reinvented Batman. In 2013 Zack Snyder has a go at shaking off the Christopher Reeve years and atoning for Sucker Punch. And Watchmen.Man of Steel is a good attempt. It's reasonably fun, mostly enjoyable and kick-starts another franchise, but isn't so much Batman Begins as Superman Stagnates.You know the essentials so I won't insult you with a backstory.Man of Steel kicks off with a fight between Jor-El (Robin Hood Dad No. 1, Russell Crowe) and General Zod (Michael Shannon) as the former friends fall out spectacularly, Krypton disintegrates and tedium steps dangerously close for the audience. It's a protracted sequence that, though it matters to Kal-El/Superman's life, doesn't need to take quite so long; a theme that runs through the film.Then comes a blast of freshness from Robin Hood Dad No. 2: Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, the finder and adoptive father of Clark and the finest aspect of the film. There's a depth and tenderness to his performance that is evident in much of his work but sorely lacking in Snyder's film. Thereafter we bounce from set piece to set piece with little of consequence linking it. It's not that these set pieces are poorly staged (far from it), it's just that there's no substance beyond them.It's a great shame because Superman is perhaps the most identifiable superhero, Henry Cavill is a stroke of casting genius (in looks at least) and the principal supporting cast enhances the film nicely (and, yes, my use of such a bland word is entirely deliberate). With Marc Webb's reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, he gave Andrew Garfield half the film to develop the character of Peter Parker, which allowed us to understand and identify with him. Here, I still don't feel any empathy for Clark.Man of the moment, Michael Shannon, on strikingly good form in The Iceman, resorts to chewing the scenery and picking up a fat pay cheque in Man of Steel but he is always watchable and it's certainly not cringeworthy in a Rhys Ifans (as the lizard) kind of way.Conversely, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane not as an egotistical preener with an axe to grind but as a regular journalist seeking a story and a decent human in search of the good in the world.At 143 minutes, I felt as though I aged through every single one of them, unlike Zod et al who look unchanged after 30 years of travelling. But all is not lost. As my companion mumbled as we departed ""I think tomorrow it won't have been as bad as you think it is today."" He's right. With a few days distance Man of Steel has earned another star from me and I'm happy to give it another viewing, now that my expectations have been reduced. After the sheer joy of Nolan's five-star trilogy, the Iron Man films, and even The Avengers perhaps I'd set my hopes too high and forgotten that we are talking about Zach Snyder here...Mostly Man of Steel is more than adequate but it verges on tedious and that is the fault of the director. In the final scenes he even resorts to some minor comedy in the form of a gushing soldier who swoons after Superman and simpers to her CO, ""He's hot."" It feels as though Snyder had doubts over the tone of the film at the last minute and is only marginally less jarring than Lois' query early on: ""What if I need a tinkle?"" Maybe it's Snyder's way of telling us he's taking the p...Superman deserves more than this, but at least it's better than Sucker Punch.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

But the way my eyes welled up during the very first sequence in Krypton made me know I was in for something special. This is an origin movie. As any other Superhero origin movie, it has a complex and difficult task. It needs to introduce many characters, build depth, while entertaining the audience. The entertainment part in a Superhero origin movie usually happens after the character's powers are developed. However, in Man of Steel, through impeccable casting, particularly in the form of Russel Crowe who absolutely killed it as Jor-El, and Lane/Costiner, the first half of the movie had its fair share of entertainment while building depth and back story never before seen in a Superman movie. The Krypton scenes are a sight to behold, as the planet is brought into life in a way never before seen on any production. Flashback's of Clark in Smallville carry a lot of emotional depth, building up for the spectacle of action that is the second half of the movie. Seeing the trailer, I was worried the movie would not be able to do the story justice. I felt it wanted to do more than what time would allow, but remarkably, they pulled it off. As seen with the Dark Knight Trilogy, now that the characters have been introduced, the sequel can only be better than what was already a pitch perfect Superman origin movie. I left the movie 100% satisfied with the action a Superman movie deserves, with sore eyes that shed tears I never saw coming. 10/10, with thanks and compliments to the producer, director, writer, and spectacular cast.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"5","/10","The silver bullet flies far past its target","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2815176/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is an exhausting summer blockbuster, clocking in at one-hundred and forty-three long minutes and boasting enough special effects that could be adequately housed in two one-hundred minute films. By the time the credits roll, I was ready to admit defeat to the film's non-stop special effects and sixty-five minute concluding battle-scene. Just when you think it's over, out pops another trap or accessory that has the ability to start things all over again. Things like that are when I begin to think superhero films are almost cheating at their own game.The big question is will this satisfy comic-book readers and please devotees of the caped-man in blue? I honestly have no idea. It rewinds time, yet again, to produce another origins story about the imminent destruction of the planet Krypton, which results in Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sending his infant son down to Earth. His son's pod crashes in Kansas, where he is raised by a gracious religious couple played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane under the name ""Clark Kent."" Clark grows up with unearthly powers, such as the ability to shoot laser-beams out of his eyes and see through walls and skin. Later in life, he evolves into Superman, and his duty calls when General Zod (Michael Shannon) threatens the safety of the planet Earth if he isn't returned to him at once.Superman, this time around, is played by Henry Cavill, a likable soul who is unfortunately burdened by inhabiting an entirely cold shell of a superhero. Superman has almost no personality, and is even robbed of the internal Clark Kent/Superman identity crisis that has been so prominent since Superman's surface in the comic books. If anything, from watching the original 1978 classic a matter of days ago and viewing this one, it seems that both films portray him as nothing more than the textbook hero figure that comes equipped with heavy morality and inert development. It seems that the character's mood is shaped not over time but by the characters close to him, such as the Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Zod, or his parents. He doesn't appear to possess the ability to develop through his own internal-thought process and remains almost a voodoo doll to others in terms of what he should do and how he should do it; there's little independent thinking going on in his head. He almost always does what is expected of him and that's no fun.In addition, Snyder misses a bold opportunity at exploring the agony of the character. In a scene lasting roughly three minutes, he shows a young and overwhelmed Clark Kent in the classroom, becoming nauseated and dizzied over his incredible powers of seeing through skin of him and his classmates. Upset, frazzled, and deeply concerned over his well-being and sanity, he runs into a closet and locks the door, shunning himself from the schoolchildren and further ostracizing himself as a ""freak."" The scene, however, solves this immense conflict in a matter of minutes and never returns to the core idea that these powers are curses and not benefits. This frustrating agony in Kent's everyday life is left massively unexplored and we get an underwhelming taste on what the possibilities could bring.Aside from Superman, most of the other characters lack recognizable identities. Shockingly empty and left untouched is Lois Lane, who seems nothing more than the obligatory lead rather than the well-known female protagonist of the entire franchise. Zod, while having the benefit of being played by the remarkable and amazingly talented Michael Shannon, is a pretty ordinary villain, with ordinary superpowers and a numbing ability at producing predictable lines. His time to shine, and the entire film's in retrospect, is when Zod's UFO in the sky shuts down all electricity and plays a demanding message on all electronics demanding Superman's detainment. It's a creepy scene, pulled off effectively because of its unexpected timing and the tremendous eeriness that comes along with the robotic video. Sadly, it takes up about two minutes of this endeavor.Excusing all of the aforementioned details, Man of Steel really amplifies the chaos in the action department. The final battle takes up almost half of the entire film, and featuring dizzying camera-work, indiscernible action, chaotic repetition of Superman and Zod careening into building, and loud, overly-bombastic sound-effects that sit right up there with ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" I almost feel guilty critiquing this part, since I talked down about the excessive use of slow-motion videography in Snyder's 300. Now, I wish he at least slowed this film down to a more watchable level. Shots begin and end so quickly, the rapid-fire editing does nothing to the overall suspense or quality, and the final battle, itself, defines muchness in cinema. There becomes a point went ""coolness"" becomes monotonous and I think that could accurately sum up much of Snyder's career in film.Man of Steel was written by David S. Goyer, who penned all three installments of Nolan's Batman trilogy. Christopher Nolan, himself, donates his name as a producer's credit on this film as well. Despite these talented names behind the scenes and the effective actors in front of the camera, ""Man of Steel"" hardly has a leg to stand on. It doesn't capture its environment, character, or its depth even half as well as the aforementioned ""Batman"" trilogy did, and leaves its character wholly vacant of personality and its action muddled and sloppy. Man of Steel could definitely take notes from The Dark Knight Rises in terms of recognizing humanity in its title character and disregarding ponderous action sequences. Action sequences are only memorable for so long; character conflicts and relationships in superhero films are what make them memorable and even relatable. With this film, Superman, again, remains an alien to the public as he does many of the characters in this film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I understand that critics are divided and there's nothing I can do about it. We cannot please everyone, and that is a fact. That being said, here it goes: I loved ""Man of Steel"". And if that statement isn't enough, I must confess I have seen it seven times. Every single session is an exciting moment for me and while some may call me exaggerated, I can only say I am totally addicted to this film.I have never been a fan of comics, something that usually grows on you once you start it. But I did fall in love with Superman when I saw Christopher Reeve flying over Metropolis and saving the world. I can't remember how many times I sat through those movies to see Reeve and dream of a dignified man whose only purpose in life was to save the less fortunate from danger. And since then Reeve has stood as the most perfect man of steel in history. He was the man who could fly.When Bryan Singer brought us the man of steel back in 2006 I was glad to watch my favorite superhero take flight once again, even though the memories I had from the 1978 version were still fresh. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the new movie that took a different turn and managed to keep me entertained. I know the story was a bit out of tune, especially after watching Donner's version of the second installment. But I still could smile and dream once again of Superman.Zack Snyder's visionary version blew me away many times, turning me into an addict. How can we not love Henry Cavill in the suit? He is talented, sweet and humble like Superman should always be. ""Man of Steel"" is the best movie ever. I love everything about it, regardless of what they say. Yes, it is quite destructive to some and even controversial to others. The bottom line is that Superman returned to stay. It's a new vision from beginning till the end, where Snyder doesn't bother repeating ideas because he's too good for that. He is not afraid of pushing the envelope and being original to the point of giving us the impression that Superman is like a Phoenix, reborn to something better and promising.Hans Zimmer's amazing score is a pleasure to my ears. Yes, I love John Williams' work, so much so that I do own his original album, as well as John Ottman's work on ""Superman Returns"". But Zimmer took a chance, just like Snyder. He created something completely new and as much as being able to give wings to a new theme and sound, Zimmer's score is addictive. I listen to it every single day, nonstop. Call me crazy, I don't care, it is here: a masterpiece for anyone who dares to dream and be different.Seven times and counting, until I can get it on Blu-ray and enjoy it again and again in the privacy of my own living room. Thank you Snyder for such a colossal piece of work. I just love you!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Good for a Triple A Plus Moody rating. So 10 stars. Now to the downside, which are the off target rounds. A question is asked to Kal-El [ Did they loose it at Time-Warner? ] : What does the S stand for ? What then follows is a very damaging bull-crap tale, even for the many young kids watching. Don't insult their intelligence. The correct answer should have been : The S? Well we on Krypton were created by two men : Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The initials of both our founding fathers are thus the same : J.S. Our latest era has been created by Zack Snyder, a misnomer of Jack Snyder, so in principal also J.S., but as the signs of our times correctly predicted, he changed into Zack Snyder. Zack will never admit to that and was actually intimidated a bit by general Zod. The end times for the Superman series will arrive when Hollowood cannot come up anymore with decent director/producers, albeit types designated Joe Shmo. The title of the movie, Man of Steel, also reflects how the S brand has descended into muddy legal waters, even more as the marvelous Iron trade-mark has emerged in recent years, featuring tireless Stan Lee, not to be mistaken for some Stainless Steel Tool.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They are fans of the Christopher reeve era of superman. Which always felt like superman wasn't that super. In this however we get a feel for supermans power. The origin story of krypton is amazing, the visuals of the planet and the technology are very well thought up. Russell Crowe was very good as Jor el, supermans father. We see him trying to save his planet through his son only to be confronted by the villain general Zod. Zod is sent into exile off planet while krypton is destroyed. He only wants the survival of his race and needs something that was in Supermans pod to do this. We then get various flashbacks to Clark Kents up bringing but it doesn't go too much into it, this I think was the weak point in other superman films. Superman is then led to a ship hidden on earth with a ghost of his real father who equips him with the knowledge and superman suit. From there we see Zod invade we his team of kryptonians. From there the visuals are amazing, we see whole towns and cities levelled. Zack Snyder uses his signature slow mo for the fight scenes and it works beautiful to show the gravity of their powers. All in all if people would stop comparing and keep an open mind. Man of steel is the superman movie that people have been waiting for. It shows how powerful he can be and isn't as predictable as other superman movies. Gets a 9 out of 10 from me :)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I find it irksome that I have to create a user account and complete all the bells and whistles just to submit a comment. However I was willing to suffer though it because of two things: 1. This was a great movie! 2. The one star ratings were pissing me off!I've watched all of the Superman movies (from the 70's-06) and I can honestly say ""Man of Steel"" was the most fulfilling. This movie made Superman a more authentic character. I loved the flashbacks, I loved Lois Lane (who was also more authentic), even though I personally don't care for Rusell Crowe he did a superb acting job as well. This movie needed actors/actresses that were more than eye candy to allow this film to reach it's potential-I'm glad acting veterans such as Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Harry Lennix, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne and Christopher Meloni were cast. They all were excellent! It doesn't hurt that Henry Cavill is a hell of an actor who's extremely easy on the eyes either. He rocked it! I'm not going to give away any of the plot of this movie because I strongly urge you to experience it firsthand. If you are a comic book fan of Superman or enjoy Super Hero movies- you shouldn't be disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

These for me took the same meaning as the films - like in Thor when he goes to fight in protection of Earth, even when he knows he may not be able to. But they paled for me in the fact that Superman wasn't really in any danger - and there was a cataclysmic amount of damage otherwise *but don't worry, they remembered to throw in him saving the girl, and an army dude lol (winning favour much?)*.But for me character development, relationships and true depth of intimacy was just lacking, and I definitely don't think this Superman should have anything to do with Justice League - Clark Kent wouldn't have let... you know what happen... etc. But the true gold in this film was in it's relevance in cultural terms - drawing similarities with Prometheus style designs (the suits btw were truly AWESOME) - the concept of alienation and home etc, and it's originality in approaching the superhero movie in a non-superhero way - *minor spoiler* - he F's up some guy's truck lol.In conclusion - it made sense that 'Superman' was danced around during the movie, and wasn't in the title - as Superman isn't really what to expect here.But regardless the movie was remarkably entertaining - if only for the newest action-based special effects, but I don't think Cavill really 'found' Superman, and in my opinion Routh's Superman would make for a much better Justice League movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I adore it for its Emotion, fight scenes,Cinematography and the overwhelmingly Underrated score. General zod was one of the best Villain portrayal. The First 15 minutes of krypton was excellent. The Last moment of Fight scene between zod and supe was well done and the destruction happen was awesome.

So this movie doesn't deserve the rating it received the entire movie was epic to me it was just as great as the Dark knight but brought a different feel to the DC Universe it is a must go see its the best Superman movie ever superman kicks major ass the entire time i felt like i was playing DC vs Mortal Kombat but DC is giving marvel a taste of greatness because Man of Steel has a lot to offer it will get Fan boys super pumped and make other grab a box of tissues because this movie is sad for the first half of the movie then an epic last half of the movie its full of action like the last hour is action it does send you on a roller coaster and doesn't give you time to breathe and take in what just happened but the premise serves right Henry Cavil is Superman he is as humble as Christopher Reeves and brings in the big Punch that superman has been missing in all of his movies. Michael Shannon as Zod was a great fit for him he serves a purpose to why he is doing what he needs and have to do. The supporting cast like Lois Lane is pretty good nothing spectacular but still great she is a different Lois lane not so much the damsel in distress. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are fantastic at being father figures in this movie great for a fathers day holiday movie. After that being said please go see this movie its EPIC its great its very emotional its Superman. If you cant get passed the darkness of the tone of the movie then people cant except change DC is not trying to play the Marvel game where ever film seems to be a comedy action epic like the Avengers and i loved The Avengers its my favorite superhero movie of all time that and The Dark Knight but this is a whole new ball game DC and Marvel are competing and competition can be key it sets us apart (iPhone vs Android) (MAC vs PC) and I'm ending this review with this superman is based off of The Bible yeah i went there you go see it and make your feelings about it and the movie has a lot of symbols towards The Bible and you may want to pay attention to that i think this is the most controversial superhero movies of all time because they have people who don't like it people who do like it and people who loved the crap out of it like me Man of Steel, The Dark Knight, and The Avengers are my favorite superhero movies of all time as of now they all have different tones different directors and different styles the only way you compare The Dark Knight Trilogy to Man of Steel is in the writing because of David Goyer and The Avengers is in its own world because in their case Joss Weldon wrote and directed it. I just wish this wasn't so much about what the other movies got going on and the film writers and directors have going on with their movies let Marvel work their own Disney kid friendly magic and let DC take on the darker tone and adult mind thinking tone. Don't judge this movie because its not The Dark Knight or The Avengers or even Iron Man let it send you on an emotional roller coaster and think about the entire meaning of it all.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

They say it's a joke. They say it's not Superman. Does this sound familiar? In the coming years people will look back at this movie like we look back at Starship Troopers (1997): they will watch it, enjoy the awesome fights, recognize its self-reflection, and ultimately find it endearing. ""Endearing"" is the perfect word for this movie. Superman is a lost, almost hipster, soul. His home world has been melodramatically, but awesomely, destroyed and now it's come back to haunt the human race. Characters often state platitudes both emotional and philosophical, but that only makes us like them more. As the amazing fights climax with Hans Zimmer's best score yet, audiences have two options: laugh and pretend like your smarter than Snyder, or smile and join the fun. I suggest you join the fun. There's no reason not to. This is a great movie. In many ways this film is as cheesy as the old Superman films. It's just cheesy in a modern way. It uses all the modern conventions to their logical conclusion: non-linear story, grittiness, ""realism,"" the damsel in distress has been replaced with a supposedly strong female lead despite the fact that she still actively plays the old role... What's there to hate? I'm serious. I don't understand why people don't like this movie. Then again, I never understood why people didn't like Starship Troopers. These films know what they are, but don't care, and that's something I'll always love.

Brandon Routh must be kicking himself right now. It was easy to see where Warner Brothers/DC were going with Man of Steel. Making superhero movies that overlap similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be no simple task. Lovers of all things DC are excited for what's to come. Zack Snyder was a good choice, replacing the 'rumoured' Christoper Nolan in the Director's chair. Man of Steel is hard, rough, often accompanied by a sheen to the surface that J.J. Abrams would be proud of. Henry Cavill has the steel to fill the boots of this now hardened superhuman. He battles with inner struggles, both as Clark Kent and the hero, always on the move, never being totally accepted. All eyes fall on him when an evil tyrant from Krypton wants to save his race by annihilating Earth's. The chaos that ensues Michael Bay would be proud of. Man of Steel is heavy on CGI, but not so much that it strips away the story. Kent and journalist Lois Lane's (Adams) romance is quick off the mark, never as meaningful as it should be. The editing can be a little clunky. MoS marches quickly from scene to another, sometimes getting lost on the way, but mostly packing a lot of intensity into its 2 hour running time. The pressure's now on for Snyder to kill Dawn of Justice. July 2016 couldn't come any quicker.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unmatched action, put all the marvel movies together in the last 2 years, it will still be difficult to match the extent and ferocity of this movie, though to some it was just too excessive but I loved every bit the movie offered 2. Non chronological way of storytelling adds freshness and a different feel to this movie, which most people expected from the biggest blockbuster of this summer. 3. General Zod (Michael Shannon) & Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) they form a perfect lethal and apt rivals to Superman 4. Fresh take on the destruction, in that last 10 years there has been 100's of movies showing destruction of earth, but this one really would remind many people 9/11. Good or bad, but the effects are very neat, real and emotional 5. Special effects, this was expected to be world class and indeed the special & visual effects will not disappoint anyone. 6. Krypton: this movie will give a feeling of watching an alien movie they way krypton is shot with the originality and unique display of their planet, though reminding little bit of Avatar Cons: 1. Unsymmetrical way of storytelling destroys the fluidity and fluency in this movie, and at times it feels like watching episodes from a serialediting in this movie is not what one would expect it to be 2. Humor: People want and expect humor, this is a popcorn summer flick, there zero humor and probably the biggest drawback of this movie3. Romantic connection between Louis lane and Superman is total waste, probably this is where marvel movies excel this one.Overall this movie does not disappoint and worth going out with friends and family for a nice evening, I will wait for the director's cut to see if there more emotional content to be offered in this one this version still deserves a minimum 9 on 10, for all the things it offered and going beyond the expectations in terms of action offered","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Man of steel. What happened with the camera. The camera was trembling sooo much. It was terrible. Also there are no big problems with the screenplay. Directing ruined the film. Snyder showed us a dark version of Superman, in a movie so dark while he tried to tell us that he was a hopefull hero. Just watch this and then watch the Donner's versions. The difference is that Superman in the older films, actually gives hope.
the actors did a great job but they couldnt save the movie.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I stopped reading critics' reviews because they were discouraging me. As it turns out, most of these 'experienced' critics, apparently, were looking for either a comic reel or an Oscar performance. What you get, instead, is a revolutionary piece of superhero cinema that the die-hard fan, and average movie-watcher, alike, will thoroughly enjoy. Every movie has a certain level of due complaint. You could examine this movie and come up with a number of them if you looked deeply enough. Some dialogue might come out as cheesy, or certain scenes might have you scratching your head. I can attest that these occurrences are very few. This movie is mature, and well thought out. However, you're a little overwhelmed by all the moving parts and speed (action) at times. There were about two too many inspiring parables spewed by his real and adoptive parents. He saves the girl multiple times, kisses her -very cliché, but it is Superman, after all. The \S/ stands for hope, it's an alien invasion movie, it's drenched with tender story and exciting sequence, all at once. People are dying, and it's up to Kal, House of El, to save an entire race from what's, effectively, his fault. Powerful imagery, strong script, moving characters, and compassion transcend this film. The landscape, scope that Snyder creates for Krypton is mesmerizing, intriguing, and left you wanting (in a good way). At first, you think this is a science fiction movie, and less a comic book superhero flick. It's loaded with the highest quality CGI and action, all the characters are believable, the story is well organized, and not rushed, much to my surprise. Unlike Singer's Superman Returns, Kal gets to fight! Russell Crowe had a lot of well-placed screen time that amplified every scene. Despite his antagonistic role on Premium Rush, Michael Shannon was incredibly impressive. We find a very talented, non-irritating, Lois Lane in Amy Adams. Faora, played by Antje Traue, nearly steals Zod's excuse me, General Zod's fire, and Henry Cavill dominated his new role. You feel for Kevin Costner and Diane Lane's characters as they have to endure raising the savior of the world. All these compliments were my biggest fears, but those fears where mercilessly extinguished.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This particular Superman is a a plot that is bit different than their predecessors in term of their stories, but still overall the story is okay. What get's me is the CGI on the movie. It's just too much CGI and the Hollywood recipe of panic has always been the same. People panicking and that is okay, but the fact that they wait until the last moment before they run away from a cataclysmic event is beyond my understanding. Come on, I know this is just a movie but why not make it more realistic. People do not normally wait for something to come down on them, but they try to avoid the danger. When you see building all around you are being destroyed, you do not wait until the building next or the one you are one is being hit. And there is one thing with all the Superman movies. Is it logical that you can not recognize a person just because he or she is taking off his or her glasses ? I don't think so...","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I have seen Star Wars in the movie theatre 10 times when I was 7 years old. I watched bladerunner alone at a matinée when I was 12 years old. I spent all of my paper route money on candy and DC Comics, Superman WAS my GUY!. I've been a Sci Fi fan since 1970, watched every VHS, DVD, BLU RAY, since then. I LOVE MOVIES. I LOVE SCI FI. I LOVE COMIC BOOK MOVIES. I really do like how marvel has developed there characters and taken the time to develop a universe. I watched buffy AND angel and used to say ""Joss Whedon is a genius, and if they ever gave him a big screen budget, a comic book generia, he'd blow people away!"". and guess what? they gave him avengers. And I absolutely love the ""campy"" touch and humor he has given that universe. love Avengers!Maybe when it comes to superman, ""fan boys"" want ""Christopher Reeves"" Campy version. I am old enough to remember the first time my parents took me to superman 1 and 2 in the theater in the 70's and 80's and still remember the euphoria I felt driving home after superman defeated Zod AND Luthor. I was swimming in the amazement of a young boy feeling ""super"". I do understand those days. But, entertainment has evolved sooo much since then.When I parse out the masterpiece Zack Snyder made of the new retelling of and old canon, I am mesmerized by how much thought was put into the story telling. the amount of subtle effort put into the back story of his Krypton parentage and Human parentage is brilliant because it does more than the previous moves did and frankly more than the COMICS did in defining the foundation of a man gifted AND cursed with sooo much power and sooo much baggage. The effort that was put into the subtle details of the organic and advanced technology was mind blowing. The effort that was put into the ""psychology"" of and man, alien, cursed, displaced, feeling alone, but raised with morals, was beyond comic book canon. Finally, critics ripped into how ""dark"" this superman was.... so back to the campy 70-80's then? Avengers had ""camp"" covered already, previous versions of Superman where ""campy"". So internet/fanboys/arm-chair critics... Did you really want ""Cristopher Reeves"" again? You would have crucified Zack for ""going back to the well..."".there was no other direction really, and this version gave more back story and ""humanity"" than any other incarnation.""Superman doesn't kill!"" wow, Black and White. OK. When it comes to morals, there will never be a ""black and white"" and Zack decided not to treat us like infants and tell us a story about the ""grey"" of moral choices.... some people may not understand that. I get it. Policemen, firefighters, nurses will though... This is a mature dialog and grown up retelling of a classic. 10/10 For contrast I submit this info; I just watched ""Age of Ultron"" 2 days ago, then ""re-watched"" Man of Steel tonight, as I write this review. I am actually disappointed with Age of Ultron, and quite frankly prefer the purity of story telling by Zack.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But this film isn't bad.It's definitely better than Bryan Singer's Superman. The strengths of this film are what Superman Returns lacked: a great cast, a good script, an interesting story, and a powerful music score.The cast, particularly Russell Crowe, is what saves this film. All are great for their roles. There is even some chemistry between Henry Cavil and Amy Adams, although they don't spend much time together. Unlike Richard Donner's version, this one is less about Superman and Lois than it is about Superman fulfilling his purpose in life.It's hard to imagine a Superman film without John Williams' memorable score but Hans Zimmer manages to come up with something unique, just as grand and nearly as hummable. It's a powerful, uplifting score befitting of a Superman movie with some very distinct themes. Though the score isn't quite as complete as that by John Williams-- not many music scores these days are-- it's very adequate.Of course the special effects are great. But they're nothing we haven't seen before. Some of them seem to have been inspired by the Matrix films. But that's fine. Most big budget films have such high quality special effects than they cannot differentiate from one another simply by special effects alone. They need to have-- do I dare say?-- a good cast, story, script, character development, etc. Fortunately, this film has most of that.I understand this version is supposed to be a grittier, more down to earth Superman. But ironically, it ends up being less realistic than Richard Donner's Superman. It is a little darker but darker doesn't necessarily mean more realistic. It spends too much time on the negative aspects of growing up and too little on the positive. A kid with all those powers can't be all that bad, can it?Also, this film has more of a science fiction feel which takes us even farther away from reality. It presents us with too many alien ideas, strange technology and technical details that we have a harder time to believe the setting is actually present day on earth. All these alien ideas and details should've been kept in abstract terms as they were in Donner's Superman.I would've liked to see more interaction between Superman and Lois Lane. And I would've liked for General Zod to appear in later films, not at the beginning, as was done in Donner's version. With General Zod, a man with the same powers as Superman, already appearing in this film, it's hard to imagine there could be a stronger, better foe for Superman without getting weird. There's talk about other aliens like Braniac appearing in the sequel but I'd hate to see the series go off into the deep end into science fiction fantasy.Basically, Sneider's Superman is a combination of Donner's Superman 1 and 2. Donner's Superman was lightening in a bottle. It appears there will never be a Superman film as good. Special effects do get better in these remakes. Can you imagine Donner's Superman 2 with today's special effects? I'd love to see that. All in all, Sneider's Superman is a good remake. It has a strong cast, good script and catchy original music score. It has most of the elements that made Donner's Superman great.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The handling of Clark Kent's human and alien parents is pretty much damn good, I just wish there was a bit more on them. Also a tad bit more on the alien home worlds, see a bit more off it.

There's so much chaos and toppling of buildings in the great city of Metropolis that the insurance for that must've been enormous. Henry Cavill, you have to admit, fits the cape to a tee, but he comes nowhere close to what Christopher Reeve brought to that role.This time around, Superman takes a long time in understanding the capability of his supreme powers. He's tossed around a lot like a rubber ball while the enemies from Krypton - General Zod and his henchmen, wreck havoc on Earth.I admit I got tired of all the destruction and mayhem while watching. I also got especially tired of Superman's insecurities on how to save the world and his lack of understanding on what's he's fully capable of.This comes nowhere close to capturing the majestic charm of the classic Superman films with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. It's more of a fast paced and CGI infested outing with no time to breath. Everything happens so fast.Henry Cavill is indeed hot stuff as the latest version of the classic Superman, but he can't capture what Christopher Reeve brought to that role. He seems to be just ""eye candy"" for his attempts and nothing more.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

"9","/10","An amazing insight into the difficulties one faces in accepting the very idea of a being like Superman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3366649/?ref_=tt_urv","denislavg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24570357/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2015","Written by David S. Goyer with the help of none other than Christopher Nolan and helmed by director Zack Snyder, Man of Steel is, in my personal opinion, an essential movie for any fan of the superhero genre. The film delivers amazing visuals, intense action scenes, a mesmerizing score by Hans Zimmer and is a wonderful character introduction to a new, modern Superman not content with adhering to any preconceptions about the character but instead trying to showcase a novel look into who Kal-El is and the struggles he has to endure in order to become the hero Earth so desperately needs. Into the heavy shoes of the titular character steps Henry Cavill who delivers a tame but on-point performance, delivering his lines with the appropriate stoicism at times, but also revealing the character's doubts, fears and anger whenever the plot demands it. And let's not undermine the fact of how difficult it is to achieve a body worthy of Superman himself, which alone shows the actor's dedication to the part. The rest of the cast, including Michael Shannon as the villain General Zod, Amy Adams as reporter and romantic interest Lois Lane and Lawrence Fisburne as her editor at the Daily Planet Perry White do a solid job as well. Special mention goes to Russel Crowe who gives a stellar performance as Superman's father Jor-El, especially in the opening sequence of the movie.Speaking of that opening sequence, which takes place on Superman's home planet of Krypton, it is a perfect example of the exemplary visual effects and creative design work that went into this film. The planet and its history are relatable and yet completely alien at the same time, in a way, making one dream of how potential spin-off set in this amazing environment could pan out. Here we see Snyder signature visuals work, with with intense zooming and change of focus while maintaining the continuation of the plot and the fluidity of the action. This style is transferred into the rest of the film, with special mention to a couple of sequences where one truly feels as if they are admiring a 15th century Italian painting with a vibrant color palette and suggestive symbolism. The first flight sequence is pure art, in my opinion. The viewer may get lost at times on first viewings as some shots are overflowing with detail, but that serves only to enrich the experience as it challenges us to pay attention and look for all the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at the future the director gives us. The action is mostly CGI, but that is completely understandable as the sheer magnitude of the situations our hero must experience can't possibly be recreated in any other way. Thereare, however, practicals and stunts effects at work here as well and they are expertly done as can be expected of such a high-budget movie affair. Superman's epic powers cannot and should not be under-emphasized as what he represents through these god-like powers is one of the, if not the central conflict of the movie. The score by famous blockbuster composer Hans Zimmer is suitably grand in scope, somehow simultaneously capturing the grandeur of the fight and action sequences, the wonder of the self-revelation sequences for the titular hero and the dread and fear at General Zod's initial appearance and subsequent malicious endeavors. Zimmer wears his inspiration from the earlier movies on his sleeve, but also makes this Superman decidedly his own.Finally, I would like to talk about the best part of the movie, the approach to the hero and his journey to become one. We are treated to a very real-life representation of what it would be to be Superman. He is an outcast, an alien, someone who destroys so many of humanity's beliefs and philosophies by his mere existence, and that is without mentioning his fearsome god-like powers. In many ways the central conflict of the movie is about the fear that mankind isn't ready and might never be able to accept a deity walking amongst them, however noble his intentions may be, and Clark's struggle to embrace who he is but also maintain what many would claim he has not - his humanity.Because, at the end, of the day, isn't that Superman's greatest appeal? That despite his awesome power, despite his ability to become mankind's greatest fear, he chooses to protect them and put his life on the line whenever the need arises, because however alien he might seem, Superman is, in fact, human. an.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is no reason to, especially when the film itself is probably the best Superman film since the very first one.I'm a Batman fan before anyone else, biased and looking at Superman as the too perfect boyscout of a hero, and personally this film changed that. I'm aware he has a definable personality in the comics and to an extent ""Superman: The Animated Series"", but for a while I just really didn't give him a chance till this film came around.The acting is great, the story is lushly and beautifully told, the action is astounding at times (though it could have been toned down slightly, but the action that was there was pretty darn impressive), and the ideal of ""Superman/hope"" is spread throughout... it's an excellent superhero movie about the most recognizable superhero: Superman.8/10, give it a watch, I don't want to give anything away, see it for yourself, decide whether or not you like it for whatever reason, but walk away from seeing this film, and ""you will believe a man can fly.""","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Oh and let's not forget how once again the all-powerful PC Race Card rears its ugly head from PC HQ (Hollywood) as suddenly Perry White is black. Well gee whiz sports fans why stop there?

The fight scenes were fantastic, the action was fantastic, Superman had depth and was very humane, it had a decent villain, and the direction by Zack Snyder was solid. Henry Cavill did an excellent job as Kal-El, and was almost as good as Christopher Reeve. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were great fathers, and Diane Lane was great as Martha Kent. The pacing is almost perfect, though there was maybe too much action. Michael Shannon's Zod wasn't as good as Terence Stamp's Zod. I do wish Lois Lane and Clark Kent had some more chemistry, that she didn't know he was Superman the whole time. I think that will take away from the classic banter of the earlier films. Overall this is a very satisfying movie, though not one of the best superhero movies. It's definitely the best Superman movie since the second Christopher Reeve film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, MOS accomplished its purpose to introduce DC's first character in their shared superhero universe. They used their crown jewel hero to begin a process that will span years of DC superhero films. Although the movie is not without faults, it does open the doors that DC fans have been waiting for years to be opened. Marvel shattered all the barriers and negativity towards superhero films and they've paved the way for DC to come in and take over this genre. I fully expect Batman vs Superman to be a magnificent depiction of the two most iconic characters the superhero world has to offer, and that's thanks to MOS. I also fully expect the DC universe to become the new standard for superhero films. The tone that MOS set showed moviegoers that DC is aiming at a much more dark and emotional experience. While Marvel has done a wonderful job, their films seem to be a bit more campy and geared more towards children. Now that we've been given so many Marvel Universe films people are wanting a bit of change. I believe the DC Universe is going to bring that change and usher in a new era of Superhero films. So my advice is to watch MOS with the mentality that this is the beginning of a whole new way to look at these types of characters and movies. MOS while is great standing on its own, will be much greater when DC uses it to give us the battles and on screen characters that we as comic book fans have only dreamed about.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It came with a lot darker tone, similar to ""The Dark Knight"", good CGI (actually, very good CGI), high production values, good acting and a relatively interesting plot.It's not a perfect movie, not by any standard. It takes a bit too long, it becomes predictable after a while and it ends without a bang.However, for all intensive purposes, it was time well spent. Superman is actually interesting here, not some perfect superhuman but a human with his own weaknesses and the battle scenes are on par with War of The Worlds.Go see it. You won't leave disappointed.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything from the art design, to the color palette is just disgusting to look at.The first 20 minutes or so, on Krypton, somehow mange to be even more boring and uninspired than the Asgard scenes in the first two Thor movies, and Zack Snyder's de-saturated color palette makes it even worse.Henry Cavill obviously cared, and he's fine, but he can hardly carry two-and-a-half hours of this movie with this stoic, one-dimensional character. What potential for drama there could have been is squandered with weirdly-placed flashbacks that ruin the pace of the movie.It gets downright laughable at the end-just two invincible godlike beings punching each other through rows and rows of buildings without even a scratch; you feel nothing. If anything, it makes Superman look like an idiot for even allowing so much destruction in the first place.Apparently this had a $225,000,000 budget? It looks like total crap.

This thematic subtext is hardly new. But Superman as a Jesus who only reluctantly accepts his mantle of saviour of humankind, and inwardly harbours a childish bitterness and resentment? A Superman who maliciously enjoys the secret thrill of being able to let loose and finally hit back, channeling decades of repression and bullying trauma into a succession of world-shattering punches, released with gleeful abandon? Much more Scorsese Jesus than Jesus Christ Superstar. This, as the inevitable comparison has it, is a far cry from the venerated days of Christopher Reeve. To say this is a Superman who speaks to this day and age would be retreading a cliché already ground into redundancy from overuse. The temptation to run rampant with clichés such as ""More 'Superman Begins' than 'Superman Returns'"" is overwhelming. And, yet, such clichés are the stock that heroes are born of, and continually validated by. Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer are both certainly fearless in tapping into the essence and mythos of the character, navigating clichés of classicism and 'dark and gritty reboot' ethos with grace and tact. Indeed, to say this the first Superman film that fully, satisfyingly, explores not only the cultural function of Superman but plumbs the depths of Kal-El/Clark Kent himself would not be an overstatement. Man of Steel is, if nothing else, overwhelming. The film is a relentless sensory overload, a breathless symphony of dazzling special effects, staggering scope of destruction (The Avengers now takes second place in collateral construction damage), and brutal, kinetic and frequently airborne fight choreography. From the first minutes, boldly opening with Russell Crowe's Jor-El riding a space dragon amidst the explosions of the dying planet Krypton undergoing a military coup. Already, Man of Steel has delivered one of the best (albeit microcosmic) sci-fi films in years. And, by this point, there is more than another two hours to go.It scarcely slows down, only hitting the pause button to allow dual dads Crowe and Kevin Costner (both as good at frowning and grunting as ever) to deliver stern monologues ratcheting Kal/Clark between divine purpose and personal choice. It also scarcely quiets down, as Hans Zimmer's magnificent score continuously bludgeons the audience with horns, drums and strings enough to leave the most desensitized audience member gasping for breath. Stunning is the word at hand, as seldom before has watching a movie felt so much like a workout. This is far from a bad thing, but hardly a relaxing watch. Nor, as most reviews have taken great pains to express, is levity on the table. Gone is the frivolity of Gene Hackman's prancing Lex Luthor and the bumbling slapstick of Reeve's Kent. This is a Superman prone to gritting his teeth rather than flashing toothy grins. Again, this is not a bad thing. The 'Nolan influence' is overwhelming, as the film even echoes the non- linear flashback structure of his seminal Batman Begins. Equally, intentionally or not, the film alludes to countless offerings from rival company Marvel, from the 'enhanced senses overload' purloined from Daredevil to the palpable glee of experimenting with powers of Spider-Man to military banter reminiscent of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer to flying shots lifted directly from Iron Man. However, Man of Steel is far from a derivative mess. In lieu of jokiness is enough sentiment to flood Metropolis. Melodrama too, granted. It is interesting to notice the film's unabashed embracing of the character being appropriated as an American cultural icon (one jaw- dropping Freudian slip minimizes Superman 'acting in the world's interests' into 'acting in America's interests'). But it is hard not to be pounded into willful submission by the film's incessant pace and noise into full embracing of the deluge of big, loud sentiment and purpose. Man of Steel hits hard, but hits undeniably true. It will be quiet the challenge to un-see Henry Cavill as Superman, as with past examples of the role resulting in extreme-typecasting-turned-career-stunting (poor Brandon Routh). However, Cavill's sublime embodiment of one of the trickiest characters to sell demonstrates an actor of extreme talent rather than limited range. As much as Cavill owns every angsty grimace and serene smile, it is the gleeful abandon he shows when 'letting loose', whether flying around the planet at top speed or bludgeoning Kryptonian adversaries, that truly calcifies his humanity. Amy Adams does her considerable best with feisty reporter Lois Lane, but is still limited by underwritten characterization that leaves her inclusion often feeling like an afterthought. There is no doubt, too, that audiences will take some acclimatizing to Michael Shannon's screaming, spit-spewing performance (his ""I WILL FIND HIM!"" scene, while fated to become almost as meme-worthy as Terrence Stamp's ""Kneel"", is still a bit much), yet there is no doubt his unflinchingly resolute Zod is entirely right for the film, and a more than worthy adversary. Diane Lane's quiet performance, conversely, is a tremendous asset, providing much needed warmth and whimsy to the film as Clark's beloved 'Ma'. Man of Steel is not a perfect film. The pacing and exposition often stumble over themselves (how exactly does Crowe's space-ghost work exactly? Never mind), and, ironically, the moments of attempted, shoehorned-in humour are often the film's weakest (Lois' thoughts on first kisses proves an unintentionally comic non-sequitar). But, as Snyder and Goyer are careful to stress, Superman is not perfect either. And, like Superman, it is easy to get swept up in the overwhelming desire to invest in the iconicity of a hero, and forgive the inevitable shortcomings. You will believe a man can fly. You will believe a hero capable of unspeakable violence. And you will believe in him, and his movie, nonetheless. -9/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The animated fare always impresses. Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy will always be beloved. But this mess? Run the other way.I really tried to enjoy this. Everyone knows the basic premise of Superman's arrival on Earth, and his emergence as a pretty darn near invincible super hero that fortunately likes helping people. I also feel for the man as it is instilled on him from an early age that once people know, he will never be left alone again.The introduction includes the expected destruction of Krypton, Kal-el's departure and imprisonment of General Zod. After that? Pure crap. Kal-el's upbringing as Clark Kent is shown through flashbacks with Kevin Costner woefully miscast as his adoptive father. I rolled my eyes during the poorly written tornado scene that served absolutely no purpose.Clark then begins traveling the world to try and find where he comes from which unlocks all the destruction to come as he inadvertently summons Zod, no longer imprisoned, to Earth to just kill everyone and everything and start a new Kryptonian society with Clark's... cells? Yes, you read that right.This all leads to the fact that since Clark grew up on earth for 30+ years, he has empathy and camaraderie with the population, and won't just violently rape the planet. Thank god for Kansas, or we'd all be dead.Lois Lane's character makes one colossal mistake after another, putting herself in harm's way, and showing some out of nowhere love interest in this alien being. Maybe this was intentional as the original comic character was a box of rocks herself, at first.Mayhem. Wanton destruction of property. A military that is full of nothing but angry arrogant Americans. Metropolis (New York City) suffering almost complete annihilation, but out of shape Perry White? You do you boo and run away from that 100 story building falling right for you.Marvel movies use superheroes in ways that humanize them, offering moving tales with purpose and feeling. DC decided to throw spaghetti at the wall, orgasm on it, and light it on fire.I'll give it a little credit for Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and the earlier parts, but the rest of this garbage? Hard pass. However, I will watch the rest of the DC Universe as they laughable attempt to replicate the success of Marvel.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was not disappointed and consider it to be one of my favorite movie going experiences. I wasn't the only one who felt that way as people stood up and clapped at the end. In many ways, that movie was a reflection of its times as it was the first superhero blockbuster and should be credited with launching the superhero genre that we take for granted today. I liked the opening graphics, the chemistry between the main actors (particularly Reeves and Kidder), and one of the best scores I have ever heard. Richard Donner did an outstanding job and we were all cheated of his vision when he got fired during filming. I particularly liked Reeve's take on Clark Kent. That movie had a comedic tint, family entertainment feel, and a lightheartedness that worked. Unfortunately, that movie is dated and the special effects do not hold up to today's standards.That being said, I think the Man of Steel is as good or better. The acting and directing are solid, and the special effects are amazing. I particularly like the extraterrestrial angle of this movie and the way the main character was developed—it's a fresh and much needed origin story of our oldest superhero. I like it for the very same reason that its detractors don't like it —its grittiness. This is not your daddy's Superman and will no doubt not work for many. We finally get to witness the awesome power of a being with very few vulnerabilities and is among the last of his species. Despite the hate that surrounds this movie, MOS is currently one of the top 5 rated IMDb superhero movies of all time and will end up being a box office juggernaut. Henry Cavill and the villains deliver. My only complaint is that the lovely Amy Adams is underutilized and Zimmer's, normally reliable score, is underwhelming. Goyer's screenplay, Snyder's direction, and Cavill's acting are the big winners here.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It has a script that is problematic, intriguing, and gives us a hint as to what could have made for a mind-blowingly weird and self-serious (but campy) world on Krypton from the opening 15 minutes. It's a story that is all about how Clark Kent (aka Kal-El) doesn't know what his place is in the world and has to find it out, while also combating a rather p-o'd presence from his past that has found him. Oh, and there's Lois Lane in it and she does things the plot requires her to do, which includes falling for Superman. It's probably Henry Cavill's dimpled chin, right, chicks love the chin.This is Snyder by some collaboration with Christopher Nolan (because Warner brothers couldn't let go of that Nolan comic book dark-and-brooding mojo I guess) making a new mythology for a character who most Americans, whether they follow graphic novels or not, know and some love. It's a film that tries for an alternate viewpoint that is not bad necessarily or wrong-headed, but as the sort of ""definite"" new view for a franchise to rise out from it's not much fun. Sure, you can philosophically pick this apart and find a lot there, maybe some dime-store Nieztsche and other things, but the problem comes when people don't have actual conversations with one another. You want to show that Clark and Lois become closer? Fine, have them talk about something that isn't just him giving googly-eyes explaining what the ""S"" on his suit means. Or make Perry White (a very good Fishburne, far as it can go) say things that aren't just orders and declarations.In the first half of the movie I found the structure the pivotal thing: here we bounce from the present time of Kent wandering around like a super-hobo or something (why he gets into s*** with people I'm not sure), and we see his young years. The most troubling part comes with Jonathan Kent (Costner plays him with appropriate and solid aplomb and is fine at being serious in this tone), especially with how his part in the story, uh, wraps up. But even as the structure and imagery drew me in, I kept thinking that 'hmm, maybe a little less telling and more showing, like the bus scene, that makes me feel something, almost, sort of'. But there's little time for that since by the halfway point Clark finds his deeper Kal-El roots, sees Russell Crowe in hologram form, and is told about the ""Great things"" he will do. And for all the misgivings it's hard to not feel something when he flies high.If this sounds like a mixed review it's because it is. I was with the movie, up to a point, for about the first hour, 80 minutes or so, despite some issues with Goyer's dialog. But by a certain point, once Zod has to get into his whole plot to destroy earth (and to be fair Shannon gives him some degree of bad-guy gravitas that helps off-set some of Cavill's blandness), then you got to watch lots and lots and lots of CGI pummeling. It's not even *bad*, it's more like a dull repetitive thud, where the color palette is washed out and gray and brown, and the hand-held camera-work, which fits the first part of the movie that's attempting (in an honestly admirable way) a more independent-feeling feature, turns into a nightmare of camera-work. And then the ending... it's less something to get angry about (though I could easily be) than just a 'wait... that's it?' I saw this movie once in 2013 in the theater and it didn't necessarily register quite how much damage was being done to the city. That's contrary to how much people lost their collective minds over what happens in this climactic rumble in Metropolis, that Superman would try to fins another way. I think what bothered me wasn't that so much - that's de-rigur in a number of movies (though Avengers did a better job of attempting to get civilians out) - what bothered me was just shoddy action direction; Snyder is obsessed with getting COOL looking images, but it becomes chaotic and the CGI lacks any real depth. It turns into something that is less about capturing something close to photo-realism than as a cartoon with the brooding nature of 1985's Come & See. I mean, come on.It's not without its merits, but its a work of popular art that loses any potential before it even gets going. When Michael Shannon shouting ""HERESY!"" and ""I WILL FIND HIM!"" are your most memorable moments (along with a notorious death scene), you got problems.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

But I've watched plenty of animated series and other Superman movies. Man Of Steel is one of my favourites.The first 45 minutes are incredible. The origin story of how Kal El came to Earth is done both shortly, detailed and accurately. You really feel for the sacrifice his parents make and see how utterly alone in the world Kal El really will be. This theme continues with confusion of who is his and his journey to discovering his true identity shown between grown man Clark and flashbacks to incidents in his childhood.Then the critics started whinging. It lost the story... Stupid love stories.... Too much action...Rubbish. Two men from a different planet with ridiculous strength are fighting for what they believe in and what they want - and Superman is fighting the only person he has ever encountered from his planet. Hits you right in the feels if you have a heart. And the controversial ending... Well, I won't spoil it but do your research on Superman and you'll realise you're whinging for the wrong reasons.And Henry Cavill is a fabulous Superman - swiftly planted 2nd in the list after Reeves.Great film.

He must fight back in order to save earth from falling into pit.From the director of 300 , Watchmen and The Legend of the Guardian , Zack Synder gives you a visual delight which is full of unbelievable and amazing actions sequences. Clearly, this is the best Superman movie in terms of special effects where Zack Snyder lives up to his reputation for creating visually stunning movies. The film has a very good storyline as it portrays the emotional struggle of Superman as he tries to control his powers and is very enthusiastic about using them for good.. What lets the film down is the narrative as too little time is devoted to the evolution of Superman. His transition to Superman under his Krypton father's guidance is shown very weakly and not enough time is dedicated to show the relationship between Superman and his Earth father as this relationship is one of the key factors which makes Superman who he is. Not much time is dedicated to highlight the plight of Superman as he feels more alien when he discovers his power. Instead the movie turns out to be a slug fest exploiting technological advancements in CGI. There is a double climax in the movie which proves to be visually destructive and violent which makes you feel that such large scale destruction was a bit too much. Nevertheless, there is a substance behind the destructive climax as two equally powerful superheroes collide but this may be a bit too much for audience to digest. Kevin Costner who plays the Earth father of Superman impresses in the few moments he has on screen. Henry Cavill, did a commendable job as Superman, but had was very little emotion on his face. Happiness, sadness, anger, love were all the same. Other actors did justice to their part.For people expecting something like Batman Begins as this comes from Nolan's production house, this movie may let them down. A must watch for Superman fans but the movie may not make a lot of new fans for this ageless superhero. If a next movie is being planned, we would suggest that a great villain be selected and focus be paid a little more to the emotional aspects of Superman and why he is the great character that he is, thanks to the upbringing of his Earth parents.Good - 3.5/5","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I personally feel that this is a good movie. The spotlight, Henry Cavill, didn't let me down. He has that serious look in his face which makes him perfect for this role. Its not the traditional Superman movie where Clark Kent works in Daily Planet and changes into Superman, on the first signs of trouble, to save the day. Its more about how he tries to adjust into the society as a normal person. Romance was very minimal and unnecessary. Loved the pumped up action scenes. And Russell Crowe is as always awesome!! Snyder could have introduced Lex as a possible candidate for villain if he decides to make a sequel. But as far as i remember i did see a LexCorp gas trunk in the movie. So am keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel.Its a nice movie. Go for it and don't trust the bad reviews.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie jumps around all over the place and just never seems to head in any direction other than chaos.

In my opinion this was the superman movie fans like myself were waiting for. Now don't get me wrong it does have its problems but their very minor and easy to look past. Maybe one of the best aspects of this film is the feeling you get after the movie is over as in your not wanting more your not expecting more your satisfied with what you got and to be honest all of Zack Snyder's films are like that.

Sadly, in this movie I do not feel like he is a very good person. He is very moody and mean spirited. For example: Some jackass throws a beer can at Superman and he refrains from retaliating, but then he goes outside and maims that person's truck. This brings a completely different perspective on his personality because he does not refrain from punching back because he thinks it's wrong to use his power to hurt someone weaker. He refrains because he is afraid that he will be found out and it's also cowardly because he retaliates behind that person's back. This makes him look petty and selfish. Throughout this movie, every time we see him use his powers in minor ways, it's always to harm someone rather than being helpful (heating the handle to burn his teacher's hand, another example). This is not what Superman is about. This person is being a jerk in many small ways, which negatively defines his character and it's not even some grand bang scene or even the fact that he ends up breaking one of his taboos. Superman is the type of person whose behaviour you can set as a good example for your kids. Would I tell my kids to behave like the person we see in this movie? Absolutely not. I do not like him as a person in this movie. So, I don't know who this guys is, but he doesn't behave like Superman, in my opinion. Actually, I feel like my favourite hero is being slandered. ;(I guess I should explain why the rating is 4 rather than 1. I felt that Superman's background and how he ends up on Earth was nicely modernised along with the special effects, plus making the villain grudge personal. I found it interesting how Krypton and his parents were represented, and phantom zone entry looked impressive too.But, yea, the central pillar of Superman movies is Superman, and if don't like him as a person, then well, I can't give you a good rating.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While that essence remains, he now gets a decidedly darker, introspective and brutal edge under the Nolan-Snyder aegis. While the dialogues might be devoid of the cheeky one-liners that pepper other superhero films we've seen of late, it blindsides everything with sheer enormity of scale.This is a Superman film for today's audience. A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon and also one of the biggest pop culture icons, it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay.

It's too bad because the flashbacks to Clark Kent's childhood on earth has hints of a great movie. That was the story i was expecting and was far more interested in however, that was just an after thought in the movie.Man of Steels is one of the countless movies in history where the Trailer(s) is actually a superior two minute thirty second short film than the actual feature length version.

I, for one, loved it and have seen it multiple times. The movie isn't for everyone. Zack Snyder and David Goyer made some bold choices and pulled from source material that not every Superman fan will recognize, which will leave many fans of the Donner Superman movies confused or upset. A word of advice, leave all preconceived notions, of what you think Superman should be, at home. It will definitely enhance your experience.If you're a fan of Zack Snyder, you will see most of his signature style minus one. That one thing? His normal ""slow-motion"" fight scenes. I'm sure he did this to illustrate just how fast and powerful Superman, Zod, and his henchmen are, and he definitely got the desired effect. Again, if you're a fan of Snyder (like I am) you will like this movie.As for the story, Goyer and Snyder really cram quite a bit into the 2 1/2 hour run time, but I thought the pacing was good and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the amount of ""origin"" they were throwing at me. They employ nonlinear storytelling in the movie, using flashbacks to give you a glimpse into Clark's childhood. As long as you pay attention, everything flows wonderfully. They also really pushed the sci-fi aspect of the story, spending the first part of the movie on Krypton, which was a nice touch.The only thing that might overwhelm some is the action, there's a lot of it and it's unlike anything you've seen before. While it's broken up throughout the movie, the final act ramps it up to an outrageous level. We get to see the kind of action and destruction one would expect when the 2 most powerful beings on earth collide.Overall, I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because I got everything I wanted out of it, great visuals, a good story, adequate pacing, emotion, great performances from the cast, and plenty of action. Snyder worked his magic to make it visually stunning, and Goyer and Nolan delivered on their promise of a more relatable and real Superman. Just a fantastic movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Don't go to the movie expecting to see Superman, you'll be seeing a young Clark Kent trying to find his way on a journey of discovery. He's may be genetically Kryptonion but he was raised by humans and he is a human and he'll slip, and he'll fall just like we would but in the end, he will save mankind at all costs.I look forward to seeing the Character develop in the sequel, the way it ended with him dawning the nerdy glasses was evidence that this is just the beginning and there is a whole Journey that we will share with Cavill's portrayal of Superman.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yet for all of their technology to visit other worlds, they quit? The society of Krypton is portrayed as smart and advanced, yet they have not idea the planet is being destroyed?

The Movie had an epic feel about it, which was necessary for Superman. With all the fights over huge distances, the sound & feel of the impacts during the fights, it just felt right for the movie & was pulled off very well with some excellent special effects.The story hasn't changed much from the comic books or previous versions of Superman movies, where a young boy comes to terms with the powers he was born with compared to other people. The movie follows his journey to discover where he came from and the purpose of his powers. When Earth is invaded by his race, he has to come of age & step up to become the symbol of hope for all of earth.There is a great cast for this movie, with Henry Cavill being superbly cast, as he is an almost perfect fit to step into Superman's costume. He has the look, as well as conveyed the struggle at times to comprehend what he was sent to Earth for. The rest of the supporting cast were very good, with mentions going out to Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe for their great fatherly roles, but in very different contexts, as well as Michael Shannon & Antje Traue as the ruthless Kryptonians. I felt that one of the movie's strong points was the grand battle scenes. They all were superbly done & very fitting for the man of steel. The most impressive scenes were of Faora-Ul & her lightning fast reflexes & combat ability. I was very impressed with the scale of the battles, which felt they were almost over whole cities, as well as into space. You really felt the impact of every hit. Also impressive was the advanced race of the Krypton's, again they were very well portrayed as an advanced race with their technology & knowledge.I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie, going in without any expectations & no huge desire to watch the movie, as I'm usually a big fan of Marvel & their movies. But after the likes of the Dark Knight trilogy, I shall certainly take notice of any more future DC movies, if they follow on from the standard of the Man of Steel.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

First off, the movie focuses more on Superman's Kryptonian heritage and his relationship with Jor-El. You also get to see Superman's human life and how he struggles to fit in with the rest of the world. Its really cool to see how isolated and secretive he is as a child. Throughout the movie you see that Clark must come out of isolation and face other Kryptonians. Michael Shannon does a great job as General Zod and he portrays him just like in the comics (which is a good thing). Also you see Amy Adams as Lois Lane and in this movie is very ""agressive"". She'll get right to the point and is very adventurous. A different but likable Lois Lane from the comics. The CGI was great and the battles are just like you would expect them between Superman and Zod. Overall, the film was amazing and I cant wait to see what they do in expanding the story (World's Finest, hint, hint.)","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I would also venture to say that this movie was even better than the Avengers and Dark Knight Rises.They storyline was rich and really gives the viewer a deeper understanding of Superman as both a human and a hero. The CG is so impressive, and almost overwhelming, that you'll probably have to see it at least twice. There literally is no good time to get up and refresh your drink or use the restroom. This movie is non-stop, edge of your seat excitement.Do yourself a favor and see it in IMAX, because the sound and the visuals will blow you away.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

David S. Goyer did a really amazing job with his script. The story of young Clark Kent will be told again to viewers. Past scenes of Krypton and Clark's childhood blend together with Kent's current traveling through the first past of the movie, which is very similar to Nolan's Batman Begins. You will easily get the simple idea of what Krypton is, who Jor-El and Zod are, why El had to send his son away, the purpose of Clark's trip wandering around the world, how Clark struggle with his alien origin during childhood. One of the best parts from the first half of the movie is when it describes Clark's development of Kryptonian power and how he controls it. Some people might get the ""Smallvile"" feeling while watching like I did. The action is really fabulous. There are a lot of punching scenes when Kal-El releases the power of his fist. Zod and his minions are equivalent match for Superman, giving Kal a hard time. Exploding scenes, buildings' collapses and Kryptonian power demonstration will catch your attention. The battle takes place on a global scale. Lots of aircraft and mass destruction will satisfy you. In conclusion, this is the kind of movie you want to watch it again when you finish it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It felt lazy and derivative, as if the 'creative' team behind the movie had simply looked at every reasonably successful action flick of the last ten years and lifted all the best sequences, creating a disjointed collage of action sequences. Avatar, The Matrix, The Avengers, Iron Man, Transformers: they're all there.Director Snyder even managed to reference footage from 9:11, so desperate was he in his search for compelling scenes to hang his emotionless story on. Couple this with characters you really don't care about, wooden acting, a nonsensical script, cartoon-like CGI and ridiculously over-played set pieces, and you have a £250m turkey, another failed re-boot of a beloved Superhero franchise, and the death of a handful of movie acting careers.Compare this to the latest Star Trek adventure, Into Darkness, that I saw the same week as suffering through Zak's latest offering. Now THAT is how a summer blockbuster and ongoing franchise should play out. Mr Snyder: take note.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The second time had to be in a BIG IMAX Screen in 3D. Man of Steel does an excellent retelling of the Superman origin story and his conflict with the rebel Zod. The action scenes were fantastic. At first I thought the trailers were giving away too much but I was so blown away, I had to see it again in a big screen. I like how the Kal El character is portrayed. Fundamentally he was always a hero, willing to help people, but also had limitations even with his great powers. I actually liked the ending and don't know what people are complaining about. It's always been a theme that he can't save everyone. People seemed to be dying by the hundreds in the last battle scene so although he would prefer not to kill, he did what he had to do. There are some minor inconsistencies but being a science fiction movie, it's understandable.Although I'm a big fan of Superman, I'm not to fond of the Clark Kent character so I""m glad the movie didn't go into the whole double personality business like Superman Returns. If there is a Clark Kent reporter character, I hope the makers do not make him too wimpy. It seems the whole of Smallville knows by this point who Superman is anyway. At least Lois knows and she won't be known as gallactically stupid:) I hope the next movie doesn't concentrate too much on Lex Luthor. He may oppose Superman, but he's not his ultimate enemy. Supes deserves a super villain, like DarkSeid. One point that is puzzling about this movie is what was Jor El thinking of doing by embedding the codex in his son? It seems he wanted to revive Kryptonians somewhere. It seems like an alternate story of the Kandorian city stuck in a bottle.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

His face is typically Superman, square and sharp around the jawline. The action and Special effects in this movie are superb! I did have some trouble with the fact that he doesn't save a couple of people in ""normal incidents"" the story basically goes straight into the big storyline. Also it flashes kind of fast, one minute he's there and the other minute we are a couple of years further, those transactions in time could be done more subtle in my opinion.

I had such high hopes after so many good super hero films that have come out recently. The Iron Man films and The Avengers are great fun. Tony Stark/Iron Man has officially replaced Superman as my favorite hero of all time when comparing RDJ vs HC portrayals. I guess I am just to old and too stuck on Mr. Revee's 1978 Superman to enjoy this version.So far I just do not care about the characters. Even though I know the back story of Superman through comics, movies, animated shows, etc. I never had a problem seeing it again and again. Until now. I am just not that taken with Clark - there is just something missing. With this movie I have no interest in the relationship between Superman and Lois and her appearance did nothing to give me the understanding of Lois like the 1978 version did. The only character I really liked was Papa Kent.Overall the visual aspects of the film are great. But this doesn't overcome the fact that the acting is flat, the music is flat, and the story is flat. I think I see what the film makers intended to do, but they just were not able to pull it off. I understand that Superman is having issues identifying with his adopted world/people and that is what they were trying to convey. The emphasis is on the word trying. Maybe it is just a matter of trying to hard to be like The Dark Knight in tone. I dunno but it doesn't work.I would say that I liked Brandon Roth's Superman better than this. I certainly loved the 1978 Superman. This one not so much. Hopefully they will do better with the next movie. If you want to see a fun filled comic book hero I recommend Iron Man (1,2 & 3) or The Avengers. They might be a little cheesy at times but that is what makes them a lot of fun. This had no cheese at all.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The truth is, this movie is good summer fun packed with action, adventure, peril and, in my opinion, a worthy portrayal of Superman.

The Richard Donner movie, arguably still one of the benchmarks of comic-book adaptations, is 35 years old. What makes it memorable is the camp that permeated during the awkward scenes where Clark Kent adjusts the glasses on his face and smiles his goofy smile at Lois, oblivious to her rolling eyes or looks of exasperation. But that kind of comedy won't work in this era. Viewers are far too sophisticated. It's not enough to show us that he's homesick, we have to see just how alien he is without turning him into something we don't recognize. After exploring the humanity and plausibility of Batman in the Christopher Nolan trio, it seemed likely that the same treatment would work for the guy in the red cape. Well, Zack Snyder's attempt didn't quite cut it.Too much attention was focused on Kal-El's origin on Krypton. I completely sympathized with the parents as they sent their son away in the nick of time before the planet imploded, even though nothing about that sequence was surprising to me. But since so much time was invested in the telling of that sacrifice, I felt a connection to those parents. I felt no such connection with Clark Kent. His evolution was so hurried, delivered in quick, scattered flashbacks, that I really didn't get the chance to know the guy. We didn't get to see him test the limits of his powers as a teen, running, jumping, or throwing a ball. He doesn't even find out about his power of flight until he's an adult and gets the lowdown from his bio-dad's holographic entity. Of course, his foster parents are to blame for his lack of experimentation up until then, but it seems silly that he wouldn't have stumbled on it accidentally.Lois Lane wasn't much fun either. Gone are the days when Lois balances the grim with her goofiness by trying strange health fads or sneaking a cigarette. This Lois is all business. We find out she's already won a Pulitzer and she's really dedicated to the job and talks trash to military men. That's all the development she gets in this movie. The romance between her and Supes is bland--two characters with no spark on their own won't create one when they're put together.I couldn't help feeling like Brian Singer's Superman Returns was vindicated by Man of Steel. Yes, the look and feel of the movie and the lead role were simply a tribute to the Christopher Reeve flicks, but that was the whole point. That movie has received a lot of flack that it doesn't deserve. You don't believe me? Watch Snyder's version. You'll be pining for the clumsy Kent and the ridiculous elevator-changing scene.It felt like Snyder adjusted the set and got the contrast too high and the brightness so low that all the red, white, and blue was washed out and all we were left with was darkness. All the things that made Superman fun and memorable were missing and in their place was a silent pathos by an actor that was instructed to do tortured with as little lines as possible. I liked Henry Cavill's look as Superman. It was certainly the update that the character needed. I just didn't feel like after watching him for two and a half hours I was rooting for him. It wasn't until the very end that we see him put on the glasses and walk into The Daily Planet as a reporter. Maybe the sequel will allow more focus on his human side.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This story is a fresh new take on the character Kal-El and combines elements of Golden Age, Silver Age, and modern age Superman stories. Prior to Infinite Crisis of Two Earths, DC's run on the comics was a complete mess with stories of the Justice League of America and other characters such as Flash, Wonder Woman, etc. not following any sort of time line continuity. Despite many comparing this movie to Christopher Reeve's version (R.I.P) Superman's origin story had been told by writers time and time again in comics and this version gets it right. This movie does a great job at nailing the source material and creating a coherent story and movie experience. Man of Steel is the Superman movie for this generation and retells the story of Kal-El the way it was meant to be told.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This instalment is so beautifully done - the entire film is run with lots of shades of blue symbolising our man in steel's brand. Zack Snyder has delivered another edge of the seat thriller and though it is violent in terms of action, I suppose that goes with the plot and tight story line. The scenes of when our caped hero, lifts from the ground into the sky, gives you a thrill that was not there in any of the earlier films which were more soft. Henry Cavill as Superman deserves a hand as he has blended into the comic character with ease and makes us not miss Christopher Reeve at all. I wish we have more instalments coming around the corner as Henry Cavill has the presence to take it further. A movie definitely for the die-hard fans of Superman and is worth to include in your collection.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill does a spectacular job of bringing humanity and relativity to Superman, unlike the previous Superman film. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner perform well as Joe-El and Jonathan Kent, respectively, while Michael Shannon's General Zod was more interesting to watch than the typical Superman vs. Lex Luthor scenario fans have seen since 1978. The only disappointing performance came from Amy Adams. She was an excellent choice for Lois, but the material didn't allow her to have a memorable moment.Characters: The characterization of the main characters was well done, but the secondary characters were not quite as interesting. Superman was well characterized as the film progressed, showing Clark learn from the challenges and mistakes he makes. General Zod's motivation and purpose were well explained, adding much needed depth to this classic villain. The secondary characters were not so well done, from Faora to Dr. Hamilton. Sure, characters like Faora had a moment or two, but guys like Dr. Hamilton were completely forgettable. Story: The story had a strong start with the growth of Superman, but the emotional journey was buried within the rubble of Metropolis by the third act. While the action was entertaining, it was difficult to stay emotionally connected with Superman when the action picked up.Script: Perhaps the weakest part of the film. Yes, there were some well written lines, but most of them were used during the film's trailers. There are a couple of lines in the film that were cringe-worthy, not fitting the mood of the scene at all.Overall: While it loses sight of the story it tries to tell by the third act, Man of Steel provides plenty of spectacular action along with enough story and emotional depth to produce an entertaining film and form a solid foundation for the DC Cinematic Universe.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Unfortunately, Man of Steel is just another generic superhero film among many","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814569/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","14 June 2013","Okay, after countless Superman films, including this one, I've finally come to the conclusion that the character just doesn't appeal to me in any way, shape, or form, and that could be exactly why there's not a single Superman film that I consider great. It's far too fantasy- based to see the film(s) (or anything for that matter) as anything but a superhero movie. If you don't mind, also, I'll be comparing this film to The Dark Knight trilogy (I know every movie has to be compared to them nowadays- it's annoying- but they're the perfect representation of superhero films done right, so) since it draws several similarities to the three films and is basically set in the same universe. Anyways, though it's been heavily marketed as a Christopher Nolan film, I find it distasteful to ignore the fact that it's truly Zack Snyder's film, and it's very clear once you've seen it since it focuses more on style- visuals, non-stop action, etc.- rather than substance like story and character development. The first half an hour essentially builds the back story for Superman- where he originated from, who his parents actually are, and how exactly he found himself on Planet Earth. The issue here is that the film did better explaining Superman/Kal-El's father's (Jor-El's) story than it did Superman's as it dedicated a considerable amount of screen time on Jor-El (played by Russell Crowe), and then when Superman's story finally came along, it brushed most of his childhood aside to get to the action as soon as possible. Right from the get-go, you don't see him as an adolescent or a teenager, you see him as a man, already in his 20's, working on a ship. The only way we see anything from his childhood is through flashbacks. The film basically turned out the way I was worried it would. For instance, Batman Begins did an incredible job at dedicating the majority of the film to introducing Bruce Wayne as an individual, not Batman right from the get-go, but then again, I guess very few filmmakers have artistic integrity in big-budget Hollywood nowadays since now, everyone's thinking about filling as much of their films with action as possible so that the average clueless Joe's come in waves. There's way, way too much action, and it reminds me of the dreadful time when Transformers 3 was released, and its finale was a large, bloated mess of unclear and incomprehensible action sequence after action sequence. Once Man of Steel commences, the action immediately begins with the intense battle in Krypton. This much action leaves little time for actual character development, and this leaves me thinking that Jor-El isn't as complex and interesting of a character as Bruce Wayne was. And for once, can the woman, who somehow gets involved in the whole conflict, not end up sleeping with the superhero just to make things a little less predictable and typical? That leads me to the next issue: it's so goddamn predictable just like mostly every other superhero film nowadays. Again, the Dark Knight trilogy was fairly unpredictable and unconventional in its ways, which is why the installments are beloved and remembered to this day. There's nothing unique about this film- nothing that helps it stand out from the large crowd. Every time someone's in peril, Superman comes out of nowhere and saves them. This is exactly what deteriorated The Dark Knight Rises's quality; it creates a total lack of suspense and that unpredictable edge that these kinds of films desperately need to avoid the generic fare they often turn out to be. One aspect that somewhat redeemed the film was the music. As usual, Hans Zimmer delivers with his incredibly epic and ""goosebumpy"" music, which is what ultimately, effectively conveys the sheer grandeur and colossal scale of the film. The darker color/look of the film conveys a tone quite similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, as well as its music. In fact, though its music was spine-tingling, it had an extremely noticeable resemblance to the TDK trilogy's music. It practically sounded just like the music present in the Dark Knight Rises in some cases, but it was still pleasant to hear. The villain- mehforgettable as he rode around in his spaceship, paid Earth a visit in order to wreak some havoc a couple of times, and returned to his ship thereafter- rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong: I strongly respect Michael Shannon and love his work, but he just didn't convey the menace he was supposed to. In terms of acting, I believe that Diane Lane stole the show since her acting was far beyond that of the rest of the cast. All in all, Man of Steel is just another summer blockbuster that has a high chance of being forgotten in the long run. Some comic book/superhero fanboys might enjoy it (and say that they love it), but they'll probably forget it until another Superman reboot releases. I give props to the visuals and special effects department, but there's nothing else to Man of Steel than just another Superhero film that'll rake in millions (perhaps billions) for Hollywood. I expected more from the same man who brought us Watchmen, but hey, if you're into heavily action-packed superhero films, I'm sure you'll reasonably enjoy this one. Otherwise, save your money for something with more substance.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is Man of steel.Watched this 3 times after release, it was exactly as expected, fun, intense, no just time for silly humor. the built up to the ending fight scene was the best as the villain delivers the most point on insult and his last defiant retort.Pros: Best Action, Fights are intense as we watch kryptonians duke it out on earth. The destruction felt is riveting as they pummel through buildings and the camera cuts along with them with near and far shots. and was jaw dropping. This is all then accompanied by a soundtrack that flows excellent in the fight scenes. Costume design and art direction is amazing, its a visual feast and shots of earth's nature was showcased in second long snapshots that are few and far between. Doesn't treat people that are movie as complete morons who react but instead take proactive steps to resolve the crisis or figure out clues.Cons: Dialogue can be very jarring, questionable choices and advice given by Jonathan Kent. Although a daring touch, showing causalities can be upsetting but it helps the movie convey a more grim tone.Rebuild scene should have been shown so that the audiences learn that people move on after tragedies.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Something that shows Batman isn't the only DC hero who can pull off a successful movie. Superman and Superman 2 were formidable films, but we needed a good Superman movie for this generation, and Man of Steel succeeded.This isn't a Dark Knight/ Man of Steel comparison review, this is a Man of Steel review. It is more action-driven then The Dark Knight, however, and those going to see it for a Christopher Nolan experience won't get it. This is different than the Batman trilogy, and a welcome difference.Man of Steel is the first film in a planned saga, branching over many DC heroes and setting up the Justice League film, much like Marvel did with The Avengers universe.Anyway, here is my review.Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) brings us into the new world of Superman. This is a reboot film, done well. You already know the story of how Kal-El got to earth, but MoS shows even more of what really went on on Krypton. I went in expecting a dark, Dark Knight-style film, instead I got a unique, action-filled thrill ride that kept me on the edge of my seat.Cavill is a great Superman, and which I was initially hesitant with seeing, but after watching the film, I have changed my opinion completely. Shannon is a fantastic Zod, and the rest of the cast (Adams, Fishburne, Crowe, Costner and more) give outstanding performances in each of their roles, which helps the film drastically.I applaud the makers of this film, they've given us the first real great Superman movie. Fans of the genre and of action movies in general will get a kick out of this film, and you will feel that DC's universe is a formidable opponent against Marvel. Bring on the Justice League!8/10","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

America needed this super hero when they struggle with Great Depression in 1930's and began ""Pax Americana"" to be a watchman for the entire world. Also Superman is a story about ""CHOICE"" of how to use the absolute power.But it is 2013 now. Our 84-year-old superhero should have been interpreted in a new way. Not just a man flying with her girlfriend over the night sky, not just our trustworthy friend who beats up crappy villains for peace...In that sense, the film's focusing to Kal-El's birth, growth, agony and his trauma, is a fresh approach.Dark colored filming, Nolan's surreal super-realism, the ultimate battle action that shakes up audiences.. All these are presenting a cheering catharsis effect for all those living in this hardship in 2013..With a adequate interpretation of Superman of now, Man of Steel is one of the best SF movie in our era. 9 our of 10.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

And I mean *really* a lot. That's the problem. This movie is a good hour too long, and most of this ""obesity"" consists of overwhelmingly violent, super-human fights, overwhelming demolition of spacecrafts, cyborgs, buildings, airplanes and mountains (!) and overwhelming speed-of-light super-chases. Everything constantly, notoriously accompanied by overwhelming, devastating explosions and with a headache- inducing thunder that completely drowns most of Zimmer's otherwise brilliant score. (Or maybe not. Because probably, underway, he must have realized where the movie was going and just copy-and-repeat-pasted the war-drum/synth-bass track to fill out the last half of the film.)Costner/Kent do a decent job portraying Kal-El's earthly stepparents, but these sequences of the film are just a bit too sentimental for my taste. There would have been plenty of room for exploring some deeper (albeit hypothetical, but potentially interesting) psychological aspects of ""being an alien on earth"".It's all really sad, because I think it could have been a 7-8 movie if some good editors got their hands on it and used the scissors-delete tool generously. Still, I'd say the movie is well worth seeing for sci-fi enthusiasts (like me). But if I'm going to watch it a second time, I'll make sure I have my remote with its FWD button within easy reach!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

On the surface, there is a lot of good, state of the art special effects, lots of exciting action, a more ""Serious"" attitude, and generally good casting and acting. The problem is that the film is all surface. There is very little character and thematic development. This hurts the film when it tries to develop an emotional or logical connection to the viewer. Worse is the fact that actual pacing film is abysmal. It has no flow or rhythm thereby flattening the impact of all the scenes. In the end, it feels empty in that I never had a sense that was really about anything more than two Superpower aliens duking out on earth.

I liked his new vision for Batman, especially the Joker before Heath Ledger's tragedy. Much of what they did there was new and provided a fresh look at the whole series. That is not the case here. The plot here is virtually identical to prior Superman movies. The main difference is in the effects and the speed of the action and using different actors. They needed to make more changes than that, and this lack of anything genuinely new makes this a big waste of time.To make this on par with the Batman remake, I expected something along the lines of really questioning the meaning of patriotism. Superman is an American hero, but imagine if they had put him into a situation where leaders make truly questionable decisions. A modern Superman, to be really new, could maybe be the one to take the lead in showing what it really means to be a patriot, not just someone with blind obedience. Hopefully this is close to where they are going with this. And I hope Christopher Nolan takes real control of the whole thing.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was introduced to the superman story as a child watching black & white TV, with actor George Reeves (middle aged - average physique) pretend to be a super hero in a cheap superman suit. Since then, I have seen all the superman movies and enjoyed them, but nothing beyond those movies. Until ""Man of Steel"", the previous movies contained * action, * slap stick, and romantic ""chick-flick"" elements. And, for what they were, I was entertained. ""Man of Steel"" is for grownups who have allowed their minds to wander and wonder about what and why things are the way they are - about possible pieces of the terrestrial life question and possibilities beyond our normal cradle-to-grave reality which is conveniently handed to us. Interwoven in this movie's story were relevant ethical points to consider about evolution and genetic engineering of any or all life forms, whether in the universe or on earth. If an environment changes and subsequently will no longer support a particular life form, intelligent species attempt to survive by either inventing gizmos, moving somewhere else, or accepting that it's time is up. The storyline also shows that if there is no compromise, if space cannot be shared, then survival can be a fight to the death. In this movie, Superman cannot save everybody. He doesn't turn back time like in a previous movie. He has some limitations, and that makes him more human, since he must make more serious choices.The visual realism for such a massive epic was a few notches up from what I have seen in cinema up until now. I did watch it on an Imax screen in 3D. But it would still be great in 2D. I intend to watch it once or twice again before it leaves the theaters. I feel privileged to have been able to experience such audio visual masterpiece within my lifetime. I hope there will be more sequels to follow. My girlfriend is a fan of foreign films, romantic movies and TV dramas , and I felt like I had to pull her by the ear lobe to see ""Man of Steel"". I think she actually ended up liking it as much as I did. She said "" This Superman was hot !""OK, so we liked it for different reasons. I am puzzled to see so many one star hateful reviews, and although I can see why someone would be disappointed if they were expecting the same type of romantic aspects of the previous superman movies. Correct. This ""episode"" was not about romance. But is that enough to HATE the movie ? What planet are they ....?. . .Never mind. I rated this movie a 12, and took off 1 point because I suppose it could have been a teeny bit better. But the ratings only allow up to 10 stars, so I guess I'm stuck with a 10 instead of 11. Ten stars it is !I am always perplexed by the great divide in public opinions about many things, so I guess I should not be surprised that a few people hate it. A few people will always hate something about anything. I will say that if you are elderly or have a hard time following conversations, then maybe you would do better with a more serene down to earth movie like ""Still Mine"", or maybe pull out some of your old VHS cassettes and watch your old favorites. ""Man of Steel"" is heavy on concepts and visual artistry. It does not elicit strong emotions (although there are a couple of laughs) nor is it always ""accurate"". But then, superman is only a fictional character with a fictional story, so if your thing is to nit pick at inconsistent details in a fictional story which is presented mainly as entertainment, then you will have a great time jotting down inconsistencies, while the rest of the audience enjoys the ride. If you have the ability to open up and enjoy a masterpiece with minor flaws, then you will love this experience.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Don't trust the critics. Those critics who shot this movie down must have been watching another version that a packed movie theater in Leeds was watching where loud claps and screams of joy poured out. I have read some critic reviews - some are just wanting to speak negative only while completely neglecting the positives. The 70's are now gone....so are the red pants! Its best to leave the Christopher Reeve movies in the past. They can never be replicated and its best to view this film as its own entity. Something that critics cant seem to expectAction scenes like never been done before. Huge scale and intensive battle scenes. The cast was superb and there was great chemistry between Lois and Clark. The pace, characters and direction of the film are VERY different to the previous versions of superman (Reeves). Change to such an icon is bound to have a mixed response from critics and fans. There was some funny moments (the bar scene) and a little quirkiness but not too much to kill the tone of the film. In time audiences will embrace this movie as the best comic book film of recent times - by far the most entertaining film of the past few yearsIt will be hard for anyone to ever play a superhero bad guy as good as Heath Ledger did as Joker, but let me tell you, Michael Shannon was brilliant. As was the girl that played Faora very menacing.The story was just right - not too complex for young kids to understand all the while keeping things entertaining and interesting. The 2 and a half hour running time will fly byAnd, yes, there's sweet chemistry between Cavill and Adams also some emotion but not too much to take the pace away. Overall I recommend this movie for all movie goers - you will get a fresh, new and modern superman...completely different to all the previous versions. This is superman for 2013!!!!

Well, that's debatable.First of all... Don't listen to a word the critics have to say. ""Too much action"" (how can you have too much action?) ""No humor"" (there were a few funny parts.) The critics are unhappy when a movie is like another movie. They're also unhappy when a movie is not like another movie. They can't be pleased.But if you like to see a true spectacle... if you like super hero movies... if you like the realistic approach from The Dark Knight films, then you'll love Man of Steel.By ""realistic,"" I mean that it's believable all around. You understand how everything is possible--from Kal-El's super powers to super weapons of Zod. Whether a scientist would agree with everything I'm saying right now, I don't know. In my mind it passes the Science Fiction Test.From the point Kal-El is introduced, he's doing what he does best: saving people. That's why we love Superman, right? From the time he was a boy he was saving people.I'm also a fan of how this movie was filmed--with actual film. Zack Snyder did an excellent job all around with the look and feel of this movie. It's as Epic as it gets.Where should this franchise go next? I'd like to see DC go the Batman VS Superman approach instead of copying Marvel. Let Marvel do their thing and DC will do what they do best. They've got a good thing going here. I can see The Dark Knight world co-existing with this world very easily.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However these were quickly squashed in the epic opening scenes on Krypton and the dramatic events which unfold on that doomed planet. This film combines the most interesting origin elements from the 75 years of Superman lore and presents a revised version of Superman the fans and the world have been waiting for. Henry Cavill brings a powerful Superman to the screens which keeps an aura of humility while finding is place in the world.Amy Adams fits well into the role of the Daily Planet's finest, Lois Lane, bringing confidence and belief to Cavill's doubting character. Laurence Fishburne as the Planet's editor Perry White is great casting as the authoritative yet supporting boss. The huge scale and demanding elements shown through these god-like beings conveyed by the brilliant and villainous General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his band of outcasts is well balanced with Clark Kent's human story of discovery. Russell Crowe (Jor-El) and Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent) stand out in this film, providing emotional clout to the film and the moral backbone Clark shall need while going on his journey to becoming the world's greatest protector. As does Diane Lane as Martha Kent, who conveys very well the supportive mother to her adopted and superpowered son. Although the pacing flows well, the jump to different times in Clark's live can be a little jarring, as is the frenetic action provided throughout which can be a little exhausting yet still fun. Another critique would be the colour palette used on the film is somewhat drab and uninteresting in certain scenes. More interaction between Clark and Lois would have been welcomed as well as more humour from the serious leading man. All in all this is a great blend of David Goyer's comic book writing, Christopher Nolan's epic but grounded tone and Zack Snyder's unique film making style.

It was fine when I was 10, but as I got older, I was troubled by the fact that four super beings could duke it out in downtown Metropolis (actually it was New York in the movie though they called it Metropolis) without the entire city coming down around them. I was also troubled by the cavalier way in which our hero, the embodiment of everything good, tossed the villains to their deaths AFTER they had their powers removed and were no longer a threat. And now, at the age of forty two, I find that some people with the power to make movies had the same questions about that great old movie that I had. All the wrongs have be righted; all my questions answered and problems put to rest. The villain's motives are understandable and relatable, but we humans stand in the way of his goals, and only by committing treason against his own people can Superman save us. And he chooses us over his own people. My faith is reaffirmed. And his inherent goodness is intact. As he is absolutely forced to kill his enemy he cries out in anguish for what he has done, and for the fact that he is now, in a way, even more alone than he had been before. He is finally and truly, the last son of Krypton.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had really high hopes for this one, but as soon as I saw the second trailer I understood that it will be very serious approached (like Nolan's Batman trilogy) and much less in a fun superhero way (like the Iron Man trilogy for example). On the one hand I don't like the idea of making superhero movies dark and serious, because superheroes should be fun and charismatic in my opinion. On the other hand The Dark Knight was good even though it hadn't any fun in it. Now back to Man of Steel which tried to be a serious superhero movie but ended up as non-sense action flick. The plot is lacking and the half of it are pointless fighting scenes that just doesn't want to end. The world superman comes from (Krypton) was made in an awkwardly ridiculous way, and Zod is a horrible villain with a funny voice. Man of Steel takes itself extremely serious and forbids itself to be funny even for a second, which made it only worse.

The odd first part seems pretty familiar for us: a CGI feast planet in a bad way like any other science fiction movie. The atmosphere really doesn't fit the soul of Superman and with all those dragons and spaceships, it doesn't feel like Superman. I liked Jor El, not because I liked the character, it was because I love Russell Crowe! Otherwise, the character was not believable or captivating. Henry Cavill is perfect as Superman and Clark Kent both. Probably, even Christopher Reeve must be happy in his grave. It is just an example of perfect cast choice in the history of filmmaking. A pretty realistic and little depressing version of the character. Kevin Costner plays his part very well, he was cool, so does Diane Lane, but an attitude of the character in the middle of the movie is pure nonsense and it seems like an unreasonable plot device. As for Lois Lane and Amy Adams, I just want to point out that Lois Lane character shouldn't be a strong or dominant woman like this or boring like Kate Bosworth's interpretation in ""Superman Returns"". She should be like Margot Kidder. Michael Shannon is no disappointment as an intimidating villain also with his powerful acting. CGI in this movie ruins your experience like ""I am Legend"" did. I have no idea what kind of technology they used in the film, but it looks cheesy and superficial. Some fights remind me Thor's fight in the town in a bad way. The villain's cliché evil plans for the world and humanity is a CGI victory, but who cares? The final battle which ends ridiculously is like an endless destruction that leaves you dazed. The movie has some great visuals, on the other hand very cheesy and superficial visual effects, but this is not a sophisticated, dark or fascinating film like ""Watchmen"". The action was solid, but not brilliant or stunning. It is true that Zack Snyder is a good visual myth teller or a magical technician, but what is missing in his movies is little heart and excitement.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now So many years after it was first rumoured. Man of Steel is finally released and it fulfils everything I wanted taking all the great elements from the batman films whilst still being it's own movie as well as paying homage to the comics and original movies. The film is very much an origin story so the second act is full of exposition and back story but it never was boring or tiring. All the performances were top-notch I felt possibly that the villain needed a bit more screen time but nevertheless every time he was on screen, he felt threatening and yet also pitiful. I enjoyed the frantic and OTT nature of the Action scenes and Superman, An Alien from another world with super powers I related to. The flashbacks was an innovative way to see his development. Though the film has a lot of set-up for an very-likely sequel, Man of Steel was a great ride. As well as the mix of a superhero film with an alien first contact was a clever idea. Powerful Themes, Stunning Action, Great performances and the ending was a great way to close off I had Goosebumps as 'Man of Steel' emerged on the screen. Not many criticisms as I walked out with none being really any big enough to mention here. A strong contender for movie of the summer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't read DC and Marvel comics, but I really enjoy watching movies and TV shows or even playing video games based on their comics. I've seen all the previous Superman movies and I probably liked Superman II the most, and close to it is Superman Returns which I consider really underrated. This one is also somewhere in my top 3 with those 2, but I don't know exactly where. The movie is pretty good, but I kept feeling like they could do much more with this.Many talented people worked on this film and Henry Cavill is the most perfect Superman ever. I doubt there will ever be anyone better than him. He looks like Superman and he also gave a great performance. The characters feel much more human in this movie than the previous ones. While they could use a bit more character development, there is at least a little bit more of that now. Many people complained about the movie being too dark and too serious, but to me that was a very good aspect of the film and one of the main reasons I liked this movie. Who says superhero movies can't be taken seriously? I think it worked great and if it wasn't dark, people would probably complain that it's ripping off Marvel. They always have to complain about something. And also, the score is amazing and while this is an unpopular opinion, I liked it even more than the one from the old movies. That one is a perfect superhero theme, but this one takes it to another level. Just listen to the track called ""Ideal of Hope"" from this movie and I guess you will understand what I'm talking about.Okay, those were the pros. Now the cons. The story and pacing hurt this movie the most. The story is kind of like the first two Superman movies combined in one story. Just even more simple. Many scenes are very well done, but the story is just too simple. It should have been something new, something bigger, but instead there is Zod again (and this version is really annoying). And also, the pacing is all over the place. Mostly because of the flashbacks that are all over the place. And the climax was overlong and too explosive. There is just so much unnecessary destruction. The CGI is great, don't get me wrong, but the whole third act is a little bit too much.This movie is pretty good, but they could do much more with this and I hope the DC Cinematic Universe ends up being great. I'm still pretty much positive because this is just the first movie and they can easily fix the flaws.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Probably the best thing about this movie is that Russell Crowe did not sing in it. The special effect were excellent but that has come to be expected in today's big budget action films.If you are new to the Superman character and story you will probably like this movie. If you grew up with DC comics and were a fan of the earlier films, you will hate it. I pretty much fall in the later camp.As seems to be the trend now, this attempts to be a reboot of the superman character. As in Batman, we have a darker persona than the early works. I prefer the original over the new version.The movie itself fails on so many levels, and those have been covered quite well in other reviews. My biggest complaints are the over expansion of the destruction of Krypton and the overly long final battle. Superman Returns had the Krypton bit about right. The planet is about to explode, Superman gets launched to Earth, the planet explodes. Enough said. As for the final battle, after so much of the same thing, it became boring. By the time it was over, Metropolis was destroyed and most of the population should have been killed. A hollow victory at best.See it if you are a fan of action and CGI. Skip it if you are a fan of Superman.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie feels fake and underdone except for the new costume design and Superman's bulging biceps, pecs and abs. But then, that's all the viewers may want to see. That and a tittering sickly sweet melodramatic Amy Adams fawning over him and being submissively cooperative. How do they all make it out alive after all that happens?

The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him, which interrupted the movie flow a lot The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best, but in this case its a heavy overdose and u feel like punching Snyder. Meanwhile you learn vital things, like what the ""S"" on the Superman costume stands for. I thought the editing was horrible! I thought a lot of the CGI effects were too cartoon like. They really have to start to find tech wizards who understand the laws of physics, and don't create every scene like it's a damn video game. Video game...reality. Video game...reality. This is the mantra they should flash in front of these tech guys as they're creating. I still think Jurassic Park to this day has some of the best CGI ever done on a film. Where are those people? HIRE THEM! At a point of time you would think that MOS was made just to support the drowing Justice League franchisee. Also, General Zod's inner costume seems to be a rip off from one of the Spider Man villains Now,The positives of the film,Wonderful fight scenes and special effects. That's it.

Very much a new interpretation of Superman; it's not the classic hero you know, which may affect your views of the film. Regardless, as a film on its own, it works very well as a sci-fi flick.Performances are strong from most of the cast. Henry Cavill fills in the role nicely as Superman and Michael Shannon fearfully brings General Zod alive, making for an intense dynamic between the two throughout the story. The visuals are simply cool. Maybe because they now have the capability to do so, but the action is fast-paced, brutal, and somewhat realistic of how you'd think fighting would actually be between such titans as the Kryptonians. Because of the fast pacing of the film and the (highly entertaining) action, there could have been more character development on individual levels and between characters (like Clark and Lois), but I believe there is room for that in the future. I especially liked the amount of time shown with Krypton and his origins there. Critics seem to be hating on this film, but I say give it a chance for yourself. There are flaws to be picked on, but I don't think they warrant the flack the movie's getting. There is more background-building, which leaves less space for character development for now, but there's room in future films. And the ""excessive"" amounts of action cannot be a real complaint, as it's incredible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What a uniquely American creation. This movie has everything you would expect from a comic book remake, right up there with the hulk, the fantastic four, Spiderman, Thor, blah blah blah. Lots of action, lots of things exploding, tons of distraction, not much in the way of a plot. The millions spent on the CGI for this film is the only thing that gives it a four rating from me.If you're an American male teenager, or perhaps a twenty something getting stoned while still living in your moms basement. You'll love this movie. If you're looking for some mind-numbing simplicity, without all of the distractions of a complicated plot, this movie is right up your alley. I would imagine this looks awesome on the big screen, and to be honest, it didn't look too shabby on my 60 LCD, Either. An enjoyable film, not disappointed, but not exactly thrilled either. Lots of effects stolen from the myriad of blockbusters before it, especially the Matrix. I did enjoy making fun of all the plot holes, and there are many. This is NOT the superman you grew up with, it is slightly different, and for that, it warrants another point. 5/10 from me, just for the special effects.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's was too hard to believe when we read the comic books and saw his origin story coming to life right in front of our eyes and we marveled at the illustrated images and the power of him saving our world. Since Superman has just turned 75 this year, we started to think, do we need another Superman movie? Well, let me think: We had the serial films back in the 30's and 40's, then we had the late Christopher Reeve when he starred in all four Superman films from 1978 to 1987. (The original remained the best.) Then, next thing we know, Superman came to T.V. with Dean Cain stepping into the suit, then we had an origin story about him before he was Superman which was the series ""Smallville"". Then, in 2006, director Bryan Singer brought us ""Superman Returns"", which didn't do so well. But not to fear, I think the new Superman is something we might need after all. Which is why I decided to go for ""Man of Steel"" and in a way, it feels fresh and modern but borrows some of the formula from ""Batman Begins"" (The director of that film and the 2 sequels that followed is Christopher Nolan, who produced this movie), thus making it darker, grittier and surprisingly enough, has pure heart and emotion. Most of that mainly comes from the inspired casting of Henry Cavill, a British actor I remember very well from Showtime's ""The Tudors"", for creating a rather conflicted Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. And whether he's ragged, rugged and/or being a normal guy, he carries a lot of charm and has the heart and soul to actually carry the movie on his muscled shoulders and that's just a start. We get to witness Superman's story from the beginning in Krypton, when his father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe, fantastic) arriving to see his wife Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) giving birth to Kal-El. Then, as the story progresses, Krypton comes to an end. But, Kal-El on the other hand survives and resides in Smallville, Kansas under the alias Clark Kent. His two adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) are in the process of finding out who he really is, which is something he's been wanting to find out as well. Then as he grows up, he worked in a series of odd jobs as a fisherman, a bartender and even a waiter at IHop. Then he definitely discovers his true calling and his answers when he discovers a ship that was sent from Krypton that landed right here on Earth. This also attracts General Zod (Michael Shannon), who comes up with a plan to unleash Hell on Earth by building a new Krypton and to get rid of Kal-El, who turns into....well, you get the idea. ""Man of Steel"" doesn't exactly carry as much humor and fun as the Christopher Reeve films, but it takes itself seriously and I salute Zack Snyder (of the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""300"", ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"") for creating an exciting ride that's fast-paced, energetic and heartwarming, filled with amazing special effects that doesn't overcrowd the story. He even gives terrific performances from an exceptional cast including Amy Adams as reporter Lois Lane and an ideal one at that, Laurence Fishburne is incredible as Perry White, Lois's boss at the Daily Planet, Costner and Lane as the Kents are brilliant and they have moments that will immediately tug at your heartstrings and Michael Shannon makes General Zod one of the best villains I have ever seen since Heath Ledger's The Joker. (D.C.-wise, of course). I must even give special props to Dylan Sprayberry as the 13-year-old Clark and Cooper Timberline as the 9-year-old Clark, for trying not to overplay the situations that Clark had to go through and trying to find his identity, but still comes out strong into the person he will become. As for Cavill, he definitely is a star on the rise. I know that even he can't top Reeve, but I admit that he is the best Superman since Reeve and he fits into the suit very well. I wouldn't be surprised if I've seen people from age 10 to 95 going to see it and coming out amazed, but have their own different opinions of it. My opinion is this: The ""S"" is not quite super yet, but it does stand for ""Superb"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Is it a bird? A plane? No, it's the best Superman movie ever! Essentially created by a pair of Jewish college students in the 1930s, Superman was pretty much the very first superhero, his comics having entertained audiences around the world for decades and helped America pull through the Great Depression. He served as an inspiration for others, both in the comics and in real life, and was a member of the Justice League. The Man of Steel also starred in various television shows from cartoon shorts to the ""Smallville"" series and was ever so famously brought to life by Christopher Reeves in the four live-action feature films (though the first two were big hits while the remaining two got the short end of the stick). In 2006, Bryan Singer attempted to bring back the film series with 2006's ""Superman Returns"", but the film only got mixed reactions and was thus looked down upon by fans. And now we have this, the ultimate Superman film that we have wanted to see for years, Man of Steel! Now we are all familiar with the hero's back story: Kal El was sent to Earth by his parents from the dying world of Krypton where he would carry on the Kryptonian legacy by being the Earth's champion. Raised by the Kents and given the name of Clark, he eventually learns of his alien heritage and hones his incredible powers by traveling the world and helping those in need, his actions all the while being tracked by reporter Lois Lane. Just as the world begins to know Superman, an unsettling event takes place as a small army of surviving Kryptonians, led by the ruthless General Zod, arrive on the scene looking for Superman with rather hostile intentions. Can Superman protect his adopted world from his own people? I have been waiting for Superman to get this kind of treatment for a very long time and this is from Christopher Nolan of all people after his run with the other famous superhero Batman. The film maintains the core of the hero in that he's an alien immigrant with insane powers finding his place in this world by doing what is right and becoming an inspiration to others. It also takes a realistic turn in terms of how people would really react if they find out that there's an alien living among them, that is to say with shock and awe. We also see what the planet Krypton was like, from the culture to the environment to the inhabitants, before its imminent destruction.All the actors to their jobs well and I mean ALL of them. Henry Cavill does a convincing Superman and Amy Adams nails Lois Lane, not just there to be kidnapped but also taking a more active role, and Michael Shannon is great as a sinister yet somewhat sympathetic Zod (finally a foe Superman can find in years and not boring old Lex Luthor). The special effects are spectacular and well detailed, mostly CGI with a few practical effects here and there. The action scenes (oh, boy) are some of the best and most intense I have ever seen in a superhero movie and any movie in general. There's a lot of fighting between Superman and his fellow Kryptonians and virtually everything sight is utterly destroyed as if Godzilla did steroids and went on a rampage across the world. It's that awesome, nothing held back! With a stellar cast, great special effects, apocalyptic action scenes, and a very compelling story, the Man of Steel is the Superman film we have been waiting for. In fact, why are you still here reading this review? Go see this movie while you still can and prepare to be blown away.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It sets the scene for the entire story and I think it was just about as perfect a beginning we could possibly have had. We then come down to earth (literally) where we find Clark Kent discovering who he is and coming to terms with his powers and what a responsibility that places on his shoulders. Much of this is told in flashback with some great fatherly advice from Kevin Costner. It's a section of the film that may have lost some (probably due to the lack of explosions) but I really enjoyed it as it gives us a chance to get to know what motivates Clark/Superman, and just what makes him a superhero. The third act, however, is where I had the most trouble. The plot wasn't hard to follow and the acting was great, particularly Michael Shannon, no, all that was great. The problem was with the fight scenes; why is it necessary to topple skyscrapers and destroy entire city blocks. It put me in mind of climactic battle in 'The Avengers' movie; I had the distinct impression I had seen it all before. Yes, it was quite a spectacle but I would have liked something a little more original. But don't let that distract from the fact it is still a very good film and one I would happily watch again. Top performances, well everybody really but Michael Shannon really does stand out; definitely worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The previous @superman returns was a let down so I had extreme expectations for this movie. I walked away as puzzled.It is certainly a 10/10 movie, and summer blockbuster. The story (origin and character development) is the best I have seen. Congrats to David S Goyer and Christopher Nolan on the story.Zack did a good job but extended and used 10 year old kid imagination for some fight scenes where it didn't fit into the movie. It could have been better, but again, it is difficult for them to present a movie that will satisfy all of us and meet all our expectations.It is in between Ironman 3 and Dark Knight Rises in means of screenplay. Not too dry (like superman returns), not too cheesy (like ironman 3), and not too dark (like batman trilogy). This was a good mix and perfect story.Actors did great. Michael S, Russell C, Diane L and Kevin C are fantastic as usual. Henry did a good job with his expressions and acting. Again, it is a must-see movie, and nice summer block busterSuperman finally kicked some ass and it was worth it. I am going back to watch it again in a few weeks, as there were a lot to process.

I ve never seen such a crazy Epic movie... my friends and i couldn't stop laughing so bad*ss it was, so frenzy paced it was. Action on action sequences in the most head blowing roller-coaster ride you could imagine... no, no ... i think you don't get it ... it is a feast to the eyes from the 1st minute to the last minute of the film , everything pops everywhere goes everywhere, amazing screen play Snyder style that gives you this mind blowing experience .. it is BRUTAL, totally brutal , and i love it for it ... i was like , OK this issss bad*ss to the next level , next Gen. you thought Hulk was a beast ? well, Action wise, be prepared to feel like every other other action movies will now seems like a joke in comparison.. its like the the Matrix back in the days, you get out and you wonder how crazy it was. to sum up, Man of steel is a daring and interesting take on superman origin story. it s biggest flaws is probably the fact that it aimed for too much, too much content and Because of it, the story suffers of development in some plot line ( like some things seems to be repetitive and some others seemed to be rushed).. Yet even with this, the story is still solid ( of steel), in fact the plot is magnificent and deserves a lot of credit... I mean i loved the Avengers but is avengers plot really better than superman's ?? .... i think not... ( a lot of reviewer are just hating for hating ) one thing is certain, Now, superman really makes sense, he is more human, he is amazingly strong yet feels more weak than in other movies, he feels more real. you understand him and understand where he is from. It s original, it s darker or should i say more Mature, and surprisingly funy at times... But most of all its totally B R U T A L. If Jorel - Russel crow ( gladiator) had said at the end : ""Are You Not Entertained?

While I admire the direct Zack Synder (Watchmen, 300), I felt I was watching a sequel to Watchmen and that's not the only problem I had with this movie. I love the cinema aspect of the movie but when you deviate from a origin that's been around for over 75 years, you run the risk of screwing up a formula that didn't need tinkering to begin with.I realize Synder wanted to put his own spin, interpretation so he can stand out among the rest. But when you try to reboot an establish brand, you often make a mess of things (Amazing Spider-man comes to mind.) And now a sequel is coming and this time Batman & Wonder Woman will join the cast and Zack Synder is directing it. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck being Batman and I can't say I'm looking forward to the sequel. I hope my mind can be changed once I begin seeing the trailers.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But mostly American ones Why? Because frankly, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. One of the most disturbing factors in the genre these days is that occasionally, actually quite often, quality actors turn up in them; Willem Dafoe, John Malcovich, Edward Norton, Jeff Bridges, Russel Crowe to name just a few. As the superman franchise goes, Man of Steel has a far superior texture to it than its predecessors. Reeve was right for his day and Cavil is right for the current era. My problem with the new installment is that its just too messy, too bitty and all over the place, we don't see enough of him growing up, probably because so much time was spent on Russell Crowe who was too big a star to do a small part and who is a seriously great actor and probably under recognized as a great. He was convincing enough in Man of Steel, but I wouldn't have cast him in that film. He's too good for the genre in my view. Effects were good at times if you're into that sort of thing, and the supporting cast worked. Overall, it was goodish but could have been much better, but enjoyed some of the subtleties.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Screw 'em! If you are a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to see Man of Steel!Granted I am a huge fan of Superman, but Man of Steel may very well be the best movie I have ever seen! Considering movies like Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", Peter Jackson's third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""Return of the King"" and Whedon's ""The Avengers"" top that list, that's saying a ton!What Zack Snyder has done with this film is ""genius""! This is such a grand movie, yet nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Everything is given to you in exactly the right dosage. You aren't force-fed action like in other summer blockbusters. In Man of Steel, the action feels natural as if it is part of a story being told. Imagine that!The origin story is there, but it isn't too much that it bores you tears and Snyder goes about it all in precisely the right manner through flashbacks. This way, you get the gist of how Clark came to be the man he is, without the movie needing to be longer than it has to.All the actors/actresses do a fantastic job in their particular roles and help the movie to do what it is supposed to do: tell a story. While I'm still adjusting to a fair-haired Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane, I can say that I left the theater content with her performance. She really grew on me by the time it was all said and done.Growing up as a huge Smallville fan, I was convinced that nobody could do the role of Clark justice after Tom Welling. While Brandon Routh fit the role physically in Superman Returns, he was just too stiff and too much of a Christopher Reeves knockoff to leave me satisfied. I'm not saying Reeves was bad in the role (quite the contrary), I just would have preferred it if Routh had brought something he could call his own to the role.That's where Henry Cavill comes in! The best way I can put his performance is this - he owned the role!You know how it goes. Often times you've seen an actor or actress star in an iconic role, only to be dissatisfied with the choice after seeing the movie (or perhaps before and after). With Henry Cavill, I can say this, ""Henry Cavill is Superman!""The whole time while watching the Man of Steel, I felt as if Cavill was truly an outsider from another planet. And, I mean that in the highest regard! Movies are often about the suspension of disbelief and we as moviegoers sometimes need a little push in the right direction. Cavill's performance did that for me. The fact that the guy looks like he trained day and night nonstop tells you all you need to know about his dedication to the role. Kudos Henry!The special effects didn't hurt either. As far as cutting-edge special effects go, this movie has it in spades! By far the best special effects I've seen in any movie to datehands down! Better than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix, Avatar or any of the Marvel movies, including The Avengers! Words cannot describe them, particularly the Metropolis battle scene! Truly epic!Speaking of battles, the fight between Supes and two notorious Kryptonians (formerly seen in another of the Big Blue Boyscout's movies) was in essence, borderline orgasmic!That battle seen alone was worth the price of the movie's admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve.Let's face it; we don't go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue. We want action and suspense to go along with a good, relatively fast-paced story. In Man of Steel you get that!It currently is and will be by summer's end, the biggest and best movie you will see this summer. Mark my words!So do yourself a favor and don't walk, run to your local movie theater! You need to see this on the big screen. I promise you, you will not leave the theater disappointed! If you do, then you're either dead or worse, a critic! ""Gasp!""","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That apart, the plot is straightforward but engaging enough, the acting is great, and most importantly the balance between amount of screen time to action/effects and to story development was close to (but not) perfect.Do not expect this movie to be like the Dark Knight series, there is a wider array of 'super-human' things that have to be a part of the movie and having titanic strength Superman inevitably struggles much less than Batman. So unlike Batman Begins the character development is kept to a minimal, and the focus is kept essentially on what makes him different and how he deals with that. At the beginning it feels like you just stepped into a running vehicle, the emotional moments feel a little too rapidly done but they are sufficient to draw you in and as you adjust it becomes more of a thrill ride. As they claim in the Featurette the 'Who am I?' conflict he faces is not uncommon and that makes it easier for us to relate to.There is a lot of flying, fighting and a terrifying amount of explosions, so many that you get fed up of exploding buildings by the end, but nonetheless the sequences are still all well executed and non- monotonous and the beginning sequence on Krypton as well as the alien technology is quite creative from a sci-fi perspective. Also, the last sequence/battle reminds me of the one between Neo and Smith in The Matrix Revolutions.The (limited amount of) acting is pretty top-notch as well except for the teenage superman and Zurer as Lara Lor-Van which seemed quite artificial. The score is great as well. It has a steely effect and even the percussion tracks go well with the movie overall.On the whole its a good reboot, might have been better if more screen time was devoted to the back story by cutting down the action a little, but a must watch and not on DVD but in the best cinema you can find.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Overall I liked the film, though I can well understand why a lot of people didn't. It seems needlessly loud and noisy in places, and there are plenty of spectacular special effects and lots of explosions that might lead some (who hasn't read a lot of Superman stuff) to assume that there's almost no plot. But there is, and it seems to reflect the changes in the comic since the 1978 film (which this looks a remake of, because it has Zod in it). I guessed what the final scene would be midway through the film and I was right! Things I like: Lois Lane is not portrayed as a sap; showing Clark developing his powers (and his grounding in morality) over a period of time; Perry White; the superhero battles; the Cinéma vérité style used for the home life scenes. Russell Crowe also seemed slightly less pompous than Marlon Brando. Things I didn't like: the Cinéma vérité for the fast action scenes (reminded me a LOT of Battle of Los Angeles which I'd seen the day before); the ""moulded plastic"" looks of the new version of the superman suit; the writing out of Lois's father (who could easily have been in this film).But then, the tone of this film is much like Batman Begins and Amazing Spiderman - a slightly more ""realistic look"". There's some clever reinventions in this film, like what the ""Fortress of Solitude"" really was; a way of having Jor-El in the first film but written out of the next; hints at the next film (I predict Lex Luthor and/or Brainiac). In tone though it resembled more ID4 or a 9/11 documentary than anything else.And the problem with that is, where does the sequel go? There are huge spectacles and stunts in this film, and for me it did have a decent plot. The way it was presented though, inverted expectations of anyone who saw the 1978 film and its sequel. But it also dropped the ""cuteness"" that peppered those films that seemed to come from nowhere (like OTIS who seemed more Woosy Winks - Plastic Man's sidekick - than anything else) except for the fact it was based on a comic. The big thing I liked about this film is that the main character is believable. His motivations come from his upbringing and the predicament of being who he is. If that's kept up, then the sequels might actually be OK.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A ""C' grade film poorly directed, produced, edited and for the most part, weak acting delivery that would bring a writer to tears, but even the writing was poor with this film.The film seemed thrown together in a piecemeal fashion, disorganised with acting segments that were so ingenuous and boring it was painful to watch. I could have summised a savant, but with no artist genius put the movie together. There seemed to be no understanding of normal socialisation skills, feelings, or the normal flow of communication or relationships, or how to tell a story. The two of us watching it were in disbelief anyone could release this film, a film that should have been on the cutting room floor. The casting was quite non sensical. The action fight scenes were repetitive, with space ship scene cloning taken from 'Battle Star Gallactica, The Matrix and Independence Day'. The only way I could watch this Movie again is if I was tied to a chair. Forget water boarding, show detainees this movie, it is horrendous. Honestly, do the Hollywood set think we will keep watching just anything. I am embarrassed for them, inferior remakes are becoming a habit by people who seem to know little about the science fiction genre, or in this case movie making.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was absolutely brilliant. Some people say it had no story to it? What?! It had quite enough of story. I won't spoil the movie but anyone can see at the beginning that there is a story. Also the action is just so amazing. It is to be expected because 'Man Of Steel' Superman in other words is a super being. Destruction is to be expected in a movie. In all honesty this movie was so up to par with the Dark Knight Rises movie.The director and producer as always have produced excellent results. I commend them for creating such an amazing movie. The Superman actor was quite brilliant and the best by far as a candidate. Movie in general was so awesome it blew my mind away. I want to watch it again and again. It deserves a much better rating in fact.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can bet on the fact that this is the best portrayal of the story of Superman origin, along with perfect casting of the various characters. Henry Cavil has been awesome and at a point with his facial glow and awesome muscular build, he feels like an ORIGINAL Superman. Amy Adams has been beautiful and charming too. The pace of the movie is good. The action scenes are perfect, one of the best i have liked. Neither are they too hardcore nor on the boring side. The movie starts with life on Krypton.In few intervals looks into flashback depicting growth of Kal-EL/Clark into SuperMan. The background track is just OK. I mean, as compared to Hans Zimmer last batman trilogy, it doesn't match up. The ending is typical NOLAN ending as you see in Inception,TDK and TDKR. I would say it is a perfect IMAX 3D must watch. SuperMan has just begun!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had been eagerly waiting for this movie for the last 1 year and when i finally read the critic reviews i genuinely thought the movie did not deliver. Those idiots constantly kept comparing this movie to the Donner version of Superman(which i honestly found 'OK' at best) which concentrated way too much on the romance between Superman and Lois and the 'apparently lovable' Clark Kent alter ego. As if a person who bears the weight of an entire planet's fate on his shoulders has time for romancing and leading a double life when other beings as powerful as him are trying to kill him and all his loved ones. Some of them even said that this version was too 'dark' and this Superman 'broods' too much, well let me say this,would you be smiling if your home was being destroyed and your family was being threatened in front of you?Now that i have expressed my frustration over the fools who try to crush new and bolder ideas let me get to the review of this movie. Unlike every other origin movie this one does not bore you with the same old repetition. This movie truly shows how a child would cope up with being treated as an outcast, avoiding making any friends just to keep his identity a secret. It clearly shows his internal anguish when he is faced with the situations where he either has to protect his identity or save lives. The first half of the movie bares open the humanity of Superman. The second half portrays the Kryptonian in him. He has to decide whether to save his world or ours. When you think of Superman the first thing that pops up in your mind are his godlike powers. Zack Snyder has done a great job in this department. I don't think any superman movie including the animated ones have ever shown the true scale of devastation that would take place if a bunch of Super-beings were fighting each other. The action sequences have been made at a grand scale which will truly blow your mind. The way Snyder has imagined the 'super speed' action sequences is praise worthy. Unlike the Superman Universe of the 70's 80's and 90's this is a much more harsher and realistic one that has been made keeping the current and future generations in mind. On the whole this is not just a movie, this is the beginning of an Epic. 'Man of Steel' finally gave Superman a movie which shows him in his full glory just like the 'Dark Knight Trilogy' for Batman. Trust me this movie will satisfy you to the core.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This was my first time seeing this film since I first saw it in the theater in 2013. As with all things, expectations dictate experience, and, happily, when I went into this movie not expecting much, I found myself pleasantly surprised with the quality of the movie. The first time I saw this film I hated it. The film adopts a very different formula in telling the Superman story, and certainly a different model of film than the Christopher Reeve, ""Superman: The Movie"" film from 1978. Rather than the familiar tale of Clark Kent, reporter from the Daily Planet, and his alter ego who is an ongoing secret from Clark's fellow reporter, Lois Lane, we instead are treated to a sci-if film that tells the story of Kal- El's departure from Krypton and subsequent coming to be the hero we all know and love. Lex Luthor is nowhere to be found in this movie, with General Zod and his Kryptonian company being the film's chief antagonists. That said, once you are able to accept that this is such a strict break with the standard telling of the Superman story, you'll find that this is actually a well done film. If you go in expecting a story that revolves around the Daily Planet reporter and his episodes with Lois, you'll be sorely let down. But if you approach the film with an open mind, enjoy the sci-fi vibe, and are well prepared for a script that is big on action and slugfests, then you'll find yourself loving this movie. My biggest criticism would be that the Clark and Lois relationship was done in a way that undermines the traditional relationship they have, and that Amy Adams's acting wasn't very up to par in this movie. Still, all in all this is a super film! 8/10 stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The actual movie was quite a let-down, though. The physics of the character fight kinetics and the air & space craft was way the heck off. Nothing seems to accelerate or decelerate, rather they all immediately seem at-speed, and the craft all seem to be on rails. Even worse, there's too much exposition about the history of Krypton and Zod, not enough of Zod & Jor El shown. Not enough of the intriguing & intense Antje Traue, and Shannon's Zod needed way more character development and depth. We needed an actual experiencing of the state of Krypton's society, then showing both a personal debate and public debate later between Zod and Jor El where not only do they both have points, but an exploration of the negatives of both sides of their arguments. There's much that should have been in this picture instead of just instructed or talked about. That combined with the use of nonlinear flashbacks for Superman made the whole thing feel abbreviated and too much like a montage with the best thing about it being the score... and that rousing trailer #3 that the film woefully failed to live up to.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was a trial by fire. So intense and gripping.Man of Steel is the story of Clark Kent, a young man with no sense of who he is or direction in life, whose desire to find the answers to those questions leads him to a top secret site where a ship of unknown origin -- previously buried under 18,000 years' worth of ice -- has been discovered. Once in the ship he discovers the key to who he is and his greater purpose. Becoming Superman and serving the people of Earth.But it doesn't come cheap or easy (this isn't a Disney movie) because in unlocking this Kryptonian ships secrets he inadvertently leads General Zod and the rest of his twisted fiends to Earth where they will not only threaten the life of Clark, or should I say Kal, but those of every single life-form on Earth. Ironic, isn't it? That's part of what made Man of Steel so enthralling. It was Clarks fault. And it wasn't. It's not a simple black or white movie. Furthermore, Clark wasn't ready to be Superman much less fight a bunch of Kryptonian soldiers and save the world. He was just a young man trying to find himself who ended up in over his head. He's Alice in Wonderland. Neo in The Matrix.More generally:Man of Steel was slower paced than I remembered and apart from the action scenes felt more like a drama than a tentpole movie... until the last hour when all hell broke loose. Then it became a tense and at times jaw dropping Sci-Fi action movie. The scene where Zod announced to the world that ""You are not alone"" and gave the ultimatum to hand over Kal-El or else, gave me chills
Apart from The Dark Knight, Avengers: Infinity War, Endgame, I don't think there's another Superhero movie that was more jaw dropping and awe inspiring in its scale and gravity. Great performances by all involved both in-front of and behind the camera. Especially big props to Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Zach Snyder, and Hans Zimmer, who all killed it.Now on to rewatching BvS...(Review after 5/25/20 re-watch)

So when i finally got to see i, i had high expectations for man of steel. What i don't like about this movie: first, it's way too long. Second, the plot is kind of boring. Third, the fights are boring. It's basically the same fight played over and over again. Fourth, the actors aren't convincing. Despite these things, i like the fact that the actors are extremely good looking. The superman is hot!And i love to see Christopher meloni in the movie. I love him! I don't hate it, i just think that it's not that good and it shouldve been better considering the budget and time it takes to make this movie. I prefer the original superman movies, including superman returns. Im not saying you shouldn't see it. it eventually comes down to the audience. I saw it with my family and everyone loved it.

Not really to be honest...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814356/?ref_=tt_urv","joben-525-633946","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37651320/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","Previous work lead me to believe 'Man of Steel' was a certain success with the likes of Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) assisting director Zach Snyder (superb architect of Watchmen). However - for me - something didn't quite fit into place.Brit Henry Cavill took the front role as the 'Man of Steel', guiding us through how our caped superhero originated to his heroic stature. He has to step up to the plate after years of living low profile when Earth comes under attack by Michael Shannon's General Zod who plans to wipe out the human race in order to clear Earth for the Krypton race. Also cast is Amy Adams as Lois and Russell Crowe as Cavill's on screen father.First of all, my largest gripe has to be with the storytelling and that surprises me with Christopher Nolan in the back seat. After a well built opening 45 minutes or so - which some may call slow - the remainder is mainly filled with spectacular action sequences which is fine - if you're a action nut! However, for me, all this action derailed what I would have liked to have been an engaging story. The estimated budget of 'Man of Steel' stretches over $200 million; in my opinion it would have been better for the lovers and non lovers of the comics for there have been a movie made on half the budget with a more cohesive and complex script and group of characters.By group of characters I mean that they truly lacked in personality and complexity. They felt rather bland and felt like they were just there to make up the numbers. Only Cavill's character, and maybe Shannon's had enough justified beef behind them.However a further problem I have is that some of the acting - from good actors - was not up to standard. To be fair, this probably wasn't the actors fault, more the fault of the screenplay however Crowe and Shannon were cringe-worthy at times. Also, Amy Adams should stick to family movies as she felt miscast in a more serious role.The main positive which can be taken from 'Man of Steel' is a satisfying ending which implies a sequel is on the cards but also the sensational effects which were present throughout.Unfortunately, this isn't enough to justify 'Man of Steel' being a success - its average at best - especially in comparison to Sam Raimi's first Spiderman movie and of course, Nolan's stupendous Dark Knight Trilogy.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Up in the sky...it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman! And this new franchise, in the recent trend of angst-ridden, self-tortured heroes, is dark and brooding and not exactly what you might think it is...Is it dark and brooding? Well, in a way, but it only touches the surface of what it could have been. It does a good job through flashbacks of letting us get to know poor Clark Kent; bullied and picked on for being ""different"" and struggling with the ""what's wrong with me"" question until ""dad"" decides he finally deserves to know why. This could have been great, had it delved just a bit deeper, but it just scratches the surface, giving us just enough for story and character development, but leaves you wishing for more....What made ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy GREAT is that it ""went there"" into Bruce Wayne's tortured self. Just as we start feeling sorry for Clark and the story allows us to start getting close enough to really suck us in, it lets up and pulls away...keeping enough distance to divide and separate from really good to great.Is is chock-full of over-the-top action in 3D IMAX? Well...there's TONS of really good action scenes, but they drag on just a touch too long, keeping them from being great (much like the amusement park ride that, had it finished just a few circuits sooner, would have left you exhilarated - but instead you're nauseous). Don't get me wrong - the effects aren't dizziness-inducing or sickening...just too long. And 3D? IMAX? Sure, if you want to spend the money, they'll take it BUT it's Fake3D (meaning it was digitally rendered into 3D format post-production and not shot in 3D) and Lie-Max (blown-up and stretched onto a huge screen, but NOT shot in true IMAX 70mm film orientation). I saw it in digital 2D and it was great.Is it a familiar take on the super hero tale MOST of us know already? Well, you'd expect a bit of a back story, but you end up with TMI about the drama at the home planet and it serves to only muddy the water and confuse rather than clarify - it's as if the film wants to start telling one story but can't decide if that's what we came for or if we just need to hurry up and get to Earth for the familiar...You'd expect The Daily Planet's editor, Perry White, to be an angry old white guy, but he's played by Laurence Fishburne. You'd expect maybe some wry, cheesy, comic book comments....but it sells itself as serious drama and just when you buy into it, it slaps you with an attempt at humor that makes you groan rather than snicker.I was expecting visual GREATNESS from director, Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300) and in that respect, Man of Steel did not disappoint! The special effects and visuals are stunning and beautifully filmed. Some imagery is just astounding. EVERY flashback scene filmed in Smallville is INCREDIBLE! It's gorgeous.Acting was solid and the performances did not disappoint. Kudos to the two boys who played young Clark Kent - you truly feel their physical and emotional pain as they adjust to their otherworldly differences. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are great as Superman's two dads - sorry, it's not told THAT differently guys...you know what I mean Diane Lane as mom and Amy Adams as Lois Lane do a good job also (especially Diane Lane who makes your heart break with hers as she deals with a child who is ""different"").My two biggest disappointments: ""product"" placement and inappropriate language. You can't get more obvious than the Sears store, IHOP restaurant, UHaul van, and 7-11 that stick out in Smallville like sore thumbs - soooo out of place and obvious in their bright colors and prominence that it's a very sad distraction. BUT MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT...an inappropriate comment made early on in the movie by Lois Lane shortly after we meet her. A reference to the size of male genitalia has NO PLACE in a super hero movie that MANY kids will surely attend. I don't care if it's rated PG-13...I'd be MORTIFIED if I was sitting next to my 13-year-old niece and she was subjected to the cringe-worthy line, let alone any other kid or teen who might go along with the family. TOTALLY inappropriate and disappointing!So, over all, is it what I'd hoped and expected...not really, BUT it IS really good (just not great). I'll still give it a thumbs up and recommend that you add this to your Summer BlockBuster ""go see"" list.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First and foremost it is a Zack Snyder film and not a Christopher Nolan film, so if you're expecting the full Dark Knight treatment, you'll be disappointed (also Snyder haters are unlikely to be converted here). That being said, you can clearly see where Nolan's had his input, which certainly grounds the film in some sort of reality, but you can also see where Snyder's been...well...Snyder (See: 300). There were a hell of a lot of crash zooms, often more than once in a shot, and did seem overused. There was also heavy use of hand-held/shaky cam, which actually worked for the most part, but there were some shots that could have really benefited from a steady-cam. As for the actual story; it was clunky at times, but never boring, and felt a lot better structured than Superman Returns. The main flaws, in my opinion, came from plot holes, which did somewhat detract from the experience, but not enough to for me to dislike it. The cast all did a great job, particularly Henry Cavill, who definitely made the role of super-serious-superman his own, while staying true to the source. Overall a solid film, not quite on par with Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, but definitely worth seeing. 4/5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Simply because of the fact that most of the judgment being passed is just not true. It's as though people have a very defined mind- set of how a Superman movie should be and that nothing should breach these boundaries, which seem to have been created to a large extent of the original Richard Donner version. Well, that is where the critics have got it all wrong. As the saying goes, change is the only constant - and Superman has changed, and IMO, for the better! The movie is NOT dark and brooding as it is made out to be. It's just a honest and sincere attempt to re-present Superman in an avatar that is different, more enriched and contemporary. The very concept, of treating Superman as an alien who has to come to terms with who he is, the mysteries surrounding his origin, his powers and whether society will accept him or not, is very unique and frankly quite apt. I mean this is Superman, the greatest and the strongest superhero of all. Unlike most of the other hero's he is NOT from this planet and that IS a fact. It takes guts to re-invent the entire concept and present it like the ways it been done and beautifully so – for that well deserved kudos to Zack Snyder and the producers. MOS is brilliantly filmed – right from the opening sequence of Krypton to the closing credits when you see the title flash on screen (yes, the title's towards the very end in case most didn't notice). This is a huge spectacle and befitting of the greatest superhero of all times. Is the movie perfect, perhaps no. And I don't intend to quibble about these few shortcomings. What the movie definitely is – it's one of the very best as far as this genre is considered. In fact it's a superb sci-fi cum action cum superhero movie. In terms of sheer scale and size it hits the Avengers and the other biggies out of the park. It packs enough fire- power to pulverize the entire Marvel gang. And that is a lot to speak of. If this was the first Superman movie made, it would have created an unparalleled name for itself. Unfortunately it has to contend with comparisons being drawn to the original movie, the original score and Christopher Reeves whose image in blue and red is so firmly etched in everyone's mind. But if you leave all that aside, you will see a Man of Steel who is here to stay. Henry Cavill is the NEW Superman.

The film started out okay but then grew ridiculous and stupid. I would like to avoid spoilers so I'll just say the villains, the conflict, and how all that played out was so over-the-top, I felt myself in that all-too-familiar, ""Oh, it's a fantasy- I guess I'm not supposed to take any of it seriously, right?"" position. Wrong! The ""Man of Steel"" film started out well but ended up yet another lazy superhero film that dumbs itself down to it's audience to sell tickets and maximize profit for it's investors.By that, I mean that characters and plot points became riddled by clichés, violence grew over-the-top, and the actors lacked the charm and humor of the actors of the 1978 version, like Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman. The original '78 film wasn't perfect, but at least it was an original (and the first superhero movie) and it didn't need the digital spectacle to tell the story. ""Man of Steel"" had 35 years to improve the film.The movie wasn't boring, so I gave it 3/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

To me this movie had a great plot, music, good amount of romance, action, visuals, and heart. There is a lot of action but what did you expect....ITS SUPERMAN.....I heard people complained for so long that Superman never unleashes his full strength, well he finally does in this movie and its glorious.

And he has a capability to show that even BATMAN & SUPERMAN are vulnerable at some point. I haven't seen a Superman movie as good as this one. Henry Cavil is perfect as Superman- Man of steel, while Amy Adams is one of the perfect Lois Lane. Russel Crowe is really effective as a father and Jor-El. The perfect thing is the character build up. Christopher Nolan & Zack Snyder have introduced superman perfectly, i think all those who loved superman will like it & the people who are new to superman would love it too. General Rod is pretty dangerous. He is the only who pisses of superman. Overall special effects are really nice and i think every single penny spent on Man of steel is worth....","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Superman in the past has been a bit of a bland character but Christopher Reeve has about 20 times the charisma that Henry Cavill brings to the role. Amy Adam's who I usually think is good is equally as un charming as Lois Lane. Russel Crowe as Jor El looks like he has at least seen the 1978 movie is about the best thing in it. Krypton is totally re imagined complete with mystical flying beasts. One of the worst big budget blockbusters of this century or any century.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I pictured the actors trying to keep from laughing or wincing at the words they had to say. A lot of the lines are written as if they are supposed to be Big Pieces of Wisdom but they are anything but. Lois Lane is reduced a damsel in distress waiting around for Stuporman (he is so DULL) to save her. They have no chemistry. Despite the big names, there isn't much acting in it because the special effects are supposed to keep you occupied. I thought the CGI, and the costumes, especially on Krypton, were laughable. What acting there is doesn't really uplift the movie much. (I never realized just how bad an actor Kevin Costner is.) Amy Adams comes across as a little girl trying to sound tough and grown-up. I usually enjoy Russell Crowe but for some reason he just wasn't convincing. The movie keeps cutting back and forth so quickly in time and place, with no titles to guide you, that it's hard to keep up with the plot. At the same time, the movie just drags on and on.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The similarities are so forced and obvious that it feels like this movie was directed by billy graham or Pope John Paul or something. There is very little ""superman"" of the comic book fame. Look, on the planet Krypton, babies are made to order (like a wendy's burger) with the correct dna set up. Want a warrior? get a warrior. Jor-El and his wife have a baby the old fashioned way, and thus, the ONLY BEGOTTEN SON of Krypton is born. He is sent by his FATHER so that THRU him ALL MANKIND can be saved...Even the beard he sports (and how does he shave? Really?) and working as a FISHERMAN and throwing his arms out in the form of a cross, and of course, making himself a willing sacrifice at the relatively mature age of, what? 33...just like Christ.Look, I'm a Christian. I love Cool Hand Luke and I see the parallel there to Christ...and it was wonderful. But...this? Come on, please. I want more comic book and less new testament at this movie. I just feel like I've been preached at for 2 hours. maybe tomorrow our pastor will fly into the rafters, and the world will balance it self out.Still, i enjoyed the fx...so giving it a 5.

So it's fair to say I'm a fan.As an adult I've little interest in action blockbusters in general, so I had to watch MOS twice to get an objective appraisal. There are really 3 or 4 short but annoying moments in a 2 1/2 film. Some of the dialogue and acting / directing could be better.There are actually some great character moments, some unsatisfying ones. Some great acting, some weak. Some good dialogue, some bad.A lot of that criticism is fair, but none of it stopped me from enjoying the movie.A lot of the other criticism on here is I think blinded by nostalgia. Go and watch the Donner films again through adult eyes, and you'll see plenty of bad in there also - but like MOS doesn't stop it being a great movie.Kal-el is portrayed here as more psychologically damaged by his ""outsider"" childhood than the Reeve's Superman.I really liked what they did with the character - he's not really confident in himself as a person, he's been having to hide who he is his entire life, had no real friends, and plenty of reason to feel bitter, withdrawn, and isolated. Yet he chooses to come out of hiding to save the world. He's a different type of hero. Not all American like Reeve, but more nuanced for a more complicated age.The tempo of the film does feel a little rushed, like trying to squeeze two films of story into 1 - but to counter that, they wanted to introduce Superman to this world in a state of panic and fear, which works well with the use of Zod. So there's a lot to fit in.Being generous to Snyder, I think it's hard to spend $200m on any movie these days without the suits getting involved with their focus groups during the edit - and I get the impression that is what has happened here.Certain characters don't have their story arks fully told, perhaps to squeeze in more action and sell more toys and video games.Even still, the action is more believable with the powers they're supposed to have.In summary, none of the bad points spoiled this movie for me, and this is more or less the Superman I wanted.He's tortured, and naturally very apprehensive of revealing himself to the modern world. As a grown up, I buy this more than I would Reeve rocking up in 1970s Metropolis donning his red pants and saying ""so this is how I roll, deal with it"".I loved that Superman, but I couldn't buy it 2013.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes, Krypton is there, the Kents are there and the Daily Planet is there but the film does nothing to develop Superman or Clark as a character; only really being fleshed out when we see Clark growing and using his powers for the first time.The first half of Man of Steel, though too dark in tone for my liking and especially for Superman, is quite good, showing the building of character relationships and some emotional moments between them. Any sign of 'heart', however, is just thrown out of the window and through several buildings in Metropolis at the very moment that Zod begins his 'alien invasion', leaving the viewer to sit through mindless action that just goes on and on, with little to no progression, making the story go nowhere. My biggest issue with Snyder's film is that it just does not feel like a Superman film. Where is that Superman magic that the first Donner film entailed? I appreciate the ""updated"" origin story and that we're essentially seeing Superman starting out but we never get to see him save someone in the suit. Henry Cavill was a great choice for Superman but he was just not given enough to do in the film, making his character, and a lot of the characters in the film, very empty, never letting the audience care for any of them (apart from perhaps Mama and Papa Kent).Man of Steel is all style and no substance.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan teaming up was basically like The Avengers in real life; two amazing filmmakers and a world-renowned music composer collaborating on a superhero movie. How could it not succeed? Henry Cavill as Superman was the best choice the casting director could have made. He's got the looks, the build, and the acting chops to take the role and run with it. General Zod was an amazing bad guy, and one of the boss fights (you'll know EXACTLY what I'm talking about) was just superbly choreographed and CGI'd. Honestly, this is the greatest superhero movie ever made. Iron Man had his time on the throne, The Avengers had their time on the throne, and now it's Superman's time. Man of Steel is comparable to Avatar when it comes to the level of 3D realism in the graphics, and I highly recommend viewing it in 3D. It's no longer a gimmick Hollywood stamps on movies to make more money. It genuinely enhances the viewing experience, especially in this case. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both do an amazing job as Clark/Kal'el's father, even though they don't have that much screen time, which is expected. Snyder expertly crafted the storyline for the Fall of Krypton, and that entire sequence is powerful to behold. All the other supporting actors/actresses play their parts well, and it was nice to see some fanboy love from Snyder in the casting (Morpheus & Cmdr. Lock from The Matrix, Lt. Gaeta and Carl Agathon from Battlestar Galactica, etc). Run, don't walk, to the movie theater. And do it multiple times. **puts on 3D glasses, heads back into the fray**","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have been waiting for this movie for about two years now and I had very high expectations. Though I do not believe that I am the only one who goes into a movie with high expectations. When these expectations settle in and we go and see a film, we may enjoy the film but at the same time we leave the theater thinking to ourselves, ""Well, I wish they had done this..."" or ""Well, I wish it had ended this way..."". Well I can most certainly assure you that ""Man of Steel"" will surpass and exceed all the expectations that you have whether they be low or very very high. Hats off to the amazingly talented Snyder and notions from Nolan. Also, I must mention that the chemistry between the characters is class-A. Of course Cavill. How could there be a possible better candidate to play the perfect Superman? And the chemistry between Costner and Diane Lane with Cavill is nothing short of perfect casting. And I cannot forget the wonderfully talented Michael Shannon. Shannon and Cavill make this movie experience an experience in itself. I also must make a point of the action sequences in this film. ""Man of Steel"" of course delivers in its story, but another delivery comes from the action. Though many people rant about the action sequence in ""The Avengers"" as well as the sequences in the popular ""Transformers"" movies. I can most honestly assure you that ""Man of Steel"" makes these films, though good, look like child's play. I could go on and on about this masterpiece of a movie, but as many words as I type and however long this review or any review may be, ""Man of Steel"" cannot be explained with words. You most experience this movie for yourself in its entirety. ""Man of Steel"" delivers in all ways imaginable. Go see ""Man of Steel"" and I can assure you, this movie will leave you with one feeling and one feeling only. That feeling? ""I'm gonna get back in line.

I saw it twice. Although i loved it the first time around, in the second viewing I completely understood why the writers and director took the approach of portraying this Superman the way they did. All the actors were great. Character development was kept to a minimal. The reason behind that decision is because it is a Superman origin story. The main focus was him. The action and visuals were beautiful and stunning. Best 'serious' superhero action in a movie so far. Throughout the movie you see the internal conflict Superman has to overcome. Not all is seriousness. Superman ends with a positive feel. He seems to feel relieved about all the conflicts he is having and shows us a lighter side of him by the end. The sequels to come are going to be as phenomenal. The director understands that in order to give fans the 'real' Superman he had to stray away from what we are accustomed to. How was Henry's performance? He was excellent as the new Superman. That man carries the suit with pride.So please do your self a favor and do not listen to the 'professional' critics who are bashing this movie based on previous incarnations or lack of romance.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So honky. They could have easily modified and made a Twilight Zone movie. If you watch it, you will never watch it again. And they are considering a sequel - Man of Steel 2 !!! Amy Adams and Diane Lane plays great parts, Adams as Lois Lane the very investigative reporter. Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White is stiff and shows no personality. The movie was made for the action. Definitely not for the story. Clark Kent does not keep his superman powers hidden. He tells everyone he has special powers, especially to Lois Lane. Not much of a story. Action filled but empty story. How bad could the sequel be. I guess by the reviews some have enjoyed the movie or the hype. Save your money and go see a real movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","No spoiler (unless you haven't seen the trailer!) - I'll answer: Type of storyline, action, 3D vs 2D, duration, acting, music, after the credit","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814775/?ref_=tt_urv","audran-alexandre","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44339758/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2013","** SummaryIf you're a fan you will most certainly love it. If you're not (like my date) you might find it too long and some action scenes being unnecessary. If you didn't like the previous Superman movies with the perfect, well shaved, invincible, emotionless Superman; you will probably like this one as it's really different!** Duration & after the creditThe movie is 2 hours and 23 minutes and there is nothing after the credit so no need to wait for it. It really covers a huge part of Superman life. As you can see from the trailer, it spans from before his birth, then childhood, to the beginning of his adult life. You'll end up discovering some facts about Superman you probably didn't know (unless you read all the comic books)** Type of storyline and TBC SequelChristopher Nolan (all new Batman movies, Inception) is the producer, Zach Snyder (300, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead) is the director and David S. Goyer (new Batman movies, Blade, Call of Duty) the screenwriter. Therefore you can expect a storyline slightly darker than the usual Superman, with definitely more depth into the his character. That is the first time you really see his ""human"" side and some weaknesses not linked to kryptonite. However, listening to other people complaints: many found the movie being divided into two movies. The first one having a lot of depth with Superman being the unique being we all expect but with problems on his own. The second one having too many Kryptonians flying around looks more like a basic alien movie packed with over the top actions making the audience slightly frustrated not to have seen the usual ""Invincible Superman stops the bad guys"" (but hey, this is why there will be a Man of Steel 2 and probably a third one too and Superman appearing in a Justice League movie in the middle - TBC) The storyline is very linear but the flashbacks provides good insights into the past. A few goose spot on my arms at moments.** Action scenesThe action scenes are good. As you can see from the trailer, some people can punch back Superman and it makes the action scenes extremely powerful and different from the usual ""invincible"" Superman who at some point will get weak from kryptonite exposure. The only problem for some people is that the action scenes are not spread across the movie evenly but mainly concentrated in one third of the movie. I caught my date checking her finger nails during some of the action scenes.** 3D or 2DThe 3D is definitely not necessary. It adds a little bit of depth but this is definitely not a 3D movie (i.e.: nothing really popping out of the screen) The problem with 3D is that you lose some of the brightness.** ActingHenry Cavill is doing a great job (funny enough my date really enjoyed all of the topless scenes from him when he's not talking(?)) and the acting from Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane and Harry Lennix is impeccable. ** MusicIt is composed by Hans Zimmer (Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, new Batman movies, Gladiator, Sherlock Holmes, Frost/Nixon, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, The Last Samurai, Tears of the Sun, The Ring, Hannibal, The Thin Red Line, The Pledge, The Rock and so much more..). As expected from a guy who won more than 50 awards, it is really deep and impressive. The score is all brand new and doesn't sound like any previous scores.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill played such an amazing Character making him in my opinion the best ""man of steel"" their could be. The film overall was astonishing which left me on the edge of my seat in the cinema. It's a piece that will fill your heart with joy and sorrow where you can reflect the movie upon our existence in the universe. The score by Hans Zimmer was absolutely perfection, it added such an ambient feel to the film which complimented the cinematography. In conclusion this was one of the best reimbursement of all superhero movies out there alongside the dark knight. I felt like Henry Cavill's character resembled love and passion which made the film so much more ""Epic"". I have seen some special effects in my filmmaking career and this has got to be one of the best visual and digital effects i've seen in a movie. the story line was phenomenal.

If you go watch a WWE wrestling match and then Cops, you'll essentially have just watched Man of Steel.

The fight scene between General Zod and Superman had been stolen from Matrix Revolution when Neo and Mr Smith fight, I got bored by this time and didn't care for the rest of the film.Surely it is time that script writers stop stealing parts of other films and come up with an original script of their own.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It wasn't perfect, but it's a fun ride. I love the overall themes, fight scenes, and all the acting. I was cool with some of the core changes they made that might make some hardcore fans mad as well. The pacing of the first half felt rushed and disjointed, and I wish they did it more linear so we could get more of Kevin Costner with young Clark and get more invested in the character rather than flashbacks moments interspersed throughout. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely (though I get the complaints about them) and thought the last 45 mins of the film were stellar. I especially enjoyed how much this movie incorporates not only the super hero saving humanity but humanity (especially Lois) helping save him as well as Superman empowering them to save themselves. Superman is the ultimate immigrant who comes to make his new world a better while also realizing he cherishes, needs, and dependent on his new home as well. I think they did a decent job exploring this theme. Overall, it's a good modern take on Superman that gets me excited to see Superman in all his glory for the sequel now that the origin story is out of the way. Also, I loved the subtle moments between Lois and Clark in the film. More in the sequel please. I give it a 7 or 7.5 out of 10. Not as high as I wanted to be but nowhere near the asinine rubbish most movie critics make it out to be. Don't listen to their bloviating. It's miles ahead of Returns and a good step in the right direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When this film was announced I had very high expectations and they weren't disappointed at all, but let's take it easy. The film lasts 2 hours and 23 minutes, as the film progresses it is very slow at the beginning in my opinion, so let's say that the first hour feels in full all the weight if you can say so. But the climate of the film changes drastically, the last hour is all explosions and fighting and if managed by Snyder they are nothing short of spectacular. In short it can be said that in my opinion Snyder did an excellent job but mishandling the flashbacks and the pacing of the film, the thing I appreciate however is the fact that the film is full of Easter Eggs, which almost made the vision of the film almost like a game and it's not bad at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Do also keep in mind when watching this movie that it's a ""Superman Movie"" and none of this is real but the CGI used were damn impressive, making it as close to reality as possible.

"10","/10","The Superman Film We Deserved!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814466/?ref_=tt_urv","thussain-3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40166208/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","Words fail to describe how great this film is. Yes they have been countless re-tellings of the origin of Superman, from movies to cartoons to TV shows. However here we have what I feel is the definitive origin story of Superman, rather than being tacked on at the beginning for 5 Min's there is around a half an hour sequence on the gorgeous planet of Krypton which is beautifully made depicting the final hours of the planet and the choices Jor-el has to make. It also shows Superman growing learning that he is different from all the other children, one particular scene in a classroom is a standout moment. We get a real feeling of this is how it would really be for someone from a different world to ours. The acting in Man of Steel is top notch for the most part with special credit going to Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner, both of them play the fathers of Superman very well indeed. You can see the struggle they both go through with Kal, Russell to send his son to earth and Kevin protecting his son from revealing his powers to earthlings. Henry Cavill plays a very interesting Superman, rather than being a carbon copy of Christopher Reeve, he plays Superman with his own charisma and charm as well as being serious at times. A beautiful moment in the film which I shall not spoil is just after the first time Superman puts on his new and much better looking suit which is one of the greatest moments in the Movie. Michael Shannon plays a very good and very menacing villain to the piece as General Zod where he is genuinely terrifying at times and yet you can still almost see it from his point of view, although I still slightly prefer Terrence Stamps version. Amy Adams as Lois Lane I honestly felt started the movie very strong as a feisty journalist but in the end she became the usual damsel in distress which I suppose is expected.Now the final hour or so in this movie is absolutely ridiculous, I have never seen action like this in my film, it literally makes The Avengers look like a walk in the park. There is so much action it's almost hard to concentrate on what is going on at any one time but Zach Snyder does a wonderful job of making it look otherworldly maybe even a little bit OTT. The Special effects are amazing and make it feel like this could actually be happening in the world instead of just being done in green screen. For DC nerds like myself watch out for many little easter eggs in this final hour that will bring a little smile to your faces if your quick enough to catch them. The Final moment of the battle is so shocking that everyone in the cinema I was watching it with took an audible gasp, it is probably the most jaw-dropping moment from any superhero film made as none of you will see it coming.Of course the soundtrack has to be mentioned as it is an original score done by the legendary Hans Zimmer. While not as iconic as the original it is a fantastic score which can fill you with emotion during the sombre parts of the film and still get your blood rushing during the action. There is no other word for it, this is the perfect Superman film. People will have their complaints about it being too dark or there not being enough humor. But as someone who grew up reading the Superman comics, watching the movies and TV shows and understanding how he should be portrayed as an alien with incredible powers instead of a clown looking to get a one-liner in here or there, this is as good as it gets. Zach Snyder, David Goyer and Christopher Nolan (whose influence you can see dotted around this whole film) knock it out of the park. I truly recommend you go out and watch this film, not only because it is truly amazing but also for the fact that this could be the jump start to a possible Justice League Movie in the near future.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a perfect blend of realism and fantasy, if there is such a thing. Zack told this story in such a compelling way that you could not help but be sit in anticipation for the next scene. The character development in this story is as good as it gets. You see Clark's entire journey internally; almost every choice he makes in the movie he thinks about first. For the first time in a long time in comic book movies, you see the true man before you see the ""superhero."" The underlying theme in the entire movie, to me, is knowing oneself. And Zack did a wonderful job telling that. Henry Cavill- could not have been a more perfect choice! Brilliant!!!! Amy Adams-awesome! My only problem with the entire movie was Laurence Fishbourne. I felt they kinda wasted his talents, and the potential of the character. Nevertheless even he did a solid job with what he was given. Michael Shannon was incredible. While he didn't completely own the role like Heath Ledger did with Joker, he was fantastic, nonetheless. I saw it in 3D and was thoroughly pleased. Finally, a superhero film that uses 3D to its advantage (Avengers only did it a little bit). The fight scenes are definitely the highlight of the movie. I love the cinematography, steady cam fast-paced action. You feel like you in the middle of the fight. This is the first movie since TDK to make me feel like a kid again. It is definitely working its way into my top favorite movies of all time. Kudos, Zack Snyder.BTW, Chris Nolan's realism is stamped all over this movie and it did not take away from the god-like appearance of Kal-El. So all you Nolan- haters can suck a fat one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It all started back in the late 30s but his name was just Superboy, then as the years and decades progressed this great phenomenon became the truth, the justice and the American way. Superman has graced our lives and hearts for 75 years ever since that one comic book hit the newsstands back in 1938 and now with digitally enhanced supersonic strength and digitally mastered special effects, we begin to hope again.This movie has outshone every facet of this superhero's life from the very first appearance on television with George Reeves to the incomparable Christopher Reeve then it went onto Dean Cain then television did it right again with Tom Welling then it went good with Brandon Routh and now the red and the blue returns for a new chapter with Henry Cavill as he joins this elite squad of the red blue blur. Everything about Man of Steel, was perfectly done and at the helm of it all Zack Snyder, who brought us Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Legends of the Guardians, Sucker Punch and now Man of Steel. And right beside him was the Batman Trilogy director Chris Nolan – excellent and superb job well done. The graphics, the CGI, the effects both sound and special – were out of this world.Speaking ""out of this world"", I am reminded of what Jor-El once told his son Kal-El, ""Krypton lives inside of you wherever you go."" Superman a.k.a. Clark Kent will live inside all of us from now and into eternity.

Which is why it's so hard to admit that the latest chapter in the DC cannon is actually quite good.However, it is some small consolation that this appears to be the direct result of Batman saviours Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer keeping Snyder's most garish excesses in check. Instead, they've crafted an origin story that is both familiar and new, from an overlong opener on a dying Krypton to a childhood in Kansas told in flashback to the rise of a superhero pitted against the only surviving members of his race as warmongering zealot General Zod tracks him down. Without doubt, Man of Steel is weakest when Snyder's hyperkinetic style is unleashed. The jittery camera-work and occasionally half-baked effects detract from the otherwise bone-crunching hurly burly as near immortals throw each other across small towns and bustling Metropoli as DC seem determined to outdo their Marvel rivals in terms of on screen destruction.It's no surprise that Michael Shannon wears the cloak of relentlessly genocidal psychopath like a glove in yet another role that he seems to have been born to play. Like Shannon, Russell Crowe sidelines memories of his predecessor as noble Jor-El. Acquitting himself with equal aplomb despite even greater scrutiny is Henry Cavill as the titular Man of Steel. Unlike the - let's face it, terminally dull - goody two shoes Supermen of previous incarnations, Cavill's Superman is good to his core thanks to his upbringing, but also unmistakably human to boot. Not for him endless martyrdom and humble forgiveness - this Supes has a temper. The rest of the cast (largely quality character actors plucked from primetime TV) put their backs into necessarily one dimensional characters. Oddly, only the usually likable Amy Adams fails to light up the screen, leaving Margot Kidder's Lois Lane the as yet unsurpassed benchmark. Some will miss the underpants (that's right, they've been banished), Jimmy Olsen, and other much-loved tropes, not least John Williams' iconic theme music. But, nostalgic as I am for the Superman of old, it's hard to deny that Hans Zimmer's effort are at least as stirringIt's clear from the grounded look of the film (only the heat vision jars) that Nolan's Batman will not form part of the much vaunted Justice League movie. This isn't just a Superman reboot - the fate of the entire DC multiverse rests on Man of Steel's box office. And so it is - grudgingly - that this sceptic must confess to being very keen to see more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... a slightly disappointing ""Superman"" movie! ""Man of Steel"" is wildly entertaining, yet suffers a rushed pace and lack of development.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2913478/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","29 November 2013","A few years ago, after Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" became a billion-dollar hit and a critical darling, I noticed a trend: Everyone on every message board I went to declared that Nolan should be responsible for every new film coming out. Someone was discussing a new ""Die Hard""? Someone else would immediately say ""Nolan should do it!"" Someone was discussing a ""Fantastic Four"" reboot? Someone else would chime in with ""How about Christopher Nolan directs it?"" Heck, I'm pretty sure people would've suggested Nolan for a new ""Teletubbies"" TV show.The fact was, Nolan's dark, gritty, socio-political, realistic take on ""Batman"" hit home for many audiences. So it seemed like a logical choice for Nolan to produce and co-write the newest entry in the ""Superman"" franchise- a reboot entitled ""Man of Steel.""But I had reservations. Don't get me wrong, I adore Nolan's films. I think he's one of the finest directors working today, along with Paul Thomas Anderson, Guillermo del Toro and a few select others I hold in very high regard. And his body of work is an impressive sight to behold- every film almost unanimously adored by critics, fans and general audiences. But I do think Nolan's style shouldn't be applied to certain characters and films.And I do think Nolan's dark, gritty influence is one of many problems plaguing director Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"", which Nolan co-wrote with his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy co-scribe David S. Goyer. (Goyer was also responsible for the fantastic ""Blade"" series, another dark superhero franchise)The film follows Clark Kent/Kal-El (Henry Cavill), an alien who was blasted to Earth as an infant when his home planet was destroyed. Raised by a kindly old farmer and his wife, Clark has been searching his life for a place in the world and the secrets to his own past, all while trying to conceal his almost inhuman super-powers from others. When an award winning reporter named Lois Lane (Amy Adams) begins to learn more about him, and a villain from his planet's past comes to claim him from Earth, Clark is forced to embrace his destiny as a protector of Earth and become a superhero known as ""Superman.""The film does have a lot going for it, but it suffers from many, many issues.The cast is decent, although very mixed. Cavill certainly looks the part of both Clark and Superman, though his character is all but completely undeveloped, so Cavill isn't really given room to show off his acting chops. Adams shows much potential as Lois, but again, is undeveloped enough that we can't really get a feeling for how good she could potentially be. Michael Shannon as the villain (General Zod) hams it up suitably, and is able to provide a compelling enough baddie for Superman to duel. And supporting roles by the likes of Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Costner are actually surprisingly well- played and developed for secondary characters.The direction by Snyder is also a fairly mixed bag. Snyder has adopted a common directorial style with this film- that of the gritty, shaky, ""realistic"" pseudo-documentary camera-work. You know what I mean- where the camera is almost always hand-held and very shaky to try and give the film a more realistic, tense style. It works and it doesn't work all at once. It actually does make the action feel surprisingly intimate (even when it's anything but as Zod and Superman throw each other through buildings) and some of the more tense dialog exchanges are made more urgent. However, it becomes hard to watch at times, and many of the scenes become shaky, confusing messes. It's a case where Snyder's style works half the time, but fails miserably the other half.The script is also mixed, and is the source of both the main strengths and the main weaknesses of the film. The strengths include some great moments of complexity, particularly earlier in the film, where we see a young Clark interacting with his human father, as well as the wonderful building of suspense later in the movie. However, the weaknesses of the script lay in something mentioned above- a severe lack of development. And this lack of development is compounded by the script's other major flaw- too fast a pace.This movie tries to do far too much for it's own good, and the cost of that is the fact that our two lead characters- Clark and Lois, go all but completely undefined and undeveloped. This is a film of ""Stuff happening"", and thus we never really learn what motivates Clark or makes him tick, nor do we see why Lois is so dedicated to her work. And it hurts not only the performances, but also the story, as we just don't care about what's going on as much as we ought. And the pace makes it hard to connect with the events transpiring, because it's just too much moving too quickly.But those big complaints being said- this isn't a total loss. Those early scenes are fantastic, and the action is absolutely heart-stopping. There are also some surprisingly complex developments later on, including a controversial ending, which I won't spoil. But I will say- it's a moment that will redeem the film for you, or ruin it. And it actually helped redeem the film for me.Despite some seriously flaws, ""Man of Steel"" still has enough to like about it that I cannot dismiss it. And thus, I am giving it an average 5 out of 10. Go in looking for a fun action-fest and you shouldn't be too disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is not the familiar origin story I grew up with, it was like reading the comic book all over again! We now see Superman in his most human. The actors were well cast, especially Amy Adams as Lois Lane because I haven't liked any incarnations of her on the silver screen until she came along. Henry Cavill is the Superman that came from the comic books, big, strong, square-jawed, it looked like Jim Lee/Alex Ross fleshed him out in real life. General Zod and his small Kryptonian army were the villains I was expecting, ruthless and single-minded in their endeavor. It was nice to see, for a change, the struggle for Clark Kent to control his abilities and his journey for truth. It was even better to see his birthplace, Krypton, visualized in a different manner than what was expected. The story itself is a good balance between slow, emotional scenes and explosive brawls, Superman was slugging it out with the bad guys! Who wouldn't watch that? All in all, a good retelling of the Superman story. Stunning visuals, great soundtrack, heartfelt moments and adrenaline-filled action, I had waited in anticipation since I saw the teaser so long ago and it has lived up to its promise.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

All the ideas and the angle which Snyder went for are highly interesting and very fresh, but they are barely touched apon and what we get is nothing short of an incoherent mess which thinks far too much of itself without doing any actual work to have substance. The film's pace and structure is incredibly choppy. Just when something looks to get interesting the film cuts to some dreary flashback or some other drab scene and doesn't give the last one a chance to fully realise itself. This is further hindered by the script which his woefully dull.The cast however, are fantastic. Henry Cavill oozes warmth and his accent is flawless, but he's never given a chance to shine as he chews his way trough the sawdust and water flavoured dialogue while sporting a permanently ruffled brow. In interviews the man is charming and a delight but all of that is lost as Snyder directs him to constantly be moody and depressed with very little explanation as to why. Having him bleat about in a suit which looks like a basketball dipped in oil as well as a horribly washed out colour grading makes the character visually hard to connect with too.The film also has an absolutely unbearable amount of hand-held camera-work which makes it look like some rough £200 indie film, but then suddenly explodes in a mess of non stop Michael Bay style CGI, only nowhere near as good looking. I wanted to like this film so much and after the wonderful trailer (still in my top 3 trailers of all time) I was so excited to see it, but unfortunately the film has none of the optimism or glory of that trailer and we're left with a splat of stuff on screen which is poorly stitched together with no real meat on its bones to buff up the clothes that it's wearing.Top marks for its ideas, but ideas are nothing in a terrible film and in film making terms, this is a terrible film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I haven't been so excited like this in a while. This movie is made keeping in mind that the viewer is Superman. I have to say this was the most awaited movie in my life just like it was for millions of other fans, wait billions you will feel him throughout the film. This movie has got that click, that connection (may it happened to me a lot more but you will see the same effect). I had shivers down my spine and that crazy feeling throughout the movie. I was having that feeling of having powers. It was like you have been given all the strength but still you feel it a little less. You feel that, you feel every second of superman. The movie was a complete package. Nolan, Snyder and Goyer presented it in a very good way. It was perfect how the movie started and all the flashbacks, young Clark feeling his powers, it was all great and perfect. This movie is all about helping, saving and serving as Superman's sole purpose. He is the hero, the messiah, protector and friend and servant to all around. I would say the story or the end of the story could have been a bit better but come guys the enemy here is Zod. He is not Lex Luthor or Brainian or Darkseid. He is just a ZOd. He isn't that big match for Supz either. Now, every movie comes with some pros and cons but here the pros certainly cover up all the cons. Well to begin with the Technics - I loved the visuals. You might have heard - I loved everything but the visuals were fantastic. Well if you are a VFX fan then you will certainly enjoy this movie. The VFX is so good, the movie is filled with it. The Matte paintings are obviously excellent. We can see the hard work throughout the movie. At the end of the day if you don't like the movie just coz the guy is good and a complete baby face and due to some other silly predictable reasons (like IM, As and GL) Well I would tell you - you are purely evil minded who can not handle someone good. You should probably get yourself a black blanket. cover yourself up in a room and sit their for the entire life. Now wait let me give you that blanket and put you out of your misery, huh. I have to tell this because there are few posts about the same. You might have read some stupid reviews on net that Superman didn't take a flight and blah blah blah which is just trash talking. The writers probably is more into his dog curing the movie - that's why. People, this movie has it's own class, complete action and visuals. Go grab your self a ticket,some food and watch this movie. It is Amazing. Have fun.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

DC's adaptation of their arguably 2nd most popular character has finally landed and rest assured; they've nailed it this time around.Man of Steel begins with a dying planet Krypton and a three-way struggle between Jor-El (Russell Crowe), General Zod (Michael Shannon) and the Kryptonian government on how to act to their impending apocalypse. The action packed introduction ends with Zor-El sending his newborn son on a one-way trip to Earth with the hope of him becoming the best of both the kryptonians and humans. The disagreeing Zod vows to find him just before being imprisoned for treason and the story is set in motion.Director Zack Snyder -an authority on comic-book adaptations- knows exactly where Superman's previous forays into film have succeeded and where not. As a fan he knows the franchise's most notable absence is action and he addresses it by giving us an absolutely relentless (but never mind-numbing) thrill ride. The action never fails to excite because for every punch, bang and explosion there is an emotion attached, be it from the villains, the people of Earth, or the Man of Steel himself. Henry Cavill reinvents an iconic character without recurring to Brandon Routh's almost excellent mimicry of Reeves classic portrayal. He's not a boy scout, instead a conflicted individual who was raised to hide his powers until he was ready and confident to release them unto an unprepared world. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) rather than being an annoyance or a damsel in distress is absolutely brilliant as strong pillar of support for Clark to finally realize his full potential. Michael Shannon is an outright perfect villain, his devotion to his cause is admirable and his means to attain them are terrifying. He's as equally electrifying acting against both Cavill and Crowe. The rest of the supporting cast is equally brilliant in their smaller roles with a special mention to Kevin Costner who in a few minutes of screen time embodies the father Clark never had in any previous film, and also Christopher Meloni who could have quite easily fallen into the military coronel stereotype and instead manages to craft a real person out of the role.We've come to know Synder as one of the strongest visual directors working today, but instead of staying within his comfort zone of long shots and stylized slow-motion he completely reinvents himself with a fast-paced, vertigo-inducing film that only slows down for his beautiful shots of Clark's flashback-narrated origin or his epic landscape shots. But Synder's most noteworthy achievement in Man of Steel is crafting a world where Superman's extraterrestrial character really manages to create a sense of awe in Earth's people, something that was lacking in other superpowered-hero attempts. If Nolan's Batman trilogy succeeded in showing us how a world would react to vigilantism, Synder's Man of Steel epic shows us how it would react to alien life.The movie is a big step forwards for DC; not only have they managed to successfully reintroduce one their most popular characters with what will certainly be a box-office hit and one of the most talked about movies of the year, but they've also managed to find their comfort zone in a style forged by Nolan and unexplored by Marvel. Realism (not to be confused with darkness) seems to be the path DC has laid with The Dark Knight trilogy and Man of Steel, and the one they should follow with future adaptations if they ever intend to journey all the way into a Justice League adaptation.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Goyer (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Da Vinci's Demons) resurrect the Superman franchise for the modern age.Henry Cavill (previously dubbed ""The Unluckiest Man in Hollywood"") takes on the lead role of Clark Kent/Kal-El and successfully brings his struggle to life. An outcast trying to find his place in the world, Clark attempts to discover the truth behind his otherworldly abilities.Clark is helped in his struggle by his foster father Jonathan who embodies the most interesting aspect of the film. Kevin Costner plays a unique paternal figure who advises his son to hide that part of himself, as he is an extraordinary being who the world is not yet ready for. Diane Lane's Martha Kent proves a wise figure who teaches Clark to use his powers for the greater good.Russell Crowe brings a level of humanity to Jor-El, who makes the ultimate sacrifice to save his son and the future of his people, while Michael Shannon cuts an imposing figure as General Zod and embodies the character's determination and drive.While Academy Award nominee Amy Adams has undoubtedly proved her merit as an actress, her character Lois Lane is not particularly memorable or interesting. The way in which the character is written, anyone could have played her.Surprisingly, the film's standout performance is Antje Traue as Faora, Zod's write hand woman. Given some of the best dialogue in the film, she manages to make the character both elegant and menacing.Goyer's script is well written and includes a lot of inspired dialogue, while Hans Zimmer's score is excellent. But Snyder's directing gives the film it's unique style.Snyder is very much a visual director, and nowhere does he excel at this more than Krypton, which contains a lot of throwbacks to classic science fiction. For the most part the planet looks like something from Star Wars, while the technology harks back to the Alien franchise (the helmets worn by Zod and his supporters very similar to that of the Space Jockey).That being said, the film does have some flaws. While the action scenes are impressive, there are too many of them and they start to drag out towards the end. Though the flashbacks of Clark's childhood help to humanize the character, the last one is very corny and forced and the film would have been better off without it.Overall, a very good film and a decent revival of the franchise. It will be interesting to see a sequel and where the series goes from here.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder clearly likes his action scenes and it's a good thing too because the action in this is fantastic. Henry Cavill doesn't try to mimic Christopher Reeve's style of Superman but gives a new, more serious style in his portrayal of the character. The 3D doesn't particularly add to the experience but it is cool to see some of the Superman flying scenes in 3D. I wouldn't worry too much about seeing it in 3D because it's just as good in 2D. At the beginning we see a fresh take on Krypton. It's not as perfect and utopian and you spend more time with Jor-El (Russell Crowe) who does a lot more action than in the original. Zack Snyder doe the origin story of Kal-El a bit differently by using flashbacks when the main plot is taking place (a bit like Batman Begins and there's a more of Christopher Nolan's influence in the film too, however Zack Snyder clearly dominates direction). This film does not have much humor. This isn't a bad thing because if they tried to make this film as humorous and light-hearted as the original, it would look very much like a copycat and I think that they avoided the mistake that it's predecessor, Superman Returns made (and the Amazing Spider-Man, which was okay but too similar to the 2002 version). In short, I absolutely loved this film. It is, in my opinion, the best film of the year so far and I highly recommend it, even if you're not a huge fan of the Christopher Reeve Superman films (or the Brandon Routh one).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was amazed by what Henry Cavill has done with this opportunity. Content was largely limited to a few lines.Snyder was able to answer a lot of things that were vague about Superman. He selects a very few aspects of the greatest Superhero to solve and he solves those well. But that leaves us in a dilemma: not all of them are solved, a few missed ones may cause a complex situation while projecting the star in future. Made in more grounded way like Batman Begins, with all the filthy yet real world back-ground, this movies gave logic to many of the unsolved questions pinned to the Kryptonian A lot of details were missing and lot more of things could have been arranged better.Having said all this, this is a blistering opening to the much awaited Superman Franchise; add to it a heavy dose of Special Effects (I would have dug deep to establish a base for him, like in Batman Begins, but we can sure live with this). Believe me, for the greatest of all Superheroes, fighting for long with minions in the war, is degrading though you can call it natural or whatever. Cavill makes a very flesh and blood Superman Brutally crushes the Rival World Avengers in grandeur. Gave the elusive Superman Character a face to set the ship on the long journey. And whatever he made, Snyder made it sure that you would eagerly wait for the next release of Man of Steel as eagerly as you waited for the Dark Knight Sequel. Nolan with all the scriptwriting responsibility fails, but then, when a great fails, even that is a masterpiece too. I was hurt in particular with the way they have altered the character of Lois Lane, more so because the role is supposed to be a three dimensional paradigm: first the damsel in distress, second the chatty and devil may care reporter, and third she is the one who has traditionally brought comic relief to an overwhelmingly sombre environment of Superman. That is missing, I would have loved to see someone different and grand, may be a better and bigger actor, in the lines of Scarlett Johansson or a Natalie Portman or Kiera Knightley for this role (Not Kate Winslet). Romance was missing, but these are early days to get started with romance.What was a puncture point, for me at least was the sudden or rather abrupt realization of most of his super-powers, something that makes me feel, dude you missed a few years of evolution there . . . .","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

So I felt I was a little bit board. The visual effect was stunning but the design of the 'alien stuf'f was absolutely horrible' Anyways the biggest problem for me was that I never felt that anything was real, or there were any real stakes. I expected the movie to be a bit more like 'batman' dark and trying to place the comic hero in to the real world. The cinematography was too nice, like a parfume commercial.

The bad guy is not just evil because he is evil, but it is because he believes what he is doing is right.In the same vein Superman does what he thinks is right.

This is the sophisticated rendition of Man of Steel we've been waiting for.So here's a question: What's a ""professional movie critic"", anyway? Today's movie critics have gotten so cliquey and snooty, that their reviews no longer hold any relevance for the rest of the 99.99% of the population who are not graduates of some snooty New York Theater / Performing Arts program. Guess what, professional critics? It's official: you are utterly obsolete, and provide absolutely no useful information whatsoever, when it comes to helping decide whether or not a film is any good.After reading one negative ""professional"" review about Man of Steel after another, I began wondering if this installment of Superman would be a dud. As it turns out, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I saw the film on opening night, after reading the crappy reviews, and I'm still amazed how completely wrong the ""professional"" critics were.Enough ranting. Man of Steel has to be the absolute best film I've seen in 18 or 20 years. It was just flat out so completely entertaining. And isn't that point of going to the movies? We just want 2 hours and 30 minutes of entertainment, where we can suspend disbelief, and listen to a story be expertly told while drinking in the amazing visuals. Man of Steel was 2.5 hours of ENTERTAIN ME LIKE NEVER BEFORE. I loved every minute of it. I watched it in 3D and I'm going to see it a second time in IMAX. And that's saying something, since I almost never watch a movie more than once.Man of Steel 2013 delivers all of the things we wanted, and for once gives us a superhero story without the obligatory watered down childish elements that always seem to pop into superhero films. For instance, most superhero films end up softening the edges, or inserting some moronic, quirky character- the Jar Jar Binks equivalent of the various Marvel or DC Universe. Man of Steel does no such thing, and never whores itself out to be ""kid friendly"". It tells the story by adults, and for adults, and delivers the sophisticated rendition we've been waiting for.Don't listen to the morons who call themselves ""professional"" film critics. Flat out, they're mostly wrong once again.10/10 for the film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

About one hour after leaving the theater with awe, I sat down with excitement to write about this film.I have a feeling that this may become my favorite movie. I'm not one to really hop on board with the general consensus when it comes to trends and icons, but I'm absolutely sure this movie will take the eyes of society. I'm also pretty sure this will place very well on IMDb's list as time goes on.First of all: If you can see this movie in a theater that has an advanced sound system, DO IT. I saw Man of Steel in a large screen room with a new Atmos System installed and it was AMAZING. The sound effects in this film will blow you away. Not only could I hear everything- I could feel it. More than once, I had shivers down my limbs from the experience in the theater.When it comes to rating Man of Steel as a story and a picture- I don't know how to give it less than 10 stars. I can't. The definition of perfection always seemed stupid in my eyes, but while watching this beautiful movie that's all I could think about it: perfection. It has everything from an air tight plot to visually stunning scenes. Through the entire 2 hours and 23 minutes I was absorbed in the intensity displayed, whether or not it was present as quiet ethereality or explosive action. There also didn't appear to be an ""in between"" existent. Each scene flowed so effortlessly that my excitement at the beginning of the beginning of the movie only grew until the finale. The only thing I can continue to drag on about this movie is that it is worth each star I gave it. I know how hard it is to give such a score, but it deserved all ten. The blend of elements captured me in no way I've felt before from a movie. I'm so glad they avenged the story of Superman with such a masterful piece of film (We all know how much of a failure the last few were.)Now, after dribbling over this movie like someone who just escaped an asylum of happiness, the only thing left to do is recommend this movie to you. It will not disappoint you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After the colossal failure of ""Superman Returns,"" a reboot was inevitable and a new angle needed to take place. Now we get the dark and realistic Superman, which I have no problem with one doing, but the foundation for this film is completely unstable. Before I get into the meat of this review, I'll talk about what I liked. The visual effects are great. There are tiny glimmers of potential greatness (this might actually be a flaw later on), and while the action is mind-numbing, insane, and overlong, there is a part of me that enjoys watching the extreme lengths a movie will go. It's when a movie just says, ""F-ck it"" and goes all the way. Though, you'll need the right sense of humor, otherwise you'll probably die watching this. Now, that's all the good stuff. I know, not a whole lot. The flaws of this film come with the editing, cinematography, pacing, character development, and the acting. The editing and pacing show us Clark Kent's life completely out of order. It jumps all around his life. He's a fisherman, then he's a kid, then he's a bum, etc. You're never going to be able to relate to this guy because the editing and pacing is so poor and doesn't satisfy a smooth transition into this type of Superman film. From what I heard, director Zack Snyder was trying to make Superman relatable by making him consistent with our world, thus the removal of the red underwear. Maybe Snyder should have actually focused on ordering this cluttered mess so we the audience can experience some character progression. The cinematography is shaky for the purposes of achieving grit, but it's also shaky when two people are having a simple conversation, and it's made worse since the conversations are conceived of mostly close-ups. Okay, major problems. There is no character development. Lois Lane isn't like Lois Lane at all and is completely bland. The Daily Planet characters are barely even mentioned, yet we're supposed to care about them later. The military characters are all typical. Superman himself is pretty dreary and distant. The only character I actually got was Zod. He's the only one with any real goal or conviction. Superman's goals were really just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Superman is sent to Earth and then Jor-El tells him that he must save the people of Earth. But they wouldn't need saving if Superman never went there in the first place. Instead of the film having Clark Kent integrate within society, they elevate him above everyone as of he were Jesus or something. There's a really funny church scene in this movie where Clark Kent is in profile with an image of Jesus on a stain-glass window. It's like amateurs made this film. Now, what about the acting? Henry Cavill had moments of charm, and he tries his best, but the script is just poorly written. He has nothing to work with. Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, and whoever else were all bland because their characters were just inserts who served a single, mechanical purpose to the film's requirements. Such as: love interest, emotional support, and exposition (and lots of it). Michael Shannon is a great actor and a personal favorite, and he also tries his best here, but again, the script is fatal, and he hasn't a lot to work with. The film attempts drama with Costner and kid Clark, but it's just redundant and boring. Costner says the same thing throughout the entire movie. The worst part is that there were glimmers of potential in this film, and you should know that I hate wasted potential. The film is just too heavy and extreme. It has so much weight to it but zero substance. It's a heavy hollow shell of a film that falls flat on its face trying to mimic the Dark Knight formula. The reason for this is because Superman is an ideal and a concept. He's heroic and uplifting. This is what made him such a great contrast to Batman whenever they teamed up, but now, he's just like Batman. 5/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However this movie is a new approach for both the director and the rebooted franchise. Man of steel does show the origins of superman and his people known as Kryptonians. Man of steel is a beautiful action film, with a great story, maybe not a fantastic story but definitely better than the Marvel's Avengers story line. Here we see a new side of superman which make it a bit realistic and gives him more character of a human and Kryptonian.A great fun summer blockbuster with a story that everyone can enjoy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I got goosebumps throughout the film,the fight scenes were simply mind-blowing and I was on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend that you go watch this film. You won't be disappointed.

This action filled movie leaves you at the edge of your seat. But of course there was one thing that I did not like. It moves through the movie too quickly. At the start I feel like I don't really know Superman and he's already using his suit and understanding his ancient planet's history. It just moved to quickly and I would have loved to understand his personality and his struggle in the beginning. The movie jumped back and forth through out the beginning of the movie which would have been more ideal if it was put in chronological order. After that, it seems like Snyder deliberately filled the second half of the movie with action. The thing about it is that after a while, the action that continues to display seems almost dull. You just get so used to it all. Overall my only problem with it is that we want to know more about Superman! The action doesn't affect the movie terribly, it's just too much after a while.Now, what I loved about this movie was, well, that it came out to be an amazing movie! I enjoyed the beginning, which showed how Kal (Superman) was sent to Earth (NO SPOILERS). I feel like that was a really good hook to the movie. After that, they show Kal and him working in a variety of places. He is soon being investigated by none other than Lois Lane. I don't want to jump into detail for those who yet to watch the movie. But I definitely recommend watching this in the theaters! Overall I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We've seen him from just about every angle, right? What else could they possibly do with this ancient comic stalwart?A lot, it turns out. Snyder and Nolan have outdone themselves in one of the best from both of them. Not a whole lot changes, story wise...I think both knew that fans and even common folk would cry foul if they changed it up too much. So they did something a little different: focus more on the man, and less on the super. This movie is not so much a juggernaut fighting a huge enemy, as it is the story of a man who inspires people. Cavill delivers the heavy hits as the titular Man of Steel, true, but it is the highlights of humanity that tells this story. Earth is his home, and it shapes him as much as the people that live there. It would have been easy to let Supes do all the heavy lifting, but it was a pleasant surprise to see his heroics complemented by the efforts of the people he was helping to save. It focused as much on the heroics of the human soldiers and civilians as it did the man in tights, and you end up rooting as much for them as you do Superman.I had my doubts about the casting, as it seemed like they got some big names that wouldn't necessarily fill the parts. Forget what you heard about Henry Cavill being too serious, he plays a perfect Superman. Russell Crowe plays an earnest, stoic Jor-El that buries the Marlon Brando iteration. Kevin Costner proves that he's still got it with a Jonathan Kent that is indispensable to this story. Amy Adams proves her acting chops as a Lois Lane that rivals Margot Kidder's version. Michael Shannon plays a Zod that you sympathize with while despising his every action. These four characters, they had to get right, but it's the ones that you don't expect that steal the show: Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White, a brutal Faora, and particularly the actors that played the soldiers: not overly dripping with American hoo-ah, but heroic in a much more relatable way.If I had one complaint, it's that there's almost too many great characters. This movie is a giant clash of wills, and at times, it's difficult to keep up with it all. The chaos ends up lending itself to do what no Superman movie has ever done before...and I can't tell you what that is. What I can say is that, at the end, the message rings loud and clear that greatness lies within all of us. That's the mark of a great story: the one that tells you something about yourself that you don't hear often enough.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storyline is thorough and easy to follow, but keeps your interest. Acting is very good. Russell Crowe's Jor-El is more in depth. Kevin Costner's Jonathan Kent is more supportive in a Father Figure role. Henry Cavill's Clark Kent takes on a more serious tone, and is mostly referred to as Kal-El instead of Superman, which is mentioned only 3 or 4 times in the movie. Also Cavill's version is darker. Amy Adams' Lois Lane is more heroine than Margot Kidder's version. Special effects are top notch, and there is more violence than all previous Superman movies.Krypton's issues, other than its ultimate demise, are told in detail. The center of the story focuses on Kal-El and his trials of an alien living amongst humans.Clark's childhood is told in flashbacks, which come at certain times throughout the movie.Notice I haven't mentioned Brandon Routh's version. There is a very valid reason. His doesn't even fill Cavill's boots.I don't want to give too much away, but this Superman reboot is more structural in storyline, very good acting, top notch special effects, and a heart bigger than Christopher Reeve's legacy. I give it 2 Big Thumbs Up!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The FX of the film were great too,and I really loved the flying sequences of Supes every time.In general,the cast did an excellent job to reintroduce Superman to a new generation,and the music,again,by composer Hans Zimmer was great.I felt sorry when Jor El and Lara saw their planet being destroyed.This is a very good film,I am looking forward to the sequel how about naming the sequel ""Superman:The Man of Tomorrow?""Henry Cavill is handsome and a very good actor.Thank you for giving us this great Superman reintroduction!I give the film 10 stars!

I've been pumped for this movie ever since seeing the teaser trailer a year ago. The trailers are a bit misleading though. They made me think that this movie would be on a deeper emotional level than most other super hero films, and it is for the most part. There are several emotional and powerful scenes, but there just wasn't enough of that. The rest of the time was filled with mindless destruction and violence, which isn't surprising since it is a blockbuster super hero film, but I had expected much more of the movie. The whole film ended up with a ridiculous amount of action and not quite enough story. The story that was presented was a great one, but there weren't enough story driven scenes. Which was very disappointing. I thought the acting was nothing special, Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner add some emotion to it. Henry Calvill gives a decent performance, he lacks emotional depth. Besides those things, I thought the film was well put together. The score was great, i've been listening to it constantly since i saw the film. Hans Zimmer is successful once again! The visual effects were amazing! Man of Steel is my favorite movie this summer. It is a great blockbuster, but lacks the emotional depth that I was expecting. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and epic night at the theater. Anyone who is looking for a deep and thought provoking movie, you might want to think twice.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film expands on both stories seen on the first two Superman films with Zod and the end of Krypton and the struggles of Clark growing up in a world he's just a little too different in.The battle scenes where epic and cgi was spot on, like they did back in the original by making a film where you would believe this man could fly Snyder has given us a film where we believe in the character, feel for his story, root for him as a hero and leave the cinema begging for a sequel.

"8","/10","One of the Best Super-hero Movies I've seen in a long time!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2815654/?ref_=tt_urv","hammancameron","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34188198/?ref_=tt_urv","18 June 2013","Man of Steel ReviewHello everyone and today I'll be giving you my review on the very anticipated 'Man of Steel'. First off I want to say that this movie definitely had a different tone and vibe to it when you compare it to other movies, which fall under the 'super-hero genre'. This would be obviously expected as DC like to add a more serious darker tone to their movies than Marvel do. What's the result of this? You get a summer block-buster, which makes you leave the Cinema thinking 'Wow... Man of Steel is definitely a movie that I'm glad that I saw!' One aspect of the movie that I was quite surprised at was the way how they decided to show Super man's aka Clark Dent's origin story. We see it through a series of scenes in chronological order throughout the first half of the movie, which in my opinion was a great approach. This was actually a really effective way of showing us his journey to being Super man. Take the 'Amazing Spider-man' for example, when you compare the two origin stories, they're very different. Spider-man's was a fairly straight forward story (not saying Spider-man is bad at all) However, when you compare it to 'Man of Steel', it definitely doesn't have all the different layers in place. I thought seeing the duel-narrative of seeing Clark Dent as a child discovering who he is alongside the actual movie storyline was an excellent choice. Another defining aspect of the movie has the other whelming action at times. I've read reviews saying that: 'There is too much action in the movie' and for that some critics have slammed 'Man of Steel' for it, I however, have to disagree. Some of the visuals and actions scenes in the movie were spectacular! Even better than the Avengers? Yes. At times being sat in my seat and just thinking 'Wow...' However to some extent, the movie could have cut out a 30 second action scene in some places and replaced it with another scene, which would have had a bigger impact on the story line. So in that sense less would be more, but either way it doesn't detract too much from the actual quality of the movie for me. I felt the plot of the movie was good also. Sometimes in movies (especially super hero movies) we get a vague plot which basically goes by: 'bad guy comes along, now we need to get rid off him' and we get the same boring plot. What Man of Steel manages to do is to add in more layers, situations and depth to the storyline. I feel it's a thing that DC manages to do very well in their movies. We saw that in the Dark Knight Trilogy and it works so well in my opinion. What Marvel sometimes manages to do, is to fall in the trap of the regular plot of 'bad guy comes along, now we need to get rid off him' type storyline. I thought seeing the his origin along side with the actual movie plot added more depth and tone throughout the movie.There is a whole lot more about Man of Steel I could talk about, but what you'd get is a huge essay that would bore the hell out of you, so I gave you the 3 main parts of the movie in my opinion. Just to add that I thought the acting was great too. I felt Henry Cavil really did nail his character as Clark Dent aka Super man. Amy Adams was really good at carrying out her role as Lois Lane and their relationship through the movie was great, Not to mention Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon being amazing also. I honestly can't criticise the movie too much, apart from the fact that they could have cut down on the action a little bit at times. If I had to criticise the movie further, I can't mention anything significant enough that it matters, or has a big impact on the movie so it's not worth mentioning.The verdict: Man of Steel is a movie that impresses from every angle that you'd expect from a big summer block buster! I fail to see anything you'd dislike, unless your not a huge fan of action, which would be stupid if you were to see this movie anyways. Man of Steel brings a lot more to the table that one would expect, so I suggest when you get the chance to watch it, I say take it!I give it an 8/10! 4/5 stars.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

And I am glad it is for MAN OF STEEL) For a long time, I have waited for a movie which captures the perspective and speed of Superman as it is meant to be. This movie does it. The movie is BIG. And though it captures the action sequences worthy of SUPERMAN, it is not devoid of emotional content. Not going overboard, the movie explores the human behavior in presence of an unknown entity.Coming to the action sequences, I feel there has been nothing attempted like this before. The movie is more Snyder's than Nolan's. Therefore the movie becomes more enjoyable if a fan enters enter the Hall expecting a Snyder treat with hint of Nolan's flavor. One of the best aspects of the movie is that it lays good foundation for the Warner Bros to explore this world superhero in depth through a sequel. A sequel will need an equally strong nemesis with more time given to build certain side characters and relationships.All in all the movie is worth every penny; with a good build up culminating in a visual treat for the viewer. Thumbs up!","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.'I liked the way they told Kal-El/Clark's upbringing and certain other events with flashbacks. Yes, this film is essentially a rebooted origin story, and it is a quite familiar story even to non-fans, so there's no need to go into too much detail, but just enough to get a grounding on his early life in Smallville and until we meet him proper.The overall feel of the film I thought it was very sci-fi, much more so than any previous Superman film, what with the beginnings on Krypton and all the spacecraft etc. But I did enjoy that, and did separate itself from the previous films as a result.This is a Zack Snyder film after all, and that is very apparent from the effects and camera angles. For me it did work well, particularly the way Superman, Zod, Faora etc were jumping and speeding around on screen. Also the carnage! By 'eck is there a lot of carnage during the climactic battle. So much so, I don't think there is much of a Metropolis left to make the already green lit sequel. Whole buildings collapsing, rubble everywhere, it all reminded me of the 9-11 ground zero videos.I liked the ending with Clark and Lois at the end, had a smile on my face after that. Thought it was a good way to end it.There is also a 42 page prequel comic, (story by David S Goyer, Geoff Johns and Zack Snyder, script by Sterling Gates with art by Jerry Ordway) that is worth a read that is set a thousand years before the film and ties into events in 'Man Of Steel'.A modern update to a classic origin with all the thrills and action you can want, albeit with not much of a story, but just enough. The cast is really good in this and Henry Cavill IS Kal-El (Clark Kent only really appears at the end). If you're expecting a film in the same vein of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, as most 'critics' probably were considering their low ratings, then you may be disappointed. But if you enjoyed 'Marvel's Avengers' and the other supers films from Marvel, then you'll certainly get a kick out of this!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nevertheless with the decision to reboot the franchise with Snyder and Nolan at the helm, I had high expectations from their creative minds and the Man of Steel did not disappoint!The pacing is excellent, never a dull moment. From the opening scenes you are treated with a lot of visual alien effects and you can tell the epic that awaits the entire film. They did a fantastic job in explaining the back story along with flashbacks in between stunning fight scenes.The casting was perfect. Cavill nailed the man of steel character, better than Brandon Routh many times over. His physique is well suited for the man of steel and his persona as a humble and down to earth person we came to know of Clark Kent was spot on. Crowe did an excellent job portraying Jor-El. Its been awhile since I saw Kevin Costner hit the big screen and this was a good come back for him although I wish he had more screen presence.I like how they made the superman universe here very plausible and believable by super hero movie standards. Everything meshed smoothly together Getting General Zod over Lex Luthor as the main antagonist for the film was definitely wise choice. In doing so, they were able to showcase more back story to Kal-El's back story, more superhero fight scenes thus flexing the filmmaker's creative imagination.The musical score was top notched and expected no less from the legendary Hans Zimmer.Overall, this is a worthy film of the Superman series started from the ground up with a powerful cast and dramatic flair that leave a lasting impression and will still get you thinking even after you leave the theaters. score 9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

These names ring a bell in a certain world of Superman. Once evolved cartoon series to movies. Now he is the man of steel. This new Snyder-Nolan team up came with a totally different perspective and story line of the said Superman series. Say goodbye to Lana Lang as love interest and Lex Luthor as villain. In this movie, we've got the Clark Kent against people from his own planet, Krypton. Though the movie was more of a disappointment, I highlighted some of the points I did not miss. The story itself was fast-forwarded to answer the question, What becomes of Superman after Luthor and after Jonathan Kent?Though it highlights several main points about the difficulty of discovering oneself, his love life, his struggles and his earthly- father's desire to keep his ability a secret, this movie has been more of Clark discovering Krypton. When we say EPIC-FAIL, I think this was what the movie was all about. The presence of giant ships, and Jor-el's trench coat allows you to enter ""The Matrix"". Hey Keanu Reeves... Where Jor-El's presence is called ""a shadow"" from an ""S""-shaped USB that the people from Krypton use also to maneuver the ship. Where the codex is not even an item that they are looking for but the codex it Clark Kent itself. Where the letter S is portrayed as a symbol for ""hope"". Where Lois Lane was asked by the aliens inside the ship for no reason at all. Where Martha Kent survived after being thrown by Zod and Zods men never did anything else than to disappear after he was taken by Superman in the city for more act of violence. Where New York was one block away from a farm without any sky-scrappers. Where Metropolis came into crumble but Superman never intended to help the people buried underneath the rubble. Where Zod was programmed to save Krypton even without the existence of Kryptonians. Where Lois Lane is an award winning Pulitzer journalist and I don't even have a clue why was that mentioned. Where moral-issue was highlighted but was unable to save his earthly father, standing helpless in front of a tornado. Where ""you're not my real dad"" script comes out of the context. Where Metropolis watch many people die when the man of steel was in nowhere but comes back in time to rescue Lois Lane. Where after snapping Zod's neck, Lois Lane appears for some reason. Where contrary to the Superman everyone knows of, this man of steel does not care about the people's safety and welfare. Where his weakness is not on Kryptonite but on killing (moral issue). Though the movie was a THUMBS-DOWN on my viewpoint, I still highlighted some quotes from the movie that struck me. Just because you can't control me doesn't mean I'm your enemy. Faith comes first, trust will follow. You are my son. But somewhere out there you have another father, and he sent you here for a reason. And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is. What if child dream of becoming something other than what society intended? What if a child aspire to something greater. Superman was once portrayed as a person from Krypton to save the people. In this movie, he was there to protect people. To save and protect are two different frames which were not highlighted in the movie. Maybe it was but it sucks.The only part I love was how the two fathers, provided love, care and assistance to Clark.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Zack snyder gonna have another golden feather on his director's hat.Better watch it in 3d. The visual effects drives you crazy and makes your jaw-drop. I bet you guys will love it.

Its not a one-man show after all.And last but not the least, the romance between Lois and Clark??? Well there was no fire and that's another aspect of the movie that did not go down well for me.

The movie was a tad lengthy though. Snyder presents to us a Superman who had a background - a story which made him make the choices that he made. Hans Zimmer, meanwhile 'not-so- silently' wove his magic in the background. 'Man of Steel' is probably the only movie in which, even the Super-Villain 'General Zod', looks justified for his actions.

Loaded with loads of exhilarating, never-seen-before action, spectacular visual effects and a well-written screenplay, this action adventure holds a lot of strength and is a complete entertainer for all ages.Henry Cavill is just so perfect and fit to play Superman that I need not to say how great his performance is. Zack Snyder undoubtedly did a great job with this film.First of all, MAN OF STEEL is a completely entertaining film with a fast pace and no boring moments. It moves so well that time passes by and you fail to realize it. By the time it ends, you're not left wanting for more but completely satisfied with what the film offered. It was so compelling that after I finished watching it, I rewinded the DVD to watch the climax fight sequence once again. It was that great!Coming to the technical aspects, this film is a pure gem. Be it the splendid visual effects or the fantastic cinematography or the heart-stopping action, the film doesn't disappoint on any front. This time I was really amazed to find that every action sequence was new, energetic, fast paced and flawless. Not a single action block lets you down. Nothing in this film ever, ever feels missing or incomplete. Another round of applause to the editors who have brilliantly cut it at a great duration.Don't watch it with the mindset of a critic.

The intention from Snyder is very clear - This is a movie for the masses.The breathtaking duel with General ZOD is sure to keep you in awe.And General ZOD is a perfect arch rival for our hero.Michael Shannon as ZOD and Russel Crowe as Jor-El are the flag bearers in the acting department with good support from Amy Adams(I really liked her in this movie) as our hero's love interest(their relationship might bloom in the eagerly awaited sequel) and Kevin Costner in a cameo.The movie never gets boring and is really intense right from the outset.The 3D effects could have been better utilized though.Anyways, that does not curb away from the fact that Zack Snyder has a winner in his hands.Winner- because he makes us feel for the most alien and unreal superhero in a time where the moviegoers have rooted more for superheroes who are more real in nature.Yes,I do feel something was left to be desired(may be the 3D, may be the non-existent humor or may be the thought that Nolan as director could have done better) but this movie sure is intense fun and entertaining to the core.A must watch and the best action movie in recent times.Superman is back and back with a lot of bang..bang..bang!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This Movie is not just a comic book Super-Man, Is is the way more realistic one. I was waiting for this Movie since when the teaser was out. The Movie defines Best ever how the Super-Man was originated, How he is born, How he got the super powers, how does he can fly, how he got the suit. The movie starts with the birth place(Krypton)of Super-man and how he is then send to the Earth. and later suddenly became a Elder man Working in ship saving the citizens in OilRig. The childhood was Explained with some flashbacks, how he is different from other children, how he will overcomes Pain from the super power he got. And later How he will Avenge and Save Earth From the General Zod from Krypton.The Main things about the Movie is The Action part, the guys who are waiting for a Fully Packed action movie I will sincerely suggest them this movie. The Background Soundtrack was one of the Best Soundtracks I've ever seen, that goes into my fav. Collection. Small disappointment with the last 20 min. which was little normal but not Boring. Overall I suggest you this Movie you can Enjoy till the End. No way you can think the Movie was wastage of Money. you will enjoy More than what you Pay.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not a comic book fan at all, but I will recommend this movie to anyone.Plus a great homage to Kevin Costner. His character makes you think who is the real superman.

If you are looking for a fresh take on Superman, this is your movie. There are great little references to the DC Universe throughout.

So I was hoping that Snyder would grasp the concept of his character and make an interesting movie out of it - he did a good job on Watchmen to preserve the spirit of the graphic novel, so there was little reason for me to lower my expectations before seeing it. But I was rather disappointed that after a good start it turned out to be just another run of the mill origin story which became an over the top disaster flick by the end. Especially since the story was shallow and derivative. Zod as the antagonist provides with the ""might makes right"" philosophy the exact opposite of Superman and a good story should basically write itself, but instead it all ended in a conclusion that was in so many ways just wrong. Most of all because it only works if you're willing to swallow a big plot-hole and ignore the lazy writing to set it up. And besides all this it also tried too hard to incorporate some darker and serious tones that came across as incohesive ramblings and made the movie look like it took itself way too seriously. The only good things are that I can now lower my expectations for the sequels and that it inadvertently made Superman Returns better.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even though it lacks breath taking sequences, as I expected ,had enough and more to glue me onto my seat.It lacks romance but depicts the hero more as a 'family man' searching the purpose of his life. And as any other super hero movie right from 'Transformers' to 'Dark Knight' it took a lot of effort from the hero to convince his mates that he is not their enemy and was actually fighting the evil rather than being evil himself. Speaking of direction, except the lengthy special effect sequence in the second half the movie was largely refreshing, and a wonderful casting adds to our over all experience. Justice wont be done if I am closing this review without commenting about the work of Zimmer. Once again he gave us what we expected from him.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The dialogue and writing, at times, feels shallow and inconsistent. Not to mention, that some character's intensity and lack of humor or light heartedness was distracting and felt out of place.Bottom Line: I am giving it a weak 8/10. Man of Steel is a impressive movie that will hopefully launch a bigger DC universe into existence. Individually, I really want to like Man of Steel and somewhere between the satisfying plot, the intense action, and the satisfaction of Superman done right, the positives outweigh the negatives.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's loud, show-off-y, and packed with special effects; it also lacks sense, story, or anything engaging for more than two minutes. Where the plot isn't flat and paper thin, it's ridiculously predictable; where it isn't predictable - it just doesn't make any sense because of the various inconsistencies (example: the first time the aliens are landing on Earth, TV stations are broadcasting this news along with ""amateur footage"", featuring a major close-up of the ship. Yet when Clark goes out to see it, you can see the ship is very far away, only visible to human eye as nothing more than a slightly bigger shooting star. Only using his supervision is he able to get the magnification... shown a minute ago on the TV screen). As far as acting goes, Adams', Cavill's and Lane's performances are up to part, but even they cannot save the movie from destruction. But it's the story (or the lack of one) is Man of Steel's biggest issue - it feels rushed, carelessly fabricated on your way to work. If you top it off with annoying product placement (thank you, Nokia and Nikon, I'll stay away from your products) - you have a complete and utter disaster on your hands; one that, I feel, not even the Superman could salvage the Earth from.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it quite a bit! Not being a hardcore Superman fan, watching his origin story from birth to being raised, and learning of his difficult past really made me appreciate Superman a lot more. Love the message about the great unknown in the world and the fear it gives off, such as Superman, except when he proves them wrong and becomes the hero.Zod, the villain, was badass as Hell. His intentions aren't really that selfish or evil, yet he goes to such lengths to conquer them. He basically wants to recreate Crypton, his and Superman's home planet, by destroying Earth, and creating it on that. So, he really isn't being self centered on anything specifically evil. One thing I was disappointed in is that he never said ""bow down before Zod"". Was really hoping for that.Half of the film goes straight in depth to the origin story, while the other half is focused on fighting Zod, (which takes up a fourth of the film, and is sooooo awesome!) I also love the amount of Russell Crowe screen time as Superman's dad. Even when he dies, they manage to put him in the movie as a chip that Superman can access to produce a hologram of his dad, to which the dad can interact with him accordingly.Of course the performances: All did great! The beautiful Amy Adams as Lois Lane perfectly poses the risk taking damsel who becomes Superman's star of affection. Henry Cavill is probably the best Superman up to date, he's so confident in what he's doing with everything.I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, and I would definitely check it out again, to try and get more out of the story, maybe take a look at some comics before hand. But it's definitely worth seeing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Come on, Superman is not Batman. Superman has superhuman powers while Batman has not, so, the movie should be packed with destructive actions, given that the bad guys have the same powers as Superman himself. And given the super powers that Superman has, this movie also should be packed with CGI.Story wise, this movie do have a story to tell, not just actions and CGI. Superman's background story and Zod's motive are quite interesting to be told. And in my opinion, the drama and the action in this movie are balanced. I mean, this movie should have long action sequences because the bad guys are not easy to subdue. They have super powers too. The fights should be long and hard and destructive. If the dramatic element is to be expanded more, the movie would've been longer and more boring (for comparison, in my opinion, The Dark Knight Rises, although it is a good movie, is long and some parts are dragged and boring).Character wise, they are absolutely not one dimensional. Nobody is genuinely good or genuinely bad. As the good guy, Clark has his own doubt. As he is different from the others, he at first hesitated to show his true power, fearing that he would not be accepted in the planet he lived. And the bad guy, Zod has his own motive too, which was actually quite a noble one, although he has chosen a not quite noble way to do it. In this movie, Zod is not the megalomaniac that he was in other portrayals.For the Superman character I'll give 10 out of 10. And for movie itself, I'll give 8 out of 10. This is one good and entertaining movie. And this is the Superman movie I've been waiting for, although it can always be made a little better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But my problem with him is that his movies are all gloss and pretty pictures, but lacking in substance. Maybe it's his trademark, but this is the reason why it's hard for me to warm up to him. Too bad, because I was expecting something that will raise the standards & revitalize the inexplicably humdrum trend of the Superman franchise and I thought the time has come. Not this year. Man of Steel is simply another superhero/blockbuster movie that's high on repetitive explosive action and booming sound effects, but sadly low on any lasting impact.This movie had all the ingredients to be another benchmark for superhero movies that could have redefined the Superman franchise. But unfortunately, it's just another explosive movie that relies heavily on CGI & mindless action to cover up the fact that it's riddled with plot holes & boring one-dimensional characters, massacring its source material. Didn't live up to expectations. It's as lame as that neck snap. Like its poster, this movie is all just a blur. my full review on Blogger :) http://strangereview.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-man-of-steel-2013.html","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Henry Cavill is awesome and easily the best thing about this movie. Unfortunately the script is rather lame and not very memorable. General Zod speaks like he has lived all his life on earth which is a huge problem. Especially when he exchanges dialogue with Kal El... They have lived all their lives in different worlds yet speak the same with same earthly references....oh so stupid and a missed opportunity to make both stand out as well as their dialogue. When an alien is present on earth and communicating then some, or a lot, of his speech have to be somewhat alien and not easily understood for it to be believable. Makes no sense a person is casually using Earth references and speaking like they lived there for 20 years when they arrived 30 mins ago. Another gripe is CGI. It looks ok when used sparsely, like when only an object or so is CGI created. It looks horrible when director tries to go full CGI in scenes that go on far too long and have little imagination. Movie switches to Game Mode... It wasn't good for 2013 and hasn't aged well now when I watch it in 2024... Why oh why can't director contain themselves? The drama and interaction between actors is the best part of this movie. The action/CGI parts were the worst. This movie would have benefited greatly from a more creative director that could imagine more creative ways to tell the same story without switching movie On and Off from CGI Game Mode. It's just a lazy crutch at this point.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Do you actually realise that's for a flawless masterpiece? And Man of Steel is far from that. SO far, that the insanely overrated Zack Snydet, who have made ONE film who deserve praise (Dawn of The Dead), later found out that maybe the idea that Superman and Zod trashing Metropolis and killing thousands wasnt so bright? Only after someone with brains reminded the people responsable for this piece of s*** that maybe insane actions should have consequences, they greenlit the even worse Superman v Batman. Yes, Superman kills, but we don't see it, so it's ok, right? If I accidently drop a 15 kilo stone on someones windshield, it's on me. Besides that small, moral dilemma, Man of Steel is boring as hell. I don't care about Krypton. The movie is too long. And Henry Cavill might have the body of a greek statue, but personalitywise, the late, great, Christopher Reeve was on another level. And THATS why Superman from 1980 always will be a classic, and Man of Steel as memorable as yesterdays dishes. It's at least better than Justice League and Wonder Woman 84.

I decided to give a chance to Superman because he's from DC and their Batman movies are usually a bit better than Marvel movies. But I guess I was being too optimistic.The first half is somewhat ok because it's just drama-based, which means no bad action scenes. Well, to be honest I was waiting for some action to happen. But when it finally starts I start to fall asleep. That nowadays style of making superhero action scenes is so boring and dull and empty that I refuse to call it action. Guys just punch each other to the other side of town and there is no feeling of action, no impact. Action should have a feeling of power but this is just like paper dolls caught in the wind. And the sound effects are worse than your grandma dropping a glass jar to the floor. And why, why, why... always have to have some giant spaceschip hovering over the city and trying to destroy the world. That's annoying because it's in every movie nowadays.There is something good too - the acting is not bad, and there are many great people involved. Nice to have the cool Laurence Fishburne, the cute Amy Adams, another cool Russell Crowe, and Kevin Costner who once was cool when playing Robin Hood (as did Crowe too, funny, eh?) Michael Shannon also makes some pretty menacing villain faces.It's not the worst movie I've seen but...it's annoying because it's just more of the same generic superhero mash that doesn't make me feel anything except general disappointment in nowadays' action movies. Superman stands for the symbol of goodness in man, and this movie stands for an example of boring millennial superhero movies.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

That said, I have to question why the writer/director elected in THIS installment of Superman to have the entire story hinged on the survival of mankind and such strong inflection added to the pointed idea that Clark Kent /Kal-El /Superman has a need to point out to those in defense of our nations safety that he has lived in Kansas for 33 years (the same age as Jesus when he was crucified and rose from death to save our mortal souls)or that his life there made him as much an American than the rest of us. As a fictional savior to mankind, its almost offensive that a similarity of age would be used to project him being one of us or that his youth made any difference in the outcome of the world. It was probably nothing, but I didn't appreciate the comparison of Saviors even if it was only a matter of age. This Superman installment was TOO mechanical, and dealt far too little with the character himself and his place in humanity. It would be nice if the story STOPPED being re-written to accommodate new ideas.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I usually enjoy Zack Snyder's movies and eagerly awaited his take on a comic book legend. However, with Man of Steel he managed to pull off an amazing triple of too long, rushed and a bit boring! Good action sequences towards the end of the movie can't save this one for me, although do bring it up to 5/10 from a lower mark. Maybe Superman is just too hard to deal with - a lead character who is overpowered and not human takes a special actor and story to deal with in movie length. In my view this effort suffers in comparison to the longer character development of TV series Smallville, and the better lead acting of Christopher Reeve in Superman 2 all those years ago.

I know that Man of Steel was made before, but budget was clearly enough to create a more credible movie.The transition of Clark Kent from a normal individual into Superman is really unsettling: he just wore a premade suit and that's it. In the first movie of Spiderman trilogy, directed by Sam Raimi, there was a nice transition of the character, you could see that he started to make his first costume alone, and then slowly, he came up with the design that everybody know. It was part of the journey, and helped me to bound more with the character. In this case, they decided to fill the last hour of the movie with fight scenes that will lead to the complete destruction of an entire city.

First of all I love how the origin story was presented in a fresh way to the genre through the use of flashbacks. The first 3/4 of the movie were believable, moving, engaging, and I devoured every moment of its beautiful cinematography. I loved Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Ma and Pa Kent, they added a warming presence to the film and felt like parents you would want/need if you were experiencing what Clark/Kal-el was going through. Henry Cavill did a superb job as superman and seemed to fit the role of Man Of Steel perfectly, despite the fact that the story cut back on some character development once he put on the cape. Amy Adams did a great job too convincing us Lois' relationship between her and Clark had depth, despite not being given much screen time to develop it. All in all I loved every minute of the movie up until the action-heavy climax. But it didn't really feel like a climax, because it was basically a rehash of an earlier battle, only this time with higher stakes. That combined with the fact that most development of the characters had stopped by now, and it was basically just a lot of punching (although epic punching) made it so that I didn't really feel a sense of despair amidst all of the destruction (although a couple moments in particular were moving.) Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the action because I saw it in 3D that wasn't very good, and I guess it makes sense that it was chaotic and messy because this is Kal-el's first major fight. He's not the experienced Man Of Steel we know, this is a film about how that man came to be. When I think about it in this way, how all this action was handled seems a bit easier to accept, along with the last five minutes that reminded me why I loved earlier parts of the movie. All in all I thought it was a great reboot of the Superman franchise, despite me wishing the climax had a little bit of the same emotional core as the rest of the film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The trailers were beautifully marketed, however when it came to the actual viewing the film lacked the depth and the insight the trailers appeared to portray. Notable positives are the standout performances from Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Antje Traue as Faora. The visuals are impressive as a whole. I will say that this film is beautifully shot, with a very good score by Hans Zimmer to match! The main negative I feel, is that it suffers the same issue that a lot of Zak Snyder's films face, in being that it is a ""style over substance"" piece. The narrative itself is done as a non-linear origin story. Unfortunately for me the script was not fantastic, and some of the performances (unfortunately having to include the lead role) Henry Cavill, as being rather flat... I am not sure if this is down to issues with the script or perhaps down to the casting...My recommendation for anyone about to watch this film is to not go into it thinking that you are about to embark on a Chris Nolan style ""think piece."" Despite the marketing suggesting something of a Nolanised tone, especially with a title of ""Man of Steel."" It is very much a film where the Action and the visuals drive the story, as oppose to a well detailed narrative.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Buildings collapse. Spaceships explode. There are fistfights between interplanetary beings that threaten to destroy the entire planet. It's wall to wall noise, destruction, devastation... a brilliant spectacle of cutting edge special effects.But I emerged from the experience utterly disappointed. True, Superman was never my favourite hero. He was too powerful... and seemed to have none of the character quirks like say, Batman. I saw the first Christopher Reeve movie, many eons ago. I did enjoy the Superman Returns reboot that came out a few years before this... but it tanked, and so they're starting AGAIN from scratch. Just like they've done with Spiderman, The Hulk and will do with The Fantastic Four in the future. There are no original ideas for superhero movies any longer... when they feel a series has run it's course, they simply begin again. If only everything in life was so easy.What they've done here is removed a lot of the human elements that made Returns so watchable and replaced them with expensive CGI. This turns the whole enterprise into one hell of a white knuckle ride, so it's diverting... to a point. But there is something missing under the bonnet of this revved up machine, and that is called soul. You can send as many objects flying through the sky as you want, fill the entire screen with action that pushes your budget to the max. But the story is so fragmented, and the characters so sketchily written, whatever goodwill that was generated by the pandemonium soon dissipated, and I was left with people I didn't care about in a film that went on for WWAAYY too long.In the words of Martin Riggs, Maybe I'm getting too old for this ****.

Okay we get it, Superman is a nice guy when he was a child, but you don't have to do this to us, Superman movie doesn't mean its for 3 year old child.DEEPER MEANING: There are no deeper meaning behind this movie, unlike Dark Knight Series which all 3 movies have its own meaning behind, Man of Steel really is all about action, and doesn't even have some sexy or romantic element in this movie, which makes it extremely boring.I give this movie a 5 for all its animation, and effects.If you like action and does not care about story line and deeper emotion triggers, this is a great movie for you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super Excuse me. For a big budget motion picture remake of perhaps the most recognizable comic book superhero Man of Steel is a tamely run-of-the-mill effort. It is generic blockbuster personified, and is a bleak, characterless, lacklustre, uninspiring, disjointed and overly rigid entry in an intermittent franchise, which ironically struggles to take off. What's the ""S"" stand for? Well in my world it stands for Super-Serious as opposed to Superman. Never before has a superhero been so unwilling to express any discernible passion for their cause, simply maintaining an impassive poker face the whole time. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance, Superman to the rescue! Screams excitement right; however, Zack Snyder has somehow turned this tried and tested premise into a dreary, rather monotonous exploit, even if the visuals and set pieces verge on stunning; more dull and lifeless than dark and gritty. Henry Cavill is cool, calm and collected as Superman; however, he comes across overly reserved and emotionless far too often. Cavills' steely resolve is rarely visibly tested even if the goings-on impart otherwise, rendering his portrayal of Superman a tad difficult to adhere to on a humanistic level. In addition to this, he appears sound in the fabled suit but his rendering of the celebrated superhero comes across too deliberate and noticeably premeditated, although he does find his feet towards the end when the movie is given a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Man of Steel lacks fluidity, it is apportioned with often brisk and abrupt scene changes, and provides an unkempt collation and abstract composition of extracts and gestures to scenes from other movies. It is also complacent on character introduction, being naive in thinking we all know about the characters enough to not have to shed too much light on them; notably a lackadaisical introduction to Lois Lane and her backstory, further marred by a romance kindled out of thin air. All in all, Man of Steel supplies a moderately attention-grabbing experience, albeit unhurried and void of any palpable sentiment. In addition, it does not break any new ground and sets an overstatedly grim-faced tone that future installments in the notoriously up-and-down series that has experienced its fair share of highs and lows in the past will have to address if they are to garner the widespread approval of the audience.Maybe somebody should have gave Superman's cape a tug and told him you're doing it wrong.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a Superman film for the modern ages, removing all the cliché flare and majesty that made the Christopher Reeve Superman franchise so successful and iconic (this includes pseudo-reboot Superman Returns). Man of Steel stands out as a unique Superman film in that it primarily focuses on the psychological division between Superman and Clark Kent.Man of Steel draws from modern graphic novel iterations of Superman (see Earth One) to depict a Superman divided between either using his powers and bearing a newfound responsibility as protector of the world, or keeping his powers a secret. Told in a nonlinear format, the film explores Kal-El's childhood as Clark Kent, detailing his social isolation and psychological coping with the development of his powers, as well as being raised to suppress them from the world. The result is an emotional, psychological, and realistic portrayal of Superman in a modern society. Instead of the previous films' themes of ""What would the world be like with a Superman?"", this film asks ""How will the world react to a Superman?"" When Superman is coerced into revealing himself when General Zod arrives at Earth, what is the right choice? One issue with trying to take on an emotionally-charged script is having Zack Snyder, who, at his best, is a second unit director, take control of the project. Zack Snyder has a cookie cutter approach when it comes to visually depicting a script on film. And with that, he fails to flesh out characters when he needs to. Scenes showing characters from the Daily Planet struggling from the aftermath of the film's climactic fight lack the emotional factor because Zack Snyder didn't take the time to revise the script and flesh out those characters well enough, substituting them with literally close to 40 minutes of unnecessarily long, destructive fight scenes that could have easily been cut down to 10 minutes at most. Man of Steel ends up looking like a film still trying to find its balance between being an emotional and realistic superhero film (a la Batman Begins) or a confusing sci-fi-laden action spectacle (a la The Avengers).The film has some questionable plot points, almost as if they were written by a high school student. Without spoiling (for those who haven't seen the film), there are events in the film that drive the character's motivations that don't seem to add up (i.e. ""the scientist will miraculously figure out to do THIS so that the weird science fiction device can start working"" trope). Some of these are minor, one of them is major, in fact, and can polarize critics. But be the judge of that yourself.Overall, Man of Steel tries to find its footing with being the dark, realistic Superman film we've all been waiting for ever since Christopher Nolan started directing Batman films, but stumbles along when it tries to become a comic book spectacle. The result is a film with all the right ingredients that was overcooked.UPDATED REVIEW: After another viewing of Man of Steel, I realized how bored I was for the last third of the film. The fighting was completely incessant and it became a predictable alien action film, evolving out of what was a great superhero film depicted with societal realism. For some reason, Snyder wanted to portray two gods fighting on screen, but we really didn't need to see 40 minutes of it with a subpar plot involving skybeams and portals again. If you cut out the last 40 minutes, you get the same movie. Man of Steel was promising for the first 2/3rds, then the action makes the film go downhill.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Apart from a couple of scenes I can't say that the 3d IMAX really made a big difference visually.For the time being Superman is Kal-El and played by Henry Cavill. Sure most people will be familiar with the background story of how Superman came to arrive on Earth. In this movie he is followed by General Zod in a quest for revenge and to transform earth into a Krypton like world.Personally I liked the scenes of Clark Kent as a youngster with father Jonathon (Kevin Costner) the best.

Man of Steel has often been accused of trying to emulate The Dark Knight when it doesn't need to, and yeah, there's some truth to that. The mood and the tone are both a lot grittier and more somber, which gives strength to the accusations. And I cannot lie and say that I wouldn't have preferred a more upbeat reboot to the Superman franchise, although that's just my personal preference. For me Batman is the gritty, dark superhero and Superman is the boyscout. When I want to see a nice, positive superhero story I go to Superman and vice versa.However, many have voiced a reasonable argument that trying to force a character into such a tight mold does them no justice and that we should allow this variety into our beloved superheros. I cannot argue about that, because it's true. The tone of this film is not one I prefer, but it's something I can accept and that does work if you let it.Furthermore, Henry Cavill is a great Superman. He has the correct build for the role, which is important when you have to spend a significant amount of your screen time in skintight latex. He also has the looks and the quiet confidence needed to make a believable Superman. I wouldn't mind him reprising his role in future installations at all.I also quite like Russell Crowe as Jor-El, but the rest of the characters felt a bit flat to me. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was an especially weird addition to the film, because her character did nothing of importance. Her character could have been cut out of the film entirely and nothing would have changed. She was there just because it was a Superman film and of course a Superman film needs to have Lois Lane in it. This was a terrible decision and quite honestly lowered the film's quality.So we have Lois Lane that does nothing, but we also have Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) that does too much, repeating the same speech over and over. Yes, we get it, Clark has a responsibility, he has a destiny to fulfill. We heard you the first time.Shaky cam is also a big problem. Is it really too much to ask for the camera not to move when two characters are sitting completely still, just having a conversation? It's distracting to constantly be aware of the movement of the camera. Enough, film makers. Enough. It's a neat little gimmick that has its places, but... enough.Still, I cannot claim that I didn't enjoy large parts of this film. The film as a whole looks great, despite shaky cam. The colours are stark and beautiful, the angles and cinematography are great and the action scenes have real weight behind them. If you wandered in just looking for a summer blockbuster with big, epic action scenes, you got your money's worth.In the end I'm torn about this film. I didn't like some of the characters at all, I felt that the tone was off and that this would have worked better with a different storyline, but I also quite liked the main lead, the action scenes and some of the dialogues. So I guess I'd call this average. If you're open to seeing a new kind of Superman, you might like this very much. If you're a Superman purist, I'd stay away from this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As the movie progresses it eventually evolves into the story of how Super Man is on a quest to save earth's genocide from the classic superman villain General Zod. Henry Cavill plays the role of Clark Kent/Kal-El, or in other words Super Man. His performance doesn't stand out but it is worthy in its own right. Amy Addams also stars as the infamous reporter Louis Lane. Adams performance was better than mediocre but it certainly does not exemplify her true talent. Zach Snyder (300) directed Man of Steel, which is a decision I highly disagree with. If DC wanted to make Man of Steal into the movie the Dark Knight was or even what the first trailer promised, Warner Brothers would need a new director. Zach Snyder brings his signature style with him but it translates very poorly to Super Man universe. His over stylized action sequences accompanied by the lackluster script reveal a major feeling of mediocrity. I am going to divide this film in half, the first half exemplified everything I wanted in a Super Man movie; it was gritty, Super Man felt vulnerable (as much as a character such as him can), and everything was down to earth. The second half completely through out what the first had accomplished and put two immortal beings fighting each other for the better part of an hour. It was explosion after explosion that soon wore me out and lost the bulk of my attention. The overwhelming feeling I got when I came out of the theater was how it completely wasted its potential. The first half set the premise in such a high fashion for it to only be ruined in the second and third act. The whole film just came off as disappointing which is a huge shame because it could have been so much more.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is why I think Zach Snyder should've directed a Supergirl movie. She's the objective superhero, and her reasons are fairly justifiable. Unlike Superman, Supergirl wasn't raised on Earth. She didn't grow up with humans and didn't learn Earth's social skills, so she comes off as more alien and has trouble making friends. She was forced to learn pretty quickly how to control her powers and speak English rather than learn as she grew because she was already an adult when she arrived on Earth. The only person in the whole world who she can relate to and sympathize with is Superman. She didn't choose to become a superhero because she cared about humanity; she did it because Superman (and Wonder Woman kinda) told her to. She cared more about Krypton and mourns for it more than Superman because it was all she knew for the majority of her life. In multiple comics, she leaves Earth to find somewhere else to live because she's tired of having to constantly save humans despite not understanding why they're deserving of salvation. She's not a monster. She just didn't have a Ma and Pa Kent to teach her how to be humble and love Earth. It's only natural that she'd be selfish. Snyder would've done a way better job with Supergirl than whatever it is the CW is doing.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie follows the change of Batman from a happy hero to a dark hero, but all the Batman movies maintained the historical story line, while Superman here changes the story line so much that you keep asking yourself far too many times ""Why did they change that?"" Also, the logic used by nearly everyone is very stupid and illogical. Only the evil people use correct logic. The special effects are, in my opinion, far too many and too often. After half the movie is over, you start seeing that things being destroyed are fake looking, especially during the increasingly monotonous fight scenes.I hate to give it a 1. I gave it a 3, at first, but the more I think about the movie, the less I like it. It is not worth seeing again because it feels like the movie, Transformers 12 (3 at this time of writing).

This one does not disappoint with it's action and special effects. It's mostly CGI creations were well done, and appropriate for a 2014 version of this tale. I was surprised to see so many A-list actors/actresses playing roles in this adaptation. They must of had a very big film budget. Superman was played by Henry Cavill, a relative new comer compared with the long list of famous actors who made up this cast. He was a good fit for the Superman role and gave a good performance. He's young, handsome, physically fit and worked well with Amy Adams(Lois Lane). I also though Amy was as good of a Lois Lane as I've seen in past films. She worked well with Cavill. Then we had Russel Crow, as Superman's Father, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as his adoptive parents the Kent's, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Michael Shannon as General Zod the nemesis of Superman. All did a good job with this limited story plot.I think it was a OK movie especially for the young who do not know the original story-line, but it was mostly action sequences. It left out most of the original story-line with Superman changing from Clark Kent to Superman to combat the evil in Metropolis. Instead they had a world-threat in terms of aliens invading earth from Krypton (a doomsday threat)to destroy the earth. Not quite the Superman story we all know and love, but what the heck it's 2014 and Hollywood action films are king. There was also very little in terms of the love story between Kent and Lois.. I guess I'm only giving it a 7 out of 10 because of the screenplay adaptation was in my opinion lacking some of the original story plots that were key to the Superman I know and love.I preferred ""THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG"" movie this year to this one, but it did its part in giving the kids another action adventure story to go see.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I know this is full unreal movie, but first of all i want to mention that the power those Kryptonian people have, more than world's people. General Zod made for war, so he knows how to deal with this. Undoubtedly Clark Kent / Kal-El has twice power than them, but what about training. At a point General Zod says that he has been build to fight, and trained, and what Kal-El did. So basically it is full of fiction. About the drama, when Kal -El in danger, he kisses his girl friend which made by some works like she went to somewhere to follow what is happening and then she drops because of Clark Kent's when he says about his father and trust. When the American army handover Clark Kent to General Zod, Faora-Ul takes Lois Lane with them, I don't understand why. Was it about the one people from world. After that when General Zod sent two earth engine to modify the world according to Krypton, it scathe a huge which can now be recovered by the world in 100 years, but at the last scene we can see all the building recovered. So viewers have to keep in mind this movie is full of fiction and drama based on nothing, only true is kiss and nothing else.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cast is very fine – hunky Henry Cavill is a rather demure Superman and that is in his favor, Amy Adams makes Lois Lane credible, Michael Shannon is ominous as the evil General Zod, and then there are the home-baked goodness of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe and Amtje Traue as the variable parents (Krypton genes, Kansas adoption). Nods also go to Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, and Laurence Fishburne for trying to take all this seriously.Plot (not really adapted from the original comic books): A child, sent to Earth from a dying planet, is adopted by a couple in rural Kansas. As a young boy he learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind. Sounds like a good story through the sci-fi telescope. The problem is the heavy handed emphasis on the monsters and space ships and tunnels and gore of Krypton and the mess made not only in Smallville, Kansas but in the major cities by the invading Krypton dudes. Makes you wonder when all the CGI minds behind it will tire of the noise and fire and space sailing of Superman. Enough already.

That's embracing their brand with pride! Maybe they knew that this ""film"" was going to blow. So, they just called it ""Man of Steel"" instead! This ""movie"" was the beginning of the downfall of the live-action DC films. I would still honestly watch ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (1987) over any other DC films made after ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. This ""movie"" is also somehow worse than ""Superman Returns"" (2006)! How in the world did that happen? This ""movie"" has a boring story, overall terrible acting, and dull sets/locations. The story could have been somewhat decent if it wasn't jumbled with too many subplots that don't add up! Don't get me wrong, flashbacks in movies can be good when utilized properly and can actually be pretty effective. But in this ""film"", they happen constantly and they just keep getting in the way from any ""real story"" to develop. What, does Zack Snyder this ""film"" director have OCD? Just stick to one premise, and the story that you're trying to express to the screen will actually have an impact! The acting in this ""movie"" is overall lackluster, especially from Henry Cavill and Russell Crowe. Henry Cavill is supposed to be portraying Superman. However, the ""super"" part is what I'm questioning! Where is the ""super""? All I see in this ""film"" is nothing but moping monotone man wearing a poorly made Superman costume. Seriously, the Superman costume in this ""movie"" is the worst one I've ever seen. Did none of the costume designers look at a comic book, or any other images of a real Superman outfit? I guess they didn't know that bright bold colors were a must on a costume for a portrayal of a hero who is bold and is supposed to stand for truth, justice and the American way. Henry Cavill is, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst Superman actor, so far. Russell Crowe is also a boring monotone actor as well (like father, like son?). What a terrible casting choice he was for Jor-El! The sad thing is, outside of this ""film"" Russell Crowe is actually a very good actor. But in ""Man of Steel"", it sounds like he's about to fall asleep or he has just woken up whenever he speaks. As for his voice, what kind of direction was he given? Did Zack Snyder say: ""okay Russell, talk like you've just rolled out of bed and are just waking up after guzzling down a pack of sodas."" Seriously, whenever he speaks it sounds like one long continuous burp! Most of the other actors are bad to average, but there are a few good ones though. Amy Adams is an upgrade over Kate Bosworth from the travesty known as ""Superman Returns"" and is a fairly good choice for Lois Lane. Laurence Fishburne is good as Mr. White, but the problem with that casting is obvious. Don't get me wrong, I still think that Laurence Fishburne is a brilliant actor overall and I respect the fact that they were trying something different for the character portrayal. But, his character's name is Perry White, not Perry Black! Michael Shannon is good, but a little too over the top to be enjoyable. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner do a great job as Clark's Earth parents. As for the rest of the actors, they are just not sufficient. The sets/locations are very dull, boring and once again they lack bright bold colors. Yeah, because Heaven forbid a DC superhero movie be any fun for anybody! The only good elements in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and the soundtrack. Being made in 2013, the special effects are of course first-rate. The soundtrack is well done, Han Zimmer is one of my top 10 favorite music composers in cinema. I still wish that John Williams would have scored this ""movie"", but I don't think that even his music could have saved this ""film"" though. Overall, ""Man of Steel"" is just a dull, boring and unpleasant viewing experience. I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Little did everyone know, that this ""movie"" was just the beginning of a long line of cinematic failures in the world of DC superheroes.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

It set the scene for more than just the usual one man against an army situation. Yet by the middle it just summed up everything that's wrong with recent reboots of film series. It felt like the writer had read/watched all the previous outings of the caped son of Krypton, had thought up individual scenarios that they'd like to see him in, taken some characters they liked from previous outings, and shoe horned a movie around it. Yes, it looks very pretty, with plenty of big set pieces, explosions, military hardware and long (long, long, long) fight scenes, yet you get the sense it wants to go deeper into the subjects of: 1) People being scared of the different, 2) The ability to have the power to change the world around you without being ostracized, 3) Family bonds (both biological family and social groups) than its Lycra clad, muscle pumped script is capable of delivering, and only allows it to skim the surface of those topics. If you compare this to previous Superman films, such as the ploys in Superman 3 - particularly the ending - Man of Steel goes full out on aggression over subterfuge, resulting in it not even to fitting (especially given how long the fight scenes are in this film are) with itself, let alone with other outings for the son of Krypton. There's no subtlety to the action, or apparent planning by the characters. They've stacked the odds so far against Superman (in technology and numbers of opposition), that they have to contrive the story around him till there's no sense of immediate peril. This results in action happening in the local area, but seemingly only affecting the local area. I mean, given that - as with most films of this ilk - there is a world ending device the hero has to defeat, that device seems incapable of even dislodging a crane tower a few miles away, or affecting traffic outside its immediate vicinity. I'm still wondering who has the most lines in the film (it's probably Russell Crowe), but it seemed like the film was generally light on speech (Lawrence Fishbourne can't have more than a dozen lines!)","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

You always keep your eyes open while you are watching the movie, you just cant lose a moment because you are too into the movie. I am a Marvel fan and even though this movie is very different from the Marvel material, you should see it! Henry Cavill knows how to portrait a great superhero even with his looks. On the dark side, the movie is exaggerated with some action -- the way superman destroys everything. They could have used half of the crashes and the movie would have been better. The movie also contains some clichés but it is entertaining. Man of Steel is not the movie of the year or the best movie you have ever seen but it is definitely an entertaining movie which wont get you bored, not even a minute.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Was really hoping for the best for this film. Casting was great. Spot on. All leads had good presence.Plot was good. An interesting, updated take from a unique perspective. CGI is now very accepted, and detracts less from a viewing. Here, I continually noticed how good it was, especially the superspeed of movement of the Kryptonians, which just seemed natural, despite none of us having ever witnessed the like! Musical score was a bit repetitive, very unlike the composer. The OST will no doubt prove me wrong, but I only seemed to notice the one main theme throughout the film, and yet this was good and fitted. So after all the good points, why only five? Well, it's that juvenile shaky cam again. Do it maybe once, in a fight scene perhaps, but two people standing in a room talking to each other? Started almost immediately, during key plot points and character development on Krypton , and spoiled it badly, for me. Another pointless 'method' is the way the camera loses a moving object, overshooting, undershooting. Your eyes follow the camera sweep, of course, as the constant shaking and unfocussing makes it difficult to follow the object. Why? All these 'tricks' detract from the viewing experience badly. Snyder is now an established director, and has no need to resort to these gimmicks. Much like the way the Bourne sequels were ruined by the same constant palsy, I left the theatre feeling I had been robbed of what could have been a true epic. Avengers jumps ahead of thus due to better directing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's my childhood-till-adulthood-favourite superhero who was joined by the caped crusader when Nolan made a trilogy based on him. I'd rather you infer that I like Batman because I like Nolan's trilogy. Another story. But this review is about the movie on the Man of Steel, Last son of Krypton or Superman as he is fondly called. Man of steel does more than justice to the things superman is capable of doing and is completely action-packed(yes completely). If I didn't know any better about films, I'd say 'this is it!'. Thankfully, that's not the case.NOTE - The goods and bads are kinda intermingled here 'coz i'm too lazy to sort it that way. This is just a movie buff's review about how he felt during the movie. Write your own when you are done watching it. Hope you read further.I expected a more coherent script from Goyer and Nolan and a better story telling by Snyder. Appeared as if the focal point of the movie was to, for the lack of a better word - 'exaggerate' what Superman(vis a vis Zack Snyder!) could do with his powers (for the aforementioned vis a vis guy - if he is funded abundantly under a huge production house!). I mean I am willing to overlook plot-holes like how Bruce made it back to Gotham after breaking free from the Pit(prison) and stuff, if I am being told a story that keeps me engrossed during its flow. I wouldn't care for those not-so-important bits if the main story is gripping enough. This one's just okay-ish on that front. I found this movie 'choppy' in between once it shifted from Krypton to Earth until the final showdown began. I don't really have complaints with the cast or the way they graced their characters. Henry Caville looks the part. Suave and well built for the role and the expressions make his character more human like. Amy Adams has spark like Lois Lane should. Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner both play their roles with gravitas. Michael Shannon doesn't evoke a fear in the audience. Laurence Fishburne's character could have been fleshed out more though. Underutilized. The development of the movie was missing. My principal issue is I was getting a feeling as if I was seeing the highlights of the movie which was switching back and forth in time which took its toll on the flow of the story. Of course Memento was shown in reverse chronological order, but one never feels they are losing track of the plot if they put enough attention. But that's Nolan. And as Penny would say, 'Nolan has ruined my ability to tolerate idiots!'. Okay, she said that for Leonard not Nolan. It's also a stroke of genius on Nolan's part as a director that he allows the audience to connect to his movies and get involved, no matter how intermingled and complicated they look on the surface. Too bad he wasn't the director here. Hope I don't get to say this again when the sequel comes. Man of Steel, however, had me feeling as if all the scenes were dots which were just connected in an attempt to score the home run(if you will)! That is to say, traversing the scenes, as an audience, felt non-smooth. And its not like, Nolan is the only wise guy in storytelling. Peter Jackson does this brilliantly in his LOTR and Hobbit movies. In-spite of the movies being unusually long, not for once the audiences feels left out. I could name my favourite directors, but that's not the point. Snyder, who was trusted to 'resurrect' Superman on screen, attempted to do so, yes, but not through character development, story and intensity build up and a gratifying finish. It was attempted through amazing the audience with visual spectacles, literally larger than life fight scenes and CG effects and ""cool"" back and forth(non coherent, no that's not cool) storytelling. Elongated and full blown, not in crescendo climax (in contrary to The Avengers'), had me looking at my watch at times. If the movie was to show what Snyder could do to create a visual marvel, I have no bones in accepting that this movie is right up there with the likes of Avatar(some would disagree, be my guest), The Transformers movies(haven't seen those, except for scenes containing Megan Fox for obvious reasons) and The Avengers and the movies which are the build-up to it. It felt like an attention seeking flick in the era of superhero portrayal on screen with never seen before VFX in almost all of them. It does brilliantly well in that department but the movie doesn't stay with you when you leave the theater.CG imagery, perhaps too much of a good thing, would require WB shelling out a butt-load of money for the sequel, if there is one, to topple the VFX they had in this. Wonder what backdrop will they choose to show it on after this! This movie was made at a whopping 225 million dollars budget(as per IMDb) which perhaps is the norm for a movie of this scale. I'll have to, although I didn't want to, agree with Scott Mendelson of Forbes that this movie doesn't drain you on an emotional level. That said, I didn't want to cry or anything. Just that connect with the movie was missing. My ratings won't matter as different people seek different things out of a movie. If I had to, maybe a 3 and a half out of 5(mostly because of the VFX). Recommeded watch though!Aakash","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But anyway. I think it's mostly the origin stuff is more interesting than the end, except a couple of moments that could have been a bit more interesting. The effects, both visual and special are outstanding. Krypton, The Fortress of Solitude (although it's not called that, I think, but I'm pretty sure it is) and Kal-El (Superman) flying (on his own), are the best looking things, probably. The entire opening scene is amazing. Brilliant cinematography most of the time. Excellent music. Powerful, cool and emotional, everything you'd need for a movie like this. The acting was really good actually other than Michael Shannon, who was alright. But Russel Crowe was the best, i think. I didn't like Zod too much. His voice was a bit bad, in the trailer, when he shouts I WILL FIND HIM!!, in that scene, he says it at least three times before, and it seems a bit repetitive(little nitpick though). So many unnecessary . There are some forced, unnecessary lines. There's one thing I didn't remember very well, with someone who apparently 'saved the whole world' according to my friends, who was really important, who I didn't see the importance in, so I don't know if that's a bad thing or not, maybe I just need to see it again. I think there's a little bit too much action at the end, which is why I said the bits before the end were better. Not that I have any problem with action, it's just not much new was happening, I felt. But all the destruction caused at the end looks crazy. It's actually pretty insane, I think, just how much there is.All in all, definitely worth checking out, but might not be what you'd expect.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is almost nothing about this film that looks distinct or visually interesting or different from every other cgi film around today. The story takes on way TOO much trying to fit in the death of Krypton, the superboy years, and Zod all in one film. They could have made 3 films out of this story. And where are the scenes of Superman doing super things? Everything in this film is a bore. Bryan Singer's Superman Returns was much more fun, and visually interesting by comparison. Joss Whedon would have been a much more appropriate director for Superman. Zach is completely out of his element. He cannot do with Superman the sexual, ultra gore things that made him famous. No Gerard Butler ass shots, Watchmen heroes having sex and killing murdering pedophiles, or young girls held prisoners in the Clark Kent world. Clark Kent just does not live in that world.

Also, this is the closest we could get to the realism of fights between superhumans. However, the latter scenes dragged on forever and were on such scale that after a while i got numbed and disinterested. After seeing a couple of buildings being crushed by humanoids they all looked the same.On the one hand, i'm glad about this reboot.

There are a lot of decent scenes and moments and Henry Cavil did a great job in this film as did Kevin Costner. The only thing I hated about this film is the story didn't quite follow the Superman story. I am speaking of Lois knowing who Superman is right away. If this is in the new 52 issues then I apologize because I haven't read those yet but I liked the chemistry the characters had when Lois didn't know Clark was Superman. The other negative thing about the film is that it seemed to go on and on and on. There were a lot of decent moments where the film could end and you thought it would only it wouldn't. Way too much action and hardly little character development doesn't always make a movie great. You can have all the action in the world in this film like they did yet but if your characters aren't interesting or underdeveloped and you make this movie too long you start to bore your audience. Action movies really shouldn't be almost 3 hours long, they should be a hair over 2 hours at the max but not 3. Man Of Steel could have been a lot better than what it turned out to be.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's consistently boring even during the 'no-brains-required', high-flying punch-up finale that takes up a good chunk of the far-too-long flick's latter third. The piece is so contrived, silly and simultaneously overly serious that there's no wonder that it's just simply no fun at all, regardless of its downbeat and occasionally dour tone (which isn't an inherent flaw as some people seem to think). At the end of it all I was just left feeling tired, resigned and like a little bit of the hope I once had that the great DC characters could be back on form on our silvers screens again had died. There was honestly a time when I thought this was clearly the worst superhero film of recent years but, now that the DC extended universe has had a few more entries, I'm not so sure anymore. 4/10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Superman's re-launch might not be as perfect / successful as Batman's but it is indeed a good, solid beginning.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814419/?ref_=tt_urv","YasheshJ","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21067309/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","Slow pace of the film prior to interval, detailing for Krypton, non-linear flashbacks, and Zimmer's background score all work well in building up a 'slightly modified' Superman universe. You have some nicely crafted out scenes demonstrating inner turmoils of Clark, while he searches for answers assuming different aliases. Some are: Clark saving his co-workers in an oil drilling plant after a mishap, confronting a drunkard in a bar.Though, all the build up never reaches the expected crescendo.What happened in last 45 minutes or so (especially after interval) seemed like watching two different films altogether. Fights sequences needed some more personal touch from Superman; it was more destruction than action with wrecked buildings, shattered glasses filling up the screen with too much CGI/special-effects, at times too cluttered for human eyes to register. Other than this the film is made as it should have been, lack of romance/comedy is not a concern.The films boasts of some A-rated cast, and most of them deliver well in their respective roles. Henry Cavill is perfect fit for the new Superman/Clark Kent. When it comes to villains, Zod of Superman 2 still remains the one to beat. Sidekick Faora did look menacing. As always, Superman's Earth mother (Lane) and father (Costner) are his emotional support and morality beacon, respectively. Growing up with perplexities about his being, they instill in him self-belief, help him control the God-like abilities, and ultimately mould him into the righteous man he is today. Jor-El (Crowe) and his son Kal-El don't get enough time together but Jor-El might not be done yet. However, due to non-linearity in film, none of the characters seem to have meaty roles; screen time is shrewdly shared across varying contexts.Moreover, the film fluctuates a lot. On one hand you have a drained out Superman—during battling with Terra-modifying 'world engine'—soaking up the Sun against a sober BGM, you are reveling the scene, then suddenly, there is a cut-to scene and you have choppers flying, artillery blasting, and what not. Snyder perhaps does it purposely, to charge up the audience after the laid-back first half.If you noticed the Lex Luthor logo on the tanker (or something) you know what's coming next, not that there was much doubt. Clark Kent and Lois Lane meeting in Daily planet toward the end of film finally sparked some chemistry too. In all, by the end of film you get to see the familiar Superman all sorted out in his brain, and of course, want more.One thing is certain, film ends on a good, promising note and a sequel, if any, will clearly have all the right ingredients ready.I was really hoping for some post-credits scene (especially after seeing the Luthor logo) but there was none! 7.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was a great flick, and I loved the new take on Superman: focusing more on Krypton and its demise, rather than JUST Superman saving the day. Henry Cavill was a brilliant superman, doing well with the emotional aspect and not overdoing it. I also thought that they did well with his ""super-ness"". It was dramatic, as Superman is supposed to be invincible, but they addressed the process of him learning to be super and to control his abilities. It seemed realistic under the circumstances. Lois Lane has a new character in this one, more brave and more invested in her job. She's not so obviously in love with Clark/Superman, which leads me to one of my only two complaints: their romantic relationship was sudden and awkward. The two had one kiss, but there wasn't any buildup to it or any sort of sexual tension between the two. It seemed like she only kissed him because he saved her; it was more of a thank-you present than a budding romance. The second thing that bothered me about this movie was the excessive amount of destruction. A lot of the movie was watching fighting and a building being blown up. Granted, the movie is about a superhero, so it's expected, but I wish that there had been so much of it. They could have cut it down a lot and made the same point. Or, at least made the fighting have substance, then it wouldn't have been so distracting. Overall, it was a great movie. I would absolutely recommend it despite my two ailments. It was good enough to see in theaters once, maybe meriting a second watch once it comes out on Redbox. It made me value Superman as an awesome-powerful-alien, but also as a human with feelings. It changed my thinking on him, which is the mark of a truly great movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, personally I thought that some of the action caused there to be less emphasis on character and plot development.

Once again we see the traitorous GENERAL ZOD banished to a prison in space to punish him for his crimes (and to provide conflict later in the film.) And once again, we see KAL-EL, the future SUPERMAN, being rocketed away from the dying world to Earth. Ho hum. There are differences. The planet was destroyed, not by a nova, but rather because the Kryptonians (?) had mined their world's core to the point of making it unstable (and it's a shame the filmmakers didn't draw parallels with the exploitation of our own planet.) And Kal-el is unique, the first 'natural' child on a planet that has practiced strict genetic control for generations. Kal-el lands on Earth, is adopted by JONATHAN and MARTHA KENT, who name him Clark, and performs assorted miraculous rescues. However, when caught in a tornado with his family, his dad tells Clark not to rescue him because that would reveal his secret to the world before he's ready. Clark then has to watch his father die. Oh, the trauma. There are more childhood incidents intended to show the future Superman's psychological makeup. They don't work. Clark joins an expedition to a mysterious object in the Arctic. Reporter LOIS LANE is also there. The object turns out to be an old Kryptonian spaceship. Wow! Clark is able to unlock it, talk to a computer reconstruction of his father's consciousness, and learn about Krypton. He also saves Lois from certain death. In contrast to all other Superman stories, Lois tracks down and identifies her mysterious savior pretty easily. What a scoop, but he convinces her not to publish his identity. Her editor, Perry White (who is now black) agrees. Unfortunately, wicked General Zod has escaped his prison and has come to Earth. He wants the codex, a skull-like object that has all the genetic information of Kryptonians and is convinced Kal-El has it. If Earth doesn't surrender Kal-el to him, he will destroy the planet. Oy vay. Seeing Lois Lane kiss Superman reminds me of a really funny article, ""Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex,"" by Larry Niven. Niven describes the difficulties involved in sex between Superman and humans and, indirectly shows the basic silliness of the Superman myth. The dumbest line comes when she says it's all downhill after the first kiss, and he says that's true only if you're kissing a human. Wonderful, Stupidman-you're telling Lois it's all downhill for you, not her. To watch movies of this genre, a lot of willing suspension of disbelief is needed. Fortunately, it isn't difficult. This film has more than its share of plot flaws, but at least it doesn't have kryptonite or ludicrous criminals like Lex Luther. In case you think the 'S' on Superman's chest stands for Superman, this movie will correct you; it's actually the symbol of Jor-El's house and stands for hope. Jor-El and Kal-El's names are interesting since 'el' is the Hebrew word for God. Maybe this is a remnant of Superman's origin from the imagination of two Jewish guys. But why does Zod wear that same 'S' symbol on his chest? The biggest negative is fighting scenes between Zod and his allies and the forces of good. They go on too long and get monotonous, especially since you know how it ends. This film diverges a lot from most Superman stories, and that makes it more interesting. It's not just another rehash. In spite of its flaws, the movie grabs your interest (a least for Superman fans) and gets your pulse up at least to a jog. I give it +++. (On http://workoutmovies.blogspot.com/, Zvi Zaks posts no-spoiler (mostly) reviews on how well a movie will raise your pulse while exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike .)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Man of Steel retells the Superman origin story in an admirably new and ambitious way, and Cavill is a firm lead, but the film is also somber, and distractingly overproduced.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2949225/?ref_=tt_urv","hasserbond","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50180847/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2014","See it if you want to view Superman kicking some Kryptonian butt for the first time in a while, but you can also rent it. The story: After the generally perceived disappointment that was 2006's Superman Returns, the red-caped franchise needed some juice. DC Comics claim to fame film franchise, The Dark Knight Trilogy, was coming to its end, and they needed to make a move. So the team understandably decided to boot up the Superman story again, hire visionary director Zack Snyder, producer Chris Nolan, new lead Henry Cavill, and aim to please. The plot, if you haven't seen any of the films or read the comics, is about a baby that is sent by his parents from the dying alien planet of Krypton to Earth to survive. But this is no normal baby; he soon will discover that he can bend cars, laser fry buildings with his eyes, and of course, fly. The now grown up boy, Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman (Cavill) wanders around our planet in the shadows from job to job trying to conceal his powers. We see flashbacks of the two loving farm hands who raised him as a ""normal"" boy, and the many experiences that shaped him to the man he is today. After making many discoveries about his true identity, our protagonist also learns that a vengeful survivor from Krypton, General Zod (Michael Shannon), and friends are on their way to Earth to put our planet in jeopardy and ultimately destroy him. Can the Man of Steel save his newfound love, life, and world? The good: The film does have a great opening that is both creative and exciting. It also, in my opinion, contains probably the best action sequence in the movie altogether. The first half as well tells the familiar story in an interesting fashion, as the chronological order of events is mixed. The pacing is fluid, and there are some nice unraveling of answers that invest us into the story even more. The cast is solid, and Cavill, while not highly captivating, portrays a more conserved hero that we can understand in his moments of quiet restraint, but also root for in moments of body slamming. The best actors actually in the film are the two father figures; Russel Crowe is awesome as Kal-El's noble father, and is the most intriguing character in the film. Kevin Costner, while unfairly not given enough time and material, also subtly shines as our protagonists caring and wise Earth-father. He also is the star of, for me, one of the film's more powerful, yet annoyingly abrupt moments. Shannon isn't as memorable as he should be, but uniquely has a moral and understandable reason for his anarchy that does drop an unexpected question on the viewers. Amy Adams and Diane Lane also aren't given full justice to bring out their full charm/skills but still are serviceable. The action for a while is very cool and surprisingly gains a gigantic scale as they escalate into mass, building crumbling destruction. The special effects are strong, and add a large level of realism to the film. Also the score, while overbearing and loud, is catchy and has an epic aspect to it that fits in well with the movie's tone. The bad: I understand that Snyder wants to deliver the super-smashing thrills that fans have been wishing for, but to quote another reviewer, less could have been more. He spends WAY to much time over bloating each battle, and soon after a while it becomes repetitive and almost an assault on the senses. It doesn't help that the cinematography is annoyingly off-grounded and almost entirely hand-held. Thats what the film needed more of; it needed to be earthed and take a few steps back. Due to the zippy action, shots, zooms, and effects, the movie feels more like an alien or other worldly film that doesn't have a firm balance. Also the large scale carnage takes too much time away from the character development and actual story that it should have focused more on. We get a general sense of the characters, but there are many pivotal moments in the film that are supposed to have traction, but ultimately aren't emotionally resonante enough due to their incomplete setups. Also the levity of the horrific destruction towards the end of the film never seems to be taken in, and one brief sequence is so overdone and arbitrary that it ends up looking like a video game. I also hate to say it, but some 9/11 imagery pops up, and it is slightly unsettling. For the script, I again wanted more time to be used to set up our connections with the characters, so that their choices and consequences that happen to them would be more significant to the audience. There also was some quick but very odd lines of dialogue that were completely out of place. You'll know what I'm talking about once you see it. I also wish that it's tone wasn't so somber. There are barley any moments of comedic relief, and I feel like if it lightened up, also visually with it's color palette, it could have benefited the picture significantly. The 3D effects don't add anything to the movie and in fact might make you wish that you could view it in 2D again. My take: Man of Steel isn't as bad as it could have been, but it also isn't as good as it could have been either. It aims at being serious and epic in scale, but could have used more moments of charm or character growth. It is a step in the right direction though, and makes me intrigued for new adventures to come. I don't want to give anything away, but be sure to look out for a few blink-and-you'll-miss-it visual easter eggs in the movie that may make the fanboy in you chuckle.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After an interval of 19 years, it was good to have him back and I enjoyed ""Superman Returns"" (2006). Roll on another seven years and what's that? Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's ""Man Of Steel"" which could be known as ""Superman 6"" or ""Superman Reboot 2"". I was fortunate enough to see the movie at its European premiere at the Empire cinema in London's Leicester Square where the director and all the stars appeared and the audience included television personality Jonathan Ross.After two Americans in the titular role, this time a Brit dons the cape and Henry Cavill does a splendid job, having really buffed up for the part. His costume has been given a new, darker appearance, befitting these austere times, and we are even told that the 'S' on his chest is really the symbol for hope on his home planet of Krypton and the appellation Superman is mentioned only once n this effort to strike in new directions for such an iconic figure. Another (inevitable) difference from the earlier films is that now we have a version in 3D, although I did not feel that the extra dimension added that much. A third difference is that the movie takes itself very seriously and there is none of the humour in the earlier Superman films or (much more recently) the ""Iron Man"" franchise.The new version comes with some heavyweight talent behind the camera: the director is Zack Snyder (""300"" & ""Watchmen"") and co-producer and co-writer is Christopher Nolan (three Batman movies). These two have ensured that what we have here is less a traditional super-hero movie and more a piece of science fiction with significant action on Krypton or involving characters from this planet. Plotwise it's a combination of the first two Superman movies - although it is not a straight-line narrative - but stylistically this is typical Snyder with a crashing opening, stunning visuals and a relentless pace that barely pauses for breath. Better pacing would have helped and some 15-20 minutes should have been cut from the last third of the film (just too many buildings being smashed up in the final fight between Superman and General Zod), but the work is immensely entertaining and great fun.In front of camera, there is a galaxy of stars: Michael Shannon is suitably chilling as the mighty Zod; Russell Crowe is around as the hero's father more than you might expect, thanks to the wonders of sci-fi; Clark Kent's earth parents are played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane; and Laurence Fishburne is the editor of the ""Daily Planet"" with Amy Adams as his star reporter. Heck, for ""The West Wing"" fans like me, there's even Richard Schiff. German newcomer Antje Traue is a beautiful, if cruel, side-kick to Zod. And, once again, Hans Zimmer provides an effective soundtrack.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having grown up with the comic books, seen the story played out on television and in theaters for more than 4 decades I was just done. And then along comes this film with a two and a half hour running time, and I simply cringed at the very thought of sitting through another same old story. But, this wasn't the same old story this was a rocket launch into action and an adventure that began almost from the very start with Kal-El/Clark's (Henry Cavill) birth. This is the first time that I recall seeing in live action shown so vividly the planet Krypton before its infamous destruction. The vision of what life on Krypton would have been like and the coup that led to the imprisonment of General Zod (Michael Shannon) has never been rendered with such detail. The action in this story was none stop, all of which was fueled by the special effects. The special effects were so phenomenal that they were barely noticeable, because they worked so seamlessly within the story. They were primarily the art of devastation, from Krypton to huge crafts, to larger than life hand to hand combat with super human strength to Metropolis being all but completely razed, the film was a visual masterpiece. This story was told with a lot of heart, and the running time was necessary to show how much of an inner struggle Clark had with being so different. It wasn't just a natural uneventful growth process like going up in a show size when his powers began to manifest, it was conveyed as a traumatic transition, which made Clark not only likable but you care about him. I'm still trying to decide how I felt about Lois Lane (Amy Adams), she seemed to be too accepting too quickly of all the other worldly events that were transpiring around her, but I guess the situations didn't leave much time for panicking. I noticed hints in the film that there will be a sequel, but I'm having a hard time imagining that Lex Luther who has always been Superman's primary nemesis will be wrapped in a story with the kind of zeal that Christopher Nolan has brought to light here. It turns out that this story was so masterfully done and so entertaining that it has renewed my enthusiasm in the franchise, I give it a green light.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So what the movie lacks in humor and romantic quotient(according to critics)..Snyder always gives emphasis on the CGI and story in his every film and critics have to understand that a superhero like Superman has always been serious character whether it is in comics or films and it really suits him. About the lack of romance..Well wait for the sequel guys :) :)Music by Hans zimmer , which could easily give you goosebumps!! ..Superb acting by all of the casts but man who really STEALS the show is ""The Man Of Steel"" Henry Cavill. 10/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I prefer a witty dialogue, a director who will let the actors and actresses act and won't bombard us with a thumping over-aggressive sound track. Or have those days gone for good? Maybe that's the reason why they haven't remade ""The Godfather"" - there's no opportunity for them to stick twenty minutes of CGI to impress the masses.

But for a film that tries to tell the story of superman in a serious drama/action film, it FAILS in the drama department. Characters are not developed properly, Moral questions are answered and fixed with one sentence, or ignored completely, any point drama happens, action interrupts it, almost like the writer was afraid people would get bored. And the action (especially the climax) completely forgets everything Superman stands for in order to give a big visual spectacle. But what about the people he's trying to protect? millions are dying because of him, aren't you going to feel bad? aren't the people going to feel pain?nop, all of that is ignored, but the fight was awesome wasn't it!!??David S Goyer did a horrible job. with what he did here, i don't think he even touched the Dark Knight script.Acting: The acting in the film is great, they all do a great job with the little that is given to them. I think everyone represented their characters to perfection, and they felt like a great embodiment of the characters we know form so long ago. With the little they gave themTecnical Aspects The Music is EPIC, but generic. So generic it is quite forgettable. The Visuals are GREAT everything looks big fantastic, epic! The cgi people did a great job. Zack Snyder did an amazing job with the visuals and carrying this whole film. When it comes to a good direction, i can count in Zack Snyder.OVERALL OPINION: I had a lot of fun with this film. It was huge and exiting to see Superman battle something only superman can destroy. Not having any kryptonite was the best thing to happen to this film, because, it is what made this film AWESOME in terms of action. It was truly epic! but it is only epic if you turn off your brain, once you turn it on, the film is just a brainless action film that ignores superman and everyone around him as legitimate characters and sees them as just cardboard cutouts doing things.It's pretty and exiting but where is the heart? Why do i feel like i'm watching a sequel instead of the first film? are you selling me a toy, or a film? Why do i have to turn off my brain to enjoy a modern superhero film, Iron Man, Spiderman, and Batman didn't make me do that, so why does Man of Steel have to do it?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were plenty of special effects in this film, almost to the point of overkill. I actually liked the Krypton special effects the best. I thought they were the most creative. When I called my sister and asked her how she liked the film, the first thing that she said was ""it was long"". I must say that I could not agree with her more on that point. The last 30 minutes of the film was a continuous brawl and had me thinking that it would never end. While I was watching Kal-El/Superman (Henry Cavill), the thought that kept running through my mind is that Superman is not all that super (although he was ruggedly handsome). I think that one of the most cleaver things about this film is the way that they kept Jor-El (Russell Crowe) incorporated in the film. That was pretty creative and unexpected. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) was a lot tougher than her predecessors. She was tough and gutsy which was a breath of fresh air from always playing the victim. Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) on the other hand was more docile than I expected. I remember in the comic books there were always a lot of symbols in his dialog box (smile). I didn't expect cursing, but I did expect him to be meaner. Speaking of mean, General Zod (Michael Shannon) fit the bill to a tee and I have to say, he was a tough one to beat. I think that the DC Comic franchise still has a little bit of catching up to do to the Marvel franchise. Unlike the Marvel films, there is no humor; it was straight drama. I never really developed an emotional connection to the character. I also think that I would have liked the film more if the story had been told sequentially instead of filling the screen with an over abundance of retro-vision. I do think that this film is theater worthy, just because of the CGI, but pack a lunch because you are going to be there for a while. This is one of those times that I wish we had a blue light (somewhere between amber and green), but because I am feeling pretty generous today, I am going to go with a green light.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Adding to that, it was produced by Christopher Nolan. So, as usual, I managed to catch the IMAX 3D screening of the film, to the advantage of this review.NOTE: This review is done by a non-Superman fan.Lets start off with plot line. The story for Man of Steel was quite good actually... from the looks of it. The film starts off pretty solid, but as the beginning scene distances itself from Krypton and fades into Earth, it tends to become quite mindless. There, still, is a bit of the plot there but Snyder tries to balance Clark Kenton's young as well as old life into half-an-hour which doesn't quite work out. By the end, there is no character development which makes Man of Steel just a mindless action flick.There is TOO much of sci-fi in this one. It seems that Snyder created all the hype for this film just for the Superman fans. Films like Spiderman, Batman, Star Trek have all had this hype, yet they toned it down for it to be appreciated by all types of audiences. However in this one its just bizarre by the amount of alien-type stuff flying around he screen. To the disadvantage, Snyder never directed the film with IMAX cameras and it's 2D-converted-3D so the effect isn't quite there.Also, the action in the film is fun at times, but then you just get bored of it. The fight between Jor-El and Zod was good, considering it was in one position, but as Superman is introduced, it tends to get a bit annoying with the cameras moving about everywhere, zooming in and out.Acting-wise, the film manages to keep it's standards. Henry Cavill keeps the audience glued to the screen with his role as Kal-El/Clark Kenton/Superman and Amy Adams was quite good as well. Kevin Costner, Russel Crowe, ditto. Michael Shannon was a great villain with his emotions, but not the best. One more point, The film doesn't have much speech. In the sense, its less talk, more action.In the end, Man of Steel is just a timepass visual-effects film. It's great at times but it has a lot of flaws, and tends to make you feel bored at times. Didn't live up to the the expectations, Didn't QUITE live up to the hype but it gave me some of what I wanted.MAN OF STEEL- 6.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Superman is certainly a polarizing figure in his own right and within the last 30 odd years we have encapsulated him and have been confused as to what we do with him. The 78 Donner film, seems to have encased this mythos to a point the character has been stuck in a time lapse. Zack Snyder's re imagining is the beginning of making large cracks in the glass that surrounds him. This film is ballsy. It's large and an epic in every sense of the word. It is humorless and quite heavy, to agree with the criticism. But it's also the most emotional and spiritual of the mythos thus far. Not a perfect film, as it does plod along on large plot exposition in the 3rd act. The fight scenes become comparable to a Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck fight with no real emotional investment, but Snyder plays with us to reveal that these fights serve a purpose for a finality to a Superman battle that might again create some controversy. I for applaud it and applaud Snyder for making a larger stand on what it really means for Superman to be the world's savior and moral compass. It comes at a cost and reduces Clark to understand the power of being human. Isn't that really what a Superman is?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Perhaps, could be for earning more bucks. The movie is excellent in totality. Not only, did the characterization build-up of Superman was good but also the action scenes were awesome. I would still rate Batman Begins much better but then, it had an advantage of a new kind of story-telling. Expectations are obvious to grow after Batman trilogy but this movie steals the show in its own way. Man of steel is here to stay and it will definitely have its own fan following, those who will eagerly await for the sequels to come.

My favorite superhero's consist of DeadPool, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and some others. However, I am not completely biased towards Marvel. DC Comics doesn't exactly have the ""coolest"" collection of comic book super heroes, but they do have some good ones, including Batman, Green Arrow, and DeathStroke. I am not a Superman fan. At all. I do not care for the over exaggerated love story between he and the indecisive Lois Lane. I find his invincibility to be a little boring to watch when he simply fights a bald man in a suit (aka, Lex Luthor). When the commercials for Man of Steel first started airing, I was not convinced. I do like Zach Snyder's work, but not enough to be convinced to go and watch a Superman film. Then I saw that it was being produced by Syncopy, whom we all know is the infamous, awesome story telling, Batman series directing, Christopher Nolan. When I noticed that he was on board with the project, my attitude towards it went from ""not interested"" to ""maybe when it comes to DVD"".Man of Steel came out over the Father's Day weekend, and as a gift to my father, I took him to see it because he thought it looked ""worth it"". I was going into the theater with very low expectations. When I came out, I smiled. I spent my money well. For a Superman movie, this was done very well! I'm not a fan of Superman, but I enjoyed this film! The dialogue was well set, the scene changes were a little awkward, but not enough to destroy the plot, and the origin story was well told. Now the fight scenes, well, they made the movie to me. The story was good, but it dragged on a little and made the movie feel as if it was 3 hours long. Once the fighting came around, though, the movie went from a 4 to a 7 in my rating. They were long scenes! Well directed and played out, and definitely awesome! I would probably say that the fight scenes are either on par with or a little better than The Avengers fight scenes. They were just fantastic!So, for someone who doesn't really care too much for DC, and who isn't a fan of Superman in the slightest to go see a Superman movie and come out thinking it was enjoyable and worth the money, then that should be a little sign for anyone who is debating whether or not to go and see this film. Check it out! I'm sure a local theater may have a $6 evening rate. If not, $10 is still a decent price to check this movie out. If you're still on the fence, I'd definitely recommend watching it upon its DVD release. It was very well done.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Many have tried to knock it from the top spot over the years and have failed. Donner's film, for me, has remained THE standout comic book adaptation and Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the man of steel has never been equaled.Until now.Because Man of Steel is a triumph.Early signs were not good. I was encouraged by the news that Batman director, Christopher Nolan, and writer David S. Goyer would be collaborating on the story and that Nolan would also be producing. But I was less confident in the decision to hand the reins to Zack Snyder. He had shown himself to be a very competent filmmaker (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen) but I had written him off as a style-over-substance director. But as I started to see some production stills my optimism began to grow.But then alarm bells started ringing when the film's release was pushed back from December 2012 to June 2013. This is usually not a good sign. But we need not have worried. And I don't mind admitting that I was wrong about Snyder. He has delivered not only a great Superman movie, but a cracking movie full stop.We all know the basic Superman story by now and Man of Steel retells it faithfully, but with a few twists and variations which I won't give away here. This is another superhero origin story, yes. But it doesn't feel like it due to Snyder's clever use of non-linear storytelling techniques and well-timed flashbacks.I was one of the few who actually liked Bryan Singer's 2006 effort, Superman Returns. But Singer (by his own admission) was such a huge fan of the original films that he couldn't seem to find his own vision. He used John William's iconic fanfare. He used a digitally-manipulated Marlon Brando as Jor-El. And he even cast an actor (Brandon Routh) who not only looked just like Christopher Reeve but sounded like him too.Man of Steel manages to break free of the shackles of the past and Snyder is very much free to do his own thing. And it's abundantly clear from our first glimpse of the planet Krypton that Snyder's interpretation is worlds away from Donner's (and Singer's) film.The visuals are simply stunning. Krypton is like nothing I have ever seen on screen before and the opening 20 minutes alone contain more eye-popping shots than most movies do in their entire running time. Snyder's distinct visual style permeates every frame of the film and whether we're at the Kent homestead in Smallville or in the bustling city street of Metropolis, the film retains a realistic, naturalistic feel.Weta Digital have truly outdone themselves and the effects are top-notch. Live action elements and CGI are blended seamlessly and you completely believe what you're seeing unfolding before your eyes, no matter how far-fetched. The fight scenes between Superman and the various villains are breathtaking and the action is very clearly staged and is never confusing.There are some very nice character moments too. We get to see an adolescent Clark struggling with his heightened senses and learning to focus his mind. In fact, almost all of the characters are believable, three-dimensional people with clear motivations and goals – no matter which side they're on. The film is beautifully paced and never feels like it's in a rush and this allows moments between the characters to breathe. Snyder manages to satisfactorily both deliver spectacular action and an emotional punch, which is not an easy thing to do.The cast is impeccable. Russell Crowe does a very solid job as Jor-El, Superman's biological father. And Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are pitch-perfect as Clark Kent's earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. Laurence Fishburne is good as the Daily Planet chief Perry White, although he's not given a great deal to do. Amy Adams is great too as the spunky Lois Lane.And Michael Shannon's General Zod is one of the most-menacing, fierce and terrifying screen villains we have seen in a very long time.But this film belongs to Cavill. He is Kal-El. He is Clark Kent. And he IS Superman. Cavill demands your attention every time he is on screen. I had no knowledge of his work before he was cast in this role and as a result he brings no baggage with him. He slides effortlessly into the role of the titular hero and it's hard to think of another actor alive today who could play the part better than he does here. On a side note – isn't it strange that Batman, Spider-Man and now Superman are all currently being played by English actors? I also have to mention the score by Hans Zimmer. Instead of trying to beat John Williams at his own game, Zimmer has gone for something entirely different which works wonderfully. Trust me, you'll be humming the main theme long after you have left the theatre.There are a few very minor quibbles. The movie is a tad too long and some of the action sequences become a little monotonous towards the end. But given the fact that the film has so much story to tell it does so with great efficiency and not a second of screen time is wasted. Plus, it's not exactly a barrel of laughs. It does take itself quite seriously at times but manages to pull it off without being overly solemn.It will be very interesting to see where they take it from here. A sequel has already been announced and I'm looking forward to another installment with Cavill in the red cape.Welcome back, Superman.Oh, and Disney, if you're listeninggive Snyder a shot at Star Wars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A well established Reboot/Remake","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2814373/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2013","When it comes to portraying a comic book character like Superman, an icon with high popularity, it's hard not to feel the pressure of millions of fans. Seven years before was Superman Returns (2006) directed by Bryan Singer which didn't gather spectacular reviews by most and before that were the dreaded Superman III (1983) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). So it's no surprise that fans are skeptical on what to expect. But to be honest, even though I found things to knock on, it's difficult not to enjoy it. I mean, how could you go wrong with Zack Snyder directing and Christopher Nolan producing right behind him?Since this movie is jump-starting the Superman franchise again, its important to understand that the writing will cover the back-story but will also continue with the current story to keep things moving. David S. Goyer's screenplay is written quite skillfully but it does have a flaw I'd like to address and that's the villain's plan. Again, the plan is involving slaying the human race in place for an older race. It reminded me too much of other movies. Most recently that came to mind was Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011). Same concept, to a point.But what I did feel to be very deep about Goyer's writing was the back- story. Viewers will have the experience of understanding the physical and mental pain that Clark Kent (Kal-El) had to endure while growing up. Whether he was 9, 13 or 33. It'll hit viewers hard because we all can relate to what it's like to be rejected by others. To feel like the whole world is looking down at us, it's a scary feeling, especially when one feels like an outcast. But, as explained Jor-El (Russell Crowe), this is why he sent Kal-El to earth, so he could choose his own path. The rest of the children on Krypton were all predestined for a certain job in life and Jor-El didn't want that for Kal-El. That part of the writing was great.Casting was another great aspect to this movie that played a significant part of the product. Henry Cavill is by far the most accurate embodiment of the Kal-El. His voice is smooth yet powerful. Cavill is also able to convey a lot of emotion in his role because of how bound he is by his upbringing. Isn't it also coincidental that he's also from the UK just like Christian Bale is and he played Batman, another DC comic hero. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a great choice too, but I am curious to why her hair could not have been colored in slightly darker. Would it have taken up that much more time? Diane Lane and Kevin Costner who play Kal-El's parents also did a great job. When they're on screen it is easy to see that they are the reason why Clark Kent is the way he is.As for the Kryptonians, Russell Crowe's interpretation of Jor-El had a royal and noble feel to it. Perhaps not as memorable as Marlon Brando's take but inventive all the same. Lastly, General Zod played by Michael Shannon was the most interesting for me. It's not often that I pity a villain but I did. According to the story, General Zod was one of the predestined children, which means he didn't grow up with the choice of what he wanted to be. Which should lead viewers to understand why Zod won't give up. Shannon has ability to instill that into his audience it feels quite real. Zod is not one to be messed with.Since we live in an era where technology is much apart of our lives, there's not much to say about the special effects or action. The special effects were well integrated into the movie and nothing stuck out like a sore thumb. And since this is a Superman movie, don't even think that there WON'T be any action. There's plenty. However, depending on viewers' preferences, some of the camera shots in this movie may annoy people. For example, there were a few scenes that seemed like it was shot with a hand-held camera. The camera just didn't stay steady. I don't know if that was to make the picture seem more real (or raw) but it wasn't necessary.Finally, the component that is needed to make any film compelling, especially a comic book hero adaptation, is the film score. Contributing to this is Hans Zimmer, best known for creating intense, high octane, downbeat pounding music and its no different here. Horns will blare and string instruments will sound. Sadly though, I did not find Zimmer's score to be as powerful when it came to the main theme. There definitely was a theme, which is great but the crescendo of notes never seemed to finish, leaving the theme at somewhat of a cliffhanger. It's important to finish because it conveys that sense of power and presence. Zimmer knows what makes a good score and all this needed was a little more push and it could have knocked this out of the ballpark. But all in all, it's obvious that a lot of effort went into this work.There are only a few things that were off with the movie but they are so tiny that it's not much to get upset over. The cast and music drive the story which leave a very enjoyable experience for viewers.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I hear other users' complaints of a CGI-injected cinematic marvel and how this disorients the movie's thesis. I'm here to say I disagree. Is there an overt usage of CGI effects? Yes. Is this a movie about a character whose abilities include heated retinas, super strength, and an ability to defy our planet's physics? Yes. This should conclude the argument over this film's over- the-top CGI debacle. Now onto the story. I interpretted this film's story through a superhero lens. I came into the theater knowing full well that this film's aim was to perpetuate very simplistic and basic ideals surrounding Responsibility vs. Power. This adage has been beaten to death but is universal in a superhero movie's framework. This was a fun, exhilarating movie that was beautifully crafted and wonderfully written. Certain aspects of the characters could have been explored more, definitely. But if comic book movies haven't inundated us with the idea of sequels then maybe they aren't for you. The fun in these sequels (at least in well crafted sequels) is further exploration into the characters we were introduced to in the first. Man of Steel gave us a glimpse of the mythologic and indestructible superhero known as Superman. It gave the man of steel his initial framework and provided us with a powerfully simple yet gripping story that you have to see the film to understand. Now this is definitely not a film for everyone. If you want an intricate story or multi-faceted characters across the board this might not do it for you. If you enjoy fundamental ideas being blown into magnificent proportions then wait no longer!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not until years later, as a man, that he begins to fully embrace his extraterrestrial heritage, while the very fate of the planet is hanging in the balance. Reimagining of sorts of the iconic DC Comics character is much more serious and somber in both its tone and characterizations than previous renditions, but there's still plenty to please with fantastic visual effects, soaring action scenes, and compelling human drama. The film's unremitting climactic action scenes border on superfluous, yet they remain exciting and fun to watch.

Ultimately, the CGI elements are what make these kind of movies possible, or else it's back to the dark ages of film. This version of Superman will not disappoint. The fact the Goyer and Nolan are a part of the screenplay says everything. They know their comic book history. Remember how detailed The Dark Knight trilogy was in contrast to the origin stories?? The writing style of Nolan's is present, but not as predominant as it was in Batman Begins. Even though some of the concepts were tweaked, it is a great storyline that was over-due for Superman. For those who remember the version with Christopher Reeve, the storyline helps explain the introductory scene of the original '77 version much better, and even though the black Spandex from the Superman II villains doesn't come right away, it does not disappoint. The action doesn't slow down and for a traditional two hour and twenty time frame, it takes up every minute of the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It really looked like Warner Bros had successfully emulated the Marvel magic that Disney has been trotting out, blockbuster after blockbuster.And, for a time, MOS works. It's certainly not lacking in the casting department: I think all are just excellent choices, and all did the best they could with what they were given. Henry Cavill completely owns the role, just as Christopher Reeve before him. Amy Adams is a sweet, tough, smart and gorgeous Lois Lane.But, this is a seriously flawed movie, with drama front-loaded & rushed into the first half of the runtime, and the back half being a mindless monster-mash of invincible enemies fighting an equally invincible hero, amidst an overwhelming scale of destruction that makes you wonder, 'Just exactly what did Superman actually save or protect?' Unlike Iron Man 3 or Avengers or Thor, which gave us powerful heroes and chaotic destruction, but with a balance of well-written comedic relief and just outright ...moments to breathe, Man Of Steel grabs you, slams you into your chair, and keeps relentlessly punishing you into submission (especially with the thunder of IMAX and visual impact of 3D).It sounds like a good thing, and it surely looks the part. There are nice twists to the setup between the characters, especially between Lois and Clark; an inventive approach to his weakness; beautiful modernization of Krypton, his suit, his father, and so much more. The Hans Zimmer score is rather adept, considering the sidelining of the iconic Wiliams theme. So why is it all so...empty? I think it's because for that second half of the film, it's just immovable objects pointlessly smashing into each other (like the most disengaging parts of the action in the original Richard Donner Superman II). Imagine the tussle between Iron Man & Thor in Avengers, but played-out for 60 minutes instead of 5 minutes, without any fun quips. And, it feels so unpopulated, as if they couldn't afford enough extras. Whereas in Transformers 3's Chicago under siege, or Avengers' ransacked NY, it really felt like these were living cities being attacked, at times in MOS it feels like the only inhabitants of Metropolis are the handful of 'important' people at the Daily Planet.Add to that a very disappointing solution to the main villain, especially after the length & scope of battle. The only other thing I can say without giving anything directly away, is that you'll know exactly how much confidence Warner Bros actually has in this film, the franchise, and any related franchise, by how the end credits are handled.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well I suppose inferior filmmaking is the answer. Zack Snyder is wholly inept director and I think this picture and just about any other is better off without him.The first half to two thirds of this film are spent on what us essentially backstory and buildup and its flawed not only in premise but in delivery. Hardly any of it is essential to the story and it's really just extra weight thrown on for the sake of it. Though one aspect of the story I would praise is how it doesn't use a lightweight crook(no offense to Hackman who certainly did his best) and his bumbling sidekick as the villain and instead opts for what you might call a worthier opponent. The action and fight sequences are also, of course, much better than those in the original films.I guess since the original cast Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford they decided to get two former stars to fill those same roles: only this time being Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner. Both of them are usually very watchable and can carry a movie and even though they're definetly two of the brightest highlights here, they still seem diminished and subpar in it. As is Michael Shannon whose talents are wasted on a caricature and cartoonish villain.Henry Cavill isn't a bad choice to play Superman and overall he's fairly decent-though he lacks some of Christopher Reeve's charm.While it may seem as if I'm committing the cardinal sin of reviewing-judging this as a film by comparing it to other work-on it's own Stalin, sorry, Man of Steel isn't a very good movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All the cast choices were perfect Henry Cavil as Superman was the perfect choice for the character, everyone else was perfect as well, there is one problem I had with everyone in this film but I'll get to that later. The visuals in this film are outstanding from camera shots to the way fight scenes are executed, just brilliant! I liked how they gave us a good enough amount of time spent on Krypton and explained their technology and society and who his family were and why they sent him to earth Russel Crowe as Jor-El was amazing one of the best parts of the film, great work done by an amazing actor. Now the biggest problem I had with this film was from the trailers, how they sorta give you the wrong theme of this film, with the whole emotional scenes about destiny and saving the world lines, yes these speeches are in this film but it goes by way too fast I didn't feel that the Kent's were in this film enough I expected there to be a good enough amount of time with Clark's back story or more flash backs to do with his past I didn't feel that bond he's supposed to have with the Kent's if this film was half emotion/Smallville and half action I would have been satisfied. Now the characters bother be a lot in this film they seem bland most of the time there's no character development whats so ever, and Clark becomes Superman way to fast! like within the 1st hour and again with no build up to it. I know it sounds like I'm trashing this film but I just wished there was more character development from all characters, especially from Clark and we had more of his connection through the Kent's in this film. Zod was great in this film I do believe Michael Shannon was Zod, every thing he did had reason and made sense to why he was doing it, he wasn't just a mindless bad guy though he will not be remembered like Heath Ledger was from the Nolan films. I do hope in the next film we get more flash backs to his back story with the Kent's. Overall I enjoyed the film but I do not believe we will be speaking about this from 6 months from now the 2nd one needs more development and emotion to it rather than constant action to every scene.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I mean are you being mean when you give it just a 59% rating. are you crusading the guy by giving it a lesser rating than superman returns. I don't hate superman returns but I think man of the steel is way better than it. I mean is it only me or do people misunderstand Zack Snyder and his films.I mean if you look closely watchmen it's a very deep movie but only if you can understand it. man of steel is not that. its not complicated. it's a bit dry may drag a little bit but its f-ing good movie. yeah its better than superman returns. and yes it's a 2d movie no need for 3d. it may not be good as the dark knight trilogy but it way better than the other superman movies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not mine. I found this to be an endless ride and utterly unsatisfying. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Tarzan even Sherlock Holmes; were all heros of my childhood. Hero's because they were virtuous, not because of a capacity for havoc. This film was epically boring, repetitive, and mono dimensional. Dialogue often seemed strained, like it was hard for the actors to stand behind. I kept watching, hoping for the moment when it would reveal greater depth, when it would move to another level which would reframe everything and win my empathy or support. Nope..","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Not among the most intellectual Superman instalments, but surely among the most enjoyable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3024205/?ref_=tt_urv","stillworkingfortheknife","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32700906/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2014","Since Superman was too old-fashioned, Clark Kent too generic, and Kal-El too unmemorable, Zack Snyder brings us Man of Steel, the origin story of the classic DC comics superhero. The bombastic spectacle devours some 200 million dollars for its budget, which it utilises for lavish action scenes, Hollywood A-listers, and imposing plot holes, although I'm uncertain about the exact expense of the latter.In its prologue, the two and a half hours long blockbuster is set on Krypton, the fictional planet not being designed too creatively or memorably, but set in the midst of a gorgeously coloured universe and forming the platform for well-directed fights, explosions, and debris coming from every cardinal direction. Kal-El is born during all of that commotion and it is only after fifteen minutes that the audience meets him again, now lodging in Kansas on planet Earth and being portrayed by Henry Cavill. The British actor doesn't consistently live up to the iconic role he's in, but depicts his torn feelings convincingly and, as the sixteenth man to slip into the character, gives Superman quite a likable yet not particularly exciting reinvention. The strongest performance evidently comes from Michael Shannon, who easily eclipses the remaining cast for all the Oscar winners and nominees it includes and transforms Man of Steel's primary antagonist, General Zod, from a commonplace scoundrel in the script to a menacing nemesis on screen, especially awesome when reiterating his certainty of tracking down Superman while being frozen into a gigantic sex toy. Across the board really, it's not at all insufficient commitment on the actors' parts that leads many of the blockbuster's characters to appear clichéd and unrealistic, but little leeway in the one-dimensional David S. Goyer script handed to them. The American screenwriter partially makes up for that with a cleverly structured narrative that never feels rushed and at least provides exposition for Kal-El's motivations, ideals, and his unhuman powers via flashbacks and casual conversations  only to then return to rob the plot of logic, consistency, and explanations on a stunning amount of occasions. However visually appealing and skilfully wrought it is at times, the highly prevalent action is not a very effective offset and comes close to being overkill in a big-scale finale. As a result, Man of Steel is not among the most intellectual of Superman instalments, but surely among the most enjoyable.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
