"7","/10","Practically Perfect Interpretation of a Less Than Perfect Book","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982864/?ref_=tt_urv","3xHCCH","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4294858/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2014","Just finished reading the book ""Divergent"" before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"" and the ""Hunger Games"" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in ""Carrie"" recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called ""The Fault in Our Stars"" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in ""After Earth"" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in ""That Awkward Moment"", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp. Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the ""Divergent"" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, ""Divergent"" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.","32 out of 43 found this helpful.

He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.8/10","50 out of 74 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Stands out against other similar minded movies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3072984/?ref_=tt_urv","jackmeat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0633574/?ref_=tt_urv","21 August 2014","Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.","31 out of 45 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Watchable if odd and slightly confusing for newbies. For fans, it's a good adaptation of a problematic novel - so good that it suffers from many of the book's flaws.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982551/?ref_=tt_urv","shawneofthedead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48490287/?ref_=tt_urv","19 March 2014","When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.","18 out of 26 found this helpful.

Are we seeing something of similar essence with the ""Hunger Games"" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it. Highly Recommend.","202 out of 352 found this helpful.

The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise.

"9","/10","Best tween film in ages","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3058062/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieSonic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18033839/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2014","I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a ""twenty-something"" youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:I have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that ""it's not all about Tris"". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some ""films"" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.9/10","74 out of 123 found this helpful.

I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well. First off the bad:1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren't supposed to be but even when they're supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film. Now with that said ^ here is what Worked: 1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.OVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel.","88 out of 164 found this helpful.

Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.","233 out of 364 found this helpful.

It didn't excitement me much and all the way up to it's release, I didn't feel it had that same kind of vibe that 'The Hunger Games' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can't get out of my head and a score I've been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I'm not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I'm sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn't quite grasp. I'm sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant.","27 out of 57 found this helpful.

The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years.

The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts.

So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn't find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can't say it was objectively good, though.The romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn't seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn't I read the book, I think I'd probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them. Not only weren't characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I'm not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn't care much about all that violence. Despite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don't know why. Maybe seeing images I'd only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough... In the end, I'd say this is a movie for you to watch when you don't have much to do and you just want to relax.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I went with a group of friends and saw Divergent yesterday morning. The Pg-13 film was 139 minutes long. I will start my review by saying it was over in the blink of an eye and left me wanting so much more.Prior to the release, critics blasted the film. It received an average 3.5 out of a possible 10 Stars on I.M.D.B. This made me apprehensive. Critics also kept comparing Veronica Roth and her novels to Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games. Scathing reviews said that Divergent was nowhere near as equally riveting as The Hunger Games. The stories are nothing alike. The only similarities I saw come from a strong female teen lead character. Is Katniss anything like Beatrice (Tris)? I suppose, but she is also completely different; motivated by a unique set of circumstances. No. I change my mind. Other than both being female, and teens, and the main characters of their own trilogies -- there are no other similarities. (Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed The Hunger Game books, and so far, the movies. I am just missing the point as to why the two sets of books/movies are being compared. There isn't one. And they shouldn't be).Personally, if you have not read the book Divergent and see the movie, I suspect the movie will be complicated. Not un-followable, just complicated. The plot is not simplistic despite being geared toward teens. I do know several people who have since seen the movie without having read the book and enjoyed the film just the same. Anyway . . .Set in a futuristic Chicago, a community is enclosed behind an electrified fence. The community is split into 5 Factions to keep things running smoothly. The intelligent faction is known as the Erudite; the honest, Candor. The peaceful people are known as Amity, and the brave, Dauntless. The selfless faction, the one Beatrice belongs to, is Abnegation. One is born and raised in the faction of their parents. On your sixteenth birthday, teens undergo a test to see which faction they actual belong in. Regardless, a person can pick to be in any of the other four factions, or stay in the faction they were raised in. When a teen chooses to leave the faction they were raised in, it is upsetting. They must say goodbye to their family. There is a good chance they will never see them again. And if you fail in your knew chosen faction, you can not return home. You become what is actually the 6th faction. The Factionless -- those who don't belong to any faction, and live like the homeless, scavenging for food, and clothing, and shelter. . .Beatrice's test results are inconclusive. They do not point to any one faction. Instead, they point to them all. She is what the government calls, Divergent. This is dangerous. Divergent do not think like anyone else, and therefore are a threat. Forced to keep the test results a secret, Beatrice must pick where she feels she best belongs.Abnegation has always been in charge of the local government because they are selfless and can therefore be trusted with politics. Beatrice discovers a plot by the Amity to overthrow the Abnegation. Chemical injections given to Dauntless will leave their minds susceptible to suggestion, making them dangerous and unstoppable --since the Dauntless train to be warriors, the police of the nation, the protectors of all.The movie is constantly compelling. The time flies. Beatrice (Tris) is played by Shailene Woodley. Never heard of her before. She nailed the role of Tris. (She reminded me of a young Tatum O'Neal. The way she talked. Something about her eyes, too. (The Fault in Our Stars will be released later this year, starring Woodley, as well). With forthcoming releases of Insurgent and Allegiant, she will surely be a star to watch.Theo James portrays Four. He also someone I have never heard of prior. At first, he was not what I pictured when reading the novel. Seemed a little too old. However, as the movie progressed, I think I saw what casting directors picked up on during auditions. He was Four. No way around it.While directed by Neil Burger, written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, Roth did not give up her creative input. She also helped write, and co-produce the film. Good for her. Although some story elements from the novel are missing, overall the movie stayed mostly true and on point. Compelling and action-packed, great acting, and some intense scenes (yeah, I jumped once or twice), I found Divergent so entertaining. I cannot wait for the next in this bound to be popular trilogy.

It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","200 out of 328 found this helpful.

The story takes time to find its feet, and while the action sequences was great, the vast number of characters kind of put things in the mix for this decent young adult novel adaptation.The world felt a bit weird and extreme at first, and it takes time before we can finally believe and be immersed in the world. Meanwhile, story-wise was great in the bigger picture, but the first half of the film was all about Dauntless and so it flows in a very narrow scope. Afterwards, the bigger picture is revealed, when we finally realize the significance of ""Divergent"" characters, and the scale of the conflict. That's when the story kind of takes a hard turn and get going for a full blast finale.The vast number of characters makes it hard to follow most of the supporting characters, making things a little confusing, all the while making us less caring for them. Yet, this also means that we can kind of like the main protagonists. With all the different kind of characters, those we want to hate, those we don't care for, leaving us with the main protagonists to like and root for. This is perhaps the reason why we can care for them emotionally, despite the less emotional nature of the unfolding plot. The first half of the film has no drama for us to feel, while in the second, there was too much of drama where we end up getting lost emotionally (in the end, all I care about is the two main protagonists).The visuals were great, and so were the action sequences, supported by a decent soundtrack with some very likable themes as well. The villain of the film was interesting on its own & fresh for a new franchise like this, and the acting by Kate Winslet was also brilliant, but to be frank, they will need a more threatening & challenging villain if they are to up the stakes for the sequels (truthfully, it is well decided in the novels already, but given that I don't read them, I cross my fingers that the next villain will prove more challenging). The twist towards the end is interesting, and quite a nice touch as well. Meanwhile, the ending felt much too abrupt and unfinished, and it just begs of a sequel to come fast.VERDICT:Good: Great visuals & action, Decent soundtrack, Unique setting, Vast array of characters (mixed)Bad: Takes time to find its feet, Abrupt endingSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

She's a better actor than this. You have to give her credit for stepping outside of her comfort zone, but she's not Jennifer Lawrence here. I believe she has the acting chops to get there, but this film might have been attempting too soon for her. The movie tries to do a lot. Too much. An adaption of a huge dystopian world, a social commentary on class structures, a coming-of-age ""I'm different than most people but that's OK""-type story, and a boot-camp movie. There are some moments that are done very confidently and others that are not. The confident moments are the feel-good little victories, the action set pieces are excellent, the combat, the special FX, dystopian Chicago is very cool, and some of the acting is very good. Although I will say, the casting is better than the acting. The writing and acting are probably the least confident elements to this filmAs with many sci-fi and fantasy movies, the directors often focus on the cool or epic before performance and character. Or there's just too many things to think about and too little time to shoot that you have no choice. Either way, these characters were not as deep as they could have been. But you want them to be and that's what was frustrating.Divergent also suffers from the classic case of adapting but forgetting the essence of the book. It wasn't quite sure what it was, where it lies, who it is, why it exists. It feels like a producer's movie - let's buy the rights to a book, throw some up-and-coming stars on-board, and market it like the Hunger Games sorta, but not fully. But in the producer's book, it was a minor success, as it is making money. So success there. At any rate, I love this genre and I love original stories and adaptations. I wanted this to be good, but it just doesn't go there. I'm glad it's doing OK because that means more original-ish content will continue to be made. And to Shailene Woodley, props for trying something new. But for now, stick to the Fault in Our Stars.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The society that resides there is split into five groups or ""factions"", each representing different virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, Erudite. On a certain day each year, all youth that are 16 years old take test that determined which faction is the best fit. In the end, no matter what the result, one is free to choose whatever faction they wish to. However, if that faction is different from the one they were raised in, they must leave their families and everything else behind and fully commit to their new role in society.Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of these 16 year olds to be divided. On testing day she shows equal aptitude for three separate factions, making her ""Divergent"". Confused, Tris is told to keep her results a secret and ends up choosing the Dauntless faction. As Tris deals with the grueling challenges of becoming Dauntless, she discovers that being divergent entails much more than she ever imagined.I think fans of the book will be very pleased with the adaptation. I have not read the books so I made sure to bring a friend, who had, to the screening with me. According to her, the film does a great job at making the book an emotional and entertaining movie without sacrificing major plot points that would otherwise leave fans disappointed. The Tris and Four (Theo James) are well cast. There's nothing particularly outstanding but they are enjoyable to watch. According to my well-read friend, their romance was whittled down significantly for the film, which I think worked out for the better. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. And while it is a major part, it didn't overshadow the story as a whole.I was really impressed with the music. Being a dance music fan, I think the soundtrack is fun. But the musical score, composed by Junkie XL, is what stood out to me most. There are a handful of very emotional scenes and the music really drives it home.I am a little outside the target age range for this movie but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The obstacles that Tris encounters will translate to audiences of all ages. It's a great story with multiple scenes that led me to reflect on not only my own adolescence but also on my journey as an adult. Out of all young-adult-dystopian novels that have been made into movies, this one is definitely my fave.http://redcarpetrefs.com/2014/03/divergent-review/","35 out of 61 found this helpful.

Even though it may not be exactly like the book, the characters, acting, storyline, etc, WERE ON POINT! The actors did a great job as especially the main characters Four (Theo James) and Tris (Shaliene Woodley) did so good at expressing the actual romance from the book that people actually wanted them to be together in real life. This movie also has a lot of action, and also was suspenseful as sometimes I wouldn't expect people attacking Tris at one point and etc, etc. I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie when it was so compacted with all the emotions from betrayal, to sadness, to anger, to happiness, to romance. But you know haters gonna hate.This movie is just hands down very well put together.","16 out of 25 found this helpful.

But last September I finally saw it because of most of the cast members and while I didn't loved it, I still liked it and found it worth the wait before watching.The movie is set in a dystopian future in Chicago where society is divided in five factions: Abnegation, Dauntless, Amity, Candor and Erudite. The rest, the so-called Factionless have no status or privilege. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born in Abnegation and her father Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) serves on the ruling council: Beatrice's test results prove that she is a Divergent, and since Divergents can think independently they are seen as a threat for the social order. So Beatrice joins forces with a group of other Divergents that are in exile and try their best for stopping Jeanine Matthews' (Kate Winslet) conspiracy. She won't succedd but since they made sequels, you can guess what we'll see.The first thing I noticed when the film began was that the sets were so futuristic and unique... not your typical city of the future, that's for sure! There were various stunts that looked a bit like those of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLEs and were cool. The acting was decent, nothing exceptional. Woodley is a very competent lead, same goes for Goldwyn as her dad and for Winslet as the villain, and the others (such as Miles Teller and Jai Courtney) are on par with them. The soundtrack wasn't forgettable but still not that important.Overall, an ok movie that somehow achieved a cult following. I wouldn't put it in that category but more in the category of decent entertainment and nothing more.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies.","115 out of 185 found this helpful.

But before she was that, she was Divergent. A Non-Conformist. Now hiding the fact that she is, she must become one of the Dauntless.Divergent was very surprising for me. I have never read the books but going into this film without reading them I didn't know if I would like it. But I was wrong. This movie was Very Good! I love the character of Beatrice, I think she is a great role model for the youth of today which is the main problem with some of these teen flicks today which have very thin leading roles. What surprised me also, is that I recognized the actress who played her. She was the daughter from The Descendants. A very big step up from such a small film.There is also some social commentary in this film. It talks about the effects of living in a world where people have to be the same or else they are thrown onto the streets. Very clever for a teen film.It is very worthy of the IMAX treatment, its a big and bold film that I think is going to be the next best thing in a long time. I don't care if there are missing stuff from the book, this movie was super good! Divergent is a must see for Teens, Parents, and Adults who are wanting to watch some great entertainment.78/100 B","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10.

Basically, Shailene has presence, her acting authentic, she delivers what this role called for, and that's that. I want to address the audience's favorable response versus the ridiculous professional critic scoring.Of course the film is not perfect, in a way Gravity or Hunger Games are not perfect. But why should it be? Of course it has flaws, like, the typology of the factions - where is the Artist/Creatives? Without imaginative power we will all die of boredom or fascism. Also, Intellectuals/Scientists and Straight-talking Factual sort tend to flock together, too similar to be separate factions. The parent characters under-used, the girl feels a little over-coddled...etc.Still, no big narrative crimes, nothing deserving a hysterical fail rating. Those who never read the book, who have enough open-mindedness, with hope only to be engaged and entertained, will likely enjoy the ride. The premise was interesting enough, the direction and styling effective, the movie's story world construction well-executed, the story-telling and pacing engaging, the acting performance by the two leads and Winslet and Maggie Q well-balanced, believable and non-jarring, the resolution was convincing enough... So what's up with the 40%/ 4 stars hysteria among the pro critics? I have my theories...In general movies get anywhere between 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 audience love it VS critic love it ratio. This one got 2:1. Which means, the film not only hit the right note with a progressive crowd, it also diverged greatly from an unspoken dogma. 40% pro critic here and elsewhere, wow, obviously Divergent hit a sensitive nerve with the film industry's Erudite equivalent. It seems, Divergent the movie is itself a divergent in its own context, a potentially uncontrollable menace to a rigid, retentive, non-divergent, evidently HOMOGENEOUS English language film critic culture...But in this case, I'd go by the Audience's score. For starters, a 1000000X larger sampling size is always more objective than a few hundred homogeneous Erudites. My rule is, movies with 1:1 audience:critic ratio, the rating is most objective. 1:2, the truth is somewhere in between. But if it's 2:1, the critics are upset about some game-changing ""threats"", and the truth leans strongly toward the audience. Works for me anyway... I call this the AUCRIT Ratio. Feel free to test it yourself. Onto Divergent...I've never read the book. I do keep my expectations on neutral when watching a mainstream big-concept film - especially yet another adapted post-apocalyptic science fiction targeting young adults.Those who expect futuristic science fictions to have primarily male leading characters esp in power positions, invincible biological strength, brute force solution, outcomes determined by technology especially Very Cool Weapons, non-stop magical actions, hot sexy androids and fetish costumes will be disappointed. Those who *demand* award-winning plot and ""logical"" science in futuristic fiction movies are just being hysterical, for they tend not to notice the fantastical magic, bad physics and overkill tech in their ""serious classic"" science fictions - from star trek, star wars, 2010, batman to iron man are equally full of gaping logical holes, mostly with no award-winning plot-craft.Truth is, ""hard"" science is evolving constantly, and science fiction flicks are not made to be 100% accurate or to win awards (if so Blade Runner still wins today), but to explore possibilities in highly-compressed scenarios, to inspire, to enlighten, and foremost, to entertain.In today's myopic, easily self-satisfied world which classifies and judges people by preconceived notions about ethnicity, gender, profession, appearance, merits, we are constantly divided by rigid specialization, subjective education qualification rules, redundant scientific dogmas, simplistic morality yardsticks, always under pressure to choose factions: With-Us-Or-Them, for or anti welfare/ abortion, JLaw-vs-Hathaway, Pepsi or Coke, the in-betweens be damned.Identity by Tribe (and inevitably the side-effect of xenophobia and authoritarianism) is a timely topic, how The Power That Be and their obedient citizenry react to the exceptional, multi-talented, multifaceted generalists who dare to defy categorization.And this is no Twilight. More Hunger Games meet Enders Game. Definitely gender-neutral in appeal, at least among under 30's. Not everything with strong female lead written by female authors equates Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Porter. Some ancient mindsets need to get used to the brave new world with the other half of the human population, women, being visible half of the time.The lead actors also defy categorization in their own way. Here's yet another hot young male lead who has brain and brawn and talent and emotional depth all rolled into one person...yet another intelligent and talented and cute young female lead who doesn't over-groom herself nor perpetually pout nor seem like she's out to please everyone or martyr herself. Does the world need more unaffected chicks and unassuming hunks? Of course, there's never enough of those on screen.Divergent may not be The Matrix or Inception grade, but why should it be. I was definitely engaged and entertained. Good enough for me.","49 out of 91 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An enjoyable franchise beginning that Woodley carries admirably.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2983147/?ref_=tt_urv","BrentHankins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14299499/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2014","Big budget adaptations of popular young adult novels have become the latest trend in Hollywood, with each major studio hoping to create the next Twilight or Hunger Games phenomenon. While many of these quick cash-in attempts have resulted in embarrassingly low box office returns, Summit Entertainment's Divergent, based on the bestselling novel by Veronica Roth, could very well be the proverbial ""next big thing.""In the future, society has been divided into five factions, each with a defining personality trait and a specific social role to fulfill. At the age of sixteen, each member submits to an aptitude test designed to guide them into choosing a permanent faction, but Tris (Shailene Woodley) is shocked to learn that she is ""divergent,"" showing equal aptitude for more than one faction. Not only is Divergence rare, but many consider it to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the delicate societal balance, and Divergents are routinely met with ""accidents"" that leave them in a body bag.In order to distance herself from her family members and keep them from discovering her secret, Tris elects to join the Dauntless faction, an elite group of warriors tasked with defending the city. But Dauntless training is more than she bargained for, with a hostile fellow recruit (Miles Teller) garnering an obscene amount of pleasure from pummeling her in the combat ring while faction leader Eric (Jai Courtney) nods his approval. She finds comfort and solace in Four (Theo James), who seems to understand much more about her than she chooses to reveal, and who might be her only hope for salvation.Divergent spends a hefty amount of time building its world and establishing its characters, and despite stilted dialogue that finds itself in dire need of a punch-up, the relationships still feel genuine and relatable. Woodley and James have palpable chemistry, while Teller and Courtney play their villainous roles with gleeful abandon. Kate Winslet also has an enjoyable turn as a sinister government official whose interactions with Woodley are chill-inducing - expect her to play a major role in the eventual sequel.Divergent is at its best when the action finally gets rolling, which admittedly takes awhile due to the colossal amount of exposition required. Woodley never quite looks comfortable throwing punches and wielding weaponry, but her talent and charisma do a nice job of balancing the scales, and she carries the film admirably. By the time the credits roll, audiences should be entranced by Tris and eager to follow her along to the next step of her adventure.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.Rating: 8/10 ""Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind.""","23 out of 39 found this helpful.

It was a good start for the franchise. One of the best things about the movie was Shailene Woodley performance, she was excellent as Tris, and you could feel her every emotion in her face but mainly in her big beautiful eyes. And although it wasn't as very well showcased in the beginning, you could see it flowing out of her in the final third act. Moreover, the story felt kind of bland at times and as if it never reached its high point, which sincerely kind of came in the end multiple times, which led the ending to miss great opportunities to end ambiguously exciting. Therefore, it had an interesting premise, that can eventually become more interesting as the movies progress, but meanwhile this movie covered what probably any other franchise would've done in one. This never felt as good as Twilight or even The Hunger Games, and it might need to work more with its characters, because I found it hard to relate to any of them, but it isn't that far behind of any of the previous movies.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Apparently, it stands for poor writing, poor directing, poor casting, and poor acting.Let's start with the poor writing. Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn't, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let's just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese. Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best. There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn't help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act. The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won't go any deeper, but just watch the so-called ""chemistry"" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I'm still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly. It just makes me so disappointed that this kind of budget goes to absolute waste because of these flaws I mentioned above. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of the books!","389 out of 676 found this helpful.

The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.Overall, a solid release.

Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don't belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she's Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It's something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is ""I don't buy this world."" Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don't buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It's not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did. An 8/10 for Divergent!","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

I watched this movie somewhat grudgingly. A YA novel adaptation set in a dystopian future with a highly structured society that the protagonist somehow does not fit into. She does her best to survive and meets a handsome guy in the process. Sounds like a plot that's been done and overdone in countless books targeted at teens. And it is. There are clichés throughout the movie but I still loved it.I'm not saying you are going to be completely blown away by the originality of the plot. I'm just saying that this formula works, as proved by the book's success, and the movie executes it well with a stellar cast and beautiful effects.Beatrice/Tris feels realistic and her reactions in the situations presented to her are believable. Four fills the role of mysterious male lead perfectly with aptly timed tidbits about his thoughts or past. For me, this was not well done in the book and I will be sticking to the movies only.Overall, a good movie for anyone as long as you don't mind being able to guess some parts before they happen.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neli Burger, Evan Daughterty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergents are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

As Tris, Shailene Woodley, will be forced to make complex choices about sacrifice, loyaly, courage, love
redemption and allegiance. This is a Science Fiction and drama film based on Veronica Roth novel. Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior : Shailene Woodley, lives in a destroyed city of Chicago, in a difficult society divided into factions and, nowadays, she searches answers on the ruins of the town. As each faction represents a diverse way of handling things. Candor are the honest. Erudite are the intelligent, in which her brother, Ansel Elgort, belongs. Abnegation the selfless, in which her parents : Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn belong. Amity the kind. And finally Dauntless the brave, in which Tris enlists herself after an extremely dangerous training . The Erudite led by Kate Winslet , have declared war against Abnegation because they think that they have essential information about Divergent. Then the Erudite scheme a massacre against Abnegation. Then, Tris unlocks secrets , uncovering horrible deeds and along with his partners and with the help from others on his side carry out a strong fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear their society apart. Tris takes desperate, disturbing choices, and makes difficult decissions to protect the ones she loves, and, finally, discovering the shocking truth.This first part contains thrills , chills , noisy action, high body-count , breathtaking state-of-art-special effects, enough characterization , and violent happenings . Here our starring Tris faces one impossible challenge after another, as she unreveals the truth about her past and, ultimately, the meaning of the strange and mysterious divergence, as well as the dark future on her sad world . The movie relies heavily on the long interrogatory with excessive use of machines, and abstract images on the dreams performed by Tris , as it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. It is followed by Insurgent 2015 by Rober Schewenke in which Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Octavia Spencer and meet the factionless and Four's, Theo James, mother : Naomi Watts. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement : Allegiant. Stars Shailene Woodley who gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet.The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alwin Kuchler. And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers. Well worth watching.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another.

There were issues I had with the book, and although I liked the books overall, there were many things that I didn't like about them.This movie I think is an excellent version, as many of the aspects that I found annoying or didn't like from the book are not included, or at least not focused on. To me this made the story that much better.The actors in the movie did a very good job, I found that both leads (Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior and Theo James as Four/Tobias) did excellent jobs in their roles. I was initially very hesitant, and didn't want to like them as they were not at all how I pictured the characters, but I am a complete convert. In fact, Theo James did his role so well that I honestly cannot picture that character in any other way except the way he portrayed it. Many of the supporting characters were superb in their small roles as well, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, and Tony Goldwyn, all stood out to me as being excellent in their roles. Some of the other actors I found a bit weak in their parts, but I also realize that might have been because they were not given enough screen time to actually build the nuances of their characters to portray them well.The cinematography and editing I thought was also very well done. I really liked the costume and set designs for this movie, and how well they reflected the factions. From the clothing to their homes, it was all very well thought out on how such a civilization would actually love.The script was also excellent. At no point did I want to role my eyes because it was too silly (which happens a lot with these YA books turned into movies), and it managed to keep you interested in what each character was saying.The story adaptation, again, was also very well done. I cannot think of any part they left out that I felt was absolutely necessary to include, they did very minor story changes, but I also realize that is because to include them would have meant they left an open ended story for viewers who hadn't read the books (which would be very annoying).Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I would highly advise anyone who has read the books to go see it, and if you drag your friends who haven't read the books they will enjoy it as well.","23 out of 40 found this helpful.

Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.Full Review:In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feelAll in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's no ""Hunger Games,"" but director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and writers Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and Vanessa Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first ""Hunger Games"" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of ""Divergent"" is far more complicated than ""Hunger Games,"" which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as ""Divergent"" does. Essentially, ""Divergent"" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.That said, ""Divergent"" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates.""Divergent"" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. ""The Hunger Games"" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, ""Divergent"" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way ""Hunger Games"" does.Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the ""Hunger Games"" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become ""Twilight"" or ""The Hunger Games."" It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than ""Twilight""), but ""Divergent"" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

I give it a 6 out of 10 stars. We all think that ""Hey!! This could be another series we could look forward to"" and this would be like the other successful series that have past. But I do not think so.Me and my siblings have a lot of side comments while we are watching the movie. I know this is in a dystopian era and we don't actually get the movie until the half of it. We don't understand why there should be factions and this looked a lot like Hunger Games. The blood thingy, where they choose the faction where they are going to be, another familiar scene... like in Harry Potter The Dauntless faction... they say they are not rebels and such... and this ""Dauntless faction"" reminds us of the Fire Nation in the Last Airbender.I mean, it is easy to get tired of these kinds of movies because they are very common now.And, Tris and Four?? Why the hell did we kissed? I mean, they just kissed and the romance went on... I mean, how did it happened so fast? There seemed to have no development between them through the course of the movie. Four is like this bully-turned-mentor guy who helped Tris throughout her stay in the Dauntless faction. And that's just it, I think I would like to see them as just mentor-student as for now. They should've skipped the ""love story"" for the next installment.I liked the whole concept really, but I think it is just redundant. Like we've already seen and heard this kind of story.I am really intrigued with this story and wanted to read the whole book series... but after seeing this movie. I just don't think that I would want to read it anymore.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I absolutely loved Neil Burger's Limitless, so I was really hoping that he was going to not inflict too much pain on me here. Fortunately for me, and very happily for my daughter, Mr Burger has delivered a solid film that, while it doesn't shatter any expectations, does a nice job of bringing the material to life.Divergent's strongest elements are the wonderfully actualized setting of post-apocalyptic Chicago, and the strength of the varied cast, particularly our young leads. Woodley and James do admirable work as the Heroine and Hero of the film, and I think there is some legitimate chemistry between these two. Burger does a nice job of understating things early on, but showcasing a growing bond between the two as the film progresses.There are some truly great moments on screen throughout. Divergent could have been an utter bomb with the amount of personal soul-searching that goes on, but through an admirable combination of pacing, character development, and fine detailed world building, Divergent never gets too preachy for its own good.There are a few weak moments here and there. The film definitely has a bit of bad-guy monologuing, and you have to wonder where the hell the scene that defined some nefarious back room dealings was, particularly with the star power in this movie. Some exposition at the end is a little uninspiring, and some of the plot is not what one would call a twist.Rough spots aside, the great moments well outweigh the bad. The movie also really steers away from any kind of brutal violence of any kind, as this is easily one of the best PG-13 movies I could recommend for parents in ages. In addition, Woodley's Tris is a wonderful heroine for girls. Tough, complicated, smart, and she doesn't give up.Go ahead and take the family to this one, you won't be disappointed. It may not win best picture in 2014, but Divergent delivers where it needs to and is definitely entertaining.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you liked the sparkling vampires of Twilight you will probably like this snoozefest, but if you are like me, and not a 15 year old girl, take my advice and pass.It's a bad story that's poorly acted. There is no chemistry between the leads, and no connection with them to the audience. It's just hard to care about them. The plot is thin and easy to figure out in the first twenty minutes or so, and the twist, if it deserves that description, will catch no one by surprise. I actually feel a little dumber after watching this movie. I've also lost a little more faith in hollywoods ability to make original and entertaining movies. I see this movie was based on a book. I would hope the book isn't as bad as the movie. If so, whoever read the book and thought ""What a great book! This should be a movie!"" and actually followed through on that thought needs to find a new line of work.

The difference is in the character development and plot, something neither actress could do anything about.Woodley is as engaging as the rest of the cast that includes Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Ray Stevenson. Woodley, who looks like she could be Lawrence's sister, was seriously considered for The Hunger Games, and was expected to have the lead in Catching Fire, but Lawrence made it back. Catching Fire has a more decipherable plot than The Hunger Games. Woodley's ""Tris"" in Divergent is as wonderful as Lawrence's character, ""Katniss."" It's easy to love them both.Divergent, a young adult book transferred to film, is as entertaining as any following the dystopian trend that includes The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire. For adults who enjoyed those films, then Divergent does it one better. Not that The Hunger Games was not a good film; it was done very well. However; the society and logic for the games don't work for all some of us reality-thinking adults.If we were thinking on a broader scale, we might ask a lot of questions if we wanted to, but we don't. These films, including Divergent, based on young adult books, are voyeuristic in that they involve prying observation of ""our own children"" represented on screen. We want to see our children brave, heroic and caring. We'd like them to save the world we messed up. For grown-ups, Divergent and The Hunger Games are still vicarious thrills. We love watching the young win--even it is against others the same age. As long as those hurt or killed are deserving (meaning bad guys) or going to kill the good guys.What makes Divergent different from the rest (and I don't pretend to know all the films made or being made in this vein today) is that the scene is on a larger scale and the young are entry-level to the scene. Their journey is just beginning. Grown-ups have already screwed things up by dividing society by its values. Evil has the usual melodramatic pervasiveness in these films; there is always a villain to make what seems to be a good plan (the world as it is presented to us) even better.That said, Divergent is a decent science fiction film that teaches a lesson to society--or by direct consumption-- teenagers in the world. Teens have questions about who they are or who they should. They questions their actions and reactions constantly. Unlike utopias that portray a perfect world, dystopias portray a world in need. Teenagers, needy or not, can identify with a world in need. The audience or reader sees the distorted world vision, but the characters--the society does not. To be dramatic, most dystopian science fiction we see on film is usually so dark and so grim as to be unrealistic. Most of the world is destroyed by war either among themselves or by aliens.Good science fiction tackles what we should or shouldn't do as a society when it comes to science or technology. And, especially for film, I think it helps to have a positive ending.","21 out of 37 found this helpful.

Many people watch movies just because they have been adapted from great books but I don't believe a film should rely on a great novel. This movie is poorly executed and could have been so much better. There are striking similarities to 'The Hunger Games' but there is no comparison to how well 'The Hunger Games' has been made and the exceptional performance of 'Jennifer Lawrence'. In contrast 'Divergent', which also featured a futuristic society governed by a strict regime with numerous divisions, is not convincing and none of the characters are strong enough for the viewer to care about them. The movie seems to end up becoming a teenage romance tale and the climax is confusing and dull. Even the main theme of being a 'Divergent' is not explored or really explained, maybe this has been reserved for a sequel. However based on this movie, I definitely won't bother with any follow up movies.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And, worth it is, quite a lot, going by the terrific 2 hour 10 minutes ride you get through the stark dystopian landscape of ""Divergent"". What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about ""Divergent"" is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as ""The Illusionist"" (2006), ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008), and ""Limitless"" (2011)). Alwin H. Küchler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.""Divergent"" not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. ""Divergent"" is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

For the most part they stayed very true to the book, with the exception of a few parts. I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book over five times and I was very impressed with the movie. When I first heard that Shailene Woodley had the role of Tris, I was worried, but she did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Veronica Roth seemed happy with the outcome and I think that's because she knew that they couldn't do everything exactly as she wrote it.

To me, it seemed that important parts were missing and random things added. Peter came off as a light hearted jerk instead of a dangerous sociopath and Four just happened to suddenly like Tris. These were important things to develop. Instead, time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end??? It wasn't just the deviation from the book. I saw this movie with a Divergent-virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over. He felt lost and confused. I understand when movies are changed because the book just doesn't play out but that did not appear to be the case.This was very disappointing and I frankly expected more with Roth being part of the production team.","70 out of 134 found this helpful.

Telling them to be brave, to be diversified. It's telling them to have many interests, and aspects to one's self. And that is a good thing. As a film, it was fine. The action was okay, the pace was okay, the characters and actors were fine. In my time, gender roles were very strict. Girls didn't do boy things; and boys didn't do girl things. I think the author of the story is trying to say that people are diversified. They are divergent. In the story, the leaders feared diversity; because it is harder to control. So they doubled down. But maybe if people were allowed to be free, they wouldn't be so mean.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They seem to miss that the world depicted is a high school, seen from the perspective of a typical student. Nobody seems to work; everybody is learning. Teachers have complete authority, with the kids making limited and largely uninformed choices. Their prospects are largely ""becoming a successful member of society"" or ""failing and becoming a hobo"". Bullying and suicide are real issues.In ""Divergent"", society is organized based on a faction system: factions stand for many things, including castes, professions, traits of character, rites of passage, dress codes... But most of all, they represent the cliques that form in high school: the cool kids (dauntless), the nerds (erudite), the hippies (amity). Due to this, the relevance of the factions for society is a bit bogus; for example, as many reviewers have noted, the Dauntless would make terrible cops or soldiers... But that is besides the point! The dauntless are merely the cool kids, complete with bullies, hot guys, hot girls, extreme sports, and excessive drama.While belonging to these cliques, most real-world teenagers also feel that they are unique snowflakes. Pretty much every real person felt that way as a teenager; but teenagers are not yet aware of that. In the movie, the unique snowflakes are called ""divergents"": people who do not fully belong in any clique, who are a bit more than a stereotype. Obviously, the heroine and her boyfriend are ""divergents"", unlike ""99%"" of other characters, who are just sheep within their respective cliques.All in all, this is merely a teenage fantasy. The heroin has doubts about who she is, where she belongs; she succeeds in becoming one of the cool kids; she finds a boyfriend; and at the same time, she retains her ""incredibly unique"" personality. And we confidently expect her to go on to become a successful revolutionary, changing the world for the better, and fulfilling the entire fantasy, acquiring fame and social status in the process.It is easy to see why this was successful with its target audience. Watch it if you want a high school flick set in the future, with some added fist- and gun-fights; don't watch it if you want serious sci-fi. To enjoy it at all, you have to see this movie for what it really is. As a 29 year old man, I found it amusing. I ended up caring for the characters despite their stereotypical personalities and had a good time. 6/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie plays with the theme that society tries to force us into a specific box when we really wish we were free to do many different things with our lives. The story exaggerates this theme by reducing people to five different personality types. Once they reach adulthood, all people are forced to choose and live by one set of rules only. The main character, Tris, does not fit conveniently into any one type so she is considered dangerous because she cannot be controlled. Even though this is being compared to Hunger Games (young people in combat in a dystopian future), it is actually completely different. Only the setting is the same. There were a few minor details that could have been corrected. This is a must watch for any fans of Sci-Fi, action, or even if you just like to see a female in a lead role. Loved it.

Not just in the storyline, but even in the way and the style that it is filmed. I do wonder, however, whether it might not have been better received it had been released first?I don't personally think that Shailene Woodley was the best choice as the lead, although I haven't read the books yet to say that she isn't a good version of the author's character.Theo James is not only handsome, but he plays his part well and although he's annoying, so does Miles Teller. I think that perhaps if the film hadn't been so rushed, we would have seen more of them both. Having said that, I did struggle to tell some of the male characters apart.There are times when I found the violence to be a bit much. I will never understand why some military branches feel the need to beat the strength out of people. Everyone has a place, it might just be admin or Medicine instead of fighting.It's not a bad story, it's just one we already know. It's a shame that there are so many of a similar ilk out there now. They may have all shined individually if they hadn't all come at once, but it's fairly obvious what will happen, because in one way or another, we've seen it all before.I have to say though, that I think this is Kate Winslet's best performance yet.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Review of the Script of Divergent","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189767/?ref_=tt_urv","alukhar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58841783/?ref_=tt_urv","23 February 2015","Imagine living in a futuristic society where all life is divided into five factions based on virtues, and everyone must fit into exactly one of these five factions or their lives are at stake. This scenario presents exactly the basis for the movie Divergent, a film version of author Veronica Roth's novel. The film follows an adolescent girl named Tris Prior on her adventure of growth and survival in a dystopian society. Each year there is a ""Choosing Ceremony"" in which all children who have turned sixteen must choose which faction they will spend the rest of their lives in. In an extremely difficult decision, Tris finds herself in the faction she will call home, fighting for a place to become an officially initiated member. When Tris finds out that she is what the leaders of society call ""Divergent,"" it is evident that she cannot be controlled or fit into just one faction. This discovery means that Tris must fight for her life as the leaders of society hunt down and attempt to kill all Divergents, who threaten the faction system. While the story line of the novel written by Roth proves brilliantly entertaining and catches the attention of readers, the movie script seems to lack the zeal with which the story was originally written. The script for the movie Divergent destroys the entertaining, suspenseful, and emotionally endearing story line originally created by Veronica Roth in her novel. Divergent's movie script fails to develop important emotional aspects of the story that are crucial to very plot and development it. The story is virtually all about identity and the development of one's self. And the people that appear in Tris's life play a huge role in her development and growth into adulthood. Unfortunately, the characters presented in the movie are incredibly underdeveloped and their impact on Tris's life is nearly impossible to fully see. As Christy Lemire said in her published review of Divergent on the Roger Ebert Memoriam Website, ""the supporting figures who had identifiable personalities in the book mostly blend into the background in the movie."" This tragedy can be very well seen through many characters, but most importantly through one specific antagonist to Tris. The character of Peter in the movie appears to be a background figure, one of Tris's competitors for a spot in her faction. He comes off as sarcastic, fairly mean, and sometimes even funny. However, in the original story presented through Roth's novel, Peter is evil. There is certainly no better word to describe him other than evil. As Tris's arch nemesis, he attacks her physically and verbally any chance he gets. Many mean remarks directed at Tris leave his mouth, but not one of them could be described as remotely funny. He even goes to the length of stabbing a fellow initiate in the eye with a butter knife during the night just to knock out his biggest competition. He touches Tris inappropriately before trying to kill her, which scars her permanently. Peter is portrayed as almost a completely different character in the movie compared to his true self in the book. This lack of development of his character along with others proves to take out a large emotional influence important to the story. The script lacks ways in which the truth behind many characters could come out, and this contributes to the detriment of emotional development in the story. Not only does the script for Divergent contribute to the lack of character and emotional advancement, but it also contributes to the weakness in entertaining and attention-holding abilities of the movie. ABC News put out a review by David Blaustein claiming that ""Divergent is a mildly entertaining movie that only succeeds because of its talented cast."" First of all, most of the movie is consumed by long hours for Tris and the other initiates training and completing activities to earn their place in the faction. This training consumes over half the movie and easily loses the attention of the viewers. Secondly, due to the fact that characters are underdeveloped, relationships are also underdeveloped. The core relationship between Tris and her love interest, Four, develops through many encounters and complications in Roth's novel; however, in the movie it remains a surface level relationship that develops quickly. The lack of complexity to the relationship in the movie causes a lack of attachment from viewers to the movie. Like Blaustein stated, the movie only overcomes the lack of relationships and entertainment through the sheer talent of the actors. Overall, Divergent succeeded in the movie business, making thousands of dollars in profit. However, the movie itself is ultimately a failure. It did not successfully portray the thought provoking, emotionally endearing, and attention- grabbing story originally written by Veronica Roth in her novel. Although the movie basically followed the plot of the story, it removed the important relationships and characters that were developed in the book and that were essential to the success of the story. The movie script dissected the brilliant novel written by Roth and took out parts that gave the story the emotional depth it needed to reach its full potential. As the most important thing that makes up a movie, the script of Divergent damages the movie itself and weakens the overall success of the film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Katniss is a born - if not reluctant- leader where Tris, our Divergent heroine is more milquetoast. Just like The Maze Runner, the first movie in the series is the best and the last, kinda sucks. Practically the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen and for this era, the CGI is pretty basic. I like a Dystopian YA stuff and really wanted to like this series but it's never more than ok. In THG you cannot help but cheer for Katniss, really feel her pain but with Tris is like whatev.

The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neil Burger, Evan Daugherty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergent are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think the first time I heard about this flick was when I went to see Beautiful Creatures, which is also based on a bestselling novel. I first herd of that movie when I went to see the Host, which if I'm not mistaken is also based on a bestselling novel. You get the idea. It's good to hear that young girls are reading novels.Though these movies are for young girls mostly, I do get a kick out of them. After all, most of them are centered on some super natural creatures or have a large Sci-Fi theme. This movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, which was visually awesome by the way. A War broke out about a 100 years ago, and In order to bring back order in a world fallen apart, the society sectioned off its people into 5 Fractions and when a child is old enough, they take a test to decided which fraction they actually belong too. Most people go back to the fractions they were born into with very few being chosen for a different Fraction, However in the case of the main character Beatrice, the test were not conclusive, meaning she would not fit into any Fraction. The people of this world refer to this as Divergent and being such is not good. The movie screams the message for young girls to grow up and be what they want to be, especially with the plot of Beatrice, who was born into a Fraction of mostly boring framers, choosing to join the fraction of really, really enthusiastic Law Enforcers. Although I can't help but to point out the similarities in this movie to The Hunger Games, and I must admit, though I find Beatrice who becomes Tris when she joins the Dauntless fraction, warmer than Katniss Everdeen, I realize if I have a Choice, I prefer my female protagonist tougher . There were way too many times in the movie that Tris' boy toy, Four, one of the leaders and trainers of the Dauntless, had to come to her rescue. In all fairness, this may have something to do with the fact that unlike most Super heroines that have been exploiting the big screen lately, Tris has no love triangle. She has 5 chooses to where her life will go, but only one choice in men. Maybe in the Sequel?The movie has a pretty well-known cast. Some people I knew by name like Miles Teller, who co-stared in the Spectacular Now, with Shailene Woodley, who played Tris. I felt a little sorry for the guy as he had a chance to grow in this movie outside of being type cast the sarcastic easy going best friend thing he's been doing in a lot of flicks, but it did not happen. Zoe Kravitz, who plays Tris BBF, taking after her father Lenny Kravitz, who is in the Hunger Games. Ashley Judd, who has a small but important role as Tris' mother and Naomi Watts who put on a little weight since the last time I've seen her, but still looks hot. Then their where a few faces that seem to float around the teen to young adult movies. The movie does a good job in appealing to a lot of people. Its starts as a dramatic film focusing greatly on the society these people live in, which I found unique in a movie of this caliber, but they give you a nice helping of action as well.It was a good choice for a movie to see, but I like hunger games better.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose?

The names should give you an idea of what direction the people are led into. Erudite, Candor, Amity, Abegnation, and the warrior caste Dauntless. It's this caste that is the defender of the established order. Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into. Also note Kate Winslet who is one of the subverters.Divergent is a nice if not entirely successful portrait of a futuristic society.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Then he says they are not propaganda in the usual sense of the word but rather propaganda in the service of ""individualism."" Individualism, according to O'Hehir, is the central idea behind consumer capitalism and is the bogey man we are all to fear. This is rubbish. I would suggest that going from a young woman's view of present day society as a glorified high school drama about not fitting as is the case with ""Divergent"" to political agitprop is a dangerous leap and a bit of a stretch. O'hehir goes on to say that we must accept the premise that all imagined worlds of the future must be about the present; a dubious conjecture at best. Where, he asks, are the fascist forces demanding conformity? Where is the segregation of society to be found? Where is the regimentation that we see depicted these movies? Is he serious? One just has to open one's eyes and look around to see plenty. Look at the paramilitary swat teams that have grown up in so many cities across America. Look at the spying on citizens that goes on by the NSA, Facebook, and Google. The pressure to conform has never been greater. Society is most certainly segmented into strata and classes. From the highest to the lowest, by race and by gender. And let's not forget about the struggles of the LBGT community. In the workplace, if you don't conform you are out. I would argue that the oppressive societies shown in the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are in fact allegorical to our present day times. They are cautionary tales as to what the future may hold. The central message presented by ""Divergent"" is to beware of labeling or ""pigeon holing"" people based on personality traits or some form of arbitrary and rigid caste system that offers no upward or lateral mobility.The place where I would agree with O'Hehir is that ""Divergent,"" while entertaining, was unsophisticated and simplistic. But what do you expect? It was based on the first of a series of novels written by a young woman geared for a young adult audience. I was willing to suspend my disbelief for a well- intentioned, well made, good effort that had much to offer including a strong female lead that was empowering to her and presented a good role model for other girls to follow. This, I think, is a good trend. If you want to see real capitalist agitprop, check out Howard Roark's speech in The Fountain Head, a movie based on the Ayn Rand novel of the same name. In this speech you can catch a glimpse the ideology of the individual versus the collective that O'Hehir is so agitated about.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many of you claimed that it is really similar to the hunger games. Well... yes and no. Divergent is stupider.First of all : the credits are still rolling and I don't know why there was a war and why dividing people into five district... I mean factions is gonna help maintaining peace. This is BS. No explanations, nothing. And we meet our lead character Kat... I mean Tris (notice how Katniss and Tris sound similar) played by Shailene Woodley. And for me, this is the first mistake they made in this movie. Woodley... I just don't like her. Her voice, her face, everything.But the crap really hits the fan when you learn that not only is she divergent but that this is something rare... How ? I mean, have you ever been 16 and not knowing what you wanted to be when you grow up or is everybody in this lousy version of Chicago conditioned or something ? I call BS on this part. Being divergent is not something rare especially at the age the characters are. It's not, and this is why the movie makes little sense.2nd problem : the factions. How does it maintain peace to restraint people to one single way of living for the rest of their lives ? And what about the faction-less (or homeless. It's literally the same thing) people ? They don't care about their fate ? They don't want abundant food and a home ? I mean, they can build a giant wall but can't feed the poor ? How perfect is that ?3rd problem : choosing a faction is nonsense. They don't even get to ""try"" them. If factions really have to fit who they are, they should be able to walk in their shoes for at least 48h each. Instead, they are giving a false choice : either you stay home safe or you explore the unknown with the risk of being kicked out. Concretely : it would not maintain peace IRL.Final major problem : The chemistry between Tris and Four is fake. In one of the early scenes of the movie, Four gives her the most beautiful, powerful middle finger ever : ""What makes you think you can talk to me ?"" And she doesn't seem to remember it afterwards, and worst of all, they don't share that much special moments in the movie. Their love seems forced by the circumstances.So, the plot is nonsense, the character development is poor, and so is the acting. I haven't talked about the action sequences at all, but trust me, it's not worth mentioning. Finally, the climax is... unexpectedly bad and makes little sense. I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free so go watch it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went and was very impressed, the acting was good, very cool storyline, and the movie was carried out very well and really got you involved with the story. Everybody kept saying how Shailene Woodley and Theo James were a good duo who connected well, and this movie was is really worth seeing. It was long, but it really did not feel as long as it was, they fit just the right amount of storyline into the length they made it, and the supporting characters did a good job too. If you're looking for a good time, check it out, a lot better than you would think.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film is now my number 1 favorite film of 2014 so far. It has beaten the new 300 film, Paranormal Acitvity: TMO, TWOWS and Non-Stop. Here is why:It has an brilliant and breathtaking storyline packed with romance, violence and some pretty mind bending scenes.It is centred around a girl who must chose a faction to live in as after a great war, a city is divided into factions (Kind of like The Hunger Games) and when their time comes they are tested to see what faction to join. She joins a faction of elite sort of peacekeepers but soon realises that it has now become a fight for survival.It had some of the most tense scenes I have seen in a long time and at times I cheered for certain parts of the movie.However; this is more of a teen movie, so adults may be a little disappointed with this movie. But I recommend to anyone who is a fan of the sci fi genre or fans of a deep story with shocking plot twists.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

So let's talk about the movie... Of course not all the contents in a book can be displayed in a movie but still it was well-interpreted according to me and I really loved the movie. Shailene Woodley and Theo James were great as Tris and Four. They played their characters up to the level. Theo James was perfect as Four. He is such a good actor and I just loved his acting in Divergent. There could not be a better actor to play the role of Four. Theo was amazing and perfect just as in the book. Certain people will not like the movie or compare it to the Hunger games but truly speaking though it's a dsytopian movie as the Hunger games, Divergent has a different storyline and is simply awesome to watch. They took some difficult scenarios from the books which were very well shown in the movie.I would highly recommend people to watch Divergent. I can't wait to watch the sequel. Amazing movie.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Based on the popular YA novel, Divergent mimics others of its ilk in terms of it hierarchical society and puerile romance; however, it deviates from the pack when it comes to its higher caliber of acting and directing.Incidentally, allotment in any setting - apocalyptic or not - is usually by someone's race.

I didn't know much about it but was hoping for it to be a fun movie. I waited patiently for what had to be around 3 hours for the plot to pick up and get interesting. I checked my watch and alas only about 30 minutes had actually elapsed and to my further dismay the movie never did get interesting and the plot remained rather lack luster.I usually love movies set in a dystopia, but this one was on par with watching paint dry. The acting was average and that's being very generous. The action was weak. The plot was weaker. The romance forced. The characters were flat.Also try not to laugh when Tris yells ""stop it"" to the bad guys during a scene that isn't suppose to be funny yet you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is. I kid you not, she basically calls for a time out while getting shot at... yeah it's a wonderful movie.

I will say that it's not complete crap like some of the Hollywood films based on teen books are, so perhaps thats why I kind of want to go easy on it. It's good to see some effort being put into a film. Comparing this to say, The Hunger Games, perhaps is why I was left a little underwhelmed, because I think the first Hunger Games was not bad, and then Catching Fire ended up really impressing me. I kind of hope that since this film is the first in a series, the next will take what was interesting in this and bring it to the fore front. It certainly has potential to be a good series, but it's off to a slightly rocky start.One of the stronger aspects of this film is Shailene Woodleys performance. She is a really strong actor and the film benefits from putting someone with skill in the lead role as opposed to the usual ""pretty but terrible actress"" kind of girls they usually put in these kind of roles. The rest of the performances we're okay. No real stand outs but they work for the most part. The plot is another strength that works. It's about a society where young adults are sorted into different factions based on skills and it's a very stressful process. But what's great is that it is clearly a metaphor for the modern day process of pressuring young adults into university and making them make these big choices that affect the rest of their lives. I have always found issue in the way society does this ever since I started high school, and I think it's interesting to see that concept in this film. It kind of works, and I will give it credit for handling a subject that can be quite relate-able for many young people today.Overall, the films strengths come from it's concepts and it's potential to improve in future sequels. As a person who likes film in general, I will always be positive about movies and I do hope they can smooth out the next film and make it something great. I would be really happy to see the sequel be something great, similar to how Catching Fire improved on The Hunger Games dramatically.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was quite impressed with this movie! Im surprised actually. I've recently watched Vampire Academy which is probably the most shameful and horrific adaptation of a damn good book I have ever seen. Anyway, so I wasn't holding up much hope for this film. But instead I come out of surprised and having enjoyed my experience in the Divergent world. Obviously in the books you get a deeper back story and deeper insight into their lives, so I understand that in the film there is going to be some lacking of both, it's pretty understandable as you cant get everything in. The acting was great, I saw a few familiar faces in Shailene and Theo, as well as a fellow TFIOS actor Ansel. The main cast were fantastic. I'd never seen Shailene before and wow she blew me away, she was great. Its not as testing as her role in TFIOS for obvious reasons but perhaps it test her in different ways (physically). She was pretty badass in this. As for Theo I've seen him in a few others and I think in this he really impressed me, as he did in A Passionate Woman. A lot of people are saying he's not right for the role but seeing as I haven't read the books I have no idea what he was meant to be like, so I'm reviewing his performance in this rather than in comparison to how he should be. Emotion wise this film built up to that and it was emotional at times. I liked that they didn't focus too much on the relationship (come on guys it's pretty obvious it was gonna happen). I have a few downsides however. The CG wasn't very good, not realistic enough. I felt like I was in a game like Beyond Two Souls or The Last of Us. It wasn't very real, you could tell it was CG. In the beginning with all the people walking into the city was just ridiculously bad, like I was playing Sims 3. And the other issue I had was with the story line, which isn't the fault of the movie writers but of the author. I saw too many obvious similarities to books like The Hunger Games and The Vampire Academy. I'll giver her this, it's difficult to be original nowadays but there were some things so obviously the same as stories before hers. But other than that, fantastic film and worth a watch.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It doesn't contain a single original idea... None at all. Totally boring, predictable, dumb, and even the basic premise of the story is unconvincing to start with. This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have. Even on a theoretical level, it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it. They want people to rigidly adhere to a one-dimensional category (I'm smart, I'm considerate, I'm fierce, I'm honest, etc.) and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose? You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once, you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self-determination. So even the basic concept of the story is flawed, and no matter how good your structure is, if it isn't built on a good solid foundation, the whole thing will crumble. Take a look at the society in Brave New World, now that's hard to challenge, it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

By their ability to obey human commands and perform their predefined roles. In many ways, in muggle or wizard world, this quality of every entity doing their predefined role is man's vision of a perfect society. However, it is in human nature to sacrifice altruism over ambition, and hence the only two factions that will stand the test of time are the oppressed and the oppressor.Divergent is the latest movie adaption of yet another young adult dystopian novel by the same name, written by Veronica Roth. Typical of the genre, it explores themes such as friendship, love, relationship with families and authority figures, diversity and socioeconomic status through a young lead character, Tris Prior, played by Shailene Woodley.""Faction before blood""Sometime in the future, society in Chicago is divided into five factions- Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave), based on their personalities. Much like the sorting hat, young 16 year old citizens have to undergo a test that defines their fit. While most conform to these factions, there are a few who display characteristics of all the five factions, called Divergents. These folks can think independently, and not according to pre defined norms, which makes them a threat to the social order government, so are usually terminated. Tris is born in an Abnegation family, but her results show that she is a divergent, and to stay alive she chooses Dauntless. And why not. In a slew of drab, the fearless, military faction members are uber chic- get to wear snazzy black, put on cool tattoos, fight peek-a-boo style and get to jump on and off running trains. The initiation and trainings in this faction are severe tests of strength, conviction and courage. All is not well though, as the Erudites and the Dauntless leadership collude to bring down the rule of the Abnegation, leading to a final showdown as Tris struggles to fight for her parents. While the movie by itself is reasonably good, there is a feeling of deja vu. The success of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and the Twilight Saga have led to film producers treating young adult fiction movies like stones thrown in the dark, hoping for a hit. There has been more misses than hits. The hits managed to transcend its audience, from young adults to adults. While the film adaptations of the misses- such as The Host, The Mortal Instruments, The Golden Compass, Percy Jackson were made in a way that they appealed to only their fan base.My feelings after watching Divergent were mixed. The good is that it largely eschews spectacle for substance. Considerable amount of time given to develop the characters, and their motives. There is no shortage of grit- the characters embrace the violence gratuitously. But the script is utterly predictable, and that is kind of sad for a movie that is all about being different. No wonder Shailene Woodley is so talked about these days. When she smiles, she lights up the screen. Pity though the script allows her to do it so little. Also, since this is a trilogy, director Neil Burger stays away from giving us three climaxes (one in each movie), rather keeps setting up things for subsequent films, which makes the ending of this movie a bit non entertaining. Strictly popcorn fare. Fans will love it though- 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Many people compare this with The Hunger Games.But this movie is different.I am the one who read the book before and I think the movie make my imagination real.The movies make me excited even I has known the end.

"6","/10","This movie is enjoyable, but the structure of its own plot prevents Divergent from a worthy watch.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2983825/?ref_=tt_urv","WheelzFourReelz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51074827/?ref_=tt_urv","21 March 2014","Divergent is based on the popular teen novel by Veronica Roth about a post-apocalyptic society where everyone is divided into factions based on what trait the have, be it bravery, kindness, selflessness, etc. I have read the book and I will be honest; I was not a huge fan of it. I thought it was good, but there was some things wrong with the story that I couldn't look past. But we aren't here to talk about that, are we? I wasn't originally wanting to see Divergent, but my mom wanted to, so I decided to watch it. After watching the movie, I can safely say that it's alright. I'm going to start this review with what I liked about the movie. First off, the acting. I thought everyone in this movie did a good job. Shailene Woodley did a good job as Tris, Kate Winslet did a good job as Jeanine, Theo James surprised me with his performance as Four. In my opinion, the person who stole the show was Jai Courtney as Eric. He did a fantastic job being a menace. I also thought the action was cool. It was fast paced, intense, and had guns. Lots and lots of guns. The only thing I didn't like about the action was that it took so long to get there. All the action-y stuff happened with about 20 minutes left in the movie. Not that it was a necessarily bad thing. Seeing all the initiates go through training was pretty cool. This movie, as well as the book, just has an interesting premise. An entire world that's divided into colonies defined by their attributes is just cool. It may be borrowing a little too much from The Hunger Games, but I don't mind. Now I must talk about what I didn't like. First is, actually, the romantic relationship between Tris and Four. I know! Criticize me all you want, but it's my opinion! I felt like their romantic relationship felt unnecessary and almost out of place. This was, in fact, one of my biggest complaints about the book. Look, I think romance in movies and books are just fine. In some cases, they're actually done very well. This one just didn't click with me. Another complaint was that this movie seriously lacked tension until the last 20 minutes or so. Characters get into the life threatening situations, but for most of the time, I didn't feel tense or worried at all. I will admit is that part of it is because I read the book, but that doesn't really matter. The movie is pretty predictable and you can expect what's going to happen next and how they will get out of the situation. You may feel tense in these moments, but I didn't have that feeling, which kind of bummed me out. While I didn't love the book, one of the things I enjoyed was that it had really tense moments. The movie seemed to butcher those moments, in my eyes. The movie's biggest problem is how it handles the source material. Don't get me wrong, it follows the book pretty well. It's how the movie uses the source material that is the fault. This movie zips by important plot points way too fast, leaving you with a ""wait, what?"" or a ""well that just happened"" mentality. It goes too fast for you to actually care about what's at stake. I may have a lot to criticize, but Divergent is still a decently enjoyable movie. It's worth a watch, but I wouldn't go full price. See if you can go on a matinée or rent the movie off of RedBox. It is not as good as the book, but the movie is good enough to get some enjoyment. And I hope Shailene Woodley goes far in her acting career. She is very good and I have a feeling you will be seeing more of her very soon.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Divergent is the most pure and honest movie based on a book I have ever seen. It does not remove almost any important scenes from the book and yet it still stitches the whole thing together to fit perfectly, and beautifully. It does this so well, that companions who haven't read the book still understand everything. It also made my friends want to read it; and though some of them did not want to start from the first book since they saw the movie, they started from the second and have not encountered parts which they did not understand. This is because the movie is so well made that they did not leave out anything in production, like most big production companies do. Divergent has action, adventure, romance, comedy, mystery, etc. It is the perfect movie to me. The actors are fantastic, and Shailene Woodley and Theo James rock the roles of Tris and Four in perfect unison. Divergent brings fans wildest imaginations to life, and flies the words of the book of it's pages.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

For Divergent, it was four. (Four! Really!) It's not boring, exactly. It's justmeh. Despite the exciting music, high-value production and characters that pant and strain and STARE intensely, there just isn't much to go on here. The book was better because it had WORDS, and Veronica Roth is a pretty good writer (unlike certain other dystopian blockbuster authors I could think of). The movie exposes the story's basic weaknesses: a paper-thin premise and too few interesting characters (when one dies I can't even remember which one it was.) Moreover, we've seen this storyline so often before that we can practically write it ourselves. But Divergent delivers in some important areas: A-list actors, a kick-ass teen male hero (with beautiful tattoos!), some pretty cool action sequences, a great soundtrack, and Shailene Woodley, one of the few young actresses who really can carry a movie by herself. Four, of course, is practically perfect in every way: teen boys, if you want to know what girls want, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Just grow muscles, have an old-fashioned sense of honor, be protective but don't be a chauvinist, be good at EVERYTHING but also have a deep psychological wound that a girl can help you overcome. Simple.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And I just don't tell myself that, it actually seems vaguely similar to something I wrote years ago on an exam. Welcome to a world where all the guys look strangely familiar and have forgettable names. Apparently there has been some sort of war that almost wiped out humanity. A small part of the population has however managed to seal Chicago off. The founding fathers of this society has clearly been reading up on dystopia and has come to a conclusion that Hunger Games is the way to go. Only smaller. This is all acted out where plot holes are blatantly overlooked and the identity of a character really isn't that big a deal.Suffering from a lot of vibes similar to that of the vastly inferior first Hunger Games movie. One can see a movie going for the same social commentary void of the core originality. The originality was also lacking, although not to the same degree, in the aforementioned film. This obviously isn't to much of a problem seeing as how it's really not THAT similar in the way the movie gets the message across, but there are very similar traits to this film and you can draw some lines that would be hard to credit for being original. As I haven't read the book i can't say if that's something to blame on the author of the book or the writers working on the screenplay. To me it seems like whoever was in charge of what was going on towards the end of the film got a bit sick of working on this. There are scenes in this movie where you may find the dialogue laughable or spine-tingling and cringeworhty. This goes for the story as well, when you're not able to tell where this movie is headed it takes a turn for the worse. However, don't worry, the guy next to me proved that predicting this movie from start to end isn't really an achievement. I'm not gonna say that the acting was terrible, but it had it's definitive weak moments. Towards the end, and I don't think this will surprise anyone, there is a crying scene. It may actually be one of the most annoying moments I've ever seen on the silver screen or on any screen for that matter. I could go on pointing everything that is wrong with this movie, but i won't. There are redeeming factors to this movie. I think the cinematography has some shining moments, maybe with a bitter aftertaste of pretentiousness. Anyone familiar with the musical works of Woodkid will know that his music has cinematic traits as a result of several years behind the camera, which I personally think is great. It really goes along well with this trendy and ""not-so-dark-dystopian"" world. Ultimately it seems like a mix of Equilibrium and, as i already have mentioned to the point where it becomes boring(much like the message of this movie) The Hunger Games. You take the mush, cover it in 100$ bills, add a relatable teenage identity crisis, some predictable romance and overthrowing of a government and you have yourself a hit, at least among the younger generation. Clearly though they haven't gotten it all wrong. My younger sister at the age of 16, seemed to think much better of this film. Hmmm... Go figure.","19 out of 37 found this helpful.

However, do not confuse him with a cold-hearted man that just learned not to care, he has a heart that can warm you up in the coldest situations, if that's what you really need, cause most of the time he will give you tough love. So, not the easiest character to bring to life, to say the least. Unfortunately I cannot say that the movie has done a well enough job at introducing us to this character or making his story have as strong of an impact on the viewer as it had on the reader, as a viewer you probably won't feel the admiration or respect that character really had. However, as someone already 'knowing' what he was like, I'll have to say that, to my greatest joy, Theo James has done unbelievable job making Four as fearless and lovely as he was in the book. If anything, the only difference would be that Four in the movie was less vulnerable, less shaky, more solid and profound than you'd remember him in the book. That change of course took some color of his book-character away, but, to be honest, that color was not fitting him to begin with. Reading the book I always had trouble putting Four-still-a-huge-mess-inside and Four-does-not-even-flinch-meeting-his-biggest-fear together. This way, more believable.Tris - good! Don't have much to say about her. She is easy to picture for the Tris of the book, she could put together being inexperienced but brave, innocent but not a victim, genuinely scared but smart teenager.Jeanine - perfection! In my head, Jeanine was one of those people that you just wanna attack physically she was so unbearably senseless in her own ideas. Like you cannot believe her! In the movie Jeanine was a total perfection. She pulled off the Erudite soul so well that I can describe that faction with just her character - her detachment, her weird evilness as if 'I really do mean good to the world'. Even small details like when she is physically approached how it surprises her, how unfamiliar she was to any type of power other than the intelligence. Bravo. Peter - Now, this is why the movie was boring. You see, the most thrilling part of the story is supposed to be the transition of Tris- Abnegation to Tris-Dauntless, and you know why? Because Peter, the real Peter of this story, made it hell and nightmare for Tris to spend a night in the Dauntless compound. He was not a jerk or a dick or an asshole, he was a psychopath, got it? He wasn't making jokes that made you wanna joke back, he made jokes that made you shiver inside and barely hold your composure. I am fine with certain scenes not being there to make it PG-13, but making a real threatening character instead of, actually, very lovely one, would be much appreciated, thank you!Other characters were well enough or not too much important to go detailed about. Christina was so well cast it's scary ( I actually visioned exactly her features / appearance ), Al - good, just a bit abrupt, Will - yeah but was I supposed to care for him? Molly - are you kidding me.. She is not bad at all, I felt pity for her.2) EventsWhen Tris jumps - that scene - is important for her character building. She does not just jump cause she likes to try, she jumps to show to Peter ( who managed to intimidate her already at that point ) and all his dauntless 'hunters' that she is not a victim. That is her first step from selfless to self preserving. She tosses her jacket on him and jumps! That is a much better scene, why change that to whatever, it's not like it would last any longer than it did.Christina hanging over the pit scene. Overall, OK. But with the timer it would be something! Without it first Eric feels less of a douche cause you already do expect him to pick her up right before she falls, second, it's less scary. With the timer Christina has only herself to save herself, and you really don't know if she will be able to, cause it's no miracles zone.Stabbing Edward in the eye. Well, not much to say about this scene cause it wasn't freaking there! Errgh.Well, as you can see, good points outnumber bad ones, overall quite a good adaptation, but not exactly great, cause the few bad ones were really really off. I am not a detailed reader or watcher, things that stand out to me are probably out there for everyone. I am angry a lot on things like Peter not having anywhere near the vibe from the book, but at the same time genuinely glad for so many others ( Four, Tris, Jeanine, Christine ) being so correctly done. For a reader that's a great pleasure.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A very well-acted well written script. I've never read the book, but the story was very easy to follow and very engaging. I just let the story come to me, let it set it's own pace and wow awesome! I really loved it! Great twists, good action, heroic moments, excellent drama, romance and heart. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM. I lied it just as much as Hunger games, maybe even a little better. It seemed more realistic and sincere. It is not as scientifically sophisticated as movies like Gattaca or Artificial Intelligence. And it's not as large scale as LOTR or Ben Hur. But it a really good flick. It was good, from top to bottom, start to finish. I will definitely go to the Movie theaters to see it at least one more time. And I hope there are a few of sequels planned. People need to give this movie a chance. They will not be disappointed. This is a Great Movie!","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

Many of the other User Comments for this film seem unjustly brutal. I confess I would probably not be considered part of the usual demographic for this type of movie, being more than half way to my 'three score years and ten'. Perhaps it is because of this I was able to just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is - solid escapist entertainment with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. When our real world currently appears to be going to hell in a hand-basket, what on earth is wrong with a healthy dollop of romance and escapism? Some have accused the film of being totally far-fetched - but isn't that rather the point of a futuristic fantasy film? Again, futuristic/fantasy/ sci-fi films are not usually to my taste and I try to avoid anything with wizards and/or dragons at all costs - not my bag at all.I thought that Theo James as Four and Shailene Woodley as Tris had wonderful chemistry. It was also very good to know that the amorous Mr. Pamuk from Downton Abbey lived to fight another day after all! Does he remind anyone else of a young Charlton Heston, or is it just me?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The one suggestion I have is to not see it with friends who talk or hit you anytime something exciting occurs (which is the entire film)At the first showing last night everyone in the theater applauded at the very end of the film.

I think that the message that the film is giving off is that if you try your hardest, you will succeed, this is due to the character Beatrice/Tris. I enjoyed this film as it was interesting and dramatic. My favourite part of the film was the ending when Tris and Four conquered the system and saved thousands of innocent people's lives. I would recommend this film to people who like film with action (fighting) but also romance. If I were to give this an age rating I would give it a 12+ due to the amount of use of guns and violence. I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors Shailene Woodley and Theo James.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

At last there was no symphonic orchestra like on most of films..Actors just running around, lines are corny, the idea is missing. Half of the film is dark, and impossible to watch.

However, the movie covered most of the important parts which is great to know. Some of the parts left out are also included the deleted scenes due to timing issues. There are some movies based on books that are absolutely terrible, but I thought that this wasn't the case in Divergent. This is one of my favorite movies currently.

So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous.","30 out of 64 found this helpful.

I love it so much! I have seen reviews talking about 'poor writing' 'poor directing' 'poor casting' and 'poor acting'. The people writing this review seriously need to get over themselves because they probably can't even act. I'd like to see them get handed the million-page script of Divergent and THEY can attempt to perform it even better. I highly doubt they will top the amazing acting done by Theo James and Shailene Woodley, in particular. Also, in saying that, I have seen another review stating that she couldn't tell Will, Al and Peter apart. Cleare;y, YOU weren't paying attention at the beginning of the movie, when they introduced themselves. They were sitting at the table, eating lunch (I assume) and they were arguing over their factions. Peter is played by Miles Teller, and again, it clearly states in the movie who he is. It is during the fight scene, the day after the knife scene, when Eric states: ""Peter and Tris in the ring"". (something along those lines) These people who are talking about poor directing etc need to pay more attention the movie, and I highly recommend READING THE BOOKS BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!! It will help you understand the movie if you don't normally PAY ATTENTION TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not rocket science people! In saying that, I read another review talking about "" Having destroyed civilization in a world war, the city survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace"" It is a fiction movie okay?!?!! It's not real! So don't be so critical about it! Honestly some people need to go back to 5th Grade! IT. IS. NOT. REAL. And don't bother watching Twilight or Hunger Games, just because it's ""slightly better"". Go watch them because they are all (including Divergent) top quality movies and entertaining for millions of people. Divergent was a great movie, but some people really need to put some more thought into their reviews. Thanks to Shai and Theo for inspiring me to begin acting too.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But you didn't state clearly why the world is broken in that way? War is not enough. In Chicago but don't know when it is, why it is??? @@ All sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives after taking an 'aptitude' (placement) test. But no orientation, no tutorial. Just follow what they have seen in other factions which are all beyond their imagination. Factions before blood, so every teenager just puts aside their origin, their parents, follow some guys but don't know who they are @@ Dauntless people could kill even their parents. Too ridiculous. Being divergent is also very easy, just think that ""This is not real"" to overcome fear. Otherwise, dauntless ones always fight back to the fear. I fear the world when everybody always want to inject sth into your necks and tests you all the time. It's also superficial to prove that Tris is divergent by testing results. There are so many people used that way to overcome fears,... T___T Many scenes of chases are also unreasonable when so many guards couldn't stop just 2 or 5 people.

And BOY, was I surprised!All of these negative reviews are insane. I mean was the writing good? No. Was the acting Oscar- worthy? No. Was the premise rational? No.I thought the writing was entertaining, it used many old tricks. The tricks that made you feel like the movies were magic when you were a kid. The storytelling was well-paced, and felt much more like an adventure movie than an intellectual sci-fi. Speaking of which, I'm so underwhelmed by sci-fi films being all intellectual and sad and coldly existential. **** that ****! So what if the story itself wasn't particularly believable or filled with holes? At least the characters here have agency. At least they go out and rebel gloriously instead of spending two hours moping about, contemplating their incompetence and accepting the sad truth of reality. I mean what happened to the good old sci-fi fantasy flick anyways? People obviously love it, but is telling a fun adventure story full of holes suddenly not OK with the review hipsters anymore?The acting was credible. People who say Shailene Woodley cannot act are out of their minds, she did a great job and was absolutely adorable, especially considering the script. Sure, every character was played in a way that at times was pretty annoying. But it was clear to me that this was intentional– as in intentionally annoying you for emotional fuel. Again, I think all the actors played their roles well in the context of the adventure template. The leads, even if they could not play whole characters (because of the script), accomplished admirably what was needed to move the story forward.Which brings me to the premise. What makes a good sci-fi story worth our time? Is it a post- apocalyptic background setting where the zombies rose on Dec. 21 2015, spread by a rare virus strain incubated in the asses of mutated monkeys? Seriously who gives a ***!All the pieces in the setup have major flaws, but they come together fine. They get the point across and I'd like to remind you critics that everything in the creative world is a simplification and reference to the infinite complexity of the real world. That is the whole point of movies and other creative mediums.This is a teen fantasy adventure movie. It's about being different and not fitting into categories. It's about family, love, and courage. It's entertaining, emotionally engaging, not particularly smart, and retells a classic story we've all heard/seen/read a thousand times. What's wrong about sticking to the basics?6.5/10 (rounded up to spite the haters)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That's about all I can say that it good about the movie. The script, though, is terrible. Basically it is about a bored little Amish girl who decides to switch Factions and join the Fascists, just for fun. The faction system is a sort of Hogwarts house system, only people are separated by more clear virtues which somehow need to preclude any others, for no good reason. The training is just like in Harry Potter, seemingly controlled, but actually quite insane. This system is threatened by divergents, people who have characteristics from more than one faction and that ""the system"" wants them destroyed. Guess which one is she.Anyway, the movie does possess a subtle irony that I believe was unintentional. A brainwashing movie made for masses of young adults is advocating rebellion against a brainwashing system. Of course, only do that after you trusted the system most of the time and obeyed without question, then found out something so outrageous about it that your only alternatives are fight or die. And I am still not sure whether some part of the film didn't advocate death as a good alternative to resistance. I mean, she had to be really weird and rare in order to do that, so that means the rest of them had no chance to begin with.Bottom line: I felt cheated of more than two hours of my life and offended by the radically dumb message of the story. They fight the system, they win, and still they end up running. And do you know the crazy bitch that started it all? They let her live at the end. Because they are good guys. Sheesh!

That it was slow and the acting was student film level. So going into it my expectations were low and I think that's why I enjoyed it more than most people.The acting is mediocre as well as the action scenes that go along with it. This takes up most of the movie but for some reason, I liked the main character and her dilemma. The whole concept is pretty cool and original. Some of the dialogue was very poor and I laughed when the scene didn't call for it. If you can look past all these flaws, I believe you get an original story with a few characters you can really root for. It won't win any awards or movie critics, but who cares? If you had doubts about this movie, drop them and give it a shot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I heard a lot of negative things about the novels and about the film itself. From what I had seen, it was one of those films that I didn't mind if I didn't get to see it right away. But my sister asked me to go see it so I did. Surprisingly I really liked this one. Coming from someone who didn't read the book and wasn't really wanting the see the movie, it's really not as bad as people say. I managed to sit through it for two hours and enjoy the whole thing. I also don't like how people bash things and fans of things just because they didn't like it and with people nowadays that's exactly what I've seen from reactions to this series. To the point where people were calling people that liked it ""stupid"", really let's grow up now. As for the film it's not a bad story, I actually enjoyed the plot and they seemed to explain the story well for a novel-to-film translation. They characters weren't nearly as poorly conceived as I thought they would be and the acting was actually good. The cinematography was great as well. The ending was OK, but it didn't feel as though it left any room for a sequel, at least I couldn't tell that there would be another just by the ending to the film itself. I'm actually hoping that this series gets the other two translated onto the big screen as well. I think I might be a fan of these now.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

If anything, it strikes me as odd that there is more romance in the novel, and less in this film. That is not how I believed Hollywood operated. I stand corrected.

As with all the others, let me state upfront I haven't read the books on which this is based, nor do I intend to. I don't have any knowledge of spoilers from the books. I'll just assume the movie follows them for the most part but changes some things here or there. That's usually the case. At any rate, without having read the books, I can say this movie is not as original as it seems to believe it is. It borrows liberally from several sources. Among them is Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" But most of it is just following the predictable YA formula. Young woman, pretty but not intimidatingly so, is the 'chosen one' to change the world or some such. Along the way she falls in love with a guy who's just too dreamy for words. It's funny how in these things the girl is always supposed to be something of a plain Jane but the guy has to be a heartthrob. I'm sure someone has written about the hypocrisy of that since men are always criticized for being shallow and thinking about looks first with regards to women...but I digress.The cast does well, with Shailene Woodley (one of Hollywood's much-hyped rising stars of late) doing a fine job. Theo James only has to look handsome so it's to his credit he can actually act. Kate Winslet plays the obligatory corrupt government leader villain. I assume she was paid well. Ashley Judd and eyebrowless Tony Goldwyn play Woodley's parents. Thankless roles for both, really. The performance I enjoyed the most was Zoë Kravitz as Woodley's friend. Sadly, she largely disappears in the second half of the movie. Anyway, there no impressive action sequences or special effects to speak of. It's not that what's there is bad, just that nothing stood out to me. After the movie was over, I didn't say ""Wow remember that scene"" or anything like that. Still, I don't regret watching it and I will likely watch the inevitable sequels. As far as these types of movies go, it was decent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's like Hunger Games' training plus Inception's dream share plus Facing one's fears; add a little romance and mystery to it, you have 'Divergent'. Actors like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd are not utilized at all. Despite being over two hours long, it didn't explore any character or faction properly. And it had one of the most predictable plots ever. The other futuristic movie released this year with the theme of maintaining peace, 'The Giver', was just ninety minutes long but had better performances and was a bit different than the usual.Divergent is actually the first part in its book trilogy, but compared to other young-adult futuristic trilogies like 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Maze Runner', this didn't have much going for it, and even if the remaining two books get adapted, I'm not that interested to follow them.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've read the books and just loved it. To me it's a little like The Hunger Games where you have that insecure girl, who doesn't know where she belongs. She always protects the ones she loves and turns out to be a heroine with the love of her life by her side. In my opinion that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think having a girl heroin is a change from all the typical heroes, which are mainly guys. But the movie was not as good as I thought it would be. For one it seemed a little rushed to me and wasn't as good as the book. The reason why is because very good and important parts were just simply left out. I know the movie is already long as it is but I'd rather watch a movie that's a little longer than a movie, which is missing a lot of details.

Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth.

For casual movie watchers ITS WORTH A RENTAL! 7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's amazing to me that those who elected to rate Divergent, compare it to ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight"" trilogies. I understand and get it... for this appears what human nature does... Yet, I believe it would be wise to rate ""Divergent"" independently of it's own cast, plot, content and adaptation. What is the point of comparing similar movies? To rip it to shreds? To manipulate or sway the readers opinion to your own? Just as it isn't really fare to compare a new relationship to a previous one because each person IS Different, and it doesn't give the new person (movie) the chance to hold its own. I don 't believe it's wise to do this when critiquing ""Divergent."" (It doesn't have to be so black and white and or, all or nothing).Lastly, I think it's interesting that as I write out my review, as I read and analyze other peoples opinions, I believe we are getting a small glimpse to who they are, what they believe and which faction he or she may value most.","15 out of 42 found this helpful.

The dream sequence of Tris is the only aspect I find innovative. Since I never read the trilogy I may not understand what the story may have for us in the future as a franchise but the initiation of the film series is very ineffective.But it has some plus points.1. Good visuals and well cinematographic vision (Well with that kinda budget what you should question is what you can't do on the visuals).
2. Good cast and mediocre acting.(Well the new actors are pretty famous now)

However, the story just didn't draw me in and Woodley's acting doesn't compare to that of Jennifer Lawrence. Of course, I realize that is setting the bar really high. Maybe I expected too much.The story seemed to leave a lot of loose ends. First, I couldn't 'buy' into the concrete living quarters. It was never believable or even understandable. Second, empty trains seem to always be moving throughout the city, just ready for people to jump on. Third, the actual daily living situation of the entire city was left unshown and unexplained. Did the kids go to school? Did anyone have a 'normal' job? Were there any shops? Who, or which faction, would perform which jobs? The setting was never complete enough to make any of it 'real.' Even fantasy needs some supporting structure.Jai Courtney made his character really interesting. There was something repellent, attractive, and interesting about him all at the same time, which left me wishing we got to know his character better.All in all, it may be worth your time and money if you have few options one evening. However, don't expect something on par with The Hunger Games.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

The hero of the story is a young woman who doesn't fit into any category, so she's labeled a 'divergent', which makes her a threat to government and the accepted conformist way of life. It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w","16 out of 46 found this helpful.

In every single second I could feel how much this movie tried to be the next Harry Potter ripoff, just like Hunger Games did it. Juveniles get categorized into dumb superficial ""fractions"" like HP did it with Slytherin, Griffyndor etc. to address the teenage-viewers desire for belonging to a team and having a clear enemy, there's one of the most predictable and unsophisticated romance-story lines involved I've ever seen, the whole set and the actors make one feel like watching a low-budget production, there is so few thought and logic behind this movie, that the constant super-serious atmosphere just makes it even more of a second hand embarrassment.

Sure, it wasn't as good as the book but you can't compare the two.People usually complain how the movie is different from the book. How some scenes were cut short or not in the movie at all. However you must keep in mind that a book gives you an insight into the character. Into their thoughts, reasons, and knowledge. A book may contain countless pages of explanations. A movie, whereas, has to format the book into a two hour clip. Try and imitate the person's thoughts through expressions and actions. A two hour movie won't be able to include all the scenes from the book. The movie was actually pretty good and did include most of the important scenes for a 500 page book. Another complaint is that the characters in the movie don't ""fit the standards."" Well, I'm pretty sure that everybody who has read the book have imagined the character differently. However the producers can't pick the perfect actors that will be able to fit everybody's expectations. They pick the characters they think fit best and if the author agrees then why are you complaining? The author definitely knows how their character should look like.So, after saying all that, I personally think that the movie was great and that you should go and watch it before judging it based on the critical reviews of those who can't accept the fact that the movie couldn't fully match the book. As you watch it, keep in mind that even though the movie might not be up to your standards, it could have been a lot worse.","14 out of 40 found this helpful.

Many friends suggested me this movie by saying that it is completely different.I would like to inform them that its not new as many movies had been made before on the very same idea.The start of the film was slow and boring.The middle of the film was also slow but it was average.In the climax the movie picked its speed but the climax was too convlucted and unimaginative.The ending was left open for its sequel.If you are going to make a trilogy then you have to make the 1st movie a solid one so that the audience may become interested in but the movie was average at its best.The movie deals with a good topic but doesn't explore it in a very nice way.First half of the movie was too prosaic.Visuals were good and acting was average.It was so pleasant to watch Kate Winslet in such a role.She was simply awesome.If you are a kid of 15 then you might like it and if you are a fan of Battle royale and Hunger games then you might leave it.If you could indure its first half then you may watch it.

If the other books are made into movies this will be a problem because some of those people have important roles to play . I sow other people complain that there is no sense of urgency and that may make the movie a bore . I think that this is caused by the fact that they wanted to get a good rating so there is a lot less death, violence and injury in the movie then in the book . In the book kids fall jumping from the train and a boy is mutilated to get him out of the competition.I agree they could have done a better job showing the pressure the character has to endure but it wasn't boring.

See it if you have read the book or if you haven't. But especially if you've read the book. As a fan of the book I really loved it, and the friends I saw it with who hadn't read it also enjoyed it.I really feel that the Neil Burger directed film did Veronica Roth's book justice. It just felt authentic in bringing that story world to life, from actually being shot in Chicago, to many of the actors doing their own stunts, to the fact that it was perfectly cast. The changes they did make from the source material only improved upon some quibbles I had with Roth's characterization and plotting as a first time author, and made sense cinematically. Fans can also rest easy, because Roth was a producer, so she had a big hand in shaping this film. Shailene Woodley was a great Tris. She is a great actress capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, and she totally embodies the toughness but relatability that is Tris. As a heroine, I found that she's a very good feminist role model for girls. She holds her own the way a male lead in an action movie is expected to, and she defies gender stereotypes. Theo James is Four. He exudes masculinity, mystery, and fierceness. He and Shailene played opposite each other very well, and their chemistry was palpable. So if you're a fan of The Hunger Games, action movies, or the Divergent book series, definitely go to see Divergent in theaters. It's an action packed thrill ride filled with great performances!","14 out of 42 found this helpful.

In Divergent, the main characters are Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Eric (Jai Courtney), and Jeanine (Kate Winslet). This movie is an action movie, and it's a lot like Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Tris leaves her faction (Abnegation) and comes to Dauntless, trying to hide her divergence. She meets Four and with him, she finds out that Jeanine, the Erudite leader teamed up with the Dauntless leader (Eric) and they plot to destroy divergents. I really like this move because the plot is very interesting, it's a mix of harry potter and hunger games, and it has a lot of fighting which makes it very interesting. I think divergent is a really good movie. Shailene Woodley acts exactly like the way Tris is supposed to be in the book. In most movies which are based off books, they cut out the main parts but with Divergent they kept the main parts.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's been compared to The Hunger Games multiple times, but I think they're not entirely similar, aside from being of the same genre. The world is very interesting. A dystopia disguised as a utopia. People live happily and in peace. Till a conflict arises between two factions and Divergents begin to get hunted down. It's got a lot of action and tension and danger for the main lead. The acting was not Oscar- worthy (though Shailene Woodley had her heart-breaking crying moments) but it wasn't horrendous. By the middle it felt like it dragged on a little bit but it pulls you in immediately. Like in the book, the is-dangerous-being-divergent thing wasn't fully explained and the world-building was not the best (though those who read the books know the origin of the faction system is explained till book 3). The climax was really good and we get to see Shai kick ass with her mother. Kate Winslet delivered a great performance as the baddie also. All in all, Divergent is an amazing movie with all the right touches of action, romance, humor, and intrigue. Since I'm a book fan, I am going to check out Insurgent, the second installment, but even if I haven't had read the books, I would have still wanted to watch it, to know what's coming next.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They make up our entire life. We learn from them as young adults.I am a 45 years old male and I enjoyed this movie as I would have enjoyed it in my teen years.It had no ups and downs or surprising twists, but it also didn't bore me for a second. I just liked to watch the protagonists going through their lives and the story being unfold.It is a solid movie with incredible visuals, sympathetic characters and a nice story.It has no explosions, but it is still better, than all transformers movies altogether (which are really really bad), so if you like nice movies with a little bit of message, which just let you forget your problems for two hours and just let you enjoy the mood, then watch it.If you like post-apocalyptic settings, even better!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are 5 Factions. You get to pick the one you want and somehow this is supposed to keep the peace after a 100-year war. Humhh.Like Hogwarts, the Factions represent different skill sets. Unlike Hogwarts, you get tested first, and a Faction usually comes out as dominant. I no dominant trait comes out, in rare cases, you are labeled a Divergent. The government, which apparently wants to control people, does not like Divergents, and they typically find them and make them disappear.Similar to Hunger Games with evil Donald Sutherland, except here you have Kate Winslet, who plays the evil government leader.The lead female character breaks from her family, and loves her family, but still has to do what she has to do. The training scenes are pretty good, and the story is entertaining. In the end, these stories leave the ending completely open, and you have to wait for part 2 to find out what happens next.

Throughout film, there have been plenty of movies that take place in the future where Earth has become a robotic like eutopic society. People must follow certain guidelines to maintain stable tranquility. Of course, because the main inhabitance are human, one individual is bound to think differently from the rest, thus making them different and a possible ""threat"" to everyone else. It's one of those self-discovery stories where the main protagonist must figure out for himself or herself where they belong among everyone else. This is what happens to a young girl named Beatrice.To know one's place in the world she lives in, citizens take a mental aptitude test which then they have the choice themselves to follow through on their test result or choose their own. Among these groups to choose, there's Factionless (poor), Abnegation (the givers), Candor (truthful), Amity (friendly), Dauntless (fearless), Erudite (the brains). Tris, as Beatrice will call herself later, chooses Dauntless not only because it fit her better than Abnegation of which she originated, but also because she discovered she was Divergent through the mental test. According to the world she lives in, Divergent individuals are being hunted due to how unpredictable they are. It is at this point Tris must learn how to keep herself under the radar.This story is very character based. Audiences are introduced to a slew new people along the way and surprisingly it's easy to follow. Plus, the actors play their roles with the right amount of charm to feel a connection to each of them, including the not so nice ones. Shailene Woodley as Tris is likable and is able to show genuine emotion when the time came. Tris also meets one of the leaders named Four (Theo James) who looks like a cross between Billy Zane and James Franco. He also gives his character the correct amount of enthusiasm to be interested in understanding more. The rest of the Dauntless crew that Tris gets to know is played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, Christian Madsen and Zoë Kravitz, all of which give enjoyable human performances. Possibly one of the most likable jerks in this story however was Jai Courtney as Eric. His duo deadpan and mean spirited attitude make him one to be reckoned with and probably Courtney's best role thus far.We also cannot forget the supporting characters played by the underrated Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Mekhi Phifer and Kate Winslet. All of which have very minor roles but important ones nonetheless. What is really apparent about this character driven story was Neil Burger's direction of which the kinds of choices he had this character's make and the writing provided by Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)) and Vanessa Taylor (Hope Springs (2012)). The development was one of its strongest points. The cinematography by Alwin H. Küchler (DP of R.I.P.D. (2013)) looked decent as well. He was able to show the contrast between what people normally see on the surface and the underground operations people don't know about. Even with a minimal amount of special effects they too were integrated well into the movie. No complaints there.Though even with all these good points, the film still suffers from other issues. For one, there are loopholes in its story. If this particular society is so rigid and perfectly made so there are no problems, why is it that there are still problems? How is it that if one character can change factions, the upper authorities won't know? This movie's running time was very close to two and a half hours, I'm sure they could have fit a quick explanation in somewhere. Then there was the music composed by Junkie XL. It certainly was a tolerable score with its hybrid mix of electronic and orchestra but there wasn't much to remember it by nor were there any themes for the franchise or characters themselves. It was effective in its scenes but still disappointing. Lastly, the action was a bit bland. It's obvious that it wasn't a full out action movie but audiences might expect more than a few fight sequences, a ""captured the flag"" like scene and a some other shootings. Perhaps it'll escalate? We will see. It certainly isn't a waste of a movie but it did need improvement on all other aspects besides its characters.This movie is like the reversal of other fantasy films. It has a big cast with competent actors and writing that develops its characters effectively. With this, its supporting elements don't seem as exciting with average music and somewhat uninspired action scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"". In this film, the beginning of another trilogy, we are presented with a dystopian future: the human race faced the Third World War and almost died out.In order to regain peace, the survivors grouped in the city of Chicago and created factions, in which they engaged according to their vocation: Erudite grouped intellectuals, teachers and scientists; Amity did the same with farmers, manufacturers, artisans and traders; Candor includes magistrates, lawyers, bailiffs and lawmakers; Dauntless welcomed the police and military; the Abnegation brought together civil servants, doctors, nurses, social workers and all those who dedicate their lives to helping others. By their characteristics, they are also the political leaders. The faction is chosen in adolescence, after a vocational test that should help, or even indicate, to which faction you belong. There are also those who have no faction or have left theirs, and who live in misery. In a system where the faction is more relevant than family, being without a faction is being excluded from society.The young protagonist is Beatrice, or Tris, whom the vocation test indicated belonging to more than one faction, that is, being a Divergent, a serious threat to the faction system. Choosing to join the Dauntless, she will face serious difficulties to integrate and pass the tests presented to her. To make matters worse, her father, who is one of the leaders of the Abnegation, is being questioned by the strength of the Erudite, led by the cruel Jeannine, eager to rise to power, albeit by violence.I really liked the movie, overall. At the time it was released I felt it went quite unnoticed, overshadowed especially by ""Maze Runner"". Now that some years have passed and the success of the competitors has faded, it was interesting to see this film, I felt that I could appreciate it better and that the film has aged well until now. The story is good, it holds us to the end, and it develops in an engaging way.The cast is quite good and competent at what they should do. I especially liked Shailene Woodley, who I didn't know until I saw her here. She is good at what she does, she has talent and, on a more personal note, she is identical to an old flame of mine, which is almost the same age as her, and that of course made me remember my own past. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, where he seems cut out for the role. Miles Teller is just as good, especially considering that his character is hateful. Equally worthy of our hatred is the character of Jai Courtney, who is very good at the task of being rude, brutish and somewhat sadistic. Kate Winslet is cold and insensitive, and in fact she performed very well, but I don't know if I would bet on her as the first choice for the character. The film also features Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort and Ashley Judd.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes, and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild all? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. I also liked to see Intrepid climb buildings with ease ... in a city that is famous for its strong winds (another logic problem that can only be forgiven for being less relevant). The sets and costumes were very well done and the soundtrack also fits into the overall set.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But amidst all of my positive reviews, Divergent seems to not fit in the YA crowd mainly to the comparison with The Hunger Games and its futuristic style similar to The Hunger Games. Also, I personally think that Divergent lacked some action even though it had action, there wasn't enough to amuse the audiences. The interest is what makes the viewers really want to watch a film. And the themes are, again, similar to The Hunger Games and can sometimes make no sense with its plot. Divergent opens its planned trilogy to a great, but disappointingly fashion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Beautiful cinematography, rather good tempo. Good-looking actors. Of course, there definitely are gaps in the plot, and dialogues could be better...My main discourage for the film was the casting. As I've said, good faces, some of them are new. That's good. But acting is not good. I almost can hear the director's headache of dealing with that human material. In some point of viewing the film I've been thinking of Theo James as good actor, but to be honest, he is good only with the tremendous efforts of the director and editors and being on the background of worse actors. Much worse. The biggest disappointment is the main character played by Shailene Woodley.I get the idea of casting young actors. And I understand that it's hard to find good ones. But she even is not as good-looking as Theo James! Why was she chosen?Concerning the plot. It has weak points. (Not too many as The Matrix, of course.) The romantic line is too obvious and too disappointing for me. She is just in the age of majority and he is her tutor with notable experience. But I can tolerate all of these. More dislikes I have about the idea of future series of films in advance of doing the first one. Money above all?But, as I stated, not too bad.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

There is nothing about her or her acting that stands out and takes command of the movie. All the actors were more on the boring side, mainly due to the fact the movie is at such a slow pace. More needed to happen for an adventure sci-fi movie. Another thing was the movie never explained why the Erudite thought they should control everyone and why the other 4 factions wouldn't gang up on them and stop them. Also what is going on outside the city walls. I wonder if any of the sequels go there?

I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sound familiar? It is. Whoever wrote 'Divergent' obviously has read The Hunger Games and changed a few things here and there.But is it any good? The answer to that question really does depend on whether you liked The Hunger Games or not. If you did, you'll love this. If you didn't, this one isn't for you. It basically follows all the same rules. Instead of kids fighting it out for food, ala Hunger Games, you have kids who are split into five (supposedly radically) different factions after they complete a test in their early adolescent years. This *slightly trippy* test determines which faction they're destined to be part of for the rest of their lives.Of course if they don't agree with the test results they don't have to be part of that faction (I didn't get that bit). Then they all sit around in a big room and pick up a handful of rocks which tells them which faction they're going to be in (completely negating the test they took only days earlier). There are various factions which they could be in, all of which have names like the 'houses' in the Harry Potter films. However, about the only faction you'll remember is 'Dauntless' which is made up of some of the most annoying people you'll ever meet. They're supposed to be 'protecting' society, yet all they do is run around the streets making whooping and cheering noises while generally getting in everyone's way and practically knocking over old ladies. Our heroine (not Kaniss, but someone just like her) is conscripted into this band of nutters. However, she isn't destined to be a simple 'Dauntless' lass, she has traits from ALL the different factions, thus making her a 'Divergent'. And, apparently, being a Divergent means you need to be hunted down until you die.But, help is on hand for our Katniss-clone, in the form of a blatantly older hunky guy who'll have a love/hate relationship with her until he eventually decides he loves her.Yes, it has a budget, so the scenery is nicely futuristic and the actors play their parts well. They're either hunky and good. Hunky and evil, or hunky and annoying.I'm not sure how well this film will be received by cynical older males such as myself. However, I really don't think I'm its target audience. It's aimed at kids and, I'm reliable informed, the kids loved it.Does anyone else hear the words 'Hunger Games-sequel/franchise?' (Sorry, I meant DIVERGENT sequel/franchise!)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you must watch it, I suggest just going to redbox or another rental place when it comes time for the movie to be released. And I am not trying to be that negative person that leaves bad reviews on anything and everything. Usually it is very easy for me to find the good in something but not in this. The mood of the movie was entirely different than it was in the book which disturbed me. The relationship between Tris and Tobias is very different than it is in the book which was something I could not get over. Along with the fact that the ending was completely changed. So basically, they spent a year on this movie to get the title and some of the characters names right.

The movie follow the bock only diverging in some parts in order to make the information pass in a small amount of time, if they follow the book in some parts it will be confusing because you don't follow all the little information that they don't explain in the movie. The awesomeness go that is even they changing little things, the changes ware awesome. And made the movie different but still awesome as the book.The movie charters: I'n the beginning i expect Tris less beauty. And in the movie i king of like in one strange way Petter, a big amount of that its because of the actor that represent Petter, he is funny and alway's smiling, in the book i get a more ruff idea of Petter and don't really enjoy the Character in the book.The movie effects: I mean, wow, i was expecting a good production but never like this, never in my imagination i have the time or the ability to create all that instruments and stuff they show on the movie. I men little stuff like the way the cups of serum are made, the way the city's are destroyed and all the wind fans systems in the buildings... All that environment stuff that the movie bring to the story king of give it a now approach even using the same arguments. I was not expects the scene when they throw themselves from the building hanged by one rope. In the movie that was awesome, beautiful... Made me make a little smile and king of feel a title of the freedom that Tris was feeling.Music: You know what i am talking... :D I'm not a big fan of Ellie Goulding but you need to accept that her songs in that movie are just well placed, and even when the movie strait's to touch your hearth where it came one song that melt your feelings and make you live all the charters of the movie.Overall: I thins its kind of obvious that i love this movie... Because i don't think you can understand that string of thinking but, when you read that state of the art book you don't expect to someone to take that and make it even better. In your mind you know that's possible but its really close to impossible. When i hear that they will make a movie of that book i really don't expect that to be that good, even because i have seen a lot of movies that are made mirroring book's and never find it well engulf...

The story line is good, your interested to see how this new society works, how different factions work and how they co-exist. To learn what divergent's are is also awesome. My friend who came along with me, now his the one who can be critical on movies without knowing so when he says its a good movie, its had to do something good. I will not go into any details or anything like that but Shailene Woodley deserves credit she did well in her part. Giving a lead role in this movie would have been tough but did very well. So this movie is a good movie to watch so please go watch why not, it will not disappoint you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was a good concept from the beginning, so on its own it may have seemed great to those who haven't read the book. If you have read the book, however, you would have noticed that more things were left out than kept in, things happened at way different times than originally, important and thrilling scenes where twisted resulting in unimportant and boring parts, and many characters, thoughts, and important phrases were almost completely left out. This is the first movie that I have ever despised. However, whether you believe the movie is good or bad, and you haven't read the book, please read it for your own good. It is honestly one of the best I have read. Things you missed in the movie: The hardcore ship you will have for Christina and Will and, obviously Tris and Tobias, so many intimate moments, the fact that Four is not called Four by Tris once she knows his name, how Molly, Peter, and Drew are complete and utter butt holes and you will want them dead as much as Tris does, and many more that I can't list because of the word limit. Honestly, just read the book, or listen to it.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Janet for instance and Christina were both played as if they were three dimensional people with lives before and after the story begins and ends. I also found Four quite credible but sadly, Triss the dauntless did not leave up to the promise she showed early in the film as a wannabe.And Yet...Overall, I found the film worked very well.

I thought it was great how the movie tried to go by the book as much as possible, but I feel that it could've done WAY better. The casting of the movie was a little disappointing. Based upon the trailer, I thought Shailene seemed to be a great suit for Tris but after seeing the movie, I just don't feel that she does a good job being a ""dauntless"". I just don't buy all the strength and toughness that she attempted to portray throughout her training. I also don't like the casting of the rest of her dauntless pals. I expected Miles Teller as Peter to be more despicable because in the book Peter was someone who I truly despised. Other than that, I thought Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet were good for their part. I like seeing Kate Winslet as a villain for some reason. It's something different than what she normally does. Most importantly, I thought Theo James did a great job as Four. For me, his appearance and his acting was nearly close to how I envisioned Four while reading the books. Although Tris is the main character of the story, I feel that many of the audience will only stick around for Four as they continue on with the series.Last but not least, although it is a small thing, I did not like the narration in the beginning of the movie. The way that they tried to explain the different factions was too boring and plain. Perhaps they could've done something else to not only explain this main part of the story but to lure in the audience as well. Overall, I give this movie a 6 because it did follow the book. The action scenes were also quite enjoyable especially the ending.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really, really enjoyed the movie and decided to look up some more information when I got home. I found out there is a book trilogy of which this film is based off and as I love reading books I decided to start reading the trilogy.When I started reading the book I found some big differences in the character development in the movie in comparison with the book. The Dauntless hide-out is also completely different in the book and a lot of details are changed throughout the movie, which makes the movie go from one thing to another in a second. That was also the moment I realized that not everything in the movie was displayed in the good smoothness the books describe it. And I also only started to understand certain things in the movie after reading the books.It is a really hard task to make a movie in which a lot of details make sense for the continuation for the other parts of the trilogy into a movie of just two hours.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They explain the training well, too well!!! Because one and a half hour of the movie is training and romance. That is pretty much it! I didn't get the point of the movie at all! The movie had a description, and that is pretty much the point. Everything that happens is so slow, but the ending which we were waiting for is super fast. We should have gotten some political discussion or something to understand why everything is happening. We get some facts at the beginning, but no government development or anything to make you root for the good guys, and some simple things to make you dislike the enemy, but that is not enough man.The story is very good I guess, but the movie doesn't get that much points for it. If the director was the one who made the story, it would have been different. But it is an adapted screenplay man. I enjoyed the movie, but thought it would be a little better, but I'm not disappointed. The action is OK I guess. It's cool but... it isn't impressive. This movie is an entertaining mix between hunger games 1 and twilight 1.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Godfather? Granted I don't think its perfect but reading all these 1/10 negative reviews made me up my rating. You're a bunch of Erudites! Seriously, though, you can't watch Frozen and expect it to have Quentin Tarantino quality. Its like humor, not everyone has the same taste. Satire might not be your crucifix, that doesn't make a joke ""low quality"". The plot is pretty solid if you ask me, a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors developed a communistic system to avoid future chaos considering human nature drove the past civilization to destruction. Divergents have multiple aptitudes making them a threat to linear society. l admit I have above average intelligence, but even my 12 year old cousin understood the premise. The casting was splendid, Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley especially the scene where shes crying (no spoiler here) and Theo James' character develops well and opens up progressively and we were all genuinely terrified of Jai ""Eric""'s ruthlessness. Also Kate Winslet played a fine bitchy dame. The dialogue was believable and appropriate for the story (they were teens and this isn't a witty comedy). Overall, the story was thought-provoking. To those missing the bigger picture, there's actually a connection between this universe and ours. Our society also categorizes people either by race, religion, politics, culture, education, sexuality, school cliques (in a small range), etc. There's always expectations in each group, a social code that must be followed. I actually enjoy the way Divergent depicts authority in such a menacing way, showing how ridiculous these bigots can be. Why are there laws against gay marriage or against innocent children who were forced into the US and can't get an education/driver's license/job when they're adults? Ignorance, that's why. I hope this movie inspired its targeted young audience to rebel and fight for what is right in their judgment.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

He was certainly the hook that got me to start watching these adaptations of Veronica Roth's futuristic novels. Well, beauty can only take you so far; the rest has to be down to acting; dialogue etc. And this falls pretty flat on all counts. The premiss is unique - society is divided into five factions based on a perception of virtue. At 16, teenagers have to decide which they have and then they spend their lives living up to the ideals - involving strenuous mental and physical trials. ""Tris Prior"" (Shailene Woodley"") is an exception, however - she doesn't fit into any one category - and so the system has no idea how to cope with this renegade. When she reveals her confused status to James - her trainer - we embark on a tale of cat and mouse as she and a rag-bag gang of misfits set out to save a world that deems them all as a serious threat. It certainly looks good - budget clearly was not an huge issue, and it is broadly faithful to the book but therein lies the problem - it is a preposterous proposition from the outset - it has not even the weakest of anchors from the society we know today (i.e. How the hell could we ever have gotten ourselves into this kind of dystopian mess in the first place?). When romance begins to rear it's head too, then I started to forget how sexy Theo actually is and wonder what else I could watch... There are clearly some parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" series, but this one definitely comes off a very poor second.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One major flaw, it's simply too damn long. For me, I read the entire series, and I went into the film with low expectations. Happy to say that the film surprised me a few times, but after the 100 minute mark I lost interest. The film shouldn't have been so stretched out, seeing as they could have cut or even condensed certain unnecessary scenes like some of the mindless banter between Tris and friends, or even the first dining hall scene. I've found that those who have read the book agree with me. Thise who haven't enjoyed the pace because it made the film easy to follow and understand. So it's a win lose for viewers. In terms of technical, well I'm not that big a fan of some of the CGI, there are times when you can go ""oh this is definitely fake"" but all in all not a bad job. One of my favorite shots is when Tris is walking down the hallway to the main control room. Nice classic directioning and movement. I won't get too in detail seeing as most of you who read this probably haven't taken a film studies class before.I'd recommend this film, but only to those who have 3 hours to kill. Add up the 140 minutes of film and the inane previews and that's a grand total of about 160 minutes. Sad to say I actually popped my headphones in and started jamming because I just got so damn bored. Still the film is pretty good. Just try not to fall asleep.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

At times I was confused but then I figured it out in the end. Although it contains violent actions I didn't find it that horrifying. I love how there seems to have time for romance when their world is being slaughtered, and how unpredictable the characters are, e.g. You would think a good guy (Four) wouldn't be controlled or nice but he can and he is not a Mr. Nice guy at all (UNTIL THE END).... etc. This movie is very confusing to understand but if you pause it and rethink what the character just said (the parts where you didn't get) (because I did that) you'll understand more clearer. The first time my nephews watched this they wanted to watch something else because at one point the characters are here then they go somewhere else but who can blame them they're only 10 and 8 and they weren't even allowed to watch this SO....

However, I was surprised to find that it was actually enjoyable.I have a love-hate relationship with the divided factions idea. As cool as it was, it wasn't done very well. Everyone wore the same clothes, or was at least color-coded, which looked very goofy and unrealistic. Although it is the future, so who knows how people will dress then. However, the factions idea, although not particularly original, was cool and each faction was realistically divided nonetheless. The acting was okay. Shailene Woodley (Tris) didn't do a particularly good job, but it was good enough. Theo James (Four) did better, but his character felt somewhat flat. I'm not sure if that was his acting or just the character himself. The characters weren't super well-developed, but somehow I actually cared about the five main ones by the end. Some of the expendables that died didn't affect me, but major character deaths and challenges were somewhat sad, but not sad enough to strike up any tears or serious emotion. The relationship between Tris and Four felt very forced and it was awkward to watch them later on in the movie. It felt like it came out of nowhere, considering the age difference. Thankfully, these exchanges very rarely happened. Divergent was enjoyable, and set itself up for a better trilogy than movies like the Hunger Games did, only this movie received more hate for some reason (Divergent is better than Hunger Games). With decent acting, good characters, an interesting story, and a good ending, I'm certainly going to see Insurgent. Having not read the book, I probably didn't notice certain flaws that others did, but as a movie I enjoyed it. Overall, Divergent is worth-watching, but its far from amazing. If your looking for something entertaining to watch, then look no further than Divergent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

However, the dialogue and the way the characters act up until the third act is irritating, especially at the beginning as they introduce all those involved.Shailene Woodley is excellent in her role, she brings likeable qualities to Tris alongside a sense of strength. I also liked Theo James, who portrays Four. A few of the others, like Zoë Kravitz (Christina) and Miles Teller (Peter), are OK too. With that said, they are all let down by the aforementioned iffy dialogue.I rate the initial world building and all the different factions, though that's one of the (many) areas where I think this film could've been great - so much more can be done with that. More development into the enemies would've been nice too, namely with Kate Winslet's Jeanine.

Some have disappointed, others just flopped due to too narrow of an audience. Fortunately, for fans of the Divergent series, this doesn't disappoint and has the potential to be a blockbuster action film whether you've read the books or not.There is much to say about this movie and tough to do so without going all fan-girl while doing so. I loved the book series and couldn't have been more pleased when I found out a movie adaptation was on the way. The casting was just about perfect, especially when you look at the two leads, Shaliene Woodley and Theo James. Their chemistry is off the charts, starting from their relationship as instructor/trainee and beyond. Woodley, who is everywhere these days, captures the character of Tris as I imagined her, taking her from the supposedly meek Abnegation daughter and growing into the strong leader of Dauntless. That she does so seamlessly is a testament to her acting. James, as Dauntless leader Four, takes the character beyond my expectations. He's sexy as hell in a quiet, sensitive, tortured way. Physically, he outshines everyone on screen, doing all of his own stunts and fighting which allows the character to jump off the screen. The rest of the casting was fine, Jai Courtney is intensely scary as Eric, Zoe Kravitz does a nice job as Christina. I love Miles Teller, and he does a decent job as Peter, Tris's nemesis, but he's the last person I'd expect in this role. Bottom line is that most of the secondary characters really take a backseat to the mains. At 2 1/2 hours, I'd say there just wasn't a way to tell the story and develop every character without compromising the movie.The movie itself is exciting, hitting all the important parts of the book. It's a tough job to sell a story that has a huge amount of background detail (what are the factions, how did Chicago end up as it is, why the animosity between factions, etc.). And, it's a fine line to walk when half your audience knows all of this and the other half sees the screen as a clean slate. Personally, I think the screenwriters hit the mark almost perfectly and what isn't developed in Divergent will be better explained in Insurgent.The action sequences are fantastic and believable, from the first jump off the train to the iconic zip line ride through Chicago. Whether you've read the book or not, this is a movie for everyone. If you like a story of finding out who you are and where you belong, regardless of how difficult the path is, Divergent hits the mark, regardless of your age.

We are introduced to a world divided up into factions, each giving life and meaning to those who choose to be there. I had not read the book when I first saw the movie (my mistake) and found that I was completely lost through out the entire first 10 minutes of the film. The screenplay offers little to know back story and is extremely confusing to those who have never laid eyes upon Veronica Roth's series. I had to pause the movie and look up the basis of the plot before I could continue. Shailene, Theo, and Miles are all reputable actors however, once again (yes, I'm tired of saying it too) the screenplay was downright terrible and offered them little to nothing to work with. The director seemed to not grasp this and should've made changes while choosing which scenes to keep and which to cut, which was also another disappointment. We all know that you cannot condense EVERYTHING in a 300+ page novel into two hours, but they cut out some VERY pivotal scenes that could've provided a better opportunity for character development that seemed lacking. Theo being a fantastic actor seemed limited and a little two brooding or in the shadows than Four actually was in the novel. Even Miles! was outcast by some heavy-handed story telling. I am hopeful that Neil Burger will take this opportunity to up his future products, though I am glad Insurgent and Allegiant will have different directors.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2990992/?ref_=tt_urv","alexcomputerkid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44939296/?ref_=tt_urv","2 April 2014","After the success of the first Harry Potter movie that later that spawned a very successful series of movies or the Twilight movies that made big money off the "" teenage vampires and humans in love"" theme, it has become more and more common each year for the studios to look for successful teen novels that could spawn a film series. It does come at some risk though as a film like Vampire Academy from this year was a bomb and critically panned followed by a cancelled series. This was a prime example of a film based on a teen novel-based film that didn't quite work and there are other examples.Being not a reader of the Divergent book series, I was clueless as to what Divergent was all about. Based off the popular teen novel written by Veronica Roth, Divergent is a three part trilogy with two spin-off mini stories on e-books. In total, this series could be possibly five films and by judging from strong box office from it's first week, you wonder what kind of money how much a movie series like this could make or how long it could last.Based in the future in a dystopian society in Chicago, Divergent's setting is a world where everyone is put into specific factions based on their own virtues. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a ""divergent"", an extremely rare condition in which a person can't be assigned due to one faction because she has the attributes of many factions. Divergents are considered threatening by the government because they are free-thinkers who cannot be controlled by the government. Later after Tris puts herself into Dauntless, a faction of people based on courage, it becomes evident that the main faction leader Jeannie Matthews (Kate Winslet) is planning to kill any divergent that they can identify. Tris must find herself, fight her enemies and learn to survive all at the same time.Like The Hunger Games and other sci-fi films, I am always interested in seeing a dystopian society if done right. Shot in Chicago, this dystopian setting offers real some cool shots of the city including Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue. Most of the film interior sets are placed in what seems to be abandoned warehouses which gives the film a different and hollow atmosphere. This dystopian society of Chicago is enclosed by a big wall and it seems as if this government wants it's people to be held up within the walls forever. The movie gives no hints as to why the city is walled up or what is beyond the walls and you really would hope a sequel will give some type of explanation on this. Still though, the setting here is a strength of the film.With yet another correlation to Hunger Games, rising star, Shailene Woddley works as the young adult lead who's trying to rise up against this society and who you do root for. Her instructor for Dauntless, Four Eaton (Theo James) is both a mean and likable character and a romantic relationship eventually develops between the two. The chemistry between them is not there at first but it eventually falls into place. Peter (Miles Teller) is the mean member of Dauntless and you can say the only cast member who brings humor to the story. Divergent has a big cast filled with a lot of depth and emotions from the characters.Where the idea of ""training"" as Hunger Games was only a small aspect of that movie, one of the main themes of Divergent is training. The training is often brutal as we see many people trying to get into Dauntless who did not get to a certain level and then were thrown into the streets. Much of the training is people fighting one on one and further you are tested on your fears. For example, to even enter the training building, you have to jump down a big hole in a building where you do not know what is below.Unlike the Harry Potter movies or The Hunger Games, this is a much more dark film based on a teen novel. The overall tone is quite dark with a suicide and an attempted sexual assault depicted among other things. This might not be some of the most fun things to watch but it does add variety and possibly brings a slightly different audience to Divergent than some of the other teen films mentioned earlier.Divergent can be very long and also tiresome at points. It also has some lack of originality but there is still a lot to like here. Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I liked it like i enjoy fanfiction though. It doesn't really have this amazing plot line or trippy idealism like most distopias but that isn't necessarily what's wrong with it. The movie really relies on it's very well written love story (which is it's best quality) and almost neglecting character development besides the obvious main character arc. However much i enjoyed the thrilling romance i felt unchanged after watching it. The acting was good and so were most of the cgi scenes considering 2014. But all of this stays the same and even gets worse over the series as a whole. I love the love in these movies but am actually bored of the plot. Very very predictable. They heavily remind me of what the CW's the 100 tried desperately to be and what the hunger games never was (because it was way better). You can really tell they were ballin on a budget to.

By no means is this movie, slow. I even sneaked my 6 year old inside because had no babysitter.

Movie plot flow along like accountant's ledger book. There were some good idea along the way but none ventured to any degree (ability to watch other's dream? outside the wall? That freaking awesome looking wall itself!?) . Movie doesn't setup a believable premise of why decision was made on fraction social structure, what's the benefit  etc. Would've been a different movie entirely if we are currently living in that kind of society, and looking back at ourselves, but this is too simple of concept to be entertaining. Movie introduced an element which it did not fully exploit, or exploit at all. What's outside the wall? Why they put the wall up in the first place. Kate Winslet character was negligible, it could've been a computer doing all of it and it wouldn't have made any difference!The Good: Acting was good, I wasn't sure about how the Shailene Woodley and Theo James would do in their role, but surprisingly good. It's like putting to super models in a movie and hope they can get their line right, but turned out to be what could be career breakout performance. Especially from Woodley, very memorable. (Although to the end, if felt like her character did a 180 degree turn into heartless bitch, watching her father died like that) Production Value was good, production design, color, music, sounds work well and add to the movie instead of taking it away. Chicago setting wasn't the best, since I am from Indiana, and I know what's outside of that wall – Gary. Summary I can't say I liked because the plot was just so bad that it's sad. Idea is soooooo generic and not well setup up at all. Without a believable premise, everything else was like a long Music Video. Acting was surprisingly good, Woodley is both beautiful and inspirational in most part of the movie, and James was plain but enough for this movie. I think is 6 out of 10 is pretty good for what this movie is, if someone else played the part of Triss, I might've given it a 2 or 3.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Let's face it, the premise of HG was ridiculous. The acting was wonderful and Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. But the premise of Divergent is so much more probable (not just because I wrote a novel about 10 years ago with some similarities). Of course I had the same criticism. No one is just one aspect. But, for the age of adolescence, cliques are a painful reality; categories are everywhere: Nerd, Mean Girls, Grunge, Band Fags, Jocks, etc. But the acting is wonderful. The pieces in the mix, although familiar, fall together seamlessly. The dramatic suspense is at times very evocative. The timing and the choreography are fine tuned. The tension between actors is palpable.I entered a skeptic but left a convert. However, I remain skeptical about a sequel.

First you had ""Divergent"" and then you had ""Maze Runner""---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch ""The Hunger Games"" films and be done with it.So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry! My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

However, as you usually recognize short comings in movies that work with an adopted screenplay - this is not one of them. The movie feels cohesive and the leaps it has to make to get everything into a 2 hour flick are well executed, with seamless transitions throughout the story. But the story feels extremely derivative and offers nothing new or thought provoking, which could be due to the shallow incorporation of the whole back-story. It's hard to imagine the circumstances that lead to such a society depicted in the movie and so the parallels to our own society or which path could lead to such a society are missing (not very well explained). Also the whole time, while watching, I kept running thru a list of other movies this one ""knocked off"". In the end, it's a Hunger Games meets Equilibrium with nuances of Ultraviolet and Aeon Flux - and considering the novel was published only 3 years ago, I reckon that the whole trilogy is not very original. The acting is pretty decent but the chemistry between the leads is lacking - James appears to be a good actor but should have never been cast alongside Woodley who is really good in that role - though, both put together is just awkward to watch and it's easier to find a better Four than Tris. Bottom line, don't expect much and watch it purely to pass 2 hours of your time - then this one isn't a bad choice.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can't be. I want to be brave, and I want to be selfless, intelligent, and honest and kind. Well, I'm still working on kind.""Let me start off by saying that I had no prior knowledge of Veronica Roth's novel which this film is based on so I can't make any claims on how faithful the adaptation is. Although I will say that 5 minutes into the film I kind of got a feeling that this futuristic dystopian story had some similarities to The Hunger Games which made me wonder if Divergent was not yet another one of Suzanne Collins' novel adaptations. The main reasons why this film was among my most anticipated films for 2014 were director Neil Burger, for his unique work in Limitless and The Illusionist, and Shailene Woodley who has been terrific in just about every film I've seen her in. So I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that Divergent, which had a heavy message aimed towards young adolescents about not being labeled or categorized and discovering who you really were by following your own path in life, was being a bit hypocritical in its approach considering it can easily be categorized as yet another generic and formulaic teen romantic adventure film full of clichés. This was far from Burger's previous films which I found unique, perhaps due to their indie approach. However having said all this, I still found Divergent entertaining enough to mildly recommend it thanks in most part to the Shailene Woodley's lead performance. I'm not Divergent's target audience, but I think adolescents and young teenagers will love this film and their expectation will be fulfilled. They are the only reason why the planned sequels will get to be made, but the truth of the matter is that this is a much lesser film than The Hunger Games and will easily be forgotten in time.Vanessa Taylor and Evan Daugherty adapted the screenplay from Roth's novel setting the story in a futuristic dystopian Chicago where people live confined inside wired walls. They are also divided into five factions based on their virtues. Their is Abnegation who represent the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. The Abnegation faction are the ones in charge of governing the city considering they are selfless and always put others first. They are merciful people. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have been raised by their parents, Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and Natalie (Ashely Judd), in this faction, but when they turn 16 they are free to choose the faction they feel they belong with. Before they decide they must take a test which basically tells them what faction they really belong to, but they are free to decide on their own. Everyone always fits into one faction, but if you make a wrong choice you could end up factionless (homeless). When Tris takes the test she discovers she's one of the few people who is divergent (meaning she has basically all the virtues from every faction), but she must keep it to herself because these people don't fit in to this dystopian society where being different is viewed as something dangerous. When the day comes for Tris and Caleb to make their decision she ends up choosing Dauntless, who are basically in charge of the security and enforcing order in the city. Knowing that faction comes before family she must bid them farewell, and her training with Dauntless begins. At first she doesn't fit in due to the extreme physical and intense psychological tests that their instructors, Four (Theo James) and Eric (Jai Courtney), make them go through. If she doesn't pass the initiation program she will be sent with the factionless, but at the same time if they discover she is divergent, she could be killed so the adventure begins (and of course the romance as well).I enjoyed the performance from the young actors in this film and I think Woodley had great chemistry with James. A lot of people had issues with his performance, but I thought he was very believable and pulled it off well. The cast elevate this film and make the film's extended running time worth the while. There are some beautiful scenes that work really well in Divergent, I loved the cinematography and the dream sequences were probably the highlight of the film. There was also a scene where Tris went down a canopy line through the destroyed buildings that looked pretty cool. The story is formulaic and has its flaws. It felt melodramatic towards the end and tries too hard to leave audiences hooked for the sequel. The first part of the film suffers for taking to long to set things up and introducing each character, but once we are with Tris in Dauntless as she goes through the initiation process the film picks up. The film also fails to engage the audience as to why the divergent are so dangerous to their society, but it all seems to rely on the message the film is trying to give to young teenagers. It is a metaphor playing on the fear of adolescents of finding their place in society and discovering who they really are. It wasn't the film I was hoping for, but I am feeling merciful today so I will give it a passing grade.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hats off to Ellie Goulding and M83 for creating yet another masterpiece for the soundtracks. The music choice is what really got to me emotionally, it matched the film perfectly. I must say however, the trailer does the film no justice for I hadn't read the books and knew nothing of the plot. It looked cliché, lame and really bad. But boy was I wrong - I'm so glad i decided to watch this movie in cinemas for it is now my favourite movie! Some people didn't like the actors, but from the perspective of a person who hasn't read the books, Shailene Woodley and Theo James were too perfect, the chemistry was there and the relationship development was sweet and not too fast. Overall, brilliant actors, music, setting, plot, and a bunch of moving and important messages for young adults. This is a must see! p.s.don't forget a packet of Kleenex because i really wish i had some!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Edward being a strong supporting character was completely cut from the movie, including his stabbing. Will and Al were like twins and I found it quite difficult to tell between the two. Tris was a very intriguing character, in the novels at least. In the movie I thought she was okay, her actress was mediocre at best. Ansgel Elsgort who played Caleb I found annoying at times. The age difference between Tris and Four (Tobias) was weird. 16 and 24 (movie) vs 16 and 18 (book). Overall it wasn't bad like most films the book was better. I enjoyed it and would recommend, however just watch closely and have thick skin.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

An insult to human intelligence.The first 5 minutes of the film, focused on the essence. They where great. The rest of the long 2 hours where a bad mixture of the hunger games without the hunger, the matrix without mr Anderson, star treck without the stars, and dumb running, kicking, fighting, agonizing for no reason what so ever mambo jumbo. Overall quality? No better than a B class TV series. So why 7.4 in IMDb? Surely can't tell (paid reviews I presume). So I give a one star to balance things out. What is the message? In a future where mankind faces serious identity issues, where individuality is replaced by casts, where society is a threat to humanity... then what does one do??? Learn karate, pick up a gun and shoot the hell out of the bad guys!!! Wooaaoou! Totally mature and intelligent! I seriously prefer swangeneger's philoshopy 'Destroy da planat and get da hell oder heeer'.Hollywood's intention: Insult humans to the degree they begin to like it. Make ridiculous films so that every one turns into TV shows. Then keep serving them insulting TV shows... they won't mind... they are 'brain dead' to quality and originality. Thank's Hollywood, I'll pass (next time at least, cause I wasted 2 hours+ watching this crap).","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have a teenage daughter, and have been forced through such movies as Twilight, The Mortal Instruments, The Hunger Games, etc. I expected Divergent to be cut from the same cloth. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. In the beginning, I thought the main actor (played by Shailene Woodley) was going to be of the same laconic and expressionless school of acting as Kristen Stewart. Her initial naivety was a little hard to swallow, and I was almost sure her her entire personality throughout the movie would be lukewarm. By the end of the film, I felt as though she turned the performance around, and I genuinely felt myself pulling for her. One of the main differences between this movie and some of those I've listed, is the genuine lack of palpable danger. There was a darkness to this movie that didn't rely on the supernatural to hammer the point home. The dystopian future realized in this movie was much more believable than the one found in The Hunger Games (in my honest opinion). This is one of the better movies I've seen in this genre, and one I would not mind following to its completion. I'm looking forward to the sequels, and will definitely be going to theater to see this with my wife and daughter.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Whilst the 2nd and 3rd book are boring, if the movie was anything to go off, the next 2 movies will be amazing! Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four/Tobias) hit it of bring the latest ship FOURTRIS to the spotlight.

This is a teenage book, so it is logical that the movie is a teenage movie, no one can complain about it.So, is the film as good as the book ?Like always, the film is a bit less good because it cannot show all the details of the book, all the reactions of the characters but Neil Burger directed a very entertaining movie.The scriptwriter found a lot of staging tricks to put all the important details of the story in the movie even if the script is a bit different than the book.The actors respect their characters, they are really good in their roles. It is interesting because often, the adaptation of a book series allows to discover some new actors who create a new generation of actors.I think it is a good start for the franchise which follows the steps of Hunger Games.

Maybe even better than Hunger Games. Divergent thou have same problems than many other movies at the same genre. To maximize the profit movie violent must keep mild. If they would go to PG-15 instead of PG-13 they might get more depth to the movie. Also it might get more adult audience to watch it. Now this feels like Twilight meets Hunger Games. Story itself is quite fascinating, but it is too dragging. When something finally starts to happening movie comes to its end and you have to wait for sequel at least a year. Maybe two movies instead of three might work better. But the studios won't think viewers as much as they think profit. The problem here is that the second movie will be just a middle story to tell and you have to wait the third movie to see how the story will end. Chemistry between Tris and Four be conspicuously absent, but luckily Four is worth to watch; ) This movie is little bit better than average on its genre, but it might work better in 3D format.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No action, no comedy, no anything. Arguably is has a bit of drama but even that I found lame because it wasn't coupled with any good character development so I didn't really care for the good guys and was almost half rooting for the bad guys just so I can see some action.

A predictable storyline, along-with an excessive running-time over a 140-minutes, take away its glory, in totality. But Shailene Woodley makes for a worthy leading-lady & delivers a knock-out performance. 'Divergent' Synopsis: In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, Tris and the mysterious Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.'Divergent' is visually brilliant & some of the action set-pieces are absolutely stunning. But, the storyline & the narrative are so been-there-seen-that, that I wasn't engrossed after a point. While the first-hour moves on a slow-pace, the second-hour gathers momentum & offers a good climax. But overall, the result is just about average.Evan Daugherty & Vanessa Taylor's Adpated Screenplay has a few aces, but they aren't many. Neil Burger's Direction offers grandeur. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing isn't crisp. Art & Costume Design are superb. Graphics are outstanding.Performance-Wise: Woodley shines & steals the show. She's in terrific form & leads the film's stilted narrative with a knock-out performance. Theo James has the tapping's of becoming a fine actor. He's impressive. The always-excellent Kate Winslet adds a streak of delicious menace, despite limited screen-time. Zoë Kravitz is natural. Miles Teller is perpetually irritating. Ashley Judd is first-rate.On the whole, 'Divergent' is a so-so fare. Watch it for Woodley!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have seen this movie FOUR times now in a week. Love this movie! I am not in the age range of teen to twenties that they did the movie for. Sadly for me I'm well beyond those days, but LOVED the movie any way. Took some of my friends in their 30s and they loved it too. The theater has been so quiet during the movie. Everyone is so into the movie. This is the quietest I have heard a theater in years. I have not read the books yet but had an interest from the trailers and finding Theo James in the movie. The cast selection is wonderful. The cast all seem to have a chemistry together and were placed in the perfect roles for them to play. I very much enjoyed the story and am planning to read the first 2 books soon. This breaks my rule of reading the book before the movie but something Theo James said has my interest really peaked to read the second book too. Theo James blew me away in this movie. He has inspired me through his portrayal of Four to want to try to live life more and to attack my goal of losing weight again even though I had given up on myself. The movie is action packed! Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your toes wondering what will happen next. I find in most movies in the last 5 years or so that my mind wanders and I get bored during some point in the movie. This is not the case with Divergent. Two thumbs up and a YEEEHAW (I'm from Texas) from me. Can hardly wait for the second movie and for the Blu Ray so I can continue watching. If I had to compare to another movie of course Hunger Games comes to mind. I enjoyed those movies very much as well, but would choose Divergent over Hunger Games. It was just so tightly put together and ended in a fashion where it could be a stand alone movie and didn't leave you hanging like that's it!?! Thank you all and best wishes to the Cast and Crew!!! I read there was a lot of pressure to make this movie great. Mission accomplished!!! But, I imagine the pressure will be just as bad or worse to make sure the second movie is just as strong and solid. All my best to you!!! I have faith it will also be a grand slam! :)","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Thought of it as just another teen novel turned into a movie like Twilight. Surprisingly, the movie was pretty good. I loved its premise. A post apocalyptic world where Chicago is like Mankind's last safe place left surrounded by a huge wall. A five factions system ensures that no further war ever takes place. Kinda reminded me of Equilibrium and Hunger games. The story was pretty good. It follows a girl who tries to find her role in this faction system. The actress who played her did a fine job in my opinion. Liked her slow transformation, it was one of my favourite thing about the movie, her whole journey after joining a faction of her choosing, it was really good. Kate winslet plays the main baddie and she was pretty good. The rest of the cast was from okayish-lame. There were some emotional scenes here and there too, some executed perfectly, while others hastily.The CGI was a mixed bag. Some shots were good, while many weren't. Didn't distract much from the movie so that's a plus. Liked the soundtrack, had some nice pieces. The main dude was very generic however and just wasn't good for the most part. Also, the movie had some pacing issues, it often slowed down. And then there was the LOVEY DOVEY stuff that you get in these teen novels movie adaptations, never liked em and didn't liked it this time either. Still, a pretty good flick worth checking out. 7.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While some are successes, such as ""The Hunger Games"", there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film ""Divergent"" rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.In ""Divergent"", which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"" but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like ""Logan's Run"". Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in ""Elysium"" with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific ""The Spectacular Now"", Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.While ""The Hunger Games"" shows its points through a grand and epic scale, ""Divergent"" is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. ""Divergent"" maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the ""perfect society","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6690619/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","13 March 2021","The world of Divergent is curious. In the opening minutes, Tris (Shailene Woodley) explains to the viewer that, in the not too distant future, the city of Chicago is destroyed and the residents were divided into factions, according to their qualities and choices: Selflessness, composed of altruists, current leaders; Dauntless, for the brave who act as policemen; Friendship, for the affectionate (and dressed like hippies); Candor, for those who speak only the truth; and Erudition, formed by intellectuals (and who may be plotting a coup d'état).Those who do not fit into any of the groups become homeless. But at the age of 16, the destiny can be much worse: those who fall into more than one of the factions are called divergent, hunted, imprisoned and even killed. But how did this separation occur? Nobody protested at the beginning? What was there before the division? Why are these five factions, and not others? The division system accounts for professions such as farmers (Amity), lawyers (Erudite) and guards (Dauntless), but where are the doctors, the artists? What do those of Candor do? It is not known. Perhaps the book explains this social and historical context well, but the film does not provide explanations.Disobedience, then, is something that is expected of teenagers, like any rite of passage. A bestseller among young people, Divergent embraces in a painless and behaved way (the only real break in Beatrice's life is also expected and obligatory, farewell to parents) the idea that the world is a place to be physically explored. Extreme sports and games are at the heart of that experience in the film, and while there is a minimal sense of threat - deaths are considerably more shocking in The Hunger Games - it is inevitable to see the heroine's journey in this film as a ride through an amusement park.Evan Daugherty, newcomer who wrote the script for Snow White and the Hunter, adapted with Vanessa Taylor the futuristic plot that runs, in good measure, as an American high school story, varnishing the mandatory division of groups in the cafeteria (nerds, athletes, patricinhas etc. here they just change their name), with the right to flirt between one burger and another. The screenwriters little explore the relationships between their characters with themselves and between them, failing to get the basics, which is to give the audience reason to care about the fate of those figures. Even the initial premise of the franchise is used minimally and ends up being almost neglected in favor of a novel pushed down to the audience.Based on the success of The Hunger Games saga, it was only a matter of time before another plot appeared in the cinemas that referred to a dark and totalitarian future. However, Divergent is inferior in terms of the Katniss Everdeen saga in terms of visual effects and art direction. The Hunger Games presented a boldness for costumes and sets that the world of Tris does not dare to imagine. The futuristic scene in Chicago is very minimalist, as if the future did not bring many aesthetic changes in relation to the present (or as if art directors had a reduced budget to work). Abnegation residents are known for their vow of poverty, but the other factions have similarly simple clothes and visual identities. Perhaps the greatest example of little visual inventiveness is Jeanine Matthews' (Winslet) costume, which should represent power, authority and coolness, but looks just like any executive. However, what takes a little interest out of the film are some (dozens) of poor dialogues, which may not even need to be in the script.As for the plot itself, The Hunger Games removes the structure of young people who fight among themselves to select the strongest - to impose a logic of bread and circus, in the case of Katniss's story, and by self-imposition of the young people themselves, in the case of the violent internal rules of Dauntless. Both governments are tyrannical, but Divergent's seems more perverse, since the residents themselves have assimilated the rules and started to reproduce the logic of extermination on their own. As for the script, it's a shame that the surprising amount of twists and turns in Divergent ends up sacrificing tension. Important moments such as Dauntless tests, or Tris' aptitude test are revealed without any suspense, without scenes of anticipation. When the tests start, Tris is always one of the first to participate, enters the room quickly and does what she has to do. If he had more time or more attention to the pace, the director would be able to build a claustrophobic atmosphere - which The Hunger Games achieved most successfully in its gaming arena.The film loses a little of its potential when it does not free itself and the ordinary. The novel inserted in the story proves to be potentially distracting. The construction of the main character is interesting and the show is becoming strong and fearless, but the possibility of this being eclipsed by her relationship with the character Four is strong. Thus, the message loses power in the face of the romantic ending that the character may or may not have. The need to serve larger audiences is stronger than the message that it is possible to be different and that there is no mistake in that.Another failure was to structure the film in such a way that moments lost due importance. We see the character entering various situations of overcoming and challenging throughout the film, but the last challenges and overcoming are superficial and frivolous, not receiving much attention or even generating consequences for the character. In its struggle to free itself from the motto ""faction before the blood"" the film ends up taking the character away from the colon, in addition to simplistic resolutions at certain times and total detachment with characters and their deaths.Divergent has some advantages over the other franchises mentioned. There are many more scenes of action, combat, more blood and more training that Tris must go through. The script calmly accompanies the girl's improvement in the art of war - unlike Katniss, she has no innate talent before entering the ""games"", in this case, the training. The training pace is good, convincing, and Shailene Woodley is able to cope with the character's complexity, especially in times of tension, such as fear scenarios and knife testing. Director Neil Burger's camera constantly focuses on the actress's face, showing that the director knows where the biggest weight of the film resides. But, considering the violent universe in which Tris gets involved in choosing the Dauntless faction, Neil Burger's cowardice in showing the consequences of the training (and, later, of the military actions) perpetrated by the group, greatly minimizes the impact of these scenes. It is not about glorifying violence, but about showing more seriously its physical and emotional consequences, something that ""Hunger Games"", produced by the same Lionsgate / Summit has done so well. Some deaths that occur during the projection do not have the dramatic resonance that is required of them, because director Neil Burger seems to want to spare the audience any more uncomfortable emotions. Moments of tension, fear and excitement are present throughout the plot, but the often static camera dissolves part of what we should feel during these scenes, which then must only depend on the performance of the actors, who save at times.Overall, Neil Burger - the same as No Limits with Bradley Cooper - should be able to please fans and also those who are unaware of the books. Although not daring visually, limited to filming his characters up close and creating great aerial shots of the futuristic city (which reveal the limitation of special effects), Burger knew how to explore certain elements of the story, such as the half-destroyed city of Chicago, which it served to dictate the tone that the film needed. Neil still changed the end of the film a little, differentiating it from the original version (but not much) which ended up creating a very interesting outcome. The soundtrack, produced by none other than Hans Zimmer in partnership with Junkie XL and Ellie Goulding, is simply sensational and fits very well with all the scenes.Even so, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face. It is also worth highlighting the protagonist's simple and punctual romance with leader Four, without excessive love scenes. Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, the film managed to fulfill the two biggest challenges it faced: including as much of the story as possible in the script while maintaining its loyalty, to please the fans of the book, and explaining the minimal bases of the story, to those who still don't know the work of Veronica Roth. Despite having a slow pace (it's 2h20 of film), Divergent's script does not compromise by giving time for the story to be told smoothly (although a 15 or 20-minute edition would do the plot well). And, of course, there are hooks for the sequels, since the film is the first in a trilogy. The tip is to enter the room without waiting too long and leave satisfied after the session with a film that fulfills its goal: entertaining the audience. What is already more than could be imagined in a plot that, at first, seems to be a mixture of so many copies aimed at teenagers and launched on screens in recent years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is set in a dystopian future where society is divided into five factions based on personality traits, and follows the story of Tris Prior (played by Shailene Woodley), a young woman who discovers she is ""Divergent"" and does not fit neatly into any one faction.The world-building in Divergent is impressive, with a detailed and well-crafted society that feels both familiar and unique. The action scenes are intense and well-executed, with a good balance between physical combat and emotional tension. The film also explores themes such as identity, conformity, and the dangers of a society that values conformity over individuality.The cast is excellent, with Woodley delivering a standout performance as Tris. She brings both vulnerability and strength to the role, making Tris a relatable and inspiring protagonist. Theo James also shines as Four, Tris's love interest and mentor, bringing a quiet intensity to the character.While the movie does have some flaws, such as pacing issues and a lack of depth in some of the supporting characters, it still manages to be an entertaining and thought-provoking film. It successfully captures the spirit of the novel and delivers a satisfying adaptation that will appeal to both fans of the book and newcomers to the series.In conclusion, Divergent is a well-made and exciting film that offers a fresh take on the dystopian genre. With a great cast, strong themes, and impressive world-building, it's a movie that is sure to please fans of young adult fiction and action movies alike.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What about if the group you choose you belong to does not include your family? What if you unraveled a secret plan that was created to destroy people just like you? This is exactly what Tris must go throughout the film Divergent. In a world where people are divided into factions based on human virtues, Tris Prior is forewarned she is Divergent and will never fit into any one of these factions. When she discovers a conspiracy by a faction leader to destroy all Divergents, Tris must learn to trust a complicated character, Four, and together they must stop this faction leader from destroying the Divergents before it's too late.Walking into my town's local movie theater to watch Divergent, I didn't know what to expect. Not having read the book, I was a little bit skeptical going in. Many people raved about the book, but watching the previews on television, I wasn't very impressed. I thought it was going to be one of those film adaptations that people generally weren't really satisfied with like Twilight. I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. Maybe not having the book to compare it to helped with my enjoyment, but coming from my perspective, it was better than I expected it to be. The advancement of the film's plot may have started out a little slow and was a bit confusing for those of us who have not read the book, but by the end, I fortunately understood what was happening and where they were going from there.I was impressed with how the actors and actresses developed their characters throughout the film. They showed us, the audience, who these characters were and were able to portray their personalities while the plot of the film developed further. Going along with that, the plot took a little bit to get going and capture my interest. The entire time while watching the film, I was wondering when the 'divergent' part was going to come in, and it didn't truly show itself until close to the end. Having the book and film called Divergent, I was hoping for a little more insight into what being divergent meant.I've always been a big supporter of music in films and its importance and Divergent didn't let me down. I thought the music choices for this film were spot on. Each song supported the scene it was matched with perfectly. The music kept the general feel of the film moving forward despite the slow moving plot. It was a more modern type of film, so the use of ""new"" sounding music made the film more believable.Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the film. Of course there are things that I disliked about it, but that goes for anything. I was certainly pleased with the final product created by the collaboration of director Neil Burger, author Veronica Roth and screenplay writer Evan Daugherty. I am looking forward to see what the next two movies have to offer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:""A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists."" sounds familiar?Please stop paying for such movies.

These factions include Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Everyone (when they reach the age of 16) is assigned to take a psychological test that determines what faction they should join, and in the end, they are allowed to choose the faction of their choice. Tris takes the test and gets the rarest result--Divergent, which means she would not fit any particular faction. When she chooses Dauntless, she and the faction leader Four (played by Theo James) discover the plot to assassinate all who are Divergent as they seen as a threat to social order; and decide they must fight back.To be clear, I never actually read the novel. Upon watching this, however, I found it very similar to the Hunger Games series. They both take place in a dystopian society that is divided up into factions (or districts), except there is no teenagers fighting to the death in a large arena in this one. While this wasn't as exciting and enthralling as the Hunger Games, it was very compelling and interesting to watch. The characters were great, I love how Shailene Woodley played Tris. It was a very interesting role her, especially since her role in the ABC family series ""Secret Life of An American Teenager"". Theo James was.........I guess okay as Four. I don't know if he was the best, but he didn't do too bad. The plot was pretty good, although it did drag a little bit in some spots. There were several scene where I started to lose interest, but when it reached it's climax, it got exciting. I enjoyed the climax towards the end, especially with Kate Winslet playing Jeanine, who is behind the whole to plot to take out the Divergents.Divergent is a pretty decent movie, although it might have been better if I read the novel series before hand. Yes, the film has its flaws but its intriguing to watch and if you a big fan of the novel series, you'll just might enjoy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The characters in the movie are wonderful and are very good actors. My favorite character is Four (Theo James) because he is very handsome and strong and he can fight very good in the movie. My second favorite character is obviously Tris (Shailene Woodley) because she is very beautiful and also strong but is always there for people and she cares for what is happening in the world and she protects her kind and family from enemy's. The connection between Tris and Four makes my heart melt. They have so much in common and they really do love each other. I give the movie 10 stars because it deserves 10/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

These Factions, as they are called, are designed to maintain peace so war won't happen again. Tris (Shailene Woodley) leans toward Dauntless, but she really doesn't fit in there. She is Divergent (free thinker, non conformist) and Divergents are considered dangerous and may be put to death. This can't be good. I believe we have found another Katniss as Tris (Shailene) reminds us of another HUNGER GAMES kind of thing. I will admit that in the beginning when they showed Tris, I saw Katniss. See? There are some differences: no bows and arrows, no killing of children. The children in here undergo intense initiation training that can kill them if they are not careful enough. But, make no mistake about it, this is still a dictatorship under the guise of peaceful Factions. Their mantra is Faction before Blood. The real culprit that this dictatorship wants to control and eliminate is: The Human Condition. Can you believe that? Who makes this stuff up? (dictators is the answer) As we looked to Katniss to affect change, we now look to Tris to do the same. But, this won't be easy. She doesn't have a bow and arrows. Oh, oh How can she do this?Most of the movie shows the training of Dauntless hopefuls and some of it is hard to watch. This training focuses on individual fears and how the candidates perform when confronted with his/her greatest fear. In time we get to see a love story, sort of, and hope for the best, of course. We watch Tris try to qualify and not be dropped out of the program. But, to be fair, it's the love story angle that keeps us in our seats. We know it's there, however, that aspect takes a long time to crystallize, but we are a patient audience and believe we will be rewarded in time. The fight scenes and acting all around are very good. Besides Shailene as Tris another standout is Theo James as Four who comes across as a very strong character. There was a little joke in the beginning when Four announces his name and one of the candidates says to him, ""Four? Were 1, 2 and 3 already taken?"" We are told that the candidates are only to speak when spoken to. So right here we know the candidates will be in for a rough time of it. The rest of the cast performed well and Ashley Judd as Tris' mother, Natalie, does a credible job. Seems most of the candidates have to have tattoos and we can only hope they are washable.Over all a pretty good Sci-Fi story. The ending leads us to believe there will be a sequel or sequels. Can't wait, can you? (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.Looking forward to the next installment.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

When the trailers were starting I said to myself, ""maybe it's not gonna be that bad, maybe I might really like it."". Then the opening narration started, and I knew I was going to be tortured. What followed was a long, (or at least felt long) crap-fest that rips off who knows how many movies. Bad acting, bad plot, bad action, and just plain bad. So far this is the only time I've fallen asleep in a theater. A lot of people are saying Shaliene Woodley is a good actress but after seeing this, I'm never going to agree with them. For Hollywood cash grabs, this is definitely one of the worst. To quote Roger Ebert, ""This is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, nor it is not under the barrel, it isn't ever the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence as the barrel."". People, save your money, skip this movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks. My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable. My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done. Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In ""Divergent"" the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making ""Divergent"" references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us!

I expected that this movie would be a really hard sci-fi movie (at least from the poster) but was extremely light at this part, the action was light too and it wasn't till almost the end of the movie where it was not so much. T think this movie was more a psychological one than action or sci-fi one. The end of the movie I think was a bit rush but in rest all was natural to me. At least that is how I felt. The only thing I didn't liked it was the lack of emotions (or very few emotion) from actors. Maybe this movie isn't like the book and maybe people are just too mean.

I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sounds like most young adult novels being made into movies but, loosely summarized, that is the plot for Divergent. While not having personally read the books I was familiar with the series from seeing the distinctive covers monopolizing shelves in bookstores.It is in the details that Veronica Roth's novel Divergent differentiates itself from its peers. The tale begins in the future in a decimated Chicago some time after a debilitating war. Society is no longer sustainable as a democracy and a new system is set up to prevent future conflict and maintain peace. Now the population is divided into virtuous factions: altruistic Abnegation, intellectual Erudite, kind Amity, honest Candor, and protector Dauntless. Adherence to the faction system is imperative to its success and is dependent upon individuals within the population identifying and belonging to a specific faction, and only one faction. Those who identify with multiple are called Divergents and can not be controlled or contained.Beatrice is the daughter of one of the superiors within the Abnegation faction; the faction that governs the city. She and her brother Caleb are of age to test and choose a faction they will remain with the rest of their lives. When Beatrice takes the aptitude test the results are inconclusive, a rarity and a dangerous one at that, and she must choose her own path. Though truly a Divergent she chooses fearless Dauntless.She leaves her life and family behind, transforming from Beatrice to Tris. Along with the other transfers she begins training as Dauntless under the coaching of Four. She must persevere and prove herself Dauntless or be cast aside to the undesirable factionless if she falls below approval standards. Or worse, be killed if found out to be Divergent. All the while the Erudite faction are working tirelessly to discredit and overthrow abnegation to become the new ruling faction.It's a riveting tale for the YA book adaptation Divergent. The back-story is fed to audiences well to provide sufficient narrative seamlessly within the protagonist's plot. The film is action packed with fight scenes with a minor love interest line for the teens. All casting and acting is spot on. The set design really produces a dilapidated cityscape with costumes modern enough to pass for a sci-fi future. Divergent is good despite what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster to appease the masses and make boatload of money.The issue is with the character development which is lacking as soon as Tris lands in the headquarters of Dauntless. At that point, all evolution is from the physical training and the film turns into one fight scene after the other and the movie just blends and fades. There just has to be something more to the story between the characters in the literature. The audience is supposed to believe that the teens are fighting for their livelihoods but there are few exchanges besides pats on the back and chummy punches to the arm.Divergent is action packed, glossing over development details rather than creating a fully realized futuristic story. Hollywood gets its hands in Roth's novel and turns it into a typical blockbuster with the unrelated top-40 soundtrack to match. These minor details should not deter those from enjoying the film. If you look deep within the plot you will find darker broader themes regarding conformity and independence.More recent movie reviews can be found at our website.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The five factions are: Abnegation, the pious; Erudite, the smart ones; Amity, the peace lovers; Candor, the honest, and Dauntless, the brave ones who are in essence the city's police.Our heroine is Tris, who joins Dauntless after the being brought up by her parents in Abnegation. This is after tests are conducted (think Hogwarts Sorting Hat) to determine which faction candidates would be best suited to, and hers are revealed to be- as you can work out from the title- Divergent i.e. having attributes from multiple factions. The factions have been set up to retain order in the city and thus, ""Divergents"" undermine the system and must be eliminated. I can't fully get on-board with this idea though as I find it puzzling that the vast majority of the population can have just one attribute. What's stopping one from being- God forbid- smart *and* peace-loving? Dauntless also spend a lot of the time jumping around and being a parody of parkour enthusiasts.The social commentary is weak in comparison to the Hunger Games and it borrows narrative elements from the superior Ender's Game. However it leaves just enough intrigue to make me want to return for the next in the series.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As you can tell it was not done right.The actors all with the exception of the main actress did very bad. the visuals were not very impressive. This whole experience of this movie was like being attacked my an angry squirrel. just annoying and still just leaves a empty feeling.I give this a one star because there was just nothing.","23 out of 55 found this helpful.

You can see where they tried to throw in all the de rigueur elements: There's a social status quo that people accept and within which they operate. This is a little like the Matrix, except that there's (spoiler) the sense, by the story's end, that the social system in Divergent fails not because it's a systemic horror-show illusion (a la Matrix), but because the checks and balances fail; so Divergent doesn't *really* go for broke in that sense.There's a VO backstory involving a war and the city of Chicago being surrounded by an odd sort of ""wall"". This comes off like a quaint throwback to Blade Runner, with it's backdrop social reality of off- planet white flight. The difference is that Blade Runner's social backdrop feels strangely warm and contiguous with our reality, whereas Divergent's feels contrived for the express purpose of explaining how the ""new"" Chicago's progenitors got pushed to contrive the faction system. Frankly, I prefer a backdrop that looks like a version of ""home""; and that shouldn't just be another contrivance to ""explain"" things.I think the flick was supposed to be an extended parable on the importance of mutation for survival. But, in the end, I wasn't convinced that it sheds light on this; it veered too far into future dystopia action hero fantasy shoot-'em-up territory. We're supposed to understand that the heroine transcends her faction. In the end, it just sorta looks like she simply lucks into the position of getting the big picture and then using her faction-developed skills to blast through and stop the malefactors.There's a lot of stuff in the flick that doesn't seem to gel. There's an interpersonal antagonism within the heroine's caste that seems more designed to generate dramatic tension than it does to demonstrate caste- functional social behaviors; in other words, from time to time, writing for character just doesn't compute. In the end (spoiler) there's a deus ex machina moment where we're to believe a drug-programmed person is induced to snap out of it at the point where the heroine just-so-happens to need his aid to extricate her from yet-another brush with death, so she can go on to save the day.What's good about the flick? The actors were marvelously professional, and took direction exceedingly well. Set work, effects, stunts, shots, editing, and scene-by-scene dramatic flow was managed well, in a general sense. Production work was fully what one would expect from a contemporary sci-fi action flick. Hollywood has honed that stuff down to a razor sharpness which is always a marvel to behold; and might even see you through the viewing with nary a thought to leaving the theater or ejecting the medium from your video box.But if you're hoping to see the next mindblower sci-fi wunderkind, abandon hope.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm a big fan of sci-fi films and from the trailer and the hype, the film was set out to be something incredibly cool nonetheless, but in practice, it really didn't pan out upon watching it, my main concern was the emotional moments, they were rushed and happened to soon between one another we wasn't given enough time to connect with the main character, it was too sudden and it had no emotional effect. The concept was a good idea, but the acting was especially poor when they were pretending to be vacant, it didn't look good. Basic acting like the moment she woke up, the person she wakes up to immediately walks in as if he knows she will wake up, and she sits up- right immediately, who even does that, come on... I'm disappointed overall without a doubt I expected more but alike the existing ratings it isn't getting a good score from me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

She joins the Dauntless and meets the mysterious Four (James), the trainer of the initiates, together their romance is budding through the training programs; then they discover Erudite leader Jeanne (Winslet) is scheming to annihilate and usurp the Abnegation faction (which is the present authority and where Tris' parents belong) to be the ruling class, meanwhile Dauntless members are hypnotised as the killing machine, only the divergent are immune to it. So by the end of the first chapter of the trilogy, they temporarily sabotage Jeanne's plan, which persists in eradicating the weakness aka. human nature out of human beings, but as cheesy as it sounds, actually love cannot be eradicated. Visual effects are mediocre at its best, the paralleled shift between the virtual and real world is less glamorous but pertinent to the engaging buildup of Tris' character, the mid-way rope- sliding in the night is a catharsis to feel thrilled and emboldened. The white-knuckle, adrenaline-driven, money-spending high point was never set alight, the entire procedure to scotch the scheme looks jejune, the last ditch to turn Jeanne into doing Tris' bidding is a knockout, but before that, the whole plan is a disorganised hash, the puny suspense agglomerated through the acting-like-robots gimmick never pay off, not to mention a hasty design to kill off Tris' parents, who else is psyched and wants to watch Ashley Judd kick more asses? On the philosophical ground, a future nation originated by Veronica Roth actually makes more sense than say, THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10), a virtue-divided society could be an ideal notion if only multiple options are applied. Our current spirit is that we should never be classified as any types, multifariousness is the keynote, so the vehement repercussions of its novel sources are totally justifiable. Shailene Woodley is the key to the success of the franchise, a timid next-door-girl as the first impression, but she has a dogged willpower, dare to chase her dream and bear a heroine's affinity, it is her star-making turn after her breakthrough in THE DESCENDANTS (2011, 8/10). Theo James, memorably remembered in his one-episode only guest appearance in the British sensational hit DOWNTON ABBEY (the unfortunate Mr. Pamuk), is a new rising star, DIVERGENT is his well-suited springboard, it is never too late to be a hot teen throb. Winslet, for the first time as a villainess in a studio project, similar to Jodi Foster in ELYSIUM (2013, 7/10), harbouring a high-flown goal but has little to offer except her evil mindset.I think I will be looking forward to the chapter two because I am hooked to see what will happen in the following step, which I have no clue since I prefer movie to book as a media to chiefly dispense my energy with, at any rate, THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is officially on and a young heart dies hard.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Turned out it wasn't like that. Many around me compared it to the Hunger Games and I suppose that in some ways it resembles it, but personally I think Divergent is so much better. I honestly don't care that much about small movie mistakes, such as the wound at her ear or stuff like that. It's not those details that give the quality of a movie. The acting does and I was very pleased with the acting. It suited the subject and the atmosphere the movie tried to create. So I'm looking forward for the sequels. My only hope is that the sequels won't be boring or exaggerated, like man sequels are. This is why sequels usually suck compared to the first movie.

Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villanious Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose?

Dystopian stories are something I find fascinating. That being said, this is very reminiscent of a futuristic version of Hunger Games. Strong female protagonist from a group not looked upon highly. Said protagonist takes a huge chance, which in The Hunger Games eventually leads to her fighting corrupt government...not a spoiler, because I'm not saying anything about Divergent. If it's the exact same plot that's not my fault.And nothing is wrong with them having extremely similar plots. It's how the directors go about it. The grit and grunge of a dystopian world can be done well. This movie, however, did not do so. Many of the darker instances of the book that help truly develop the characters lack intensity in the movie, if they're in at all. The dialog is stilted; it's how many people write their first story. ""Instead of me writing what's happening and why, I'll just have my characters blatantly say it.""The only thing that gives this movie any saving grace are the actors portraying these roles. You hate the bad ones, you love the good ones. Their acting cannot save the dialog. Or story. Or set design. Or the soundtrack many other reviewers have been raving about. If you want the soundtrack just go buy an Elie Goulding CD.On the whole, not worth seeing in theaters. It's an entertaining plot that is toned down for mass appeal. Too much is shoved in. There are many scenes that should be shortened, and a select few that should be lengthened. If you read the books, you'll enjoy the movie. If you're under the age of 15. Even then, you'll be noticing the disappointment in Woodley's eyes as she realizes this film is mediocre at best. It seems like a young Veronica Roth got excited to see her name on the big screen and gladly sold out to make a relatively family friendly movie, following the teenage rebellion girl trend, despite the fact that the entire concept of the book is that Tris is different.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

I loved how they kept the same parts from the book and didn't change their order. I loved how dramatic it was and how much action there was.The only thing I didn't like was that they cut out some parts.This is a great movie because of the action. the people who are in this movie are Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four/ Tobias (Theo James) Eric (Jai Courtney) Tori (Maggie Q) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) are the main people we are going to be talking about.People who would like this are people who like Twilight , The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies with like a little romance to it.The good thing is about not having all the parts from the book is that they can make the plot better and spend more time and money on that rather than the other parts in the book. The plot is that Tris and Four (Tobias) are Divergent so Eric injected a serum in both of them but it didn't work on them because they were Divergent they were trying to blend in they were going to war against Abnegation The Faction they were from and since it didn't work on them Eric tried to kill Four but he didn't know he was Divergent but Triss shot Eric in the ankle so then they figured out that they were Divergent and caught them and brought them to Jeanine. She want to kill all the Divergent but she made a serum and it only worked on Four and because she wanted to kill Tris but she didn't get killed because her mom saved her and she also saved Four.Overall this movie is great you should watch itI still think it is 10 out of 10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Shailene is phenomenal as the lead role Tris. She embodied the character perfectly and made me tear up on several occasions. Although this movie is relatively long, it didn't seem like it. Each scene was important in the story and action packed. Kate Winslet was able to evoke a very intelligent character in the way she portrayed a person who, although we think is evil, really believes in what she's doing. The only negative critique I would have on this movie is that, having never read the books, the other characters were not developed as much and it was hard knowing who was who. This isn't a girl falls in love with boy kind of movie, it is strong and brave and never ceased in action.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

For DIVERGENT I'm going to try and give a quick review on what I loved, and not going to go scene by scene like people would normally do. There is only one word that describes the whole movie for me, and that is-EPIC! Best movie of 2014 so far. I want to go see it again, and again. You could tell the director and actors put a lot of effort into the movie, and it paid off wonderfully. I thought since Summit Entertainment was doing the production then it would suck and regrettably stupid just like TWILIGHT but surprisingly they did an amazing job with the movie. There was a lot of action, a cheesy romantic scene, and a few kisses here and there but overall the action-pack made up for it. Characters- The actors true to their word, stuck to the book characters as much as any person could, and as much as I wished it could have I really wanted Tris to be attacked just like in the books but it turned out a bit differently as I thought it would be.Now everyone's question was it like the book? When a book turns into a movie, they can't stick chapter by chapter to the book, sorry, I know it's horrible but it's the truth, it stuck maybe 20% of the book, but you couldn't really tell that it was skimmed over, it was that good.Music-The soundtrack is amazing, and I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. One of my favorite songs on the track is Ellie Goulding's song Beating Heart.Overall DIVERGENT is a movie that is action packed, suspenseful, and a pinch of romance movie that is a 2014 Best movie so far this year. It's a MUST SEE. I do not regret a thing.Rating: 5 Plus Stars.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

This one's almost exactly the same as THE HUNGER GAMES, featuring a dystopian future world (is there any other type?) split into five different factions. Teenagers must choose a faction in which to live for the rest of their lives.Yes, it's exactly like somebody watched or read the first Harry Potter film/novel, decided that the whole sorting hat thing was a cool motif and that they could write a whole book series with it applied to real life. Unfortunately, that opening plot point is the only thing this film has going for it, as the rest of it is mere set-up. We watch characters interacting, getting to know one another, and training - lots and lots of TRAINING - for over two hours before an action narrative sort of hits in the last half hour.The lack of incident and completely predictability of what's taking place on screen - we've been through all this training stuff before in the first two HUNGER GAMES movies and it was boring then - make DIVERGENT a real chore to sit through. I don't know why these films have to have such lengthy running times and so much exposition when all of the stuff we see could have been depicted in a mere half an hour with a handful of pithy moments instead of endless self-indulgence and stretched-out moments. CGI training sequences are not something I enjoy watching.What I did like about DIVERGENT is that it has decent characterisation for once, much better than in the Jennifer Lawrence franchise. Shailene Woodley is a decent young actress and completely sympathetic in the lead role, and newcomer Theo James makes an impact as her mentor. The supporting cast features the impressive likes of Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, and Tony Goldwyn, alongside more minor bits for Kate Winslet and Maggie Q, and overall the calibre of the acting is strong. It's just a shame that there's no story to go with the characters; I can accept and enjoy well-plotted movies without characterisation, but a film with good characters and no plot is doomed from the outset. We'll see where the sequels go with this...","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Little did I know.The basic idea of the movie: We live in a post-war world, where people are divided into factions, based on virtues. As young adults, they got to chose which one they want to join. Surprise surprise, we find ""divergents"", people that don't fit into the system and are threatening its existence. They are chased and killed in a totalitarian system. Sounds familiar? I hope so, otherwise you have missed lots of movies in the last decades. The last one I have seen was ""Upside Down"", and it wasn't a great movie either, but it is so much better. And it has only a score of 6.4, I just really don't understand that.There's really not much to say about the movie itself. Lots of martial arts and gunfights, some kind of a love story, political intrigue. Characters without faces, intentions without sense, a movie without a justification for existence.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Not loyal on the book? Well, I think some changes, additions, and omissions have to be made to fit a novel for a full-feature film. Clichéd young-adult movies? What do you call the Marvel movies then? I'm gonna review this for what I've seen. I'll be fair to judge this on its content, not on loyalty or formula.In ""Divergent"", Tris grows up in a world where society is divided into five faction based on virtues. She discovers to be a Divergent, not fitting to only one faction. Her seemingly utopian world becomes a dystopian one. This film is very relatable to audiences ages 13-21. This is the stage where we wanna know where we belong and what we wanna do with our lives. The Faction System is a thought-provoking idea. What if you'll value faction over blood? Friends over family? I love the world-building invested on Abnegation (selfless), Dauntless (brave), and Erudite (smart). I love the action scenes. I'm impressed with Shailene Woodley and Theo James's athleticism to perform most of their stunts. I love how the plot runs. It's not too slow or not too fast. If you wanna enter a new world that is very close to our real one, watch ""Divergent"".","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The bottom line here is about the violent overthrow of a benevolent government. While far from perfect, these benevolent rulers are certainly 1000 times better than being governed by psychopathic killers dressed in business suits! Another message from Divergence: Some people use fear to their advantage, they are awakened by it, while others are overwhelmed and are ""shut-down"" by their fears. This film focuses a lot on facing every kind of physical and psychological fear imaginable.This also is a story about adolescents making adult choices and facing the consequences of those choices.

There are 5 factions Abnegation (the selfless) Candor (the honest) Erudite (the intelligent) Amtiy (the peaceful) and Dauntless (the brave). Tris is the main character she is divergent the government doesn't like divergent because they think that they will try to take over the country.Evidence This is a action movie and it's sort of like the Hunger Games. The main characters are Triss (Shailene Woodley) Four/Tobias (Thoe James) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) Tori (Maggie Q) and Eric (Jai Courtney). You would like to watch this movie if you like the Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies. Also if you liked the book you will probably like the movie. This movie is about Tris who is divergent she goes to Dauntless but she finds out that Jeanine is trying to take over the government controlling the dauntless people and making them kill the abnegation people Tris and Four are Divergent so Eric and Jeanine can't control them but hey have to pretended or they will be killed. In the end Tris and Four stop Eric and Jeanine!Conclusion I think that Divergent is an amazing movie and I can't wait to see the next two!

In this world, when people are sixteen, they take a test, which assigns them to one of five factions where they will live for the rest of their lives. Beatrice's test results are inconclusive, and she decides to go live in the Dauntless, or the brave faction. In this faction she meets many new friends. She also meets Four (Theo James), who is the faction leader, and falls in love with him. Beatrice, or Tris (her new name) then discovers a plan made by another faction leader, Jeanine (Kate Winslet), to take over the government and kill many innocent people. This causes her to go on a journey with Four, who she is unsure if she can trust, to stop Jeanine. This movie is filled with splendid acting, realistic visuals, and a twisting and unpredictable plot. Shailene Woodley, who plays the main role, does an incredible job playing a character that has not found out where she belongs and has to lie to survive. It is also filled with realistic visuals, such as Four and Beatrice climbing about 300ft in the air to the top of a Ferris wheel and looking down over a futuristic city. Another effect is when the main character glides through this futuristic city and past tall buildings on a zip line. These realistic effects make the viewer feel as if they have been transported into the movie.The unpredictable plot makes this movie somewhat hard to follow for people who have not read the book. There was so much that happened in the book and the movie that made it hard for the viewer to understand what was happening. This movie may cause some viewers to ask questions, such as ""Where did this woman come from"", ""Where are they now,"" or ""Who is this?"" Another reason that many viewers may have questions is because this plot is shrouded in mystery. Many of the characters reveal their backstory and how they tie into the plot at the end of the movie, so do not worry. I felt like there were a lot of unnecessary training scenes; however, these scenes were nice because they provided action to the movie. This was a long movie, lasting two hours, however, it went by extremely fast because of how much action was in it. Another thing that I thought I was going to be disappointed with was how similar the plot was to the Hunger Games. Both of these stories are set in a dystopian future with a government who is disliked by many common people, which causes the people to rebel. However, Divergent puts a new and fresh spin on it. Instead of the government being the bad thing, it is a woman that wants to take over the government, who must be stopped. The villain, or antagonist, was a woman, which made the film seem different than others in its genre. One thing that might deter some people is the amount of violence in the movie. There are many scenes, which contain fighting, knives, and blood. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an action movie with a new, fresh plot idea. I think that it might have been slightly better if I had read the book because it would eliminate some of the confusion. However, it is still fun movie to watch even if you have not read the book, since it is filled with spectacular acting and visuals, along with an unpredictable, surprising plot.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals. Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them. I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd. Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue. My Grade: A-","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is here. Like kids waiting for cookies in the oven. The moment of truth has come. From the beloved book by Veronica Roth, Hollywood has their grasp on this baby, diaper inside out. So how was it?I always wanted to see a 60s, 70s stylized sci-fi, Pink Floyd inspired. Unfortunately, the style nowadays settles with fake, eye-rolling & desensitizing teen material, separating young people's appreciation with good cinema for this. So where does Divergent fit in? Come on, where doesn't it? This is the epitome of modern-day, 3-week cinematic hit, & forgotten two star snore on a Sunday afternoon 2 years from release on Shaw. Yeah, the acting, the story, & the vision here is flat all around. These actors will get their fame & clinch a lifetime spotlight in Young People's magazine, & TMZ laughs. So it's another wretched teen blockbuster. The look of this dread, it's disgusting & destroys my palette. I believe a Juno-quirky teenage styled flick, fused with an intense sci-fi is an interesting conception. However, the game plan & execution results show. Now Imagine a Rainbow, Pull-n-peel licorice, if each peel was a different color & was pre-pealed, & each peal defined a film genre, you'd have the layout for Divergent. It's not free nor comfortable. To satisfy hormone-confused teens, they heavily coat it with held-back character interactions & motivations, never reaching or exploring above or below the norm. Maintaining teen-equilibrium content of an awkward nature, which in itself is awkward, with one somehow managing to free themselves & enjoy that in an unbelievably grand fantasy universe as it's backdrop. Tis unmixed, left to dry. Too afraid of doing or even trying. It remains a scattered vision not knowing what it is, forgetting what it is, & leaving asking the critic's swear word: why?There's a big twist. I read the book, & it is a rhythmically flowing experience filled with page-turning thrills and emotion. The film, which many passion-lacking productions exploit easily, breaks down the story to so many different visions, it's as if several directors manhandled the project. The story was compromised in the process. Nothing was clear nor soothing or enduring. Every 5 minutes I felt I needed to re-engage myself because the music went off the page too often to care.It is on the verge of a Broken Picture. Maybe that's the vision, a new revolution in cinema we are yet to settle with. Maybe this picture is ingenious in every way. You'll have to go see for yourself, if you dare to tread such sociopathic material. Be my follower, Diver.","24 out of 66 found this helpful.

The movie takes place in a future Chicago where people are split into factions based on their virtues. Beatrice (Tris) Prior, played by Shailene Woodley, finds out she is Divergent, which means she doesn't belong to just one faction. She is seen as a danger to the existing system, and she has to stay alive.Divergent (2014) captivates with its stunning drone shots, showcasing a futuristic Chicago that, while heavily CGI-enhanced, felt unnecessary but still well-executed for its setting. Trise's narration, voiced with compelling depth, adds a rich layer to the storytelling. From the very start, the movie hooks you with its humanistic portrayal of society, weaving a narrative that feels both big and personal.The soundtrack by Junkie XL is really good and has a soulful quality that matches the film's hopeful tone. It also uses the inspired music of this movie that has the futuristic vibe, just like Ellie Goulding's song, which I wasn't sure about at first but ended up fitting very well. Cinematographically, ""Divergent"" impresses with its clean, high-quality shots and thoughtful camera movements.The narrative explores themes of trust and identity, drawing parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" yet establishing its own distinct dystopian vibe. The characters, especially Beatrice, are well-crafted; her cold-blooded, fearful character and ability to maintain composure under pressure are particularly striking. The Action scenes in the film are executed with remarkable professionalism, adding to the overall thrilling experience.Overall, Divergent (2014) is a film that resonated with me deeply, reminding me in many ways of ""The Hunger Games,"" yet standing out with its unique approach to a teen dystopian narrative. Its blend of impactful storytelling, visually stunning cinematography, and a soulful soundtrack and inspired music that makes it a memorable cinematic experience.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After all, the movie is based on the book and not a replica of the book.Divergent, the movie, is directed by Neil Burger who is known for his films The Illusionist and Limitless is about choosing a faction as defined by the futuristic society and survival in the respective faction. The movie has Shailene Woodley who plays Tris, Theo James playing Four, Ashley Judd playing Tris' mother and Kate Winslet plays Jeanine who is the head of one of the factions called Erudite.Apparently, there was a war and Chicago was the only place that was saved which led to formulation of a society that is divided into five factions - Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. As per the rule prevailing in the society, when all teenagers reach the age of 16, they have to undergone a simulation that would help them understand which faction do they belong to. However, each individual is free to chose his/her faction and the same choice can't be changed later whatsoever. Tris' parents are under Abnegation wherein her dad is a close aide to the President of the society. On the day of the test, Tris learns that she doesn't belong to any faction and hence is ""Divergent"" however she must guard this secret with her life or else she will pay for it with her life. Tris, much to her parent's surprise, choses to be a Dauntless and then initiates a daunting journey for Tris.Dauntless are hard, demanding, emotionless (well mostly) and tough to the core. Tris has to become dauntless, both physically and emotionally. She meets Four there who is the instructor at Dauntless and with this team he makes sure that the new recruits 'earn' their place in the faction or else they shall be faction-less. What follows is a fast paced and an exhilarating journey for Tris and her friends to be above the line and eventually become officially Dauntless. The journey is incredibly tough with hardcore training, merciless fighting sequences and some dare-devil acts.Neil Burger couldn't have picked up a better cast as each character is perfect for his/her role and makes you believe their part. Shailene Woodley understands her transition from Beatrice to Tris and plays it without a flinch. Theo James is what he is supposed to be; arrogant, rude, serious, tough and kind, probably all of these at once. Kate Winslet has a smaller screen time but she delivers it with panache and with such poise and ease that you want to see more of her. She as Jeanine is absolutely cunning, shrewd and witting to put Abnegation down and have Erudite be the rulers. Casting Winslet as a sweet villain is one of the best decisions by Burger. The movie is full of pumped up dialogues and jaw dropping sets. Cinematography is brilliant with capturing incredible frames with excellence.I keep hearing statements like 'Divergent' is a different version of 'Hunger Games'. Well let me break it up for you - it's NOT just like not every ship sinking movie is not Titanic.I am excited to learn that a sequel will be in place by 2015 but I am sad to learn at the same time that Neil Burger won't be directing it because he insists on been given amply and adequate time frame to bring 'Insurgent', the sequel, to life and the makers are not willing to provide the same. I echo Woodley's thoughts when she says, ""It was weird, he was the leader of this entire pack, and he created this world, he dreamt it up, he made all of the executive decisions. It was strange to think that somebody else is going to come over and take it on.""My recommendation - go watch Divergent for brilliant performances and excellent execution.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is boring, illogical and predictable and there where so many ""Oh my god are they really doing this?"" moments i stopped counting.Some of the audience left because of this soppy ""Twilight"" love story and the stupidity that i was witness of (others started laughing of the same reasons). Please people do yourself a favor and stay at home and do something else with your money.PS: I have never written a review about a movie until now.

I liked reading Divergent, it is not as similar to the Hunger Games as you think it is, it's actually unique in it's own way. What ticked me off about this movie is that it was pretty different from the book, (enough to make me annoyed) and that the entire relatively new cast (besides Winslet) cannot act. Theo James is sexy and he knows it in the movie, and Shailene Woodley is just ugh I can't explain it but she cannot act! Why are they comparing her to the fabulously talented Jennifer Lawrence when she can't even hold a candle in the acting world? This movie messed up the story for me, did Veronica Roth even see the script?","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

"8","/10","This movie talks about the defensive mentality and its consequences","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009611/?ref_=tt_urv","dan_grecu76","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39573449/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2014","Let's talk a bit about the dangers of defensive mentality. This kind of mentality proved time and again to be very detrimental. But let's see why what is it that makes this type of mentality so dangerous.The first reflex of the defensive mentality is to build a wall as tall and as strong as possible, be it a concrete and barbed-wire wall as it goes with human communities, be it an imaginary wall, just as strong in people's minds and hearts. Anything coming from outside is now automatically rejected. The logical consequence is inertia in all aspects: economic, political and cultural when it comes to societies, spiritual and emotional with individuals.Once this wall is built, the second stage involves the removal of any element, this time from inside (as the outside world is already blocked) which does not conform to the already established standards. A feeling of fear is maintained in the society by the means of external and internal imaginary enemies, so that people can accept repressive measures more easily. This fear also helps to bring people to support the regime in power. The same thing happens with the individuals: the mind maintains all sorts of anxieties and imaginary diseases, which keep them in a continuous state of fear, not allowing them to leave the confinement defended by the wall. Thus, they remain in their imaginary stronghold, believing themselves to be safe.As this regime matures, a very dangerous process takes place, namely the transfer of one's responsibilities towards the others. The citizens are no longer responsible about the community, as the system is talking care of everything and everyone. The system educates, takes care of the people's health, builds and distributes housing and so on. Consequently, people only need to focus on delivering on their duties at their work place. Moreover, they do not even need to worry about how the results of their work is used. The scientists are just scientists and the system is making sure that the results of their work are properly used. Soldiers and policemen no longer need to worry about the morality and rightness of their orders, they only need to carry them out, regardless of what their conscience might tell them.The final blow delivered by this process is applied to the most fundamental values of the people. The isolation erodes the connection between people and makes them unable to feel. The human bond is lost. Now the system raises the stake and attacks savagely the most important human values and call into question even the human nature, proclaiming the need for a new man, most of the time a man that relinquished the feelings and the weaknesses brought upon by them. The blood ties and family bonds are nothing more than abstract notions stemming from the humanity's primitive past. Family is now only a social unit that prepares responsible citizens to be delivered to the society. As a replacement, total loyalty to the collective is demanded as well as the willingness of sacrifice for this greater body, which now represents family.The consequences of this process can only be disastrous for both individual and society. The diversity and pluralism are eliminated, everyone must behave and think the same, any progress or personal opinion threatens the stability of the system and are nipped in the bud. Fascism and communism proposed and implemented such systems, and the majority of the population embraced them willingly or tacitly, out of their desire for ""peace"" or ""tranquility"" and out of their fear of others coming to take what was theirs. What were we talking about in the beginning? About the defensive mentality, about building walls around communities as well as hearts and minds.And what could be the solution to this problem? Is hard to believe that the solution could come from the top, as once installed in a position of power, elites are unlikely to relinquish that position willingly. Then, just as the problem, the solution could only come from the grass roots, from the rank-and-file people, more exactly with people realizing the trap they have fallen into. These people manage to find their true self through a painful and dangerous introspection. Afterwards, they break down the imaginary walls built around their hearts and minds and also smash the walls around their societies.The discussion about the defensive mentality and its consequences, have covered the main philosophical, political and motivational themes of this movie. It is an example of a movie that sinks its teeth in a theme and never lets go until it is done with it. This way it has a chance to actually transmit something to the viewers. The rest is action and suspense, sensuality and special effects meant to sell this ""masterpiece"", which by the way is well made.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I really did. After reading the book I was looking forward to this film and could not make it through without fast forwarding. The main problem is the story which is highly narrative does not translate. Not that it couldn't have. The screen writing is terrible and is largely word-for-word from the book. Key elements to understanding the characters and the story are missing from the film. I don't know how anyone could understand the film without reading the book. Honestly a horrible film and the screenwriter should be embarrassed.Since the film has lucked into earning a lot of money and therefore sequels, hopefully they will take this as an opportunity to bring in new screenwriters and editors.Don't waste your money for sure. Only waste your time if you are at home and doing something else at the same time.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Less romance but more about the fight to survive being different which is basically something we all do eventually in some way, however, the main problem in that 'perfect' society is control over people, they put their faction before family. About the book-movie adaption i don't know much, i haven't read the books, but a good movie for me is when after seeing it you want to read the book and that is what Divergent did for me. Story was summarized nicely so that you actually got enough details about relationship between Tris and her family, Four and new found friends and enemies in the new faction.

I haven't read the book, but i was hooked from the beginning till the very last end. Shailene Woodley gives a great performance for this kind of movie, you simply can not resist for rotting for her. Other actors did a descent job for the material. ""Divergent"" which is based on a book is type of the movies that i call ""21 th century movie adaptations Beverly Hils style"" - it's all actually a bit familiar for this type of movies, aka. ""The Host"" (2013), ""The Hunger Games"" franchise - you get the structure, and there is always a hero (a heroine)which isn't like all other, and she starts a rebellion - no spoilers here. But ""Divergent"" is better then ""The Host"", and it's better than the first ""The Hunger Games"" film.Overall, if like these adaptations, you will definitely will love ""Divergent"", which is wonderfully paste, good acted, solidly written and to sum it up, it's a great entertainment.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

You could also throw in a few other dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies and books that this is derivative of (not that Inception is such a movie, but the dreams-within-dreams scenes in Divergent reminded me of that).So, derive a plot from these books/movies, then dumb it down for kids. Hero(ine) is a teen. The good guys are the running, jumping, climbing, fighting types, not the intellectuals, or anyone else. (The perpetual running, jumping and climbing actually made the Dauntless people quite comical, rather than heroic, to me. Their whole shtick just seemed so lame). Throw in the usual underdog prevails against the odds and ultimately becomes a hero routine, with a bit of romance and an evil conspiracy by the adults/non-action types and you have your common-or-garden teen action movie. Only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it was better than The Hunger Games (but only marginally so). At least Divergent had some semblance of grit and edginess - Hunger Games is a like a Disney action-movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I really couldn't get over it. Was not disappointed. 2 hours and a half, really went by fast and wish it lasted longer. When I first heard about this movie was when I saw a trailer last year, and this world just seemed so interesting and it completely captivated me. This hadn't happened to me in such a long time from a trailer, and I have good instincts of knowing a good movie (at least I'll know if I'll like it.) I really couldn't wait so I read the books. Eh, in all honesty, I kinda do wish I hadn't read the books before I saw the movie OR at least had read it a long time ago and forgot every detail. Because every detail of the book was still fresh in my mind and I had imagined it a certain way without even noticing. I really couldn't help compare each scene to the book. It's okay though, the second time I didn't do that I just appreciated it as a movieOn that note, I think Theo James captured and portrayed Four P E R F E C T L Y. He did it in a way that I didn't imagine, so yes it was a little different, but he embodied the essence of Four's character, with every manner and mannerism. Shailene Woodley played Tris really well also! She was different from what I imagined, but at the same time, the same. The actors are good, the production is good, the soundtrack is okay to me, but it wasn't bad or anything.I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE. Before I read the books I thought the romance would take away from the identity of the female character, like it would just become a romance film, but nope! They make each other stronger, and I kinda am in love with Four. It has a good an interesting plot & storyline, good action scenes, and funny moments. I think it's a really different and unique movie. I really would not compare the story to Hunger Games. I liked Hunger Games, read it too, but I think this is better. My friends who hadn't read the book really loved it too (though they would've been slightly confused if I hadn't explained stuff, but I think they would've been okay), and some of my guy friends like it too. I know this doesn't represent everyone of the male gender, but hey I thought it's knowing a guy can like it too and they thought Four was cool.I want the next movie to come out now!!! And I want this on DVD <3","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It looks gorgeous, it's very well written, full of emotion and suspense, entertaining and very thrilling. It also has great characters, very well described, written and presented. It made me more and more curious about the fate of the two protagonists whilst not disappointing me any single time.As a minor downside, it didn't have the most conclusive finale, not even close, but it leaved a good opportunity for a sequel.

The series highlights the future that may come wherein each human would be divided according to the faction ie their human characteristic. The problem is the person who has some characteristic of all faction needs to killed since they are considered as a threat to human society who do not fit in any category. The story revolves around how Shailene Woodley the lead who is a divergent gets into one of the faction and later is recognized as a divergent. Amazing role of Kate Winslet who is casted in a negative role who requires all the power in her hand and control of all the faction. Overall an amazing movie with some different concept.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

People are expecting this series to match with Harry Potter and mostly The Hunger Games. It could be just another one of those dystopian future tales that revolts against a tyrannical government, but the concept sounds a little transcendent that can somehow relate to the young adult readers. But the story itself is lacking a definite center, forcing the action to come out when it needed to without any slow burn at the ticking bomb. It's almost like any of the genre's generic films: exposition over substance. Though the exposition here is at least more than great visuals, it manages to make it all exciting despite that it generally isn't. Divergent is competent in filmmaking, but mediocre on themes.The films has a decent way to introduce the world and it truly is intriguing to explore the surfaces. It's so intriguing, the actual storytelling ends up being contrived without any growth. The threat just suddenly distracts the nearly endless exposition, but what really suffers is the subtext. The film doesn't seem to be interested in snagging its thematic potential, all what this narrative is capable of is innovating. This is a common problem to the YA genre, apparently, and the momentum and conflict once again just pops up out of nowhere.This underwhelming storytelling is thankfully carried by a more fascinating and delicious vision. Neil Burger creates it into larger-than-life, and they are much entertaining than what the script tries to deliver. Everything just moves briskly and makes sure that it doesn't miss a satisfying thrill. The coolest scenes are proof that these filmmakers have big ambition to the project and yet the narrative fails to justify it. The cast has also done well. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are competent enough as the heroes, and Kate Winslet somewhat elevated her villainous character.Divergent could be like one of those vapid YA's such as Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or whatever. Except this one is probably the best among since it has a craft that at least made it watchable. But then the meat is not well defined. It's frustrating because the ideas are just right there on display and you don't know where the potentials have gone. The bright side is there are more cool sequences, like the zipline ride and the wannabe parkour from a train (with the Woodkid soundtrack), than mouth sucking subplots that the genre has been iterated in years, we could use more of that. But there are bigger things to complain here, there really seems to be something far more compelling beneath the concept. So for now, we at least get a movie that has better focus to intrigue our imaginations and not teenage hormones.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

Is Divergent similar to The Hunger Games in some ways? Yes. However, if some people would actually pay attention they would see that Divergent is actually quite different from The Hunger Games in many ways and is not just a ""rip-off"" of the Hunger Games. Personally I enjoy the Divergent series more than The Hunger Games. So, I really liked this movie. I read the book beforehand and I've got to say that this is actually a pretty good adaption of the movie. The only thing I wished the could've done is make Peter more cold and aggressive like he was in the book. In the movie he just seems like your stereotypical bully. Also I wish they could've included the scene where Edward gets stabbed in the eye as that was pretty disturbing in the book and it would've made the movie a bit darker in my opinion but it's in the deleted scenes so it's all good. I thought the acting was very good, Shailene is superb as Tris as is Theo as Four. I thought Winslet was amazing as the cold, cunning Jeanine Matthews and everyone else was very good as well. I also absolutely loved the soundtrack to this movie, one of my favorites personally. So, again, I think some people and critics are kind of harsh either because they compare it so much to The Hunger Games (which there are going to be similarities, it's the exact same type of genre) or because these types of YA movies aren't for them and if that's the case then maybe they shouldn't be trying to see these movies in the first place. Superb movie in my opinion and good adaption, 9/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And after the movie played, everything was falling into ashes. The casts are awful. I expect that peter would be someone who have an arrogant face, but instead.. Jainine, Kate winslet is an awful choice. Jainine should be played by Charlize Teron, or someone who have a typical face like that. And I felt that the casts are lack of chemistry. The story.

No. I was not surprised. Not in the least.If you ask me this utterly pretentious, $85 million production was just another version of ""The Host"", but, of course, this time it was all done on a much grander scale, with definite shades of ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in for good measure.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, Divergent really pushed the limits when it came to being tolerable entertainment. In general, I thought that most of the cookie-cutter characters in the story were just a bunch of shallow, two-faced, arrogant snots and I couldn't have given a sweet-damn whether they ever triumphed in their goody-goody, little mission, or not.All-in-all - Divergent was nothing but superficial fluff marketed exclusively for a very gullible, non-thinking audience.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Perhaps you are 15 and your parents are members of a church that believes with all their being that the world was created by God 3000 years go and that carbon dating, and evolution are the work of the devil. Or maybe they believe all religion is superstition and that religion itself is a sort of delusional psychosis. These paradigms and everything in between is what our children must contend regardless of their station, class, race, religion, sexual orientation or nationality. This movie navigates these troubled waters in a sure handed, original and entertaining way, never losing sight of the larger struggle to sort the'good' from the 'bad' and what the associated costs may be.What are the values that matter most? Security,liberty, social cohesion, the power of the few over the many and the rights of the minority all are questioned. The hope of answers begins to emerge for our protagonist as her journey progresses. It is a journey worth taking.This is the sort of movie where pretentious movie critics prove how pusillanimous they really are.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some will say it's better some will say it's worse. The story is a little unbelievable but is packed full of action and drama. The problem is the action isn't great, and the drama isn't that exciting. Even the props had a feel of low budget or just not enough thought had gone into them. The actors were not great. The male lead was increasingly wooden and just seemed unable to dominate the screen the way his character should. The female lead was at times very good but she just didn't do enough for it to be better than that. Kate Winslet was good also but she was not involve nearly enough.Even with some good performances the film seemed a bit dull and obvious. Divergent is an OK film it's just OK, and that is its biggest problem it is a very safe very middle of the road sci fi film.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

But this movie makes me wish I had despite my not being in its target audience.First of all, Divergent is a far better film than I expected. If you must compare it to the Hunger Games franchise, I think it holds up quite well for the simple reason it is clearly the more intelligent of the two. The idea of splitting society into five factions is brilliant and more than a little suggestive of reality. The key idea, that those who don't conform are dangerous, is practically sacred scripture in our society and with our security people in particular.Second, the two leads are impeccable choices, Shailene Woodley and Theo James do a great job. Ms Woodley captures your interest and evokes more feeling than most actresses do in their entire careers. And Mr James moves as convincingly as a trained martial arts star and is easy to imagine as a leader.That said the first half is much better than the second where the movie devolves a bit into a much more run of the mill story. I can understand why it would given the demands of the market, but I was so pumped by the first half I was more than willing to forgive. It made me wonder what the novel was like especially when I read beforehand that the novel was written by a woman. I have never read anything written by a woman as unexpected as this movie's setup. The specific territory I'm referring to, paramilitary training, is almost never gotten even half right by women. There's a better understanding of it here than most men have especially because most men haven't seen military service. For once the female lead is not treated as some superwoman. Tris, the heroine, is knocked down and bloodied as a real woman would be and the focus on courage is something else I was glad to see properly addressed.For a teenage girl this is going to be a special event. I highly recommend it for them all, even if they haven't yet read the novel. As for everyone else, all I can say is I enjoyed it. And I know for me the name Veronica Roth, its author, is now one I'm not likely to ignore.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

A lot of things about this movie made me unable to watch it any longer, mainly I just felt bored by the performances of the main characters. the main guy and girl I felt I had no interest to watch at all. When compared to other big movies at this time like smaug or Robocop, I found this does not even compare to those movies. This movie is about rebelling against a system put into place for whatever reason, but it sounds like an attempt to control and enforce subjugation, and a few people have the fore sight to attempt to break out, the idea itself is not too bad it's the way that the movie goes about to implement this idea, through dream scenarios where you attempt to react according to a dream, but give me a break. How can you actually believe your even in a dream in the first place? The movie wants you to attempt this is possible by injecting you with a needle, I just found that to be absolutely absurb and silly. This movie fails to teach anything it uses a lame character build up and pointless romance to enforce this and i'm not buying it. I recommend don't waste your time on this one , unless your really really bored and are easily impressed with lame fight sequences and a cheesy story that has no back story and no explanation to enforce how any of this could ever be feasible. bbbbooorinnnggg.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I enjoyed both the movie and the book, mainly because of the well-written world and characters, and of course, the similarities between page and screen. The only thing that I, and most of the book club, didn't see while reading was Tris' final fear simulation/test. The room which she took the test in was different. I'd imagined it as a small recording-booth like setup. With an office on one side and the simulation room on the other. The rooms were separated by one way glass/mirror, and Tris was unable to see the people monitoring the test, though they could see her. Other than that, I loved the film. Shailene and Theo did an amazing job of portraying Tris and Four. I'm excited and looking forward to seeing 'Insurgent' with my book club.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It started out good, addressing the factions issue and setting up the theme. But completely fell apart in the middle. The writers seem to have felt the (idiotic) need for more action scenes so they just filled 60% of the movie with training simulations and cheesy teenage drama, and I wont even start enumerating the clichés, because halfway through the picture I had to shut my brain off just to finish watching. What bothered me most was how poorly they explained the sci-fi elements. Just picture this, a guy goes up to you and tells you he will inject you with a substance that will cause hallucinations. BUT if you somehow find out that its not real, then you are a Divergent. The guy just bloody told you its a hallucination. What an effective method. And if the serum didn't work on Divergent, how was it working at the end of the movie? We are never told. But it seems nowadays, science fiction adaptations don't need to make sense. Just throw some action at the audience to make them forget the numerous plot holes. That being said, the acting was solid and the cinematography as well. Just left me wishing for a better adaptation and some decent storytelling. 6/10 watch it if you're bored","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The futuristic dystopian setting is hard to accept, and even if you do, it's difficult to understand the motivations of many of the characters in it.It is similar to many other ""young adult"" movies, and it probably hits its target audience better than it hits me. But, allowing for some plot holes and similar, I wish the setting had been more interesting and understandable. Maybe this will be more in focus in the later movies? Why the society looks like it does? It is never really awful, though. If you manage to go along with the premise, the movie is easy to swallow.

No wait, scratch that. I know I didn't get it.I saw previews for this movie when I went to see Catching Fire in the theater. It looked good, something like Hunger Games, but I didn't have a strong desire to see it. Maybe because I read the Hunger Games books first and not this one, but it still interested me. I have to say, the previews did not successfully ""preview"" what the movie was actually about.What happened to the whole divergent thing? It was touched on briefly during the main character's test (lord, I already forgot her name) and it was made a big deal of by the lady giving her test, and it was mentioned maybe three more times here and there, but this was not about a girl being divergent and at risk from her society because she was, like the previews made it sound. The previews made it seem that she was divergent, but not welcome in her society, and therefore had to learn to survive with others like her. The movie was nothing like this. For a movie that was categorized in the same genre as Hunger Games (teen survival) it definitely fell short.I have a feeling this series is going to turn into a franchise that could have been told in one book/movie. So far, this first installment proves that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichés of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It shows many characters live in our lives and the struggle to find out how we are. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are the best lead actors for this role. Also, the side actors are great. Every scene of the first and second part keeps the viewer in front of the screen. The third one is not worth to watch, the base of the story wouldn't be bad, but it's very chaotic so you should watch the first 2. I recommend this movie to those who haven't seen Shailene in an action film previously. Exciting a lot! Definitely worth to watch.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

No explanations what, who, when and where happened beyond that Chicago is pictured and you may not even recognize it unless you are from around.You may find it is a great movie if you watch it relaxed and let your mind be taken to that place, their time and space. I started watching it completely unbiased, without any expectations in advance, taking ""Let's see what this movie is all about"" I found this movie surprisingly good.But if your expectations are to see typical set-up: police, army, special forces, streets filled with cars, people in bars, good-kicks-bad fight and that alike (what is already in number of Hollywood movies, one may call it a stereotype of present); also if you start looking for logic in events and imperfections in scenes... then this movie is not for you, better skip it and instead re-watch Avengers, Hulk, Matrix, Harry Potter...From technical point of view, this movie could benefit with a little bit more of special effects. Just to add make-up and polishing. Any CGI is contained within candidates psychological testing (watch and you will see what I mean), nothing else outside in their world.The movie lacks a bit of seriousness. For example - take 'Dauntless' faction that suppose to be armed forces (peacekeepers, equivalent to police say at least)... Throughout the movie it looks like guys having a lot of fun and a bit of not-so-rough training. From that point you may take it as teenager movie.Overall - recommendations for watching 'Divergent' and waiting to see its sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Which there was. Maybe he was expecting them to go back to when the main character was a baby. Better yet, why not go back to when the parents were babies. Such a weak complaint. As to this movie, if u either read the book(I haven't), you seen the previews, or read the synopsis, you would know exactly what type of movie you were gonna be watching. And if you don't like these types of movies...Why bother watching it in the first place.The movie has a good storyline, romance if u are into it, a little drama, action, and a tint of sci/fi. And as for plot holes? The ones saying that are really nitpicking bringing that up. Maybe the movie wasn't the way they would like it or as good as they would have made it. But of course we know that, people are regular geniuses and should be screenwriters in Hollywood right now. No respect.Some people just like to complain about something and for some reason those are the people that most frequent these reviews. Read up on the premise for the movie, and if you like how it looks, then watch it, because that's exactly what you are gonna get. Nothing more, nothing less. And any questions leftover might be answered in the sequel. But some reviewers are to inpatient for that, evidently...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That said, there is a certain alluring concept. Sure, the plot is rather weak and predictable. The characters, other than the lead roles, are bland and uninteresting. The acting is decent at best, but I didn't expect Oscar roles in this movie. What I liked though, and I believe like-minded people would agree, is the setting and concept of society that is shown in the movie. Without including any spoilers, the synopsis says that people are split into factions based on virtues, and that is the underlying concept that plays a big role in the movie. You are constantly reminded of the social structure, some faction more attractive than others, and how it finally merges with the plot.There are many scenes in the movie that are really, very enjoyable. It's mostly because of special effects and whatnot, but it works. Other noteworthy segments, I felt, was the strong lead female roles. It's clear to me that other than the main male lead, all other lead roles are strong female characters, which is a refreshing spin on things. Granted, there are many similarities with Hunger Games, too many in fact, but hey, I still enjoyed it, and I'm sure fans of Hunger Games will surely like this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, no problem at all. She's perfect for the role.Yes, it's not perfectly perfect or whatever. But I think it's enjoyable and actually good, so I don't know why there're so many bad reviews when I came to check on IMDb.People are like bashing the movie and everything. Now that makes me thinking, do they really hate the movie after they watched the whole of it with more ""objective"" mind or because they are going with the ""flow"" of the bad reviews or whatsoever that they read/heard first before they watch the movie? Or, they have this constant comparison to The Hunger Games while they're watching the movie. Like comparing Tris to Katniss, and the what with the what, if so... then I think it's not the movie's fault.Well, it's undeniably having a similar concept, but you know what. It's just the way you look into it, I guess. But for me, I'll be waiting for the continuation of this movie.

It's a half hour too long, given epic treatment when it deserves far less, and the dialogue's terrible, as if a high school student had written it. I'll pass on any sequels.

One is supposedly to be disturbed, perhaps traumatized, by the expectation that defecation is to be consummated in an open bay of toilets; the ""mess hall"" scene that follows, while suggestive only of the utilitarian efficiency of an industrial, prison-like dining facility, is rendered trivial and basely comic by a dual commentary upon the ingesting of ""hamburger"", followed by an absurd and pseudo-intellectual analysis of the food in question. Never having suffered the indignities of Boot Camp in any branch of the military; terrified of exposing their bowel movements to one another in a jail cell; reviled at the prospect of eating lousy fast food -- the privileged participants in this plastic vision of a possible future fail at the outset with their pedestrian and Bourgeois lack of vital capacity or open-mindedness.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

You can't parallel one medium to the other. It simply isn't possible.That being said, the movie does the book great justice and is quite entertaining. I also highly recommend the book series to those who have enjoyed the film. It follows the book plot well enough that readers won't be disappointed much. Some semi- major events that will be integral in future sequels weren't covered, but may be seen as flashbacks in the future films. It'll be interesting to see how they handle these anomalies. You don't miss a lot that makes the story line make sense though.I'm personally not one to really sit and read, but I was bored and picked this one up to pass the time. I was hooked and read the whole series in a matter of weeks. Definitely see this film and read the series. I'm looking forward to the sequels.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But hey, The Hunger Games is a rip-off of Battle Royale, so what? It's still pretty good. And is this good? Yes.This movie has more haters than it deserves. It may be long, but it's still fun. The story is OK but nothing outstandingly original. But it's still pretty interesting. The acting is decent. Nothing amazing, but nothing bad. Miles Teller is probably the best in his role. I'm not a huge fan of the books. The first book is the only one I really liked, the second one was decent, but the third one was a mess. And that spin-off about Four's character wasn't anything special either, but I really like the first book and I really like this movie. It's a pretty faithful adaptation and those who liked the book will be satisfied, I can guarantee it. It's very well done and it doesn't have that much of The Hunger Games vibe because it's less depressing and doesn't take itself so seriously, which is probably a good thing in this case. And one more good thing about it, the ending of the book isn't changed a lot but it's made to feel more complete and not a cliffhanger because that would be bad if the movie was a flop.This movie may get a lot of hate, but it's actually a really good movie. Is it a masterpiece? No. Not at all. But is it fun? Hell yeah! If you were planning to watch this movie, do it, it's not incredible but you won't waste your time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My wife introduced me to it and I'm surprised I never heard of the books before. Anyway, it definitely peaked interests in both of us. This movie has fresh young actors and a popular young adult dystopia/post-apocalyptic feel to it. After seeing this movie, I wanted to know the ending and ended up reading all 3 books. Great book to movie adaptation. Although it is similar to the Hunger Games style in many ways, the story is still fresh and excitingly different. Divergent is a must see for teens and young adults.We have watched almost 10 times in the last year. Four is the obvious star of the show. All the girls love him and he is quite noble and attractive. Other characters do their part to make this an exciting movie and some good character development.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was wrong. The main thing this movie suffers from is too much exposition. Which may make for a clearer and more enjoyable sequel does not make for a good first movie. A lot of the time I had to stifle my groans when yet another ambiguous monologue began to expand upon in a sequel "" Our founders built a wall after the big war..."" sort of thing. This movie did not bring anything new to the table and instead tried to bring concepts and ideas from older, better movies to a younger audience in the hopes they could attempt to pass it off as original work. Then of course there are the performances. While I don't dispute Shailene Woodley as a competent actress she really didn't shine for me in Divergent. Playing the same unrealistically brave and contemplative teenager who will save the world with special abilities we've seen countless times before. Kate Winslet was somewhat decent, but with such mind numbing material to work with she too did not particularly shine for me. Overall, I'd say give Divergent a miss, trust me you're not missing anything you haven't seen somewhere else.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Don't listen to the critics and just enjoy the film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128867/?ref_=tt_urv","thomas-w15","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43867541/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2014","Divergent 8/10- Most are skeptical of book to movie adaptions, especially when it is in the young adult genre, and most movies of the past have not given the genre a good name. Divergent however, is a solid film that without a doubt makes up for all of them. It takes you on a non-stop suspense-filled ride while staying true to the book and literally makes the magnificent words fly off the page. I would like to clarify that it is not some twilight garbage or trying to rip the Hunger Games. It is its own film and does a fine job standing by itself. I will begin by saying that I do agree that at certain points of the film, it does feel like they are going a little slow and are dragging on a certain scene. These scenes are this way though because the director has a gigantic respect for the book and wanted to stay true to the book as much as possible. The main problem that I heard most people had with the film is that they felt like the ending was too rushed. I can see why someone would think that, and I do agree that is was a little rushed but I still thought it was a near-perfect scene. Again, the reason it was this way is because that is how it is in the book. I love the book and I loved all of the scenes that they chose for the movie, but I would have maybe changed the scenes a tiny bit just so it would be more amicable for an audience. Those changes would be very small though and all of these minuscule problems in no way stopped me from enjoying the film.Whoever was the head production designer deserves an Oscar for this movie. He made the exact images that I pictured in the book come to life. He picked the perfect shades for the colors of each faction and made amazing communities for each faction as well. He did an outstanding job particularly on the dauntless designs. I was very concerned coming into the film about how he would portray the dauntless and the place they live in, but I was just astounded by how great of a job he did. The fighting arena, the pit, the rooms, they were all awesome. I would also like to give props to the choreographers of the film for completely coming up with a new way to fight. They do not follow the usual boxing type fighting, they design their own that significantly contributes to each combat sequence. The casting directors of Divergent could not have done a better job, particularly with Shailene Woodley and Theo James who play Tris and Four. I'm really glad that they took their time and found the perfect people for the movie who have such great chemistry together while still each giving off a good intensity of their own. Shailene Woodley, Theo James, and all of the rest of the cast were amazing together and you could tell that they were all fiercely dedicated to their roles. Shailene Woodley did a great job at really diving into her character Tris Prior and no one could have done as great of a job as her. The emotional scenes she was in were really the highlight of her career. I see plenty of actors that just completely mess up those scenes because they are just not good at acting, but Shailene Woodley really made you believe she was experiencing what Tris Prior was in those moments of the film. Theo James did just as good of a job and I truly believe that no one could hold his own with Shailene Woodley as well as he did. He really puts on the mask that Four does at the beginning but as his character develops, he changes with him and really was a perfect choice for the role. The rest of the cast all did an above-average job, but Shailene and Theo were really the ones that were mentioning walking out of the theater. My advice to you is do not listen to the critics, most of them just do not like the young adult genre in general. The movie the best film out right now and I strongly recommend that you go see it in theaters.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I like films like this, which show how a possibly good idea can turn bad if people start repeating the same mistakes we are doing. For me, 8/10.I understand well those who have read the book.

So many plot holes. It's painful to watch the amazing Kate Winslett playing such a shallow character. Same with Miles Teller, although when this was filmed, people didn't know about him. Ashley Judd at least has a little bit to work with, but it's not much.Shailene Woodley does a pretty good job with her character, and I'm convinced she's on her way to a great career. Theo James also does a good job, although he's not given much to work with. The main problem with the movie is its premise and story. It leaves too many things unreasonably unexplained, so you never really buy into the story. For such a hard-to-buy premise, it's even more important. They really should have established the world they were playing in better at the very beginning of the movie. For instance, Why the wall? Why would the evil faction hate the good faction? Mankind can be summed into 5 roles in society? Really?

"3","/10","Diverging from Decent Filmmaking","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3080092/?ref_=tt_urv","wakemeup36","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18902470/?ref_=tt_urv","3 September 2014","I used to be an avid movie watcher not too long ago. All sorts of movies: action, comedies, dramas, thrillers; you name it, I left no genre stone unturned. Unfortunately, it got to the point where every new movie I watched felt like a rehash of something I had seen before. I have been on a movie hiatus for about 4 years since then. I have still watched movies in this span of time but not as many as I used to. I do not observe them as carefully as I used to and don't consequently write reviews about them either. However, something about this movie awakened the critical beast within me. I have not seen such a plot less movie pretending to be deep in a long time and I need to write about it to feel like I didn't waste 2 hours of my life on nothing.What is this movie about, you may wonder? In a dystopian future, human beings are split into 5 factions. I don't remember the names of these factions and I won't bother to look them up. But basically, you have labourers, farmers, scientists, charity workers and the army. The charity workers also happen to be politicians and the scientists are jealous and want to be the politicians so they hatch an evil scheme to take over. Also, there are people who don't fit into factions and they are called 'divergent' (and are presumably talented at everything the other factions excel at), aka our main character Tris. The authorities don't like divergent very much because umm they couldn't think of a faction name for them I guess? Actually, the movie logic is that they can't be controlled. But why not? Just make a different faction for them and now you have them in line right? Oh well, let's just ignore that and take a leap of faith. The basic plot isn't anything I haven't seen before, and I've been out of touch with movies for the last few years. A lone teen/young adult in a dystopian rebelling against the really bad system that rejects them. Several movies have attempted this before, including Equilibrium, The Hunger Games etc. Does this movie do anything well enough for me to forget about the aforementioned fact? No, not really. The acting is bad, the music is annoying and the characters are terribly written.The acting is incredibly hammy. Sometimes the actors tend to overact while at other instances, they can't conjure up simple emotions. It gives the movie world a very dead feel to it. For example, a scene that is supposed to be rather dramatic towards the end of the movie has our main character bawling her eyes out like a maniac, while a similar 'tragedy' occurs a few minutes later and she doesn't bat an eye. The villain played by Kate Winslet is also emotionally dead and shows no acting range at all. Perhaps it's because English isn't my native language but I had a very difficult time making out the dialogue at times. The actors' speech felt very mumbled and incoherent.The music is very off balanced. Much of the time it overtakes the dialogue. Additionally, a lot of it isn't original music composed for the movie but popular radio songs instead which I always find a cop out when it comes to movie soundtracks. One of the scenes has knives being thrown around Tris by her instructor. It's supposed to be very intense and the music makes sure it tells us that by being very obnoxiously loud every time the instructor throws the knife. Similarly other scenes, particularly action scenes, have a very terrible use of music that distracts from the movie.The characters. Where do I even start? The main character, Tris, has to be one of the blandest characters since Bella from Twilight to be ever put on screen. She has absolutely no personality. Yes, she's 'Divergent', but what else? What does she like to eat, does she like animals, does she have any hobbies, does she like to screw around with her friends? The filmmakers made sure they don't address these questions at all, so we're left with nothing but a blank slate of a character. The other characters aren't any better in terms of development. The romance subplot is so forced, its borderline laughable. 'Hey, I touched you tattoo, let's have PG-13 intercourse now!' is the gist of the romance. The villain (Winslet) is pretty boring as well. 'I don't like human nature very much as it leads to violence so I'll use violence to destroy human nature' is her philosophy. None of the characters are interesting or have any sort of development throughout the story. The romantic interest is just a pretty face, the bad guy goons are well goons, and the main character's friends are just present as decoration pieces.Even after ignoring the unoriginal and silly plot, the movie doesn't offer anything that will make me want to look at it in a positive light. Weak characters, horrid music placement and cheesy acting clutter the movie throughout. How this had enough of a following to warrant a TV show, I will never know.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was quite excited to see it as a movie, entering the theater with high hopes. The clothing design was sexist. Seriously, it's the future, and women are still accustomed to body-revealing ""serious"" clothes; ranging from sexy skin-tight Erudite mini-skirts to Tris's sexy black tank top. The book was nothing like this; women wore pants.Excuse me for being a feminist, but that was a small part of the movie that had bugged me. The acting was bland, the character designs were bland, and the whole movie was rushed. Each scene just... breezed by, like the whole movie was saying ""okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you saw this scene already, let's just get this story over and done with because, apparently, the writers just don't care about our personal entertainment.""the length had made it seem like a kid's movie, along with the fact that even the romance scenes with Tris and Four were small and sped up, and the violence scenes! There was hardly any violence. For example at the scene where Tris was almost pushed over the chasm, there was literally a few pushing and shoving and then DONE. And where are the guns? The book had included real guns with bullets, but in the movie everyone was using these weird, ""futuristic"" guns that shot spike- like bullets and didn't even show blood... no one told me this was a freaking PG movie.What a waste of money. The book had unforgettable characters, great dialogue, and creative, heart-shattering scenes. This movie felt more like a joke; I wouldn't be surprised to find out, one day, that this had actually been made as a parody of sci-fi/action/romance movies. It would have done better as a parody than as a movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watched it very carefully, through my headphones in order to get a better sound, to hear actors' sometimes quiet whispering, to get a better idea of lavish soundtrack. The whole cast is pretty strong here, and yes, Shailene Woodley as Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior Theo James as Tobias ""Four"" Eaton Ashley Judd as Natalie Prior Jai Courtney as Eric Coulter Ray Stevenson as Marcus Eaton Zoë Kravitz as Christina Miles Teller as Peter Hayes Tony Goldwyn as Andrew Prior Ansel Elgort as Caleb Prior Maggie Q as Tori Wu Mekhi Phifer as Max Kate Winslet as Jeanine Matthews Ben Lloyd-Hughes as Will Christian Madsen as Al Amy Newbold as Molly Atwood - they all did a pretty solid and decent work. I must say and dare say the first part is rather nice, and a thrilling piece of work to watch. Yeah, there are weaker moments, too. What many have already mentioned before, the plot is at times terribly predictable, and you can easily tell the next twist before it even happens. Is it so bad? Yes, as it turns a movie a bit sour. No, as it does not spoil the whole movie. The video effects are very spellbinding and the lush soundtrack proves to be a pretty strong point. But still, many, many characters beg for deeper portrayal and a better explanation. Sometimes, some elements seem to be a bit shallow and not that persuasive, it just happens and you have to go with it. I say, this movie should be watched and will be enjoyed, but a second try? I am not sure so much.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Society is segmented into five factions (dauntless, abnegation, erudite, candor, amity) plus the Factionless. Those in the factions are privileged, while the Factionless are impoverished. The abnegation faction controls government. The film, in short, involves the attempted mutiny of dauntless and erudite to replace abnegation as the rulers.Young people in this society are faced with a choice in their late teens: to choose a faction. Each teen is given a test to help determine the faction, but the teen's choice is the determining factor, not the test.Tris (well, Beatrice), daughter of Natalie and Eric, sister of Caleb, gets an inconclusive test. Tori, who administered the test, advises her to just leave and say the test was flawed. Tris does this. On the day of choosing, she chooses dauntless over her family's faction, abnegation.The story follows Tris' acclimatisation into dauntless and her involvement with the unspoken motives of dauntless and erudite against abnegation. The other central theme is her flawed test. What really happened there?This is the first installment of a trilogy, and some of the first moves of dauntless plus erudite against abnegation are detailed.-----Scores------ Cinematography: 8/10 Reasonable skill was shown.Sound: 6/10 I could make out the words that the actors spoke. The background music was between insipid and irritating.Acting: 3/10 I liked the performances of Ashley Judd, Kate Winslett, and Theo James. The rest of the cast was well worth forgetting.Screenplay: 0/10 Boring, not involving, not believable.-----Conclusions----- This is another exercise set in a dystopia that is simply not possible...so who cares? There was nothing to balance that: nothing and no one to bring identification, or empathy, or involvement. This film is in the YA female demographic. One line summary: Teen's coming of age in a factionalized future dystopia. Two stars of five. Recommendation: fine if you are in the demographic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

All over IMDb, I see bad reviews, condemning the writing, the acting, casting and basically everything about this movie. So if you're a pessimist, read those reviews. Divergent is actually a decent film.Yes, I have been annoyed by the fact that some scenes are different from the book. Writing could have been better and I really do not get why writers would have changed a perfectly good story line (SPOILER: really, why not let Jeanine test 'a new serum' on Four, to let him run the simulation? Why not let Tris' mother rescue her from one of her worst fears? -END OF SPOILER)But next to these 'poor' choices in scenario, Divergent is a pretty good film. Lets not let our judgement be clouded to think the acting is so bad, when just a great story has been screwed over. The acting has certainly not been bad and the 'lack of chemistry' between the main characters can easily be explained by their personalities (which have just nob been translated well to the big screen). Really, I tried to also add a paragraph to this review about how it's not these young actor's faults that directors have messed up a good story (but then again, they were also not good enough to improve things very much).Lets give Divergent the benefit of the doubt. Let the directors be fired and the actors prove themselves in the sequel. The story is worth it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I read the book before watching it and I was very surprised with the inaccuracy of the plot. Many key details were left out and were changed beyond recognition. Many scenes angered me with the complete and utter disregard for the book. I was appalled. Some key details like Edward being stabbed in the eye, the relationship between Tris and Four (Tobias) came out of no where as in the book it had been developed from the first look between the two. Edward leaving Dauntless is a key in Insurgent and there was no development of that character. Tris's mother visiting her on visiting day, Tris and Tobias climbing to the top and having their moment, Christina getting the flag instead of Tris, paint balls instead of darts, Jeanine showing up where she is not supposed to be. This movie would have been much better if they would have followed the book. I was very disappointed this movie. I gave it two stars instead of one because it did follow some of the plot, loosely.

The book is on my ""never read"" list, mostly because I heard it has a lot of romance in it with insta-love, which I can't abide. I was afraid that the movie would be like that as well. However, I have had a movie change my mind about reading the book, twice actually. Therefore, I decided to give this one a shot.I've heard the story compared to The Hunger Games more times than I can remember. Funny thing was that it reminded me of a whole lot of other dystopian novels, and even some non-dystopian ones, but not The Hunger Games. The factions remind me more of the houses in Harry Potter. Especially because the houses seemed to stay with them even after they left them. The difference is that Hufflepuff is divided up into three aspects of the Hufflepuff mentality, which in a way doesn't make sense, but it does if you think in the terms of jobs. The only people we're missing are the Slytherins. The problem with factions and houses is that no one fits only into one category. You may be more like one, you may want to be more like one, but no one can be defined by just one trait. Houses have been criticized because of this, but people eventually leave school, though the house they were in remain as a part of their identity. Factions you can't leave, therefore they are worse.The world building really doesn't make sense in some ways. I'm not sure if it's better explained in the books, but there are definite holes. So my questions within the first 10 minutes of the movie were:The beginning was actually quite good. While the world wasn't established well, the personality and life of Tris was. Then it got boring really fast. The whole training, the drug induced illusions reminded me of Ender's Game. I was equally bored there as well. Good thing that this time I had cooking lunch to occupy the 90% of my mind the movie wasn't engaging. Things only started to pick up an hour and a half into the movie. Some aspects also reminded me of 1984. While the threat from outside wasn't specific, it's not unlike the war in 1984, which I always thought didn't actually exist. Also the whole drug thing, that I won't spoil further.The ending itself was kind of anti-climatic and annoying. I am half tempted to pick up the second book just to see where they go from here, but I was so bored for most of the movie, the jury is still out on that.I almost forgot to write about the actors and the characters. That in itself speaks volumes. While Tris was well established, I didn't find her someone I could cheer on. I'm not sure if it was the actress, or just the character. Shailene Woodley I've never seen in a movie before, therefore I would not be able to judge her acting. However, as Tris she just didn't feel much engaged in the whole story. It felt more like she was stumbling from one event to the other. Her smiles felt lukewarm. Kind of like Kristen Stewart, which is not a good thing. However, it could just have been a bad director, or the story itself. I would need to see her in other things as well to see if I like her as an actress. Theo James is hot for sure. If he was my instructor I would have wanted to get into his pants too. But love? I didn't feel the love connection between the characters. I generally don't like mushy romance, but a bit of building up would have been nice. The character of Four didn't feel well-rounded either. He was more like the convenient guy that can be the love interest.Are the books coming off my ""never read"" list? Not sure at this point. I may find my curious nature not being able to let go of wanting to know how this thing ends. This is partly why I tend to go for finished series. I hate waiting. The movie itself gets two stars for interesting beginning, boring long middle, kind of picking up ending.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Action packed, intense and suspenseful.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3034653/?ref_=tt_urv","nicolechan916","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35623598/?ref_=tt_urv","16 June 2014","It was a really well made movie and the action scenes were well executed. I missed a bit of the beginning of the film, so was a bit confused throughout but I get it now. It""s a pretty good storyline. Actually, it's quite brilliant really. So simple, yet so captivating.The visuals were really stimulating and detailed, which made it really believable. Some elements reminded me of 'inception' as well. Just in the way it was edited and contrasted.But the thing with these stories (Divergent and Hunger Games) is that they all question the leaders of the society or the way that society works. I don't know if they're trying to get more people aware of the power that leaders abuse and to take action against it, but I think because it is set in the future, people might not think of it in the present. I mean, there are already a lot of people aware of the power that leaders abuse- especially if you turn on the news and hear about the rioting and civil wars going on in parts of the world (Syria, Venezuela etc), but because we all live in our own little bubble, we don't think it concerns us. So maybe these novels/films are trying to reach out to the younger population and to make them think about these issues and if that's the case, that's totally awesome but it doesn't necessarily make them think of the NOW.Right.Moving on, I'm a huge Maggie Q fan (Nikita FTW), so was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of her. She could've done a lot of action scenes as well, maybe in the future films! *Crosses fingers* Not even sure if her character lives beyond the first book though, but I'm praying so hard that she does. I'll read the books soon.Also, I kind of hate the fact that though we have this powerful female protagonist, she is still mostly portrayed as the damsel in distress and needs the guy to save her. I guess they were trying to establish the 'chemistry' between them, but I found those scenes to be a bit awkward and unnecessary. Oh well, at least this passes the Bechdel test.Wait- I just thought of this one example (which was evident in Twilight as well) that really is extremely problematic. The guy goes ""if I wanted to hurt you, I would already have' or something like that. I've never noticed this before but thanks to my gender studies class, I realize how pro-abusive these kinds of statements are. Think about it for a second. The guy is asserting his dominance, saying I have the power to hurt you, but I choose not to.Please. I could kick you in the balls but I choose not to. Whatdya think of that?And the fact that the cast was predominantly white. Not hating on this film, just pointing out the obvious that most often flies over our heads.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Great movie, breath-taking scenes, amazing acting, perfect scenario. Although, some of the actors are pretty much unknown, Theo James is the actor who amazed me the most. I highly recommend ""Divergent"", it will be the movie to take you to another world! And I know, if you watch it once, you'll do it again. Definitely, the best choice, they could have made for lead role.

Since I haven't read Divergent since New Year's Eve 2014, I don't remember some parts in this movie, but it's mainly because some parts were changed, deleted, and or altered, so that's why it's good to read the original.This movie does contain sensual scenes, shooting violence, and blood/gore, so I suggest unless your child is mature for this, kids under 13 shouldn't really watch this film. Especially not your 6 year old children. I saw a small family with a mother and her two girls leave the movie theater, and I am 100% sure it was because of the loud shooting noises and the blood. It has stunning quality and good visual effects, and the moral of never giving up, being brave, and the main plot is fine, with no major alters, but it still annoys me it's not exactly the same.

With the latter example, where a new movie adapts an older theme, I mean divergent. Two great classic dystopian novels, 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 have both been converted into excellent motion pictures. But when you see franchises like Godzilla, James Bond, or Star Wars take a turn for the worse in the later adaptations, I often feel that the movie industry is also fading in quality. But then, movies like Divergent pop up and rejuvenate the idea I seem to have of Hollywood. It is an excellent film, in storyline, acting, screenplay, and, what is o so important to me, staying true to the older movies that have comparable themes (like 1984, but mostly my favourite Fahrenheit 451). Do not doubt about seeing this film, ever. The themes and storyline are familiar, yet refreshing because of the modern-day extra's like romance, emotion and action.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I thought it was really boring but then after then the movie got really interesting because the acting was really good witch made it believable by the audience. One thing that I would say for the next movie is that they have more settings in the movie also have more action in the movie. The ending of the movie. That was the best part of the movie because that is when the action started and after the movie thought that this movie is way better movie than The Hunger Games. The best part of the movie to me was when Tris was at the final stage and then we saw her fears and at one point Tris started to kick a guy. Also I was was about to cry when Tris parents die at the end of the movie.I think that this is the best movie of 2014 so far because it was really an amazing movie and I would love to watch the movie over and over again because that is how good the movie is to me.

I'm 31 years old I just watched it this morning and I thought it was great. I liked all the action yeah there wasn't anything crazy going on but the action was still very good. I also thought the story was great it felt to me like a mix between the hunger games and maybe something like dark city or total recall. I really enjoyed this movie. I hope they keep making them. I think the thing I thought was cool was the tattoo parlor I really wish that tattoos were painless lol. The actors I thought were good and that they were believable and they made the story. I am looking forward to rating the next movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I read it about 3 months after the movie Divergent was released and my friend really recommended the movie and was starting to read the book. So I gave it a try and LOVED it. And so on I finished the series and thought ""How about seeing the movie, like my friends told me to?"" But since almost all of the reviews were bad, I started to have low expectations. But, you know what? The movie wasn't near bad. Of course they changed some parts (even left out my favorite part in the book, but then found it it was a deleted scene) but that didn't bother me. I liked the story and the characters. It's not nearly as bad as people here say, but also not as good as the book. The one thing I especially liked about the movie, is how they could make Tris look like she's actually 16. A great casting of her. Four was supposed to be 18 but looked a bit old for that, but then I realized that they changed his age to 24. Fair enough. So you should see the movie, but just don't have your expectations too high.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Philosophy started 2500 years ago with Plato, Socrates questioning ourselves. Did this society become that stupid to create a perfect world in that way, impossible. We then see a joke of stereotypes in a monolithic society where contacts between factions are not allowed. However, at the end, ah the end... they fight for such a perfect world without knowing what the others (erudites) propose. The whole end is written to announce that there will be a 2nd one.

Often, that short-sells the more gleaming examples of the genre. Not so with Divergent, a ruthlessly narrow little bit of phony escapism that confirms every ugly stereotype. Dim and wooden, it's a thoroughly hand-holding bit of tack that can't seem to get over how breathlessly important it thinks it is. The generic core storyline has nothing to offer, over-familiar and rich with the scent of manufactured drama. Its cast, thin and transparent as they come, spends most of the bloated runtime reveling in their own majesty at the expense of actual character development. Not that the actors seem capable of exploring any such depth, were they given the material to work with. Shailene Woodley and Theo James, beautiful people without so much as a single spark between them, seem to have been chosen exclusively for their pouty appearances on the promotional materials. Likewise, an awkwardly mismatched sparkle-pop soundtrack stands at odds with the bleak, dystopian tones that the plot stretches for. At least the visual effects are well done, for what that's worth. It's a real waste of time and effort, an insulting vehicle to cash-in on the latest craze and promote a few of the parent company's tunes while they're at it. I wish I could get my two hours back.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is an old tradition in native American tribes of two-spirited people. If a boy (or girl) in his/her early pre-teenage years did not show required characteristics of its own gender, a ceremony was held to find out what are his inclinations. If a boy chose weaving utensils or girl went for the bow&arrows, he was considered a two-spirit - that is having male and female spirit in one body. These people were not punished, condemned or persecuted - they were considered quite important for the survival of the tribe. Having both male and female characteristics, they were believed to possess talents to bridge the world of men and women, settle the disputes, harmonized them. As much as bridge between material and spiritual worlds - they have become healers, shamans, storytellers, organizers of the ceremonies.Even if this traditional role was not considered ""sexual orientation"", but it was gender based (""third and fourth sex""), it nicely translates into contemporary language. While straight people are naturally more competitive, self-centered (me, my wife, my kids, my family) and also they are much more prone to become specialists (they tend to excel in one thing, but are often narrowly focused on this one domain only, without much understanding of the importance of the others ... they are experts always competing with the other experts ""who's better""), queer energy is more generalist, cooperative, inclusive, seeing bizarre interconnections between various topics, seeing things from the perspective, a ""bigger picture"". Hence - the harmonizers, the bridge between worlds, the glue among the professions. There are more artists, teachers, caretakers among them - that's exactly the modern version of shamans, storytellers, those who educate and give different perspective, those who are able to see things from multiple sides.While even the contemporary LGBT/queer movement is afraid to discuss these quite provocative queer histories and myths, it is interesting to see the exactly same topic being shown on screen. We see the majority of specialist (factions) who tend to quarrel who's more important for the society, compete for the power over the other factions ... and the rare (!) hated (!!) minority (!!!) of the generalists (divergent) who have the abilities to appease the eternal wars among those talented only intellectually (erudite), physically (dauntless), socially (abnegation), green (amity) or have strong sense of justice (candor).This - competition versus cooperation, specialists versus generalists, majority versus minority and also the omnipresent ""versus"" - are the most hot topics of the contemporary world. Gives us more of it!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When you think, while you watch the movie, 'hey, that's dumb', when you don't even have to be made aware of it after the movie, but think it during.. Needless to say, that's not a good thing. (and I can usually suspend my disbelief)Also it gets way to obvious that is was made only because The Hunger Games was such a success. Same thing with The Maze Runner. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's annoying, and that's not good at all. Shailene Woodley does an alright job, she's a good actress, and has an intriguing appearance. That tall dude, his appearance I don't care for. And yes, how people look matters in movies. I want to see pretty people in movies. But anyway!

Shailene Woodley is the perfect Tris. I was a little nervous about Theo James at first because he seems a bit old to play Four, but he's the perfect Four. Miles Teller is hilarious as Peter. Kate Winslet is such an amazing actress that she made me hate Jeanine even more than I already did. I love how the special effects crew made Chicago look as if there had been a war there and not like the typical futuristic city. Although the movie wasn't 100% accurate, it was pretty close to the book. I see why they left out the things that they did. But, I'm really disappointed that they didn't have the butter knife scene, Uriah, and Dauntless cake in the movie at all. Uriah's name was on the ranking board, but that doesn't explain his character and he is really important in Insurgent and Allegiant. I also didn't like that Tris just shot Will and moved on without any emotion. I hated that, in the movie, they didn't really go in depth with the secondary characters and I think that they should have because friends are an important part of the book. Overall, the movie stayed true to the book. I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely be seeing it again on theaters.My Three Words: Action-packed, wonderful, and intriguingMy Rating: 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story line was beyond predictable, not once was I even questioning how this movie would end. The book might have been better but after watching this I will never attempt to read it. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen. One thing that made the hunger games work was that the female lead could actually act, Jen has awards proving her talent. The female lead in this does not have the talent to present Jen an award. The countless pointless action scenes that didn't add anything to the weak plot made it even harder to watch.

Yes its kind of like hunger games and harry potter as some might say, but its also different in its own way that makes it stand out from all the other dystopians. It made me think of how schools are with the different cliques that are trying to control the other cliques and becoming power hungry with each victory.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Reassuring and refreshing because most Hollywood films are degrading and actively seek to demonise European natives and European culture.The political nature of the film was perhaps a glimpse at the possible future where unchecked governments may perform wicked acts against their own people in order to assume totalitarian control. We see this today with the creeping effects of globalisation and the often hinted at - 'new world order'.Solid acting all round yet not the most complex of scripts and minimal visual effects but a resounding message that people power will always win the day!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The casts are interestingly shown, which almost perfectly coincide with the faculties of Hogwarts, very coolly shown illusions and a charming boy love interest and part-time pickup guru. However, the main drawback of the film is the feeling of ill-conceivedness not only and not even so much of the actions of the characters, but of the world in general, although it is likely that in the book this is presented much more fully and more substantiated.In general, it's not bad, it's better to watch on the big screen, because it's much more epic.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After all, both movies (or books for that matter) set place in a post-war world and depict a society divided into groups in order to keep peace. However, even though the story lines have their similarities, Divergent evolves in a different way. It may be a story of fiction, but Divergent gives us viewers a way to look at society's problems and ask ourselves whether we can end up divided into factions in the future as well. One major thing I loved about the movie was the acting work; I think all actors did a wonderful job in defining the characteristics of their persona. The chemistry between Tris and Four was heartfelt. I am looking forward to seeing Insurgent and Allegiant.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

However,it's understandable that this movie is over-rated because many raters are simply fans of the book and they think such a good book can never be made into a bad movie. Well, never underestimate the power of movie makers. Host is one of the recent examples(good book, bad film). I have not read the book and this movie certainly killed my will to do so.

I mean ""action movie"" I just could not help but think about Hunger Games, and from then on the mind as if tricked by one of these ""now you breathe manually"" jokes kept looking for just those parallels. The nearly identical puppy love, dystopian society, excessive for-show violence and a pyrrhic happy end make this teenage girl-oriented flick a girl movie. I expect most of the high ratings come either from girls, or old lonely women, or men who got some great ... lip service... after bringing their GFs along to watch this as a reward afterwards. I usually like the general setting (i.e. dystopian, post-apocalypse) but there's just so much hello- kitty-glitter-spice a cook can put in a dish, and here he dumped the whole shaker in. Also plagued with a kind of soundtrack that would either be found on a teen girl's iPod or in a female oriented ""erotica"" movie. Did I say this movie is oriented on teen girls by the way? I can not stress this enough obviously. Even the rivalry depicted amongst the characters... even that is literally a direct copy/rip off from hunger games!I really want 139 minutes of my life back, but I don't think Hollywood does refunds. So, to the concerned potential viewer out there, know this: I sacrificed part of my life on the altar of cinema viewership, quite selflessly I might add, so that you can avoid wasting your time on it.

Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is ""special"", therefore a threat to society because she thinks ""independently"" - whatever that means.Those like her are called ""Divergent"" and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the ""divergents"" too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Honestly when I went into the movie I was not expecting it to be amazing or anything because I've been let down too many times by movie adaptations of books before but this honestly exceeded my expectations of how terrible it was going to be. Apart from the fact that they missed out and changed A LOT of the book, not to mention leaving out important characters, the acting was terrible and the settings and music were VERY, VERY typical Hollywood over dramatic rubbish. People would like to probably say that I did not enjoy it because of the fact that I have read the books and therefore expected too much from the movie but honestly if I had not read the books I would still have thought it was typical Hollywood garbage. It felt like I had been watching a parody for the actual movie and in some of the really 'serious' scenes I found myself laughing at how bad they were. I can honestly say that the only bits that people thought were funny actually came DIRECTLY FROM THE BOOK. Neil Burger, or whatever his name is, honestly really let down a really good and meaningful series and turned it into typical Hollywood garbage. I honestly don't understand how people thought it was good because I struggled to find anything good about it. Terrible green screening. WHAT DID THEY SPEND THEIR $80,000,000 BUDGET ON?! I hate to say it because I don't like to compare series to other series but they could have really learnt something from the Hunger Games film adaptations, sticking to the book is the best idea. All in all a MAJOR let down.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

If you see it as just a movie I guess that Neil Burger did a pretty decent job. But I have read the book and i barely made it trough the whole movie. First of all they totally messed up the storyline. It's like letting a toddler copy a Picasso, if you look closely you can see the original in there somewhere. And second of all they didn't manage to get even half of the brutality and intensity from the book in to the movie, the fight scenes are a joke, not to talk about the casting. I guess some of the actors where pretty good but none of them where right for their rolls. And what about the plot twist? They completely messed that up, revealing what was going to happen way before it did. I know that transferring a book in to a movie is hard but come on, rewriting scenes like this should be a crime. In conclusion Neil Burger completely and totally raped a fine piece of literature. The only upside to this movie was the music choice since i'm a big Ellie Goulding fan..If you read the book and liked it don't bother to watch the movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But nope just the combination of twilight, harry potter, The hunger games and any other ""teen"" movie + chick flick at once. The only good part of this movie was the main actress ;) and I literally mean JUST the actress. Maybe this would've been a good movie if I hadn't watched any movie EVER. And that was the only thing I could think about in every scene again and again and again. Stay away as far as possible from this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"3","/10","'Divergent' Conforms to Uninspired Fan Service with Little Clarity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982957/?ref_=tt_urv","TyRawrrnosaurus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13132580/?ref_=tt_urv","20 March 2014","In a very quick introduction voice over by Tris we are told that after a massive war society was broken into five factions to ensure it never happens again. Why the war happened, who it was with, and how it ended is never discussed, but at least Chicago has a large security fence as tall as a skyscraper surrounding the city to protect against a giant T-Rex or something. Planes must not be an issue either because they could easily fly over the fence, but we never see any flown; technology in this world is used for guns, digital display panels, seeing into a person's dreams, and instant tattoos, not for rebuilding a more suitable world to live in - that would be silly.Tris was born within the Abnegation faction aka the just and loyal Hufflepuffs. Abegnation are the leading figures of government because of their selflessness. She lives with her mother Natalie, father Andrew, and brother Caleb who is also taking the aptitude test despite being older, which makes no sense per the rules stating 16-year-olds must take the test and choose a faction.Now that Tris is 16-years-old, she must partake in a process where she is told to drink an unknown liquid to determine which clique she belongs to. Based on her results, she may find herself fitting in with Dauntless aka the courageous Gryffindors; Candor aka the ready-minded Ravenclaws; Erudite aka the cunning Slytherins; or the last group known as Amity who just farm and have no real stakes or voice in the entire film.Tris' results of her aptitude test are inconclusive and discovers she is a rare breed known as Divergent. Those labeled Divergent can fit into any faction because they are capable of having more than one personality trait – explanation as to why everyone else cannot achieve the same level of basic human nature is not provided. Through a sorting hat-like process, after wasting time with an aptitude test that tells each teen which faction they should belong to, everyone is able to choose a faction, via a blood sacrifice, they'd like to shack up with for the rest of their lives.Luckily for Tris, her aptitude test proctor Tori allowed her to walk away despite one line of dialogue telling us Divergents are a threat to the system. Evidence to prove Divergents are dangerous to the way of life is never explained well enough to truly justify as a threat. So Tris hides her little secret anyway and chooses Dauntless because she would not want to become factionless, a nomadic people without a home who are not accepted into any of the five factions – doesn't that make them Divergent? While spending almost an hour through a rigorous training regime to prove to us she is the one, we are introduced to a love interest named Four (Theo James). Four is the eye candy until the main conflict presents itself almost two-thirds of the way into the movie; the Erudites want to overthrow Abnegation as the leaders because selflessness is too weak and not logical. Heaven forbid anyone should be able to think beyond their means.With a taxing two hour and twenty minute run time, Divergent is a complete clunker. The real grit of the story doesn't begin until well over an hour in and it isn't until the last thirty minutes that some kind of resolve needs to happen. Since I haven't read the book, I'm not sure if it is Roth's lack of imagination or the screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor's failure to bring the book to life, but Divergent is absolutely devoid of any kind of world building to make this film stand out besides its loony way of assigning factions to its citizens. They even use the Chicago's L transit system to ride into Hogwarts, I mean Dauntless.Strangely, there seems to be no adults anywhere unless they play a small role in the plot, and yet there are so many kids running around. The bulk of the movie is focused on these kids and their plight to fit into Dauntless. Tris and Four's parents become a convoluted piece of the puzzle near the final act, adding little relevance, clarity, emotional depth, or importance. Janine, an Erudite and President Snow rip-off, is one of the few adults we get to know and acts as the main antagonist, posing as a faceless, unmotivated, and irrational villain.Thankfully, Woodley and James are able to have enough chemistry on screen to provide some redeeming qualities. Another case of beautiful people falling for beautiful people. Without Woodley, Divergent could not stand a chance. There is also a Ron Weasley-esque sidekick for Tris named Christina as well as a Neville-esque boy named Will.Visually unimpressive with an uninspiring score that does nothing to better the film's lack of a personality, Divergent struggles even on a superficial level. Even a larger budget than most YA adaptations can't set it apart from the rest. Sets do not feel lived in and the different factions are hardly explored, making the world even more unbelievable than it already is.Themes of discovering who you are, understanding your place in the world, and standing up for yourself are practically force fed, but in the final third of the film the moral teachings diminish and Divergent transforms into a popcorn action flick. Burger tries to materialize high concepts of freewill, totalitarianism, and the human condition, but misses the mark by focusing more on the romance and action than answering the bigger questions.Divergent is simple fan service at its best; it even ends so abruptly that no ramifications of Erudite's actions, Tris' Rebellion, or Dauntless' coup d'etat are mentioned. Anyone going into this movie without having read the books is going to end up confused or annoyed by the sheer lack of coherence.","12 out of 40 found this helpful.

It may have well have been set in 1940 as thats the level of technology you see in this world.I have not read the book, but this film was boring. For over two hours your watching nameless kids go to school. But nothing happens! There are no student rivalries, no interesting characters that set them apart, no class clown. Every character was EXACTLY the same and none of them did anything unique or memorable.If there was a villain, i didn't see him or her in the 100 minutes i watched it before walking out. It was just a bunch of kids attending class! Even the teachers were kids. Adults don't even exist in this world for longer than a few seconds every half hour.No explanation was given about the war, the world, the wall. The class factions might have been benefited by a sixth faction called 'builders' that actually tried repairing all the buildings in that city. As it stood, there was no-one around to build or repair anything. The whole mystery about 'divergent' was barely touched in the time I watched it, and I had given up waiting for answers when I walked out. It lacked any likable and interesting characters, any resemblance of a plot other than completing high school, it lacked a villain or conflict of any kind. Story-telling 101 was ignored completely and the only thing that gave the rating an extra star was the cinematography and panoramic views of the destroyed city which impresses well for a few seconds, before being ruined by the characters getting in the way of the camera and blocking our view.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

"4","/10","The cast is the least worthwhile in this lacklustre and generic young-adult dystopian thriller.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2988775/?ref_=tt_urv","caseymoviemania","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33067187/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2014","Riding on the phenomenally successful adaptations of the first two HUNGER GAMES movies, it's simply a matter of time before Veronica Roth's best-selling novel trilogy (Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant) is finally riped for big screen adventure. Out of the gate this year is the highly-anticipated first movie in a trilogy, DIVERGENT, which already positioned as the next HUNGER GAMES.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in a dystopian Chicago where society is divided into five factions based on five different personalities: Erudite (smart), Candor (honest), Amity (peaceful), Dauntless (brave) and Abnegation (selfless). Those who doesn't fit to any of the five personalities are declared factionless and they are equivalent of homeless peoples.However, Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), who belongs to an Abnegation family with parents Natalie (Ashley Judd) and Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), discovers that she is a Divergent after being tested by a tester named Tori (Maggie Q). Apparently Divergent is classified as someone who fit into more than one personality, and could not be discovered by anyone or risk terrible consequences.When the day has arrived for a new group of teens to choose their own factions, Beatrice picks Dauntless. After the choice has been made, she has to undergo an extensive training period to become a qualified brave warrior within given time period. If fail, she will be kicked out of the faction and becomes homeless. As the training takes place, she slowly becomes friends with one of her drill instructors named Four (Theo James) and eventually falls for each other. Then one day she learns about Erudite, led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), is planning to overthrow Abnegation, the humble faction which currently rules the government.THE GOOD STUFFThe cast here is overall solid, with Shailene Woodley being the particular standout. As Tris, she manages to handle her first leading role with her engaging and soulful performance. Equally good is Theo James, who brings an unexpected warmth beneath his cool-looking exterior. In fact, both he and Woodley display believable chemistry together as eventual lovers.As for the supporting actors, Jai Courtney is perfectly typecast as the no-nonsense Dauntless leader Eric, while Zoe Kravitz is likable as Tris' closest friend, Christina. Maggie Q, who plays compassionate tester Tori, manages to make full use of her limited screen time to give a worthwhile performance. Last but not least is Kate Winslet, in her rare villainous role as the power-hungry Jeanine Matthews. Although her role doesn't flesh out well, she remains plausible enough to pull off her role with her steely-eyed expression.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The engaging knife-throwing scene (which is heavily promoted in the internet) where Tris is daring enough to step in front of the knife boards and tries her best not to flinch when Four starts throwing knives at her.THE BAD STUFFAt 139 minutes, DIVERGENT suffers badly from glacial pacing while the story -- adapted by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor -- feels bland and noticeably lack of sheer urgency needed for this kind of dystopian-thriller genre. Then there's the drab vision of dystopian Chicago which feels like a cheap-looking, B-grade movie. Overall technical credits here are disappointingly mediocre, while all the action sequences here (from fistfights to extended shootouts during the climactic finale) falls flat on the surface. It doesn't help either when the action is mostly ruined by shaky camera-work.To top that off, it's a surprise that Neil Burger's previous directing credits, such as the magic-themed period drama THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) and mystery thriller LIMITLESS (2011), who has a knack for showing versatility when tackling different genres, seems to be clueless directing DIVERGENT. I was shocked to see his direction here is terribly pedestrian and dare I say, lifeless as well.FINAL WORDSOverall, DIVERGENT is a waste of opportunity and a weak start to a potentially exciting new movie franchise. Hopefully, the subsequent two sequels (INSURGENT and ALLEGIANT) will show some improvements in the future.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie just doesn't make sense. Let's say you produce the movie Sharknado. But then you have warned the audience, and they know that this is crap! But why would anybody finance Divergence with more than 80Mil US$? I think that earning money with drugs or weapons is more human than producing such a movie and then cheating the audience. What I also don't quiet understand is, why this movie has 7.1 on IMDb and 48 meta score? If you ask me, a score of 3.4 would be OK, and a meta score of 15. I know that now somebody could argue and tell, but the original book is like this movie. Yes, maybe it is, but not every crappy book has to be recorded into a movie!!!!!! NO IT DOESN'T!!!!!!

So was I. What do you get? The story of a young girl who faces challenges and tough decisions as she is coming of age. That about sums up the movie; and of course the run of the mill cheesy romance.'Divergent' are set in a future society where mankind has survived some cataclysm, and are now living in a fenced city, with the people divided into factions which serves a societal function. It has the setting to explore multiple themes of human interaction, survival and philosophical questions.Sounds cool? So, are there any themes explored? No. Are the factions explored? No. Are the mechanisms of society put to a test? No. Are the so-called 'dystopia' theme of the movie explored? No. How about an intricate plot and interesting characters? No. So what exactly do we have here? My opinion on movies is, no, you don't have to explore any philosophical issue, make social commentary or develop profound characters or story. Just make it fun, exciting and action packed etc.'Divergent' delivers nothing but boring teenage drama, about some bland girl facing challenges of life and growing up in this future society. That is all. The only 'message' 'Divergent' promotes is that, it is OK to be yourself and stand out and don't let the grown ups stop you, and conforming to society is not so bad that either. Us young new hipster teens just need to remake society in our image and all the problems goes away.The acting is unconvincing to just plain out of touch with the scenes. In my opinion, this is also a really horrible teenage romance drama, if that was all they were gunning for. Spanning 2 hours and 15min...Will be a waste of time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Those who hadn't read the book sat there confused at some points, and bored at others. The lack of Tris and Four's developing relationship made it sudden and awkward, very far from the book's snowball of romantic events. The acting was also extremely bland, and a lot of the characters did not develop enough to form a connection with the audience.I do not foresee any other movies being made from this series.

Divergent is tailor made for the least discerning teen viewer, who likes their characters a bit less than one dimensional and their romances telegraphed with all the artistry of a daytime soap. The attempt to class up these proceedings with what amounts to an extended cameo by Kate Winslet backfires with her villainous role, that even she can't transcend with this cornball material. Shailene Woodley barely registers as a presence, has no charisma and can't carry this film. She brings nothing to her role and you have to demolish suspension of disbelief to accept her as a young woman who can handle herself in action. The effects are adequate, with the exception of a zip line sequence through some run down skyscrapers, that serves no narrative purpose but to show off some effects they didn't have the money to do correctly. Running at about two hours and twenty minutes, Divergent begins with our main character having to make the most important decision of her life by choosing her faction - but there's no suspense or compelling material watching an undeveloped character go through this. The narrative then becomes an endless series of training sequences, before rushing into a last act that feels like an entire sequel condensed into a climax. With so little substance, it's going to be an insurmountable task to make this a running series of films that won't be instantly crushed under the weight of its own flimsy premise.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had only finished the book 2 weeks prior so I knew I would be biased and therefore I over-looked the movie's portrayal of the book in order to critic the cinematography. However, I wasn't pleased. I was happy as a clam just to be there and enjoyed myself, but the movie wasn't great. The acting seldom felt genuine, the scenes were extremely choppy, they left no room for any character development and barely felt any room for plot development and included the silliest, cliché parts but not the would-be significant plot-defining parts of the book. The thing I am most disappointed with though is Trice. When I read the book, Shalene (sp?) was exactly who I pictured, but once I got into the theatre, I was sorely disappointed in what I saw.But I will admit, the action was great and the choppiness was good in the sense that it kept the adrenaline going throughout the movie. The settings and costumes were spectacular and they did do an honest job of trying to put as much of the book into a 2 hour film as was physically possible....?","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Yes it was a mistake. A big mistake. So I walk into the theater Wednesday afternoon, and arrive early for the showtime. When the previous showtime ends and everyone walks out I wait about ten minutes to go into the theater. After waiting the ten minutes I walk into the theater and notice an older man dead asleep in the back row. This was that warning from God that you know this film was going to be just downright bad.The story is yet another dystopian future film aimed towards the younger audiences who just really want to see this films for the young guys or the young girls. Frankly it seems like we get stories like this every year now. Back in the 70s and 80s we got amazing dystopian future films like Rollerball, Running Man, and Death Race 2000. As you may already know the stories are far better in those films than in this film being discussed here. In Divergent we get a lousy script tossed at the wall as the filmmakers hoped something would stick. Well when this slop was tossed onto the big screen nothing really stuck at all. Even the acting is completely forgettable minus an actor or two like Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet. Mostly everyone else is phoning it in big time.Junkie XL, whatever kind of name that is, did the music score for this film. And yet again it was more slop thrown at a wall hoping it would stick. It doesn't stick of course. We are subjected to trendy new age music that the younger generation might like instead of a Hans Zimmer type score, the executive producer of the score for this film. Zimmer is a huge name in musical scores and the creators of this likely wanted some name power. And Zimmer is a guy who rarely turns down checks.Overall if you are in the category that this film is targeted towards, for example young teenage girls, then you will likely eat this film up. To the rest of us its slop on a movie screen. I'm all for dystopian future films being made, however I'm not interested in the ones that are only made to ride the success of a film that is nearly the same exact thing. This film is a big time pass, and frankly it is not even worth a rental.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This flimsy premise is the basis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes thought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast running, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big guns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she winked directly at camera.

In my opinion, ""The Hunger Games"" and Company can't catch up with classics like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Rollerball"", ""Soylent Green"" and so on. ""The Hunger Games"" was already almost just a rip-off of the famous Japanese book and movie ""Battle Royale"". At least, ""The Hunger Games"" had a few great actors, stunning costumes and settings and loads of action. ""Divergent"" is now a rip-off of ""The Hunger Games"" series. My advice for you is to watch the originals instead of what Hollywood wants to be the next blockbusters.So basically, this is a rip-off of a rip-off. But ""Divergent"" features less impressive actors and actresses that portray more or less convincing characters. I could not connect with any of them but maybe the target audience of teenage girls would see things differently. The costumes and settings are much duller than those in ""The Hunger Games"". The action scenes are a lot less urgent. Even the story is rather frustrating in here, feels rather random and is even a little bit hard to follow at some points. The movie's villain has not much charisma either.The film wants to introduce the female main character Tris as somebody special. She passes a mental test that should indicate one of the five factions she would best fit with. People in dystopian Chicago are either brave, intelligent, peaceful, selfless or truthful in an isolated and precisely structured society after a great war that is not further explained. Tris doesn't fit to any of these factions in particular and is divergent. This is already rather strange. The so-called test lasted for maybe one minute and the main character acted in a completely normal way where I would have taken the same decisions if this test was for real. One doesn't really believe the movie that Tris is so different and special. She is an ordinary looking girl with ordinary skills who is about to go through an ordinary bad meets evil plot and to fall in love with an ordinary good-looking young man. The base of this story is already rather odd.The entire story is not much better. The so-called divergents are considered being a danger for the elite and are chased down by governmental forces. Tris joins the brave faction and tries to hide her secret. One day, the intelligent faction tries to overthrow the leading selfless faction with the the help of the mentally manipulated brave faction. Tris and her boyfriend who turns out to be the son of the leader of the selfless faction (what a surprise) will obviously save the world in a few minutes.Between the initial test and the final battle scenes, this movie is filled with endless mental and physical games and simulations that portray the main characters everyday life among the brave faction. The fighting scenes vary between being visually stunning and being ordinary. The supporting characters in the brave faction are superficial and don't add anything to the plot line. The failed assassination attempt of the main character feels completely random and out-of-place. Basically, the first and maybe the last thirty minutes of this movie are addicting while the rest tries to kick off some character development and dystopian world exploration that is mostly uninteresting because both characters and the dystopian world are rather ordinary. This all sounds rather negative and it is. So you might ask why I still gave this movie half of the points. The reasons are simple. I'm a big fan of dystopian books and movies and even the worst examples still attract my attention. The special effects are well done and worth to be seen in the cinema. The capture-the-flag game at some point in the movie is my personal highlight set in an interesting atmosphere and location. As I said, the first thirty minutes of the movie are rather entertaining and promising. The final thirty minutes are filled with action and tension. Even though the outcome of the story is highly predictable, the last thirty minutes will get you on the edge of your seats. There are even a few emotional moments in there when some characters need to do some important sacrifices. Not everything is bad in here. Half of the movie is well done, the other half really ordinary.In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you would like to watch the rip-off (""The Hunger Games"") of a rip-off (""Battle Royale""). If you liked the rip-off, you might also appreciate most parts of ""Divergent"". If you thought the rip-off was of an average quality or below, let me tell you that this movie here is clearly below the rip-off's quality. Don't waste your time on it then. As a fan of the genre, I had a little bit more than two and a half mostly entertaining hours. The movie was made to watch it in the cinemas because of its solid sound and visual effects. On the other side, I would certainly not watch it again and I wouldn't buy or rent this film either. If there was a sequel in a few years, I would probably feel like watching it for the sake of having already watched the first part but I would feel hesitating. Don't get yourself into the same situation. I would rather suggest you to avoid this movie and watch something more original which basically means that you should look for the original dystopian movies.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Because, upon closer inspection, that's the main flaw of the filmTo properly analyze the book, a lengthy prologue about the conduct of a dictatorial government and its implementation on the novel by Veronica Roth necessary. Just as there is a forensic awareness in the serial murderer (able to find excuses for their behavior), there is also a totalitarian awareness in many dictatorships: arise in times of great social disorganization, impose control over the people, atone and classified and exterminate the ""threats"", expand and seek to obtain a balance or a happy society, even if they must use the most violent and cruel methods to achieve that goal. Even the Nazis sought a world in peace and harmony, but for this task were insanely convinced the domination of the Lebensraum and the extermination of ""undesirables"", plus the loyalty of the people to the Nazi PartyVeronica Roth respects part of this common sense: the dictatorship of the novel comes at a time where wars almost destroyed the world, and this new totalitarian government seeks a peaceful state curtailing freedoms. But is Roth who also added a bunch of craps: this dictatorship imposes an impractical system of dividing society into groups of coexistence, where some people to meet majority must choose one of the groups to live forever in it and not to contact legally the other sectors, which means that many families would be torn apart by the division if their children chose a foreign group, triggering a social imbalance that is somewhat unfair in a totalitarian government that could well impose another system without disrupting society so drastically. In ""The Hunger Games"" there is the classical system of minorities with money vs enslaved and poor people, with dreams of belonging to the elite minority, which is a scheme that allows poors to be with their families until they are chosen randomly in combat (it is not very realistic, but certainly much more flexible). But this approach that Roth tre is surprisingly fla even for a real dictatorship. Furthermore, the system designs its logical failures: people living in their family's are to meet certain age and choose, which means that the sectors may suffer easily seepage of personalities from other groups just because a guy gets two personalities (the personality of the family and the new personality of the group); in fact in the film alludes to this pointBut also Vernica Roth, either she lacks imagination or personal beliefs, embarks on theological estates where human ills are products of elementary, almost cultural and godlike factors that humans suffering. Thus, wars are caused by the qualities of ignorance, selfishness, etc., and the solution is to remove these qualities. It is an excessively naive view, today there are materials and advanced sciences like ponerology who developed the explanation of a dictatorial government as complex mechanisms where the executors suffer serious pathological deviations.And if all this world sounds implausible, worst of all is the bizarre taste of the novelist to give substance to her name and universe. It's horrible: the groups were called ""Candor,"" ""Erudite"" ""Amity"" ""Abnegation"" and ""Dauntless"". Each of these factions meets the personality according to the title of the group, eg if you belong to ""Dauntless"" then you'll be a brave person for the rest of your life. It's so absurd and obviously the names of the groups, and the objectives of the factions also ridiculousThe film is directed by Neil Burger, who knows how to deliver some power but does not have many exceptional films (not even ""The Illusionist""). In ""Divergent"" applies enthusiasm enough to be entertaining, even if only dedicated to copy some tips from other directors, even if only dedicated to emulate the energy of the films ""The Hunger Games"" 1 & 2. Many scenes action / adventures are good but unconnected, with the only purpose of generating a little entertainment in a production that focuses on the main character training. There are awkward moments: the test sequence (the protagonist with the wolf) is really flat, instead of waking some lyricism. The Soundtrack is bizarre and out of context, Pop songs when the movie tries to sell this as ""Serious""The protagonist decides to belong to ""Dauntless"" (because it is the most entertaining group to make a film, right?), And is warned about two special groups: the ""factionless"" where individuals who did not pass the test of their faction live in an area of ??decay; and the ""divergent"" group where they are people who do not fit the mold of legal groups and are quickly killed to prevent rebellions. In the ""factionless"" is absurd to think that people who have own culture fall into a state of total decay, simply for failing a test. And in the case of the ""divergent"" if you think about it deeply, has exactly the same characteristics of a ""factionless"". Why not classified in the same group?This review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose nowhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/80744453615/divergent-film- review","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Divergent is nothing new from other films of its kind. Admittedly, the first act does have some interesting world building, and the world is an intriguing one. It's the story, the writing, and its characters that leave much to be desired.Then, all the ""build up"" in the first two acts leads to a very unsatisfying and rather anticlimactic conclusion. Questions left unanswered (which to be fair could be answered in the sequels) and characters underdeveloped.I will be honest, though I expected worse.

So, how does it measure up? Divergent takes place in a bleak, strictly regimented future where everyone is born into certain ""factions"" based primarily on their personality traits. Those may include intelligence, selflessness, fearlessness, justness and kindness. At a coming of age ceremony the young members of this society are given a test that dictates what faction they belong in—however, they able to choose the one they want no matter their results. Our teen protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley) was born into the selfless faction, and is shocked to learn that the results of her personality test are inconclusive—therefore she is ""divergent"", and cannot fit into society. However she chooses to join the fearless faction and with the help of some friends begins a covert overthrow of the government so this faction business can be done away with.Before I get into anything I'll say I've not read the books, so I do not know how this compares to the source material, nor if they did anything ""wrong"" in the film. This movie felt forced. It felt like it just really, really wanted to be The Hunger Games. But unfortunately none of the characters, plot, or fictitious government were very good. I spent the entire movie thinking that the concept of their factions was so flimsy it was ridiculous. Mainly because the personality traits—kind, just, intelligent, selfless, and brave are NOT at all contradictory. I find it flat out impossible to believe that any person could possibly fit into just one faction. Not only that, but what the hell is the point of the test if you can choose your faction regardless of what the test says? It would at least make more sense if people must stay in the faction they're born into like a caste system, or just that one MUST go into the faction their test dictates. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable, and the acting really fell flat. I was very aware I was watching a movie, and was never engaged or excited by anything that happened.All in all this movie was a poorly acted and poorly executed mess that left me checking the time every few minutes. It's based on a storyline and characters that make no logical sense, and who try to be poignant but just come off sounding juvenile and foolish. Definitely not worth the time it takes to watch it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When what felt like the 'intro' was dragging on for over an hour, I googled whether there were follow-ups to come. Unfortunately, yes.The story follows this girl who lives in a strange futuristic society, in which people have to enter one of five factions. Which one is determined by character. This faction system, it is mentioned, is essential in keeping the peace after the last global war. It is not clear, however, how this faction system contributes to peace. It seems to me that it causes competitive behaviour between factions, but maybe the next movie explains how it works. Well now, to prevent spoilers, the girl experiences the beginning part of an adventure. It is actually quite a predictable movie.I did not like it very much, but I presume I am not in the intended audience group and I didn't read the novels either. I rate it five stars because some parts of the story made sense, I did not feel offended by it and the (albeit quite anticlimactic) suspense of and questions about the history of the world war that caused the demise of civilization.Reminded me of the hunger games: based on books, with a female lead role, and a strange society with questionable behaviour. Also, I did not like that movie very much either.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The audience (I am guessing) are teens, hence the obvious lack of plot complexity. Overall - the movie is okay. Nothing special but not too bad either.However... here comes the fine print: Divergent, The Maze Runner, Hunger Games and probably a couple more franchise movies have all something in common - they have literally the same plot. I defecate you not - every one of them is about a teen or a group of teens living in quasi-post- apocalypse settings, in a society different from our own, where the same protagonists rebel against the established order in their own way and fight ""the evil old people in charge"" I DARE anyone to prove the opposite! And... of course since it's a teen movie... as already mentioned there is the ""youthful rebellion"", there is the cliché Hollywood character building that takes almost half the movie and.. oh, of course: the slight sexual tension between the characters.I feel as if I have been robbed those hours watching these movies, and now I engage in even more waste of time by writing a review.

While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), ""Divergent"" was just an ""okay"" movie.For a basic plot summary, ""Divergent"" tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up ""divergent"", meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a ""which career should I choose?"" test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole ""what to do next in life"" is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.The problem, though, is that ""Divergent"" tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.Contemporary films like ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Giver"" (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of ""camouflaging"" the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. ""Giver"" pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while ""Hunger Games"" (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like ""Divergent"" takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.""Divergent"" isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The main culprit springs out of an uninspired cast nearly top to bottom. Lead Shailene Woodley deeps lacks the Jennifer Lawrence's big screen charisma and the viewer's eye frequently loses attention on what she's saying in favor of some interesting CGI work on post-apocalyptic Chicago. English thespian Theo James has the gravitas of someone in their early thirties which ramps up the ick factor when you dwell on the problematic plot point of a male teacher starting a romance with his 16 year old female charge. Most of the rest of the cast is indistinguishable although some of that is a side effect of the book which struggled to distinguish the male characters. Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet could have easily swapped parts between the criminally under-used mother character and the villain with the least evil name ever - Jeanine without any diminishment. The boring cast does play the plot close to the book although the necessarily condensing accelerates as the movie goes on until an ending that is just a quick greatest hits of the last dozen chapters of the book. In short, given a mediocre Hunger Games and Harry Potter band wagon jumper as the source material this wasn't going to be great but it could have been much better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's as if she ripped her books apart and someone picked up pieces and glued them randomly together and said ""let's make a film!"".It's as if a high school group of amateurs decided to reenact it and film it and somehow Hollywood bought it? Lacking everything from context, a fitting soundtrack, well done VFX, good actors (not even Winslet made me happy and definitely did not fit this role), the list goes on and on. But most important of all: so much has been cut off from the original that it lacks all kinds of depth that movies as well as books need to make it something great and make you FEEL it. Divergent the movie was nothing but a falling piece of crap that landed flat and never stood a chance with this rewritten script.

I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I have been a lifelong Potter fan, enjoyed Twilight (the books are way better than the movies) and loved The Hunger Games. I like Science Fiction even though many of these books were written for teens and I'm in my 20s. Regardless, I wanted to give the Divergent series a chance and my next read will be The Maze Runner.First of all, the movie was SO not faithful to the book. If I had never read the book, I would have liked the movie more, but it was so horribly inaccurate. I found myself saying ""No,"" ""That never happens,"" ""WHAT?!"" ""What about...?"" to almost everything. I'm kind of shocked that the author approved this movie. Entire scenes and characters were left out. This book was shorter than most of the Harry Potter books and the directors of those movies seemed to fit everything in nicely, so I wouldn't use that as an excuse!Second of all, the characters needed to be expressed more so. Peter isn't mean enough, Jeanine isn't evil enough, Four isn't edgy enough (and he looks a lot older than 18, but I digress), etc. I did appreciate Eric though. I think they did a great job with his character.There wasn't much for back story either. I don't expect a movie to go into extraneous detail since that's what the books usually do, but there was practically no detail. I found myself explaining things to my boyfriend while we were watching that way he would know why things were happening.I don't know what else to say. It just wasn't a good movie because it's like they hardly read the book themselves.

I tend to doubt it. Take ""Divergent,"" a futuristic tale based on the book by Veronica Roth, itself just the first in a series of novels aimed primarily at young adults. Right off the bat, one can see that ""Divergent"" owes a great deal to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" both being set in a society built on a strict caste system, where every member of the community is assigned a social level and a specialized task from which there is basically no escape. The difference is that, in Huxley's world, one is engineered from ""conception"" to be a member of a certain caste, while, in Roth's, individuals are, theoretically at least, free to choose, at one crucial point in their adolescence, the group to which they will forever belong.In ""Divergent,"" there are five categories or ""factions,"" as they're called here, only two of which have any real significance in the film: Abnegation, whose principal function is selfless service to the community, and Dauntless, which serves, essentially, as the police force in this walled-off, post-apocalyptic version of old Chicago. Caught in the middle is a young woman named Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who, while raised in Abnegation, finds that she may actually be what is called a ""Divergent,"" a rare individual who fits comfortably into more than one category, making her an existential threat to the stability of this homogeneous society, where everyone knows his or her place and role. Beatrice opts to join Dauntless, a decision which leads to innumerable training sequences that seem to drag on for a minor eternity.Par for the course for the dystopic genre, our divergent heroine soon finds herself on the run from diabolical government forces (led by Kate Winslet) bent on destroying her lest she throw a monkey wrench into their ""peaceful,"" ""well-oiled,"" ""harmonious"" society.And that's pretty much all the movie is about. Throw in some dreamscape elements straight out of ""Total Recall"" and ""Inception"" - both much better films, by the way - and soon we find ourselves heading down the rabbit-hole into incoherence and confusion from which it becomes virtually impossible to extricate ourselves.Even decent - if pretty much standard, at this point - production values can't rescue a generally drab film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having no prior knowledge about the Divergent film series, one would not be as disappointing if did not enjoy the film. This film is best suited and aimed for those fans that enjoy films as the Hunger Games, Twilight or Maze Runner, and we can see why. As these are more teenage, young adult based theme films. The Divergent Series has done well box office wise which is why it is a trilogy. About the film, the effects and visuals as well done, the presence and lead portrayal of Shailene Woodley is good as she is a likable lead to root for. Divergent is quite long and seems to drag at times though there are some scenes of entertainment in general. It is quite predictable and not as suspenseful or thrilling as one had assumed. Towards the end half, the film plays out more like a romance love story (as we all saw the romance between Tris and Four happening) in which it starts to go slowly downhill and become a little more boring in regards. The film also doesn't show as to why there are fractions of the world split, we are just to assume something happened in the beginning. Dystopian futuristic movies have a certain praise as we enjoy, but without much detail, it becomes a little wondering as to why. In general the film features a lot of stunts, jumping around, running, fighting and other forms of survival.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To clarify, I also don't like dystopian since it is boring and not much action.2) Also, action was in the last 30 minutes. I have read books and seen movies where the action was much longer.

Given the content matter I might actually have liked the books. The movie? Well to me the movie was a rather mediocre one. As the blurb states the story is set in a dystopian future but we do not really get to know how they got there except the standard explanation that ""there was a war"". The world is a bizarre mixture of primitive post-apocalypse living and modern, futuristic tech. The division of people into factionswell to me it felt pretty dumb to begin with and the idea that some people could not possibly fit into more than one faction was absolutely ludicrous to me. How the hell was it supposed to keep peace by deliberately factioning people against each other? Okay, trying to get over these gripes, what about the rest of the movie. Well it was okayish I guess. It did give me the same feeling as when reading a young-adult book and I would say that this movie is most suitable for a younger audience. The story is rather predictable. There is the initial training part where Tris of course gets a few friends and in particular befriends one of her tutors. Not surprisingly there is also the obligatory jerk. The one thing that makes the movie a bit out of the ordinary are the induced dream sequences which are not too bad.Later in the movie Tris starts to discover the plot of the bad guys and of course goes off to save the day. Again these part are simple and predictable. The ease by which Tris and a few of her friends manages to infiltrate the lab/headquarters of the baddies is rather unbelievable. It of course helps that it seems like it is only the good guys who can shoot straight or fight worth a damned with a few occasional exceptions when the script calls for it.The movie is, as far as I understand it, based only on the first book in the trilogy so it is perhaps not very surprising that it ends with a lot of loose ends but, for Christ sake, they fight their way to stop the plot, taking down a lot of people on their way, and then they leave the chief mastermind of this despicable plot lying unconscious but alive on the floor just taking off. That just felt dumb! It is not a bad bad movie but I do not understand the high ratings some people seem to give it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The basic premise is the same. The world as we know it has ended and in the ruins of what used to be USA there exists a society where people are held under an iron fist, all in the name of keeping order. And of course it's up to a teenage girl to fight against this oppression.Granted, in this series there doesn't exist any kind of elite class that keeps the rest as slaves or as lower class, which is different enough that you don't feel like watching the exact same movie, but the themes, mood and the general feeling are very, very similar.So yeah, zero points for originality. That being said, the movie is not without value. The technical aspects of movie making are more than fine to please, the two main leads are not without talent and have chemistry together. And while the plot is predictable, it's paced well and doesn't overstay its welcome. The scenes dealing with mindscapes and subconscious fears are the most interesting thing in the movie and offer some creative visuals.In the end I cannot really recommend this film. It's too similar to The Hunger Games, so you should watch those if post-apocalyptic teenage survival interests you. It's not a bad film, per se, just much more average, less ambitious and lacking in scope than its predecessor and source of inspiration.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I've never read the novel so it could be a case of a bad adaption or just a really terrible book.The premise and story are just so terribly and painfully riddled with plot holes, flaws, unrealistic characters and things that just don't make sense. A world like this could never exist, even in fiction it makes no sense. Who's keeping everyone in their factions. Are people without factions brain dead? or are they capable of uprising? What is the threat of rebelling. Why was she immune to the miraculously invented serum which was never explained. Who were the scientists who invented the serum? Was it the really really smart house? And if their really really smart then why aren't they capable of independent thought and overthrow the rulers. This film is so flawed and that's just the beginning.Katniss makes no sense. Tris sorry. The 'hot' guy is too old for her its creepy as cuss. He has 0 personality, his only trait being afraid of heights and shooting hot girls in the face....... right, OK.And its such a shame because every other aspect to this film, Cinematography, production design, editing, basically everything is really quite decent and Jessica Whoodley is outstanding as usual.

Because if you do it the other way around the movies are going to ruin you experience with the books.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If I think of twenty things to get someone to do something and even mention one outlet for her not to do so if that one is her wish even with only a 51 to 49 % advantage she'll probably just take that one outlet if she replies at all. This leads to a quick next thought. Not once in any fashion have I ever gotten a direct reply trying to intro or not much next after thoughts with electronic communication to the girl. Some responses of any kind have been detected by me but those ways currently are next to impossible for me to detect. Dating services of any fashion lead nowhere. I did get one response once about 7 years before the Internet existed joining a $700 plus dating service giving a in person application that lead to a car drive and a bar date. That was about the last time I think I had a date. Previous to that I had my share but this letter isn't a review of my life. The number one rule nowadays is that the girl must be lifetime money self sufficient living anywhere. That leads just about everyone out. Only 1 in 1000 are that way and the actresses of any fashion be it over twenty of them who weren't one of the 1 in 1000 used slut entertainment thoughts involving me to be a 1 in a 1000 self money sufficient person but the sad movie or singer concept to that is none of those girls thought that sharing their wealth with me was a requirement or even a intro one in person date let alone my preferred minimun requirement thought of 25 dates. So it's understood outthinking their thoughts of what is best for them or what they want or what they are willing to do is at least in my case impossible to outthink or even partially persuade. I'll just say the difference between me and you girl (any girl) is if the girl approached me by mail or in person giving her contact number she'd have to say next to nothing for me to reply if she was attractive and money self sufficient. But for those that weed out hundreds of suitors per day I've never known any of them to focus and when they focus their focus leads nowhere however public popular. I was going to write about 20 reasons why girls are into idiots but this email is already too long. You can though in the immediate future reach me at johniverson4@peoplepc.com There's my contact. Need I say again the difference between me and you girl (any girl). The sad fact is 9 out 10 movie concepts are light years from this letter style with many much more so than others yet those sort that yet detect me feel there is some sort of invite to them when there isn't. I could write pages about how mentally ill I would get getting involved with them. But this letter concept is not looking for dismissal with me and IMDb. I sort of had Ashley Judd in mind when writing this being more positive than negative but more or less focus writing to a star is banned here. Personally it's been decades when getting annoyed by people it's by those you can't find however immediate the interpretation and with I don't even know if they qualify for I wouldn't want to know you or them even if I did. Biggest mistake in writing these emails is if you know that any response if at all will lead you to get mentally ill if I involve myself hundreds of times over with them and not much else especially in money concept or marriage dating then why try at all from the get go. Even at the best if a romantic attitude is established it will probably only be done in some group thought fashion and will having nothing to do with being a couple. That's about the only way current Hollywood fashion stays in fashion. I current thought about Ashley is I'm over 50% positive on my approach to her but there is too she'd have to really a lot kiss my over a long time in person for me to really fall. She with me has a current personality interpretation of that ain't going to happen. It's more her charm with me doesn't much get past bye bye soon enough. I'm not looking for either for the girl with I'm not bluffing but I'm gorgeous attitude and she expects me to sex her big time a half hour minimum everyday. Those types only have a place in my life on paid for out of state DVD XXX delivery for I'm not into intensive in person long girl selfish sex or even quickie looking just for a daddy type girl.

Even if you get pass over that, the development is the typical teenager put in the typical challenges (training, bullies, self-improvement, lover boy, parent problems...), in the typical oppressor society, which could be fine if better thought. On top of that, the music tries so blatantly to catch teenagers to buy the soundtrack that made me roll my eyes. Absolutely nothing new regarding story and script. If you're interested in seeing some action movie for the while, it's OK until the last 30/40 minutes, that gets so obvious and predictable that is hardly watchable. If that half hour wasn't that bad, I would have liked it a bit more, but it really feels rushed up, even if the movie lasts two hours twenty minutes, looks like a loot happens in the end, when not much in the beginning took too long to develop. The actors are fine for what hey had to do, but there's not much to see here. Good acting, fair photography, weak story and writing.

Tris could have killed her and then in the second installment there was a new person who was set out to destroy divergents, fueled by revenge or something or just even sticking to the original reason of feeling threatened by them. The ending just didn't do it for me, and for that, I haven't watched the 2nd one.

The director wasted so much time on the training and I expected the main character to be something special but she just turned out to be like the other candidates. Anyway, the acting wasn't anything special but it was good to see Kate Winslet play a baddie for once. The director gave the movie a big build at the beginning but by the end, it was all a bit pointless. It just seemed a bit over complicated and after a while it seemed to drag and become uninteresting. The 5 different factions didn't really come into play because the director concentrated on the girl keeping her secret and falling in love with the trainer. Maybe the whole story will unfold in the sequel which is bound to come out soon, but I won't be rushing to see it. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie did get a big distribution and it looked good in the adverts which is why it made so much money. After watching the movie the film does seem like there is a loads of information missing, but I wasn't that bothered to be honest. The love story was really predictable and the action scenes wasn't that realistic. On the plus side, there is a deep moral to the story about equality and everyone becoming one but apart from that, the director really does need to use the profit to make a better sequel because the concept needs a lot of work. Budget: $85million Worldwide Gross: $275millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there futuristic, sci-fi adventure movies about 5 different factions, which have been separate by personality type, and 1 girl making the decision of were she belongs. 4/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In this movie stuff just happens, there is close to none logical sense in the continuity of scene to scene and huge shortcuts on the story which by itself is pretty uninteresting and brings nothing new to the table. Character motivations are unclear or unconvincing and the character themselves are either clichéd, cheesy or banal and are portrayed with equal dullness with the exception of Tris, who at least feels rounded thanks to a very good performance by Shailene Woodley, and whilst Four is miles away from being a real character, Theo James brings some very healthy charisma to the screen. The movie is filled with contradictions and minor plot holes that all add up to very poor storytelling. However the movie managed to be mildly engaging and times and even comes close to be exciting with a couple of enthralling sequences with great set-pieces. The film looks pretty neat and there is a very good cinematography which managed to keep me involved in what ever was going on, I have to give a shout out to the score too. Yet I can't stress enough how chaotic everything regarding characters, story and plot feels. This all culminates in a very dull third act with and equally uninspired ending. Sometimes this ""stuff"" that happens is actually good, other times it's stupid but laughable (in the first act I was laughing my ass off in the sequences that included the Dauntless and the train, I'm still laughing now), but for the most part it's distracting or and makes you cringe. I have to say that at least you can feel the director is trying o make a good movie and has actual interest for the material and as I said there is some fun to be had, but all in all it just felt mediocre. I don't know if the book is good or not since I have not read it, but it does feel like it borrows some ideas from other pre-existing franchises.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was so badly disappointed. Although the book is great, you get a full information about background, why Tris chose what she chose. There are important friendships and characters that were totally ignored by movie creators. I wonder how they will solve this problem in future parts, I suspect that some people will just show up out of a blue, no one will know how they were connected. The biggest mistake was to ignore character of Peter, he is a Draco Malfoy of this trilogy and he is important although a villain. Hunger Games already proved that you can stick to the book and make a good, reasonably long movie. With those creators all we get is a sequence of unconnected scenes.

I remember finding the story implausible and the writing uninspiring, so I never got around to reading the sequels. However, when I saw the trilogy on Amazon Prime, I thought 'Why not?' as I was curious to see what direction the story had taken.My first impression was, as others have stated, that this is a rip-off of The Hunger Games, but without the compelling bits: the self-sacrifice of Katniss for her sister, the stark contrast with the silly materialism of the upper class, the complex relationship with the two male leads, the actual feeling of danger and impending death. When characters did die, I wasn't invested in them enough to care. As such, the film is predictable and uncaptivating and fails to distinguish itself.The interaction and relationships between characters is also unconvincing, in particular between Four and Tris: there is no build-up and no chemistry. Also, I'm not entirely certain why, but the lead actresses in most of these young adult book-turned-films seem to portray their characters with as few facial expressions as is possible. It seems that this is somehow meant to convey a quiet strength or perhaps a lack of a happy and secure upbringing but it just comes across as bad acting. I could not connect with Tris nor feel her struggle at all. Or any of the other characters.As for the plot, I don't understand how human beings can last 200 years without rebellion and war, living within a faction system that favours only one of their individual attributes over all others. Certainly there would have been much dissatisfaction and they would have been at each others' throats much sooner? Humans are multifaceted; are Divergents truly that rare? Much of this is sort of explained at the start of the third film, but why should I have to watch two boring films and then one more to finally understand the main premise of the story? The film hence drags on, and there's seemingly no sense to anything they are doing.By itself, the film is nothing more than teenagers engaging in single combat, armed parkour, and whatever else is 'cool' these days. As usual, the future is in the hands of the young people, while the only adult characters either end up dead or are the bad guys. A tiny girl with little body mass fights and overpowers trained men. Also, no bullets or permanent harm seem to touch the main leads, because... well, plot.In the end, this film is like an extremely long prologue. You're left with questions that you couldn't be bothered to have answered because that would mean watching the next two films. (I subsequently ended up watching them not because I cared, but because I wanted something uncaptivating to play in the background while I did some reading.)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I saw the movie when it came out but after just reading the book and now reawatching the movie i am extreamly dissappinted. They changed so many things, added new things and removed important details. The cast is also not what the book describes. Trish is supposed to be small and very shy and grow into a warrior. In the movie Trish is is outspoken och average in fighting from the start. Molly and Peter which are supported to be huge bullies are portrayed as irritating mean children. In the book Trish is seriously scared of them but the movie makes molly seem like Trish in the book.Janeane is taking too much screentime, she's supposed to be undercover evil. But you can clearly understand she is the villain in the movie.The relationship between Trish and Four was also changed, as was the Dauntless strictness, rules and traditions.In the book the first half is all about not failing the initiation and hints of growing interest between Trish and Four. The difficulty of making it is almost none in the movie while in the book multiple people died during this period. The competition between initiatives is also totally removed in the movie.Conclusion: it's not a bad movie but it is nothing compared to the book. It seems like the director looked at the book more as a suggestion when making the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thinking about it now, this might be a good thing, mainly because TMNT is a far inferior movie. But just because I say that this movie is slightly better than the aftermentioned TMNT, that doesn't mean it gets a pass.Unfortunately, there's too many signs that they were clearly lacking a lot of things in Divergent, since there is a lot to be desired. The story is predictable and full of cliches and plot holes as far as they eye can see, the visuals don't take much advantage of its $80 million budget, the pacing can be really slow with this film's 2 hour 20 minute runtime, and the characters are onenote tropes you'd expect in films like these. Not to mention that it feels all too similar to other young adult fiction titles of its kind. The books may have been popular, but when we have films like The Hunger Games, it isn't fair to call yourself original when somebody else came before you.But even if Divergent is a bad movie, I think it goes without saying that this is NOT the worst action film I've seen in my life. Far from it. To the movie's credit, most of the fight scenes are engaging and when the film wants to indulge in the action, the execution of the fights can be fun and easy to get into, and the concept does sound engaging at first glance, most particularly to the most die-hard fans of the dystopian genre. That, and the best aspect of the film is the acting. The cast here did a great job with the materials presented, such as Theo James, Miles Teller, Ashley Judd, Ansel Elgort, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Zoe Kravitz, and especially the headlining star Shailene Woodley, who's probably the best actress of the movie. It's just too bad that talented actors like these have to work with materials that are of such poor taste, that I'm sure their talents are worth much more than anything developed from a failed film like this!Conclusion? Predictable story + uninteresting concept + meh visuals + fun action + forgettable characters + great acting = Divergent the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I cannot believe the human race would reduce itself into five factions which are segregated by a test, but then they get to choose which faction they want to join. Not only are the factions designated by job, but by uniform, colour, and even their homes. They are not allowed any personal items as that might bring forth human nature. Imagine Humans being Human, what a notion!The acting is just okay, even the bigger name actors, Ashley Judd, Maggie Q, Ray Stephenson, and Kate Winslet couldn't lift this film out of the morass the story and direction placed it in.I don't know how they could've made the movie any better other than a total rewrite and refilm.However, the action sequences aren't too bad except for the fight training... doesn't anybody remember Martial Arts in this stupid, segregated, and insanely dull future world(?)I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone.

But wife wanted to see it so I had to sit through it, plus I thought ""okay maybe somewhere maybe this movie might improve""..it never did.The worst problem I had with it was it was way too fantasy, unbelievable. Like from the start: So they run along this train..then you see ""oh, whew just in time!"", yea right!If you are a person who knows anything about anything you will see there are just to many holes in this. Example if you know anything about trapeze arts you know you must land on the net just the right way (not on your head, or feet first, etc.) else you would probably end up crippled or even killed.Then anyone who knows anything about martial arts would see this so called advanced fighting technique of the future laughable. For that matter if you have the slightest understanding of physics you'ed see a lot of stuff happening improbable, if not downright impossible. And then shouldn't there be bodies all over the place with such reckless abandon? I could go on and on, it's like the writer(s) of this movie were in some sort of hallucinogenic stupor while they wrote it. The key parts of the story they seemed to have ""borrowed"" from other trendy stories like the first book of Harry Potter, the Twilight concept, and a fair bit of Hunger Games thrown in.Also the whole movie is very stereotyped and predictable. You could literally see what was going to happen a mile away.Finally that literally got me nauseated was the way over the top dramatic and sappiness of it. Somewhere between the worst soap opera and some sort of teenaged ""reality"" show. I'm pretty sure this story was geared for teenage girls, or otherwise I'm not sure what they were thinking.In the end my wife liked it (whom is not a teenager by the way), but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other then a 14 year old girl..I got to stop thinking and writing about this movie before I hurl..","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The setting starts out showing all the tall buildings in ruin then the colorful fashion of each faction Candor being black and white, Abnegation gray, Dauntless black, Erudite blue, and Amity red and yellow. Veronica Roth's ideal principle shared the different types of personality traits that coexists in all of us and the many ways we show, express, and model it. Personality the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character helps people observe and reflect a persons behavior and the instincts they have. After I finished the book I took the quiz and resulted in being divergent in three of the factions like Tris–I tested in  Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite because of all my traits put together. For a couple of months I thought of this all the time but now I see how these factions impacted me through life. While I admired the fact that I'm selfless, brave, and intelligent compared to Veronica Roth's Tris Prior in Divergent I thought a lot about my strengths, values, and accomplishments since. Sometimes I would imagine life in the faction system dedicated to hard work and trying to fit in but though I find myself wondering why divergence isn't allowed in society while others know what exactly they are. Some have a combination of many factions but nevertheless would we as people understand that we are improving everyday.I see myself in many shades of gray, a little aquamarine in Erudite and as always black as Dauntless, somehow I manage to fit in various factions rather being in one category  that makes up a person. Where would I get my inelegance from and the bravery that comes with it? Abnegation is out of the question because being selfless isn't the same as learning to be someone either than yourself. What would people think of me? These questions we ask ourselves.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What we have as a result is a lame copy, with poor visual effects and a really (and I mean really) bad choice of protagonist.

Following that, you have a Harry Potter sorting hat style scene and then the rest of the film follows the Twilight/Underworld/Hunger Games plot of a young couple against the system. Throw in some unresolved parenting/sibling issues, some Inception style CGI, Kate Winslet walking around like Jodie Foster in Elysium, and Maggie Q as, well, she's in the film, and it's easy to see who the target audience are; it's a teen flick. Demonstrating the fact, casting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Christian Madsen and dressing them in identical clothes, could have been a statement on the state of society and how people may look a like, but can act differently. Yet sadly the acting and camera work made it too hard to tell who had done what!

Most of these films center around an innocent lead character born into a supernatural or futuristic world who is forced to overcome many obstacles, almost always finding love along the way. The craze started with the Harry Potter franchise, which was later succeeded by box office hits such as Twilight, The Hunger Games and their countless sequels. But now that the romantic spark of Bella and Edward has died down and the next visit to Panem isn't due until late 2014, teenage audiences have been left searching for another young adult movie train to hop onto (members of Dauntless should be informed that this pun was intended). Lucky for them, the search is over with Divergent, a film in which the performances and premise are almost too good for the reputation its arrogant critics are bound to give it.In Divergent, Tris is played by the immensely talented Shailene Woodley (she starred in the young adult adaptation of The Spectacular Now and audiences can watch her again later this year on the big screen in yet another young adult adaptation, The Fault in Our Stars). Tris lives in a world where everyone is separated into groups, or factions, and she has finally gotten to the age where she must wear the Sorting Hat and find out whether she belongs to Gryffindor... correction: Tris must consume a serum that will recommend to her which of the five factions she should join: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Erudite, or Dauntless. When her results come up as unclear, she discovers that she is a Divergent and is considered a threat to the society of future dystopian Chicago. Instead of listening to her results, Tris joins Dauntless and begins jumping off of buildings for fun. This is where she meets a well-built and tough man, Four (I Am Number Four, anyone?), who also enjoys jumping off of buildings for fun. He cuts her ear with a knife in one of their early encounters, which would obviously lead to Tris falling head over heels for him. When the two realize that their feelings are shared, they team up to fight against the leader of Erudite, played by Kate Winslet, and stop her from killing everyone in Tris' original faction, Abnegation.There were two groups of people, or factions, in the crowd when Divergent was screening in the theater: there were the audience members who truly wanted to analyze the film and see what all the craze was about, and then there were the teenage girls that giggled and cheered when they looked up from their cell phones to see Theo James take his shirt off. People who are part of the latter group will love the parts of this movie they look up to see regardless. But if audiences really want to see a quality film, they still may find some aspects to enjoy here. For example, the performances from an A-list cast are outstanding. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave their all to their performances both through physical training and emotional line-delivery. Kate Winslet portrayed a villain whose path no one would like to cross. Even though the performances were exceptional, the characters did not seem as well developed as they could've been. This should be an easy fix though considering the next two sequels already have release dates. Neil Burger's direction of the action sequences is very well executed. He avoids jerking the camera around aimlessly as so many current directors do to make choreography easier and instead allows the audience to see what they want to see. The adapted screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor is nothing special, but it did the job of compressing the 496 page book into a 150 minute runtime. Though some of the testing sequences were poorly done due to an overuse of cheesy special effects, they are easy to overlook seeing as they only take up a good five or so minutes of the final runtime. Divergent is not a perfect film, but it leaves ample room for questions to be answered and characters to be developed further in future entries, and it undoubtedly lives up to its name when being compared to other films of the genre. For those who just cannot wait until next March to see the sequel, a trailer for The Maze Runner, the newest young adult adaptation, was conveniently played before every Divergent screening. Be prepared to push through heaping crowds of adolescents to purchase tickets.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyway, this benchmark could launch an interesting movie, but what we see is getting entangled in clichés and mostly trivial performances, actors-actresses based on looks (apart from Shailene Woodley and ""older"" generation actors). There are some twists, but having seen about half- an-hour, you will be pretty sure who will have crush on whom, who will not survive, etc., but many of them whose acting could be pleasurable spend too little time on screen (particularly Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet). And a closed society with hostile outside world - not a very novel one, and there is no contact between them (perhaps in sequels?). Thus, in general, Divergent is an expensive hype made for young audiences who would like to identify themselves with the characters depicted mostly in good vs. bad, brave vs. craven manner.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is due to the good acting, setting, and successful directing of Neil Burger. The movie does not bore the viewer even though it is more than 2 hours long.

She is instantly relatable. Teller's Peter is a likable antagonist that I would have liked to see in a different role, yet he performed well. Courtney's Eric is very hard to like, which I was a bit disappointed in. I think my impression going in was that he played a bigger part. James' Four is a difficult, guarded young man with a soft spot for divergent girls like Tris, or perhaps only Tris. (I've never read the book/s this is based off of). As a sci-fi/fantasy genre story, I had no problem buying into the reality the film presented. As far as comparing it to other young adult popular fiction turned into films, I'd say it is more engaging and better acted than The Hunger Games. However, I'd say this isn't just for a set audience of teen girls or teens, but adults as well. It really poses a major question about society and how we lead our lives.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Both are three works aimed at young adults and written by female American authors (in the case of ""Divergent"", Veronica Roth). Both have a principled and plucky 16 year old heroine (in ""Divergent"", Beatrice 'Tris' Prior). Both are set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian world located in the former United States (in ""Divergent"", an enclosed Chicago). Both involve societies strictly divided (in the case of ""Divergent"", into five factions based on different human attributes). Both mix violence and romance in an exploration of coming of age and discovery of identity. And both are being turned into four money-making movies.I have read the three ""HG"" novels and seen the two (so far) films and so, while not having read the ""Divergent"" books, I was happy to give this first spin-off film a go. I don't think it packs the punch of its rival but it's certainly entertaining enough. As with the ""HG"" movies, an absolutely key ingredient is the casting of the central heroine. Again we don't have quite the talent that is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, but Shailene Woodley - whom I first spotted in ""The Descendents""- is an appealing young actress of genuine potential and 2014, which saw her in ""The Faults In Our Stars"" as well as ""Divergent"", is definitely her take-off year.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storyline is based upon the novel written by the 25 years old Veronica Roth. The novel is a totalitarian dystopia and it showcased how teenagers are trained to fight, kill and rebel against dictatorship. This novel is directed into a movie by Neil Burger, casting the three main characters, Shailene Woodley as Tris (Beatrice), Theo James as Four and Jeanine Matthews (Cast: Kate Winslet), the dictator who ruled the 5 factions of citizens. The main theme of the novel and movie starts with the word ""Divergent"" where in the movie was referred to as someone who behaves and interacts differently from the rest of the populations. As described in the quote, divergent is an impurity and black sheep of the society. Therefore they are hunted down by the dictator Jeanine Mathews.The populations were diversified into 6 factions. The Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor which represents selflessness, intelligence, bravery, peace, honesty respectively. Not to be mentioned, those that do not belong to any factions which are homeless and less- fortunate are known as the faction-less group of people. Teenagers are testified to categorize themselves into factions that they belong to, based upon their natural reactions toward fear and judged upon their tactics used during the test. Those whose test results are inconclusive are known as divergent. Tris and Four are the two main characters who did their best to find out why divergents are taken down and the main reason of destroying all divergents. As it is necessary to hear about people's perspectives and ideas about movies, I talked to those who went for Divergent before I did. Regardless of all those negative comments on both movie goers and readers, I made it to the movie. I was really surprise to find out that this Sci-Fi movie was actually using less computer graphics throughout compared to Hunger Games. I admit that the plot and storyline is pretty similar to Hunger Game but if it is compared to Hunger games, it is actually more tactical and unique. If you've watched Hunger Games, you know exactly what you're supposed to expect out of the movie. However, with ""Divergent,"" you just have to watch and feel that excitement with Tris until you found out what was going on. Especially when the setting of the whole movie was under a deep hollow cave than the deep forest like Hunger Games. The major character, Tris is just like a tour guide of the movie taking you from the finding of divergent to discovering the reason behind diminishing all these divergents. I like about the part where Tris was being really naïve and being unprepared about what is going to happen around her and with the people whom she trusts. The movie keeps me excited and makes me think who the good ones and the bad ones are. The movie use short synopsis and does not reveal the twists of the plot until the ending. In addition to the plot, Ellie Goulding's song, ""Dead in the water"" had really expressed the inner side of Tris. I was really thrilled by how that song matches Tris's inner feeling. Overall, the movie is sensational and breathtaking in a way that you would not even want to compare it with Hunger Game. I should say that the movie is more realistic and make me thought about the possibility of such synopsis happening in the mere future. Another credit to the movie would be the fact that there was less romance compared to any other teenage movies I had watched so far. It portrayed more of dilemma between trust and mistrust in a relationship than the overwhelming romance that people dream about. You really don't want to miss a movie that is more realistic and active than Divergent. I would strongly recommend this to teenagers and parents as it is very heart-touching with less romance and more tactics. It is more like a mind training movie and motivation for teenagers than violence.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In this world civilization is based on these factions represented by the human virtues: Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the courageous, Erudite the intellectual, Candor the truthful, and Amity the passive. When a member of this civilization becomes a teenager they are administered an invasive test to tell them what category they fit into. After the test the individual may choose his or her path, even if it is not the virtue the test revealed them to be in. The main character Tris, (AKA Stiff) played by Shailene Woodley, is revealed to be a divergent which means she does not fit in just one of these faction category, she is a combination of all of them, this is a threat to the order of civilization. Tris chooses to become Dauntless where she meets her soon to be boyfriend Four, played by Theo James. Together they embark on the impossible journey of overthrowing the government, and disengaging the devious leadership that controls the world they live in. The music in the movie is clear, especially in the powerful scenes during the beginning of the film when the Dauntless characters are introduced. The sounds of their actions are heightened with every move as they run through the crowed and scale a very high wall to jump aboard an extremely fast moving train headed to the Dauntless training facility. The audience can feel the sound effects giving them the sensation of being right there with the characters as they perform these daunting task. They give the viewer an emotional connection with the characters bringing a sense of reality to the film. Visual elements are eye candy for the viewer. There are masses of natural light used throughout the movie making it more realistic for the audience whom may be sitting in a dark theater, or a night viewing at home. This natural tone allows us to see things more clear giving the spectators a concise feel for what the characters are engaging in during the outdoor scenes. White light is used in the final scene where Tris and Four combat the enemy in the control room at the Dauntless training facility to reset the computerized mind controlling serum given to all the Dauntless characters. This is an effective way to show the audience how bright colors in a white light setting can enhance the viewer's visual perception of the environment. The story line of this action packed movie takes the viewer on the adventures of a love story, conspiracy theory, and heroic journeys of the futuristic society where five factions are the basis of the civilization.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And this is what I was hoping not to see again in the Divergent series. There was too much supernatural soap opera going on the last couple of years, it's the time for something much less smooching and much more plot than chasing shirtless hotties. And here it comes - yes undeniably the romance is still on, but so far much more clean and painless. Beside that, the story offers some the food for thought, the point being how you build your character when you are young and how the choices make us who we are. It is to be argued if Tris is more or less or the same level of complexity as Katniss but definitely there is much less darkness to her than to the Hunger games' heroine and I must say this is very likable. So the story is quite real to keep you invested throughout the whole 2h of it. The end is nice though not much of a cliffhanger for the next movie. But the cast delivers quite engaging performance so you would love to see them again. I really enjoyed the progress of Shailene Woodley after ""The spectacular now"" and I believe there are more great performances from her to come. The rest of the cast was charming as well - very hateble villains, very reliable boyfriend, dedicated friends and above all - marvelous bad, bad, bad Kate Winslet. Enjoy this new series and don't forget - the easy way tends not be the right one.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","Good old-fashioned young adult thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2986380/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2014","""You're different. You don't fit into a category. They can't control you. They call it Divergent."" Tori (Maggie Q)Does Divergent diverge from the YA formula established by the Twilight series and fattened by the Hunger Games franchise? Not much. But I have to admit I was carried along by the interesting sci-fi story and solid performances of lead Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four). In other words, my intellect was teased by the allegory and my heart by the true romance. Divergent is just good old-fashioned young-adult storytelling that engages adults and teens at the same time.Faced with making a choice of what category of five the teen chooses to belong to for a lifetime (Erudite, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Abnegation) Tris chooses the protector group Dauntless, while knowing she doesn't fit any (that's why she's ""Divergent"") group. Already you can see the author, Veronica Roth, has allegory in mind, viz., a caste system that freezes people forever in a category (surely a great fear of teenagers) and a social order that allows similarities to flourish but individuality not.The Katniss of Divergent, Tris (shortened from Beatrice, an allusion, perhaps, to Dante's guide into hell), is not as glamorous as Katniss (but then that's relative since Jennifer Lawrence is not a classic beauty either), nor as skilled initially, but she has a reserve and humility, as well as interior demons, that can endear her to the audiences' sense of their own flawed humanity.Like other young adult fiction, Divergent plays to teen fears and a societal concern about stifling individuality. By overcoming the former and becoming who she is meant to be for the latter, Tris embodies the ideals of a healthy democracy and individuality. And as Woodley plays her, a normal teen with normal hang-ups and some abnormal potential. Just don't buy into the airbrushed posters with her perfect bod—she's only fairly good looking and fairly flawed.If that's not enough to get you to this actioner, see Kate Winslet play a bad Erudite named Jeanine—she's quite believable and quite different from her carefully framed persona of a simpering goodie. Wait. Wait. She is expressing her individuality as a talented actress. She's divergent!""The system removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will. Divergents threaten that system. It won't be safe until they're removed."" Jeanine (Kate Winslet)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","An adaptation that is very okay, v1.00.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3422743/?ref_=tt_urv","annevejb","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10727948/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2016","The biggest problem that this film series faces is that it is based on some very long and delicious novels. The Hunger Games series shows that the features can still be okay, but that is not the same as 'delicious'.So I experience Divergent to be very okay. It is an adaptation rather than a straight copy and the two commentaries with my disk do help me see why the adaptations were made. A lot of the film can feel natural, even though such as The Pit is rather different to the book.The film makers / director are / is, not surprisingly, very visually orientated rather than technically orientated and to me this is the root of the main problems that I experience in Divergent the film. To fully experience most features films one has to suspend disbelief, which can take a bit of work. Mostly with Divergent I find it easy to suspend disbelief, but I had not read the novels for about a year prior to my first viewing.With the feature Super 8, the train crash is deliberately visually orientated to an unreal extent and its commentary says why. Divergent: My biggest problem, first viewing, was the zip line ride from the Hancock building. Visuals gone wild at the expense of reality. Try such a ride in even a less windy city would be asking to get smeared on the buildings that are passed. Building such a ride would not be so easy for such a society, either. Yet the novels feel very real in their depictions of the ride. The Abnegation underwear of Tris, a more humorous piece of unreality.There are plenty of other parts of the story where the visuals are too hotted up for my taste, becoming unreal, but to point to them can easily get in the way of appreciation of the film.I get the descriptor 'delicious' from that magnificent second childhood story Ramona And Beezus.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
