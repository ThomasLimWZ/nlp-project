"8","/10","Too realistic...but it had to be!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358409/?ref_=tt_urv","techno_lime28","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19849358/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2015","I always saw The Hunger Games' movies as a thrilling representation of the corruption and tyranny that's invading this world, and as a young Egyptian who lived through two recent revolutions, we know a great deal about the consequences of civil war, and how dirty the fight can be over political power. This movie hits right home with this theme in a way that democratic and luxurious societies won't understand or enjoy.Mockingjay pt2 delivers a suspenseful and emotional ride as Katniss and the other rebels set out on a mission to kill the ruthless president Snow. The film plays heavy on its politics, showing the ugly side of revolutions. It would have been easy to make a pure good vs. pure evil scenario, but the movie shows a lot of gray areas and stresses on the fact the no one is incorruptible, which is far more enjoyable in terms of storytelling.The film also does justice to its characters in their final journey, and has great performances by its two leads. J.Lawrence excels in portraying a determined Katniss fighting to subdue her tortured emotions for the sake of a bigger cause, she perfectly balances the strength of making sacrifices and becoming merciless in war without losing her humanity. Hutcherson gives his best acting shot as a confused Peeta fighting battles both on the ground and within his mind, and his monologues arrive with several meaningful moments that remind us of what 'The Hunger Games' were all about. However, its D.Sutherland's and J.Moore's sickening performances as two similar nemeses, that elevated this young-adult film to a whole new level.But the film is anything but flawless, it has several problems which we can blame on the editing team, the slow pace of the film focuses too much on Katniss and her group that makes you forget about the outside war, and when the time came when the size of the rebellion showed itself, you don't get enough of it, which in my opinion is the biggest issue with the film. However, this was never meant to be a full scale war film, it was always, presented from one person's point of view, which is understandable. Another issue I found was in how the movie had several deaths of main characters but doesn't spend enough time to pay tribute to them, not as much as they did with Rue in the first film. Nevertheless, instead of lingering on the imperfections, I applaud Mockingjay Part 2 for the bigger message its trying to convey, for creating a satisfying resolution to one of the strongest and most enduring heroines in cinema, and for respecting its audience and not sugarcoating anything. People are complaining about this final chapter being too grim, my parents thought it was too realistic, too similar to what's happening in our country and so many others, but to me...that was necessary. I can only wish that movies like this will in some way contribute in making a wiser next generation of political leaders, which is what the film offers ultimately as consolation; a last sense of hope for the future.","61 out of 96 found this helpful.

It's almost unbelievable how the tone progressively changed from the colorful brutality of the first film to the grayscale palate of a very real world portrayed in Mockingjay - Part 2. The conclusion to 'The Hunger Games' saga is slow, dark and heavy. Starts gloomy and goes downhill from there. It feels anti-climatic and manages to achieve levels of tension only grasped by the previous films. All at the same time. The fascinating thing about the film is how unexpected and unforgiven it is. The struggles feel real as do the consequences, and hopelessness permeates all of it.The film has its shortcomings. It starts slows, drags a little on some scenes and contains some lazy writing, but other than that it's almost perfectly executed. Jennifer Lawrence is flawless as Katniss and majestically leads the devastating journey towards its conclusion. Part 2 is bold and devastating. It may not be the conclusion some fans wanted, it sure wasn't what they're expected, but it's a way better conclusion than one could hope for. A thank you note to Francis Lawrence for the eerie sewer tunnel scene, which plays as the love child of ""Alien"" and ""The Descent"" - very unusual in tone and something no one is expecting to watch in a blockbuster​ of this size.","53 out of 88 found this helpful.

Really emotional and has a strong theme. I was reading through some reviews and saw people who say it was rushed and I don't know what they were talking about. How is a story divided in two 2 hour parts in any way rushed? If anything it was dragged out. One thing I found a bit off though was how most deaths were completely bloodless, which wasn't the case in the books at all. It did keep true to the book for the most part which is always good when making adaptations. The beginning started pretty much where the last film ended. The ending was satisfying and bittersweet and did not disappoint. Probably both the darkest and the most epic of all Hunger Games films. Overall it's a great movie and epic end to the franchise. I recommend it for all Hunger Games fans.","35 out of 57 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Certainly has Many Great Moments, but an Overall Disappointing Finale,","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3362584/?ref_=tt_urv","lesleyharris30","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23055365/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2015","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2 is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a reasonably pleasing finale to the four part series, all of the character archs are wrapped up quite nicely, and there's some good twists throughout, even one that had me jumping off my seat. The chemistry between all the main cast members is still evident and it's sad to think this is the last film where we'll see them portraying these characters. Admittedly, I expected better, the first part of Mockingjay is very slow paced, but I could forgive it because I was expecting this part to be an action packed, intense adventure, and it's a little underwhelming in the end, the story dosen't move around as quickly as it should, lingering on certain plot points for far too long, and our interest in Katniss's relationship between Gale and Peeta begins to ware thin. The best scenes in this movie are certainly Lawrence's confrontations with President Snow, played miraculously by Donald Sutherland, he's great in the other movies as well, but here he really gets to shine as the sinister, evil character he really is. My biggest problem is that they decided to break Mockingjay in to two parts in the first place, it may have worked out well for Harry Potter but that's because it felt like they genuinely wanted two movies to wrap up the story properly, here, however, it just feels like they did two movies to make more money, and because of that, instead of getting one outstanding finale to the series, we get two that are both disappointing sequels to their predecessors. It may be a bit underwhelming as a finale to the series, certainly not as good as Hunger Games or Catching Fire, but The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2 is still worth the watch because of its impressive special effects and terrific performances, and if you're a fan of the previous movies then I don't have to tell you to go see it, any fans of action should get a kick out of it. Katniss must lead an army against President Snow as the destruction of other districts increases. Best Performance: Jennifer Lawrence","24 out of 43 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Amazing ending to The Hunger Games.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3356951/?ref_=tt_urv","mistoppi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46804064/?ref_=tt_urv","18 November 2015","I love The Hunger Games trilogy mostly because it is so dark and brutal, and even if Katniss does what she has to do, she still suffers from everything that has happened. In a badly written version of the novels Katniss would behave like nothing ever bothered her, which would make her just seem violent and rash. When we know everything has gotten to her, we know what she is sensitive, we know that everything has actually touched her. The most horrifying thing is when you realise how young Katniss actually is. The original point of the novel series was how kids were forced to fight in the arena, and how a kid actually became the most important person to the resistance. Think about when you were 17, would you have been able to unite people against your oppressors? That's a really horrifying thought - and that was the point Collins was trying to make. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss. She portrays her social clumsiness well, but also her emotional weaknesses and her bravery. She's a great actress, but there should've been someone else playing her, someone younger (and Native), because then it would look as terrifying at it was meant to.Not all the events from the novel were included in the Mockingjay part 1 or 2. It's understandable especially when it comes to the part 2. For example, Katniss, Finnick, Johanna and Peeta being trained for the war? It would take too much time to show everything, considering how long the film already was.Some people are complaining about how they should've made the Mockingjay into a one film. I disagree. It is one film, but in two parts. And it works this way, because the second part starts so well - it starts exactly where it should start considering what happened in the end of Part 1. It works as two parts, and there was no need to wrap the story up any more. It was very dense already - things happen quickly but there is still time for important dialogue.The music in these films is almost unreal because of how beautiful it is - and it still is astonishing in the last one.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 is dark and brutal, but it has hope, some amazing hope that after all that darkness makes everything better. It's an amazing finale for the best young adult science fiction stories I have read or seen.I feel weird that it's all over now. Suzanne Collins has created amazing characters who were portrayed so well over the years - or left out, as the case may be. Thanks for the ride, it has been amazing.","80 out of 138 found this helpful.

And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co.","66 out of 83 found this helpful.

After the events of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), Katniss, Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson), Gale Hawthorne(Liam Hemsworth), Finnick Odair(Sam Claflin), Boggs(Mahershala Ali), Cressida(Natalie Dormer) & the rest of the Rebels will have to take down President Snow(Donald Sutherland) & the evil Capitol, once & for all. As the war of Panem spirals out of control, & the Capitol attacks any district that opposes them, Katniss' life & the lives of her allies & loved ones are at risk. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a fantastic film. It is a satisfying & emotional end to The Hunger Games series. All the action set pieces are top notch. The special effects are superb. The underground set piece is one of the highlights of the film. Don't worry though. This film is not just a mishmash of action scenes. There are plenty of heart touching moments too. This movie takes all the best aspects from The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), to become my favorite film in the franchise. There are so many twists & turns in the film that will keep you guessing right till the end(if you haven't read the books, of course). The suspense factor is a welcome addition, that didn't feature in the previous three films. A minor flaw would be the 3D. Although it works in a few scenes, overall the 3D is unnecessary. Just watch the movie in 2D, if you have an option. Director Francis Lawrence has given fans a perfect end to The Hunger Games movies. Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as Katniss Everdeen. Josh Hutcherson is spectacular as Peeta Mellark. Liam Hemsworth is brilliant as Gale Hawthorne. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is good as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is great as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields is impressive as Primrose Everdeen. Sam Claflin is superb as Finnick Odair. Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright & Jena Malone are effective as Boggs, Beetee & Johanna Mason respectively. Stanley Tucci & Elizabeth Banks are super as Caesar Flickerman & Effie Trinket respectively. Natalie Dormer & Elden Hensen are awesome as Cressida & Pollux respectively. The supporting cast are great as well. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a must watch.","55 out of 95 found this helpful.

So here we are, we made it to the end of The Hunger Games movies and I most definitely not enjoyed all of them. For all fans, this is the moment they've been waiting for. The films, first of which was released in 2012 have ranked in more than $2 billion worldwide at the box office and made a global star of their leading lady: Jennifer Lawrence, perfect mix of fury and resignation. In fact, The Hunger Games movies - on their own, separated from the books - have been a true phenomenon, let's be honest. It's almost weird that the four of them came out so quickly to each other. This sudden burst of popular culture that is now over.If you haven't seen Mockingjay - Part 1 there's nothing to catch you up on the events of the first half of this movie, or for that matter, the first two movies. By now you either know what is going on, or you came to this film with a friend and you don't care anyway, so moving on. Part 1, as I wrote back then was all setup and no payoff. It was truly disappointing. Though, I really should know when a film has a ""Part 1"" tagged onto it, I'm not going to get a complete story out of what I came to see. Still, here viewers finally get their payoff. It's by far the most polarising instalment of the saga. They took all that time to build compelling characters in Part 1 just to allow some subtle character's moments. Indeed I liked some of the direction they took with the characters, especially Peeta, he's genuinely messed up and his character development made him as deep as he's ever been. Before he was just one of the guys in the love triangle. Plus, this time it was a similar feeling as earlier this year with Furious 7. Even though an actor we liked was no longer with us, we'd still get to see him one last time: to say goodbye. In this case it is the last time we'll see Philip Seymour Hoffman. And even though I thought I had myself mentally prepared, it's still pretty shocking. Looking at Hoffman on screen, I couldn't help but whisper to myself ""Man, this guy will be missed..."" While being ""sort-of"" heroic, Katniss Everdeen is frightened all the time. She spends the whole story being forced into situations she doesn't want to be in. nearly always she acted out of naive sense of what was right, starting with her decision to take younger sister Prim's place in The Hunger Games. However here, like little Frodo Baggins, crushed by his heavy burden over the course of three films, she's not quite the same person - for the first time - she was when her adventure began. Jennifer Lawrence skillful performance holds the centre, letting everything the dialogue doesn't say play across her face. Katniss seems to understand the symbolic weight she's been asked to carry. If only it didn't have to hang so heavy... At the end of the day Katniss can only rely on one person: herself. If I'm being completely honest Katniss Everdeen, by herself, is not really an interesting person to me. We all love her and we are all rooting for her; but Katniss as a person is just boring.In comparison to Part 1, Part 2 feels almost like non-stop action. In fact, Part 1 was a very unnecessary movie. I really don't think this final chapter needed to be split in two film, as it was very slow paced and sometimes we can find little shades of that left over in Part 2. Yes, there are parts of this film that are deathly snail paced slow, and for some parts it's working as some sequences are meant to be very serious and poignant. Nonetheless, the production values are still above grade. The series has veered far from the realm of traditional YA entertainment; for all intents and purposes, Part 2 is a war movie. This is a overly dark and sad film, there's barely a ray of hope coming through the cloud throughout the entire runtime. Halfway through we even get an elaborate underground sequence that almost feel like something out of a zombie movie but certainly not The Hunger Games. Or maybe something more out of the director's prior film, I Am Legend. At this point, you might even start to wonder how a YA audience will handle scenes scary enough to make you long for the relative mutant-free safety of The Martian (Matt Damon may be 50 million miles from home, but at least he's alone). The gradual building of suspense during the actual siege of the Capitol and all the traps were grand, they are everything you would imagine game makers of the actual Hunger Games would make but in a city. Finally, director Lawrence does allow enough room for audiences to process what is unfolding before them, working at a classical pace for the saga. You get excited for a second and then it goes back to this crushingly slow pace which doesn't raise high stakes. At least, the script is clearly more concern with the mass-media manipulation of combat footage than what is actually happening in the trenches.Overall most of The Hunger Games fans will find enjoyment in this last chapter of their beloved franchise as it is actually an enjoyable movie with some exciting action; but as the final instalment, it doesn't really justify everything you walked through to this moment.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The entire film is expected to be rushing and full of actions between the rebels and the Capitol but it still ends up at a slow pacing and lacks of glorious actions, most likely due to the attempt to stick to the original story in the novel. The plot focuses a lot on Katniss, Gale and Peeta which allow them to perform well while the attention on the political acts and propaganda-making have wiped most of the screen time, leading the weaker character developments of the supporting cast, less emotional impacts and poor progression of romance. Musics by James Newton Howard is beautiful as he utilises the same theme from Part I and manage to lift up some impressive moments of the draggy ending while the visuals are spectacularly shot especially during the climax. In short, Mockingjay is the weakest entry among the series due to the greedy mistake to split but the effort in its political twist has brought this finale a lot more outstanding compared to other young adult genre which waste a lot of time solely on romance.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

This is my first comment on IMDb. The Hunger Games:Mocking Jay Part 2 is an interesting sequel to part 1. It is the story of a strong woman rebel Katnis Everdeen fighting against a dictator president. The film is entertaining with action.When you see this movie you will feel with rebels who have been oppressed and you will come to the feeling that evil doers and dictators will sooner or later get destroyed as a result of their wickedness.This movie has been achieving international success in every country of the world. It is a film for people who love justice and democracy.Me and my dear son Muhammad enjoyed this excellent movie and we definitely advise you to see because it is a perfect epic movie.","229 out of 437 found this helpful.

It takes no time for the film to get going and when it does, you will be on the edge of your seat.Francis Lawrence, who has directed all but the first film of the franchise, handles the action well and delivers a few sequences to get the adrenalin pumping, most notably a scene that finds Katniss and other members of the rebellion fighting a herd of monstrous creations underground. It's a moment that some younger viewers may find quite frightening as it feels like something straight out of a horror movie.I was really enjoying the film up until a really significant moment involving someone close to Katniss and this is where I thought the film shot itself in the foot. There had been a build up to this happening now for three prior films and in the end, I can't help but feel that the end just felt rushed and badly underwritten. It can't be easy writing a finish to such an epic story and with the book to go by, there isn't too much room for change. That being said, I was left utterly underwhelmed by the final half hour of this film.As always with The Hunger Games films, there isn't one performance that lets the film down. Jennifer Lawrence once again shines as Katniss, a role of major significance in her career and one that will go down as one of the strongest female characters in the history of film.Lawrence is given ample support from the likes of; Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Natalie Dormer, Woody Harrelson, Julianne Moore, Donald Sutherland and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. So, with The Hunger Games franchise now at an end, we have lost the best franchise to be based on a series of young adult novels that have taken the world by storm. Sadly, they will keep on coming but my worry will be that none of them will be anywhere near the standard of The Hunger Games franchise.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.Panem is in chaos Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) plans to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a trap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as he turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own agenda. You could say she and Snow are two sides of the same coin.Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in this franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels.","273 out of 430 found this helpful.

Their mission is to put an end to the tyranny. To assassinate President Snow(Sutherland, deliciously evil).There are entirely too many characters, and darlings that have been left alive, in the least critically trimmed of the four films - this feels strangely disconnected from the others. The production values, talent and scope on display fail to distract from that. As a final chapter, it's fair. Almost every single farewell feels flat and rushed. Essentially, no one has anything to do, not to mention that the new ones, thankfully largely undeveloped anyway, are utterly superfluous. Everyone in the love triangle do find themselves in extreme emotional situations, and certainly the still unstable and potentially homicidal Peeta makes for an immensely interesting element. But it is only with these three, and these two parts could and should have remained one three-hour picture.The themes are explored rather well, and this fits in an impressive amount of solidly done fiercely political, anti-war messages that are surprisingly relevant, considering it's all there in the book, which came out in 2010. It is clear that this wants to motivate for real-life campaigning to affect foreign policy, and one can only hope it does just that. Satire, clever writing and excitement yet again come through and elevate what might otherwise be ""good... for YA"" to a truly compelling piece that truly has something to say.There is a lot of brutal, disturbing violent content in this, pushing the PG-13 rating about as far as it can be. I recommend this to any fan of the series. 8/10","43 out of 73 found this helpful.

And even better, it gives you a philosophical message that make you think about the meaning of life, and perhaps gives you hope on humanity in between. You leave the cinema feeling hyper, and when you back home you want to look for more information about this movie, check out what other think, to see if there are people in resonance with you.I have to say Mockingjay Pt2 failed this for me. It was a surprise as usually when you cut a movie/book into two parts, the first part usually is slow and dull (as still building up the background), and Pt2 you have this big finale and take you to the climax at the end (like Harry Potter 7). But MJ Pt1 did fulfill the ""good movie"" factors, and it even had a few very moved moments that made me almost in tears.But Pt 2  I didn't feel ""wow it is good and they know what they are doing"" until perhaps after 45mins. Then you have 45 mins of really intense and good action scenes, as well as scary part that made me feel I regret to watch it by myself while I had no arm to grab on (despite I know what would be coming as I read the book). Although to be fair - in the other hand - it did follow the book, that the climax arrived on the 2/3 of the book/movie, then it quiet down afterward. There was a twist at the end, but since I was aware of the twist, it didn't work for me. I do think if they can put pt1 and pt2 in one movie, it will be much better. As some reviews said, Pt2 is a good finale as the whole series, but failed as a movie by itself. In the book there are so much opportunity to make a big impact scene, but it didn't manage to do that, and even it did reach the impact at a certain scene, but it jumped to something else straight afterward, losing the momentum.And Katiness is not the most likable character ever. Although in the other hand I think it makes her very real - she does not born as a typical hero and think ""great power comes with great responsibility"", be a leader, save people and always do the morally right thing. She is hurt, angry, broken, has PTSD, helpless, self-centered. But - if you imagine yourself grow up and live in her situation, it makes her very real.I didn't like the series until movie 2. Movie 1 has the potential but was poorly directed, and the shaky cam/direction of how the camera pan made it even worse. But movie 2 was excellent, definitely the best of the series and one of my fav movies ever. That scene when she appeared as a Mockingjay on the stage still make me hold my breath, and watching Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance just made me feel it is sad that we lost a talented actor.But I do strongly recommend the book/movie to teenager. It is a good story with a message that hopefully can leads to a lots of deep thinking, and political awareness. Still a watchable movie, but I wish it could achieve more.Side note: Finally managed to watch a movie in the Vmax cinema, and so glad with my choice - the sound effect of the movie itself was excellent and Vmax cinema really brought out the best of it.","25 out of 51 found this helpful.

Well...I can definitely say that wasn't the case, and the film was a sort of disappointment, but i have to say that it could be much worse if it wasn't for the humongous love i have for the first 3 installments, especially the first 2, and the epic amazing ensemble cast lead by the scene stealing, one in a million Jennifer Lawrence. The first films were different from everything and forever changed this genre of film, they were unique, creative, original, breathtaking a huge breath of fresh air. Then the 3rd installment went in a total different direction, a mainly grim political direction, that i wasn't definitely expecting but enjoyed a lot, and was the drum rolls to the grand finale, but...It is far from having the feel of a grand finale to a franchise that deserved one. All the characters are back, but instead of focusing on their development and closure they just appear as some sort of cameos with nothing to do but the occasional word, battle plans, and the ones that do talk more, like Peeta and Gale are bound to speak about the same theme because the narrative doesn't really lets them move on until the film is over. Many characters like Haymitch, Plutarch and Johanna that should be in the center of the narrative, are sidelined to the point of barely registering as cameos.Instead the focus is only on Katniss, and i could understand that, but there's nothing really great that justifies that, and even when there is, it is addressed in such a simple way, that it barely registers. There's tons of things happening around the districts, specialty in the capitol of course, and instead of actually show that, the battles, the tortures, the consequences of war, we only get to see Katniss underground sitting, talking, sitting, talking, resting, talking, thinking, talking... they speak on and on about the war plans but we don't get to see nothing of that, and even when there's an action scene here or there (theres like 3 in the entire film) the camera never gets away from katniss face for we actually see what is happening (i mean i get it, its Jennifer Lawrence, but for gods sake!).We also never get to see Snows side, and instead of making an interesting analysis of the two sides, we get to see Snow for like 2 minutes and then they sort of make that analysis in the end but in a very sublime way, so overall we never get to see whats really so bad about Snows dictatorship aside from the obvious things that we assume and get to know in talks, but would it be so hard to actually show what the heck is happening, it all feels like a biography of katniss and Katniss Face. People fighting for their freedom, people dying, the world in ruins, snows ideals and thoughts, no! Lets see some sewers instead. The narrative never really moves, is stale, and if you think about it, it seems there's nothing happening (it is happening, we just don't get to see it). There's a huge twist that i really enjoyed, and in the end that leads to a huge, very smart take on what has happened and is happening in the real world, something that has tons of potential but once again is shown in a very sublime way, but thats the thing, the film has tons of potential on political analysis, on tons of themes discussions, the narrative could have gone in so many great directions it's astounding, but what gets to appear on scream is all in the underlines and so sublime if you blink you wont see it. Tons of potential material wasted. I get that the film had to be serious, but it doesn't have none of the charm of the first 2 films, and even when they attempt to show hope it is so grim it doesn't even look like hope. It went in an unexpected direction in the end, but i still enjoyed some things, now the ending itself, well i hated it. It is completely out of character for Katniss, and feels so forced, so out of place , its like they took an ending from another completely different film and attached it to this one. As for production values, they are top notch, the visuals are great, the production design has little to do, the score is amazing but it doesn't get much to score either, the visual effects are great, even if we don't get to see many, and so on.Overall there's some magic that makes you appreciate the film, and Jennifer Lawrence is a tour de force, she gives an unforgettable performance and makes you not take your eyes of the screen, even if the problem of the film is mainly the over focus on her characters perspective. The irony! But the film is a huge waste of potential, and instead of ending a franchise in an exciting, thoughtful, thrill ride, it ends in a dark, underdevelopment film, that is a completely different one that i would have expected (and most people i think).P.S. My rating should be worse, but the love from previous installments speaks higher.","51 out of 117 found this helpful.

I think this has got to be one of the most disappointing ending installments to a film series I've ever seen. The previous films build this installment up so much that you actually expect it to be the ultimate one of the 4-film series, with plenty of action, suspense, and drama, and given the way the previous films unfolded that expectation wouldn't be unwarranted. Unfortunately the exact opposite happened and instead of getting a really exciting & thrilling end film, we get a very slow, somewhat dull, melodramatic experience. I mean the first moment of any thrills is about 75 minutes in and yet only lasts for 10 minutes, and the thing is, those 10 minutes are the most exciting the film gets.I saw a couple of comments from people where they said this is ""Battle Royale II goes all Twilight"" and ""Battle Royale with cheese"" in describing this film and I think those are two perfect ways to sum this installment up, especially with the romance line and the way Kayniss went from Peeta to Gale then back again.After the completely over-hyped first installment, I found that the series was actually getting better, which was unexpected due to how lame the first film was. Catching Fire was MUCH better and blew the first film out the water. The third installment dipped a wee bit but was still decent enough and I thought it set everything up for a good climactic end film. I thought wrong because instead of a great climax it was more of a damp squib. Even the end scenes were about as exciting as a wet weekend in Grimsby. The whole film was just one big disappointment, especially given the build up from the previous three films and the whole ""revenge"" theme that was portrayed.If you want thrills you won't get it here. If you want action you'll need to look elsewhere. If you want a boring melodramatic Twilight type of film with some cheesy romantic undertones then this is for you.This is definitely not the ending I was hoping for.","36 out of 51 found this helpful.

Like the ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Twilight Saga"", the ""Hunger Games"" franchise also chose to divide the final book, ""Mockingjay"", into two films. When I saw Part 1 of ""Mockingjay"" last year, I thought it lacked substance to stand alone on its own. However, now that I have seen Part 2, I understand why they could not have just made it as one single big movie.After the long introduction to the action that is Part 1, Part 2 begins where it left off. Katniss is dead set on killing President Snow. Peeta is slowly recovering from the brainwashing he suffered by the guys in the Capitol. Gale is wasting no time in trying to win Katniss back. The three of them are members of a team sent by President Coin to storm into the Capitol and kill President Snow. However, their mission is beset with dangerous and elaborate booby traps, as only the best Gamemakers of the Capitol can concoct.Being their fourth film already together, Jennifer Lawrence (as Katniss), Josh Hutcherson (as Peeta), Liam Hemsworth (as Gale), Woody Harrelson (as Haymitch), Elizabeth Banks (as Effie Trinket), Stanley Tucci (as Caesar) and Donald Sutherland (as grand old President Snow) have really fit their respective characters like a glove by this time. With Jennifer Lawrence there portraying her, every rash act of Katniss becomes heroic somehow. She gets the audience to actually root for this indecisive, foolhardy character.Julianne Moore (as Coin) and Natalie Dormer (as Cressida) had to contend with bad hairstyles but do get their jobs done right. It was good to see and hear the departed Philip Seymour Hoffman one last time as Plutarch, though his screen time here was very short. It was great to see Game of Thrones actress Gwendoline Christie in a small scene as Commander Lyme. It was good to see the other victors like Finnick (Sam Claflin), Annie (Stef Dawson), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Johanna (Jenna Malone), though their screen time was also very brief. ""Mockingjay Part 2"" is a very long movie and it can feel like it. It was more than 2 hours (137 minutes to be exact) of war, politics, and yes, the love triangle. There are actually no more Hunger Games to show in this one, but the Capitol itself was turned into one large-scale Hunger Games arena when Katniss and company encounter the ""pods"" (which were spectacularly violent land mines). I actually do not recall that there were oil tsunamis or mutant monsters underground in the books, but these were the most shocking and thrilling parts of this film. Without these, the younger members of the audience may doze off with all the talking scenes. 7/10.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

I wish they just took out Hoffman altogether than the way they pieced him in with 60 seconds of total airtime.","58 out of 92 found this helpful.

After all, I spent all this time waiting...for this?! I think PART of this is natural...a series is over and there's a sense of disappointment because of this. However, I think it's deeper than that. In ""Mockingjay: Part 2"" there is tons of action (like the previous films) but little else. I assume so much of this is because the book was split in two--most likely to scrape every last dime out of the franchise. And, as far as the surprises and machinations, I expected pretty much all of them...even though I hadn't read the books. All in all, not a bad film but one with less substance and lots and lots and lots and lots of explosions and all...but not much else.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

Usually war pictures that portray war so grim and realistic are saved for actually events not a fictional tale such as this. It was a real accurate reflection on the full aspects of war.And Its really dark for a blockbuster. In fact, I found that the entire Hunger Games series to be more grown up than I would have expected from something based on material with the label young adult on it. This was the darkest in tone yet. But it does feel incomplete. From the moment the movie starts, it felt like I walk in halfway through it, and they purposely did that too. It bothers me that this movie has no legs to stand alone. Like most blockbuster sequels, it relies far too much on previous knowledge of the entire franchise.Characters that were a big deal in the other three movies are barely secondary in this one, which is a complete waste on the screen. And even though it was a great war epic, the action sequences were not very exciting. In fact the whole movie was hard to get into. It felt like everyone was doing stuff with no real purpose. Once again like I walked in half-way and missed the part where the plot was explained, and everything that I've seen in all the other Hunger Games (like the games itself) seems to become a sub storySplitting MockingJay into two halves may have made for a better book adaption, but in reality, the studios got greedy like the always do. Mockingjay part 2 is one long unfulfilled goodbye that would have worked better as one whole movie.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Well the answer is kind a yes.The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay Part 2 is the final conclusion of the hunger games franchise that pretty successful , it's neither satisfied or unsatisfied conclusion it's not a bad movie but it's not that good either.The most memorable thing from this movie probably is the action scene where things really get intense and ugly that's when the mocking jay and honestly the hunger games shines the most , when the situation start to goes down to all character we know and love the felling that some of them might not make it just makes the audience chills.The problem is these kind of exciting thrilling and engaged moment are just few and far between and there's come the problem of Mocking Jay Part 2.The storytelling of director Francis Lawrence is just too cliché , predictable and by the books combine that will super slow pacing makes Mocking Jay Part 2 outside of the action scene kind a boring and nothing really happen.I must give credit to the writer though since the screenplay is actually pretty and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is still a great performance we expected , so in the end the movie still give us something to think but it's just not as powerful as it should be.Overall Mocking Jay Part 2 is an okay conclusion of The Hunger Games Franchise it has it's peak moment where everything seems to be exciting and engaging but a lot of it's moment is just so plain and too predictable because of it's director storytelling yet this is still a movie that should be in Hollywood history book.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Aside from 'Harry Potter' of course, it was one of the films that paved the way for the countless young- adult book adaptations we are getting every year, whether that is a good thing or not is depending on your interests. But now lets get into this film, was it the finale we all wanted? Did it conclude the 2 hour set-up we got last year in Part 1? lets find out. So after last years 'Mockingjay: Part 1' disappointed us with 2 hours of nothing but build up to a battle that never came, i went into this film hoping that it was going to be all payoff for 2 hours. Now, there was some payoff, but it definitely wasn't anywhere near 2 hours and definitely not as big and grand as i had hoped it would be. I will begin with the first act of the film, which picks up pretty much exactly where the last film left off and continues the same, slow, dull, boring elements that Part 1 suffered from. This first 30 minutes of the film was the stuff that would put you to sleep and i struggled to pay attention the whole time, it really was disastrous. Pretty much nothing in the first 30 minutes of the movie added to anything that would happen later and it didn't really build on anything that was introduced in the last film. The entire film has a very dark and dreary tone, but to open the film with this combined with more talking, and more planning and more nothing was really a mistake. This act should have almost entirely been in the last film and the rest condensed down to 5 minutes MAX to establish where the characters are now. There was almost no interesting content but it made me appreciate the second act much, much more. The second act of the film however, was, FAN-TASTIC, everything from the action, the drama, the themes, the character development, the emotion, the story and just everything else about it was near perfect stuff. This is more or less exactly what i wanted 80% of the film to cover, it didn't, but for the entire hour or so of this second act i was completely engaged and glued to the screen. This entire sequence was intense and insanely unpredictable, it was very reminiscent of the types of events we saw in the first 'Hunger Games', and 'Catching Fire' that made those two so great. It was once again all about the traps and they made for some very awesome, and intense sequences. I won't go into them here because the surprises are pretty damn cool, but i was on the edge of my seat for almost this entire sequence. It was pretty fast paced and didn't linger in one section for too long, always changing the setting and keeping you interested which was great. At one moment it gets pretty dark and introduces some horror elements that were really refreshing and upped the stakes immensely, and were just so intense. Even with all of this fast paced action they managed to still fit in tonnes of character development and also developed the Katniss and Peeta relationship without taking away from the intense action. This relationship between Katniss and Peeta is featured heavily throughout the film and i gotta say, i loved every minute of it. Seeing how they have evolved to this point throughout the series was great to see and how they interact with each other during this film was really interesting stuff. It only added to the characters and the film and didn't take away from any of the other events which was great. But after the intense and amazing second act, the film did unfortunately drop the ball a little with its conclusion.The closing act of the film overall was a very emotional and fitting end to this series and a great farewell to the characters we have gone on this journey with. Much like the 'Mockingjay' film itself, I'm going to split the last act into two parts. The second part of the final act was great, the way they closed out the series was very well done.... and that's all i can really say about that here without giving anything away. The first part of the final act as i mentioned did kinda drop the ball, i didn't feel that it lived up to what the rest of the second act was leading towards. Don't get me wrong, i didn't dislike this section, i totally understood why most of the events happened the way they did but it didn't go the way i was imagining it would go, and although i feel like it would have been more fulfilling, what we got was still OK. (Well that was one of the most vague reviews of an final act i've ever written).So in the end, much like the series itself, this film has its highs and it has its lows. It is a great continuation of the series and a good conclusion to the franchise that you will enjoy especially if you liked the previous films. It has great action and plenty of emotion that will keep you interested from the 30 minute mark onwards at least. - 7.3Well, that is all i can say here without spoiling anything major, i will be doing a Spoiler Review very soon covering the more important events, so stay tuned for that.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Solid Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358105/?ref_=tt_urv","MediaPanther","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22921009/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2015","The catchphrase of The Hunger Games series is easy to remember: ""May the odds be ever in your favor."" For the final installment of this trilogy, the odds were excellent. While last year's Mockingjay: Part 1 failed to entertain, Part 2 delivers far more excitement as the action- packed, emotionally-charged conclusion to The Hunger Games.Mockingjay: Part 2 starts slowly, like an extension of the previous film, as Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) wakes once more in a District 13 hospital. For the first 20 minutes, Katniss pulls her usual tricks, defying orders from her elders while nursing her wounds. This is par for the course, and Gamemaker-turned-rebel Plutarch (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) and District 13's President Coin (Julianne Moore) continue their propagandist scheming while barely keeping tabs on Katniss. Eventually, the film turns from the weary greys of the Panem districts as Katniss sneaks away from her inspiring role as the Mockingjay – luckily for the viewer, since the beginning camera work is as shaky as a foundfootage reel. Accompanied by an elite squad of soldiers and her love interests, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss infiltrates the Capitol on a death-defying mission to assassinate villainous President Snow (Donald Sutherland).Tensions run high through the movie, as familiar and beloved characters – mostly the bedraggled victors of the former Games – encounter danger after danger on their quest. Given that director Francis Lawrence was also at the helm for Mockingjay: Part 1 (which suffered from a serious case of the doldrums), it's odd that Part 2 feels more like a horror movie than an adventure flick. Whenever tragedy occurs, the grief that follows is rushed, as though the action sequences were more important than any fallen character. Still, as Katniss' bravery falters in the face of the on screen perils, Jennifer Lawrence proves herself a more- than-capable actor, voice broken into a hoarse whisper as she carries an invisible weight on her shoulders. Most of the surrounding cast is just as good – particularly Julianne Moore, who, stripped of her signature red hair, makes an excellent ice queen – and Hoffman's absence from some key scenes is well-disguised with some clever ploys from the screenwriters.The film's secondary plot line, Katniss' love triangle, is one of a few signs that Mockingjay 2 – perhaps the entire series – isn't quite a masterpiece. While Hemsworth and Hutcherson do their best with their one-dimensional roles (stoic soldier Gale and Peeta, the tortured male ingenue), it's difficult to feel much sympathy for their characters, who seem to have a fourth- wall knowledge about their love lives. Meanwhile, Katniss' own romantic feelings are completely inscrutable, leaving the viewer to hope she'll stay single.Although producers Nina Jacobson (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and Jon Kilik (Babel), have plenty of experience under their belts, they missed their chance to strengthen the film. The pacing is strange, with too much time spent on the Mockingjay propaganda arc. No one seemed to notice that the screenwriters barely even wrote a script. Much of the dialogue present in the source material, Suzanne Collins' book series, is cut in favor of shots of the actors' anguished faces. Overall, the whole trilogy might have benefited from narration – it would give more credence to the befuddling choices Katniss makes. Given Jacobson's penchant for strong female leadership, it's unsurprising that the women in Mockingjay are never truly questioned.Despite its faults, Mockingjay: Part 2 is a solid film. At its core, The Hunger Games is a grim dystopian tale, and its final installment perfectly fits the bill. After spending two hours immersed in this greyscale universe, it is a welcome relief to step out of the theatre into a world with full color.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Together, they leave District 13 to liberate the citizens of war-torn Panem and assassinate President Snow, who's obsessed with destroying Katniss. What lies ahead are mortal traps, dangerous enemies and moral choices that will ultimately determine the future of millions.So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in the second film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.So this is the last film of the series and it picks up where the last film left off with Katniss (Lawrence) recovering from an attack by the brainwashed Peeta (Hutcherson). Katniss along with the leadership group from District 13 including President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), begin to mount an offensive against the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland). With most of the people of the other 12 Districts (I made a mistake in the previous review by saying District 12 was gone but actually some people survived) united with their cause, Katniss leads a unit with Peeta and Finnick (Claflin) (just to name a few) towards Snow and the Capitol facing various traps and enemy soldiers along the way. What I didn't like as much about the previous installment, Mockingjay Part 1, was that it just seemed like filler and a just a buildup to the events of this film. I had hoped that after watching that film that it would have been worth it and that the next film would have had much more action and it kind of was and it kind of did. There was more of a payoff in this installment and it had much more action. I think the first half of this film had more action than all of the previous film. I found the plot here to be a little better and the pacing was also better since there seemed to be more progression as they did not spend as much time in one place as the film took us from District 13, to a few other districts, to the Capitol. The acting in this film, along with all of the previous films so far, has been great as Lawrence and Hutcherson were good (perhaps not as good as previous films but still good) despite the fact that I still disagree with the use of Hutcherson in this one. Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy in a larger role and to a lesser extent Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket were okay as well. Like I've said before, I haven't read the books and this may be because of it but I was not a fan of the ending. Overall, this film serves as a fitting end to the series despite not standing out above the previous three films.Score: 7.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

I think going in to this story, the filmmakers and screenwriters seem to be so faithful to the source (albeit missing the interior monologue of Katniss, which I'll get to more in a moment, and adding some scenes outside of Katniss' point of view like with President Snow in his mansion), to the point where it actually drew away some of the suspense. Of course it was hard for them not to keep to many of the key plot details for the set up to really pay off after all these films. But it was hard for me on a first viewing to completely divorce myself from the Suzanne Collins book, with its myriad twists and turns and (yes) revelations), and yet it's still a successful film as far as creating a sense of consistent dread, pockets of real suspense, and some more solid acting from all those involved.The film starts off immediately from part 1, so it's without question to see the previous installment (one might even suggest seeing it again soon before part 2 even if you saw it last year), and Katniss has a raging desire to kill President Snow. She's still the Mockingjay and is sort of under the thumb of President Coin and Plutarch (Julianne Moore and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the latter in his real-final performance). But she'll do what she wants, as is her way, and sneaks on to a ship to take her to the Capitol, and is then, when discovered (I mean, she IS the Mockingjay, doesn't take long for a camera or two or many to spot her), she's put into an elite task force to go in - initially as a team to shoot more ""Propos"" videos, and then they end up getting into the s*** of things militarily speaking. Oh, and Gale is part of this group, but more importantly Peeta - yes, who at the end of part 1 is a raving lunatic mess of a man - is put in as well.That last part was something that was hard to shake too, via the movie vs the book; in the book it seemed to make a little more sense, whereas here something about the logic of it seemed off, at least from where Peeta is last left off in his holding cell and then when he's seen again. Maybe it's simply a fault I find with the story, that it's not wholly believable, even under the ""propos"" suggestion for Peeta to be in the group going to the heart of the Capital. I should let it go though, since story logic is not exactly the film's strong suits; the power of The Hunger Games series, especially in the Mockingjay films, has been depicting a sense of total helplessness and despair, which is hard to do in a major blockbuster film. That Francis Lawrence and the team go there is a testament to the power of the material itself, and also the faith in star Jennifer Lawrence to carry it.Also, aside from what is or isn't in the book, I wished I could've seen a little more of Katniss' anguish. It does finally come out, at a certain point in the story, but it feels a little too late (already dragging on what is a 2 hour 20 minute movie), and it felt like a lot of Lawrence's emotional energy from, say, Catching Fire wasn't totally utilized here like it could've been. But then there are still amazing set pieces and moments here, whether it's a character death that comes all too brutally and with a quickness - the latter of that is actually fine, and compelling since it means, just as in the first movie and the thread of this story, anyone can go at any time, albeit in PG-13 style - or in the characters being hunted. The main set piece, calling back to mind the director's previous I Am Legend, has the characters underground in a sewer being pursued relentlessly by a great many unstoppable, wild forces of nature. I won't say what exactly, but the lead up to this is pitch perfect; you know something is out there, but when it strikes it'll be horrible, and it is.Some choice little moments do occur, and big ones, between characters (though a 'Katniss will have to choose' element is kind of brushed aside in a denouemont that both drags and feels rushed, if that can possibly make sense), not least of which when Katniss does, as we can all guess whether we read the book or not, catch up with the evil President (and Sutherland gets maybe two of his best scenes in his latter years as an actor, period).I probably liked the movie more than this review lets on, I recommend it for people looking for a serious-minded action movie, and yet I can't help but feel like something was missing here that I wanted to see or feel that could've been there, or that was there in the book. Maybe viewed in marathon-mode back to back the two parts will bring on better momentum from one to the next, as a 5 hour film or something. It still has some sharp edges, but the predictability, book or no book, starts to show in the second half as things gain traction with Snow/Coin/Katniss. Oh, and the love triangle too, if it is even that here (it's kind of weak generally, which may be for the best, due to actor chemistry which is not great to begin with).","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

I haven't felt like this since listening to Jar Jar Binks.The first two Hunger Games movies prepare you for an epic battle between the rebels of District 13 against the Capitol, which could just as well be the Empire of Star Wars, led by an equally cunning president/emperor.However, instead of using all the lore that has been carefully built up, especially in Mockingjay Part 1, the producers/writer decided to keep the main cast as far away from action as possible. The heroes suddenly become actors instead of the warriors they had been in the previous movies. Everything is fake and nothing they do (or not do) is supposed to affect the story. On purpose! I have no idea what happened here. Did the writer die and someone else had to finish it? Did they outsource the production to a galaxy far, far away from the first two movies? I simply cannot believe that this was an accident. There has to be purpose to this letdown and I wish I knew what it is, but either way, Mockingjay Part 2 is the biggest disappointment since The Phantom Menace.","56 out of 103 found this helpful.

There are plenty of tense action sequences, but not as many as the masses expected. There are emotional scenes, but not quite as riveting as we wanted. It is very well-shot and with excellent special effects, but not effects that decimate the competition of late. If you read the books, then you may be inclined to enjoy it more because it follows Collins' plot relatively well. If you didn't, you may have thought the movie was ""eh"".But what really stands out is the themes and ideas that Mockingjay: part 2 represents.First of all, the acting was certainly up to par. Although Jennifer Lawrence's character was meant to be solemn and distant throughout the film, she manages to add a menacing edge to it which helps bring Katniss to life. Donald Sutherland delivers what I consider to be the best performance of the film, as well as the most believable, as the cold and calculative President Snow. The ensemble cast puts on a great performance as well, and no one seems to stick out as a bad actor.As for the action, while fight scenes are relatively few and far apart, they are intense, quick, and satisfying. The underground chase scene is easily the best action shot in the film, and a surprisingly effective amount of tension is built as the crew traverses the Capitol. These scenes are well-directed and meet the expectations going into the film.But, as previously mentioned, it's the themes behind the film that make it shine and almost make up for the okay ending. Propaganda, cruelty, fascism and greed are peppered throughout the film, and war is shown as it should be - as a deadly push for power that thrives on the thirst for blood and need for order. Neither faction is devoid of sin or hard decision-making, and I think Mockingjay: part 2 does a solid job at revealing the darkness that is war without glorifying it.The ending is what you make of it, but if you read the books, you may be inclined to like it more. The problem with the film is that it never quite blows you away. The trailers and the hype promised such an explosion, but it doesn't truly occur, and it makes the film feel just as slow as Mockingjay: part 1. If you can handle that caveat, then the film is worth watching, especially the sewer scene.7/10","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

It sounds fitting to call the previous installment as a storm of fire still gathering blaze, or an engine still heating up, with Katniss' being prepped up for a deadly rebellion as the fuel filling up the gas tank of interest for this last film. It is arguably a promise that has left a very comforting thought to dwell into, in spite of the fact that Part 1 isn't as compelling as any of the last two films. This year, part two unleashes that storm of fire, but it runs out of palpable wallop at landfall.Picking up from the events where the previous film ended, the film follows District 13's march toward the Capitol, with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), at the forefront standing as the symbol of the rebellion headed by revolutionary President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore). The fire has already gathered blaze, even at the first overly-stretched twenty minutes or so allocated to wait for the smoldering heat to scream its vengeance. At the center of it is Katniss, ready to dive into the claws of danger and terror awaiting in the Capitol. There is much of these threats seen and unseen alike, that inundate the screen in successions of deftly staged sequences that are no less of a visual feasts, and that is the problem. By the time the story has to fold itself into a supposedly satisfying conclusion, the film itself gets lost in its grimness and violence that it forgets to serve itself and its spectators a sense of finality. The last two films are arguably the darkest, being at the end of a trajectory that trails toward a depressing farewell. It stumbles in the end justifying the horrors it has needed to go through, that all those bloody campaigns end up as if they are meaningless.Ultimately it all goes down to its cast and how they pulled off their material in the best way possible. This franchise, even from the start, has been ridiculously provided with great actors of caliber much better than its material ever deserved, most note-worthy of whom is Jennifer Lawrence, having carried out the character with reasonating dignity and credibility. Towards the end, it only gets difficult to question her commitment to Katniss that even her material itself almost becomes her bane in the end, she manages to pull off the role with palpable capacity. That is true on her part, but it is hard to see how influential her role becomes to the franchise's final moments, considering how the story itself has seemingly disregarded the path it took to reach its end. It just doesn't fit, and makes this final installment even more depressing than it already is.","23 out of 63 found this helpful.

The second part of ""Mockingjay"" is pretty faithful to its source - and suffers because of it. Although longtime fans will be pleased, most regular viewers will be left to wonder why this movie feels so unsatisfying.Lionsgate's decision to split the finale may have led to a short- term boost in their profit margins, but it was an ill-fated decision for both the franchise and the audience. Instead of having ONE what- could-have-been great conclusion to a good franchise, we're left with two movies that are both, quite frankly, boring.Do not expect this final installment to be a non-stop ride full of action and final showdowns. Worst yet, the whole thing just kind of cuts abruptly at a certain part (you'll know it when you see it). You don't even get to see the immediate aftermath of the 'war'.Another thing that made me slightly confused was the ending. The film makes very little effort in letting us know what happen to the other (important) supporting characters. Here was a chance for the filmmakers to really expand the world - and they didn't even bother to. While some of you may be fine with that (I still remember the problem with the multiple endings in 'The Return of the King'), many of us will feel cheated and left in the dust because of this.Aside from the major story flaws, there isn't much else that is wrong with this 'Mockingjay Part 2'. It captures the spirit and tone of its predecessors (albeit in a much darker and dreadful mood) and doesn't deviate too much from any of the franchise's preestablished elements (e.g. Katniss's love triangle). The cast is good as always (but no one stood out), the direction is good, the editing is even better (save for one fight scene), and the visual effects look better than ever.Make no mistake - a small part of me still regrets buying a ticket to see the final installment of 'The Hunger Games' franchise. It's just that, compared to the other films that are out now ('Creed', 'Spotlight') this one ranks somewhere at the bottom.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The story was so captivating that I had to read the books. Mockingjay part 1 was already a slight disappointment because they dragged out the final book into 2 parts. As such, I already didn't have high expectations for part 2.But even my low expectations were not met. In my opinion this is the weakest of the 4 movies in the franchise.Firstly, the movie trailer practically summarizes the entire movie with all the major scenes.Secondly, the pacing was all over the place. Sometimes it felt too rushed. At other times it was just too slow. At least in part 1, the pacing was much more even.Thirdly, this is one instance where being true to the book did this movie no favors. Some storyline or dialogue changes from the book might have helped.Fourthly and I think most importantly, I felt that the movie was not made with as much care and attention as Catching Fire or even Mockingjay part 1. To me, the editing was not done well and the actors' didn't give me the impression of full commitment.Lastly, I think that Jennifer Lawrence has totally outgrown this role. She is a good actress with great emotional expression however I just could not emphatize with Katniss here. In my opinion, she expressed Katniss best in The Hunger Games/Catching Fire. But here I just felt like a spectator, watching from a distance. This emotional disconnect together with a poorly edited and paced finale led to disappointment!On the plus side, the special effects sequences were OK. And, the franchise has finally come to an end.","192 out of 392 found this helpful.

Nowhere near as engrossing as two first ones but definitely better than the third.First thing first, the movie is too long, especially its unnecessary last minutes. It is boring at times, and you won't sit still for sure. That can be put down to the fact that the script includes virtually all the details of the book. It even failed to make a plot twist (some scenes I think that may astonish my friend came as no surprise to her, and she hasn't even read the book).However, there are some note-worthy aspects. No complaint about the acting as usual: Lawrence, Hutcherson, Moore... Nice visual effect. Nice make-up. Nice atmosphere. In some particular scene, I think this was a horror for its tension and a few jump scares . The cheesy part is OK just not powerfully moving.I give this an 8, which may be too easy.

This film itself does seem like it just can't wait to go directly to the finish line, a sentiment shared by yours truly.""Mockingjay - Part 1"" was like a big PR move or an advertising and branding 101 class, the whole thing could've been trimmed down, it didn't need to be 123 minutes long. Part 2 for some odd reason, still tackles a bit of that effort of trying to market and 'sell' Katniss to the public, but then the story takes a sharp turn into another hunger game, another set of obstacles, upping the ante in terms of its threats, complete with flesh eating creatures and other kinds of booby traps you've never seen on screen before. And then suddenly it takes another sharp turn to blurring the lines between leadership and manipulation. With one final massacre (as if previous killings weren't devastating enough) the rebellion wins but their victory leads to Katniss coming to decide on the lesser of two evils.Granted I had only read the first book, I didn't read the rest, but I think I'm not alone when I say that this ""Mockingjay"" adaptation should've been just one installment instead of a 2-parter. This film does have thrilling suspenseful moment that would keep you on the edge of your seat, but as I think about it again, those action sequences are more like fillers. By that time, I'm just too exhausted to go through another hunger game. The runtime is 137 minutes long, significantly longer than part 1, because much of this film is spent on the characters trying to persuade or trying to convince the other person; to change the other person's mind into seeing that theirs is the right way.The somewhat love triangle of Katniss - Peeta - Gale is at an interesting point because all three of them are driven by rage but each for a different purpose. Katniss wants to kill Snow, Gale doesn't care about collateral damage, and Peeta wants to kill Katniss. Lovely bunch, aren't they?! As far as which man gets the girl in the end, I think it's not earned enough, it just doesn't have me sold. But it comes back to what I said earlier in that the film just wants to get this over with already.I think fans will be satisfied with this finale for the very same reason why they're satisfied with the finales of every other young adult adaptations in which they have invested their money and emotion. ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" is giving its fans the happily ever after ending that they want, plain and simple.","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

The sad part is this didn't have to be the case. If Mockingjay hadn't been spliced into two separate chapters, we would have looked at this series with only one below par entry. But now there are two.Obviously Mockingjay Part 2 is better than Part 1 in every way possible, except for being a good substitute for sleeping pills. But this film is the ending, which we'd like to see be a little bit better.At least if it's been a year since you've watched the last Hunger Games, there isn't much that you have to remember because nothing really happened. Basically, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) goes crazy and strangles Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence). And in this film, Katniss et al are on a mission to attack the capital and kill Snow (Donald Sutherland). Snow expects all this, so he sets up some traps for them along the way--the highlight of the film.Perhaps the most obvious pitfall in this movie is the tortured Katniss. Now, it isn't Lawrence's fault. She plays the part convincingly, but so much so that it almost hinders the film altogether. She comes off as lackadaisical and it really slows down the movie. It's a shame though. All that depth they spent time heavily building in the previous films is wasted away in this one. She acts like a zombie the entire time--save for one powerful moment about ten minutes in when she's intensely talking to a man who's pointing a gun at her head. After that she's all but absent.What made the first two Hunger Games so good is that it separated the series from the rest of the YA genre. It was unique to itself. But a third of the way through this film, beginning with Katniss and her friends' journey to the capital, it turns into every other dystopian teen movie--mutant creatures and all. There's nothing original about it. There's no moral struggle. There's nothing making us feel like anything is at stake. And there's really no point.At this movie's best, it still knows how to build tension and suspense with its action scenes--a trait last seen long ago somewhere in the 2nd film. The effects and visuals are great like always, and I appreciate the ""game board"" aspect being brought back too. I just wanted the film to be a better conclusion to the series.But there is still an unresolved love triangle coming into this film. Will Katniss end up with Peeta or Gale (Liam Hemsworth)? I know this is necessary in many films directed towards teenagers, but here it's not only unnecessary, but it gives the series less credibility--especially considering the forced nature of the conflict. There's never anything really separating the two guys. She has no real reason to choose one over the other, which then forces a decision to come down to mere physical preference--a trait that openly welcomes a younger, more naive demographic--the demographic that will rid this movie of all credibility. In most love triangles, the two lovers are opposing archetypes--Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton's characters in Fight Club, and even Edward and Jacob in Twilight--but here, the two men are basically just the same nice guy. We never feel like she can realistically make a decision. We can't either. And I think the filmmakers knew this, which is why they abruptly give us a reason not to like one of them with about 10 minutes left in the entire series. It's really the first sign of differentiation between the two male leads. And so it goes, the decision is pretty much made for Katniss. But it has to be, seeing as they're the same person, which makes everything that happened in the previous four films feel like a total waste of time.In Harry Potter, the series never focuses too heavily on the romance between the characters. While Mockingjay Part 2 is still deeper than most other YA films, the love triangle distracts from the overall point of the series, which is the last thing you want as the franchise wraps itself up. It was just too strong in this one.As the film ends, it never really climaxes--it just tapers off. Oh yeah, we get a betrayal from a character which no one cares about since the character just got introduced to us in the last movie and we got no time to get to know them. There's no sense of shock or betrayal that a good twist would have given us.It seems like I hate this installment, although it's actually entertaining--much unlike Part 1. But overall, the film is way too into itself, presumably due to the hype that it's gained since its inception back in 2012. As a standalone movie, Part 2 has all the thrills you would need, but in the context of this series it makes us realize that we would have been fine wrapping it up after the 2nd film.Hey, at least I wasn't falling asleep.Twizard Rating: 69","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

And you get The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2.I don;t why Wikipedia says it is a quasi-sequel to the 2015 film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1. But, as in this film, the plot is too cheesy and copied from both of the aforementioned hit films. The heroine is lukewarm while the vindictive villain does a very good job. Owen Wilson is a waste and no pivotal role to play.Overall, performances were appreciative and the song were not very good. Direction is average and cinematography is poor. Lots of plot holes and goofs here and there makes this one watchable, NOT! BOTTOM LINE: It is yet another Hollywood gimmick and there's no entertainment in this. Only plagiarism & stupidity.Can be watched with a typical American family? NO! Please do read the plot summary of BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM before you watch this movie and you will probably forgive the producer for blatantly trying to copy Shuaya Nanahara's character from REQUIEM, or for introducing a heroine who is actually not required in the script. You might also forgive the honest media that is full of reviews and promotions but does not hint that this is a copied movie so standards may vary, or fall completely..","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I enjoyed that it follows the book, but I do wish they would have added more screen time to the actual fighting. More time for grieving over dead characters and more depth and character growth. It felt a little glossed over, like ""Here's Katniss, Here's the rebellion. Now Here's your ending."" Where's the heartfelt moments that grab your attention or the crazy action scenes? I did like the over all message of the movie, about how corrupt people at the top of society are and how they will go to any lengths to gain or keep power.

Once it's past the slow start though it offers a pretty epic conclusion that's at its strongest when showing that revolution isn't always as black and white as it seems.Jennifer Lawrence gives a final performance as Katniss that reminds you why she's a movie star and the face of this franchise. More than any other instalment, she carries this film and anchors all the spectacle. Josh Hutcherson gets to build Peeta back up after the torment of part one and re-establishes the tangible chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence.Francis Lawrence finds new to keep his direction fresh 3 films in. Borrowing heavily from Aliens for the strongest set piece and operating on sheer forward momentum for the majority of it. The slower pace does allow its closing moments to take their time, making sure everything is wrapped up and allowing it to end on a very satisfying note.As it's the final chapter of the saga, James Newton Howard delivers a score that mostly focuses on pre-established pieces for once, which fits since it's the last one. His work has been a constant highlight across this franchise and here he gets to go really epic like never before.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Katniss has changed from a strong character to a weak one, it was as if Jennifer Lawrence was playing an extra rather than a main character.But the worst part of this movie is that it is so dull. Basically you watch a long drawn out trek to the capital and apart from a ridiculous part of the journey where silly monsters start attacking everyone it almost put me to sleep. (Actually sleep might have been more interesting)As for the ending it was a pretty dreary anti-climax.In my opinion this movie spoiled the entire series. Mockingjay 1 and 2 could have been one movie which might have increased the pace somewhat.The first Hunger games movie was good but it all went down hill after that.The only thing good I can say about this rubbish is that Donald Sutherland was consistently good throughout.

I went first day first show in India because i am a great fan of both the movie and the book. First two movies definitely did justice to the book. I am saying this keeping in mind that whole book can't be portrayed as it is. Few changes were made and i was okay with it. Mockingjay Part 1 was good also but i thought okay, so the drama is here, now the thrill will come in the next part. So the thing is i was very excited to watch it.Now i am disappointed. The ending was nowhere as thrilling as the book. Certain important scene so beautifully presented in the book were made too weak in the movie that they could not make any impact. I know some people will say don't compare the movie with the book but we cannot stay away from this comparison. No problem in the acting department, but there was so much to show about the characters of Katniss, Peeta and Coin that everyone else were slightly shadowed.

The games that were missing from Mockingjay pt. 1 have finally arrived! While there is plenty left to be desired with this final installment in the Hunger Games franchise, it still sticks the landing.With Mockingjay pt. 1, I was truly bored for the majority of the film. With Mockingjay pt. 2, it was the complete opposite. I was glued to the screen as Katniss and her team fought their way through the ""76th games"" to finish what was started in Part I. The action sequences were fantastic, the tension was well drawn out (especially down in the sewer) and there was real emotional depth to Katniss and the decisions that she made. I wish that some deaths weren't glossed over and that there was more closure for some of the supporting characters, but I was still happy with the end result.When I first read/watched this series, I did not quite agree with Katniss's ultimate decision regarding Peeta and Gale. In watching it again, I better see why she made the decision that she did and how she was able to find peace. I felt that it was a fitting conclusion to the Hunger Games and the epic tale of Katniss Everdeen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Mockingjay part 2 is as far the most magnificent movie in the all three past movies before . I am one of those that read book before going to see the movie and I have wait almost 4 years to see this adaption on screen and it was worthy after all the years.Once again Francis Lawrence took the movies to a hold new level, thank you for make that possible. Furthermore , the three main character exceeds expectations they all star with a very slow progress building up their own character.To answer sincerely yes the movie has action but it is in slow paced. Did this surprise me , not at all the book itself is in a slow pace it drag you for the majority of the book. The think that I love most is that they hit all the quotes that as a fan of the book I do love. Mockingjay part 2 is what I was expecting from them. Many people would critiqued them because they haven't read the book , but we just need keep in mind that they games are over they would be games way more dangerous than before.Katniss Everdeen was not only fabulous, she was playing to winning it . For the time that she start talking and struggling in this movie we know that she is in deep suffer since the Peeta that she remembers is gone and the only feeling that he may felt for her are gone thanks to President Snow. On the other hand Gale try to took advance of that but it seems that it didn't work at all, he knew very deep down that she was and always would be in love with Peeta Mellark.Peeta Mellark show us another face of the kind and humble Baker that he was, technically the evil side of Peeta was show in this movie, It was sweet when they start talking and try to figure out what to do with each other. Best part with the Real or not Real motion that was good.Over all the reason I am giving a 9 over 10 is because I believe the last 10 minutes of the movie was like they were in rush to just finish. For start I know this is at adaptation of the book but after that major character is death they just rush. I really was hoping to see the struggle that katniss has over that death the silence that she summit herself, the past of the months and her stage of mentally disoriented , she was supposes to be burn and not look as pretty that she looks in the movie. The last meeting with President snow was just as I was hoping , it reveal they key point so katniss could take a decision that would shake the Panem again. But what shake more was, since when Effie and Haymitch are something that kiss near the end was surprise me . and then he just gone and not even thinking to come back come on what type of romance was that. Also I love the way katniss just make her decision for either Peeta or Gale they way she just dismiss that character make me wanting to scream in the middle of the movie theater. Peetar return back to district 12 and make symbolic by putting those Primroses in the garden that make a statement that he has remember his feelings for her after all it looks like it would be another Always in there.The Epilog was just I was expecting even though in the book is not clear if it is 5,10,15 years that has past , I would have love that they may said Many Years Later and then show the final scene but it was all the contrary it was just from ""Do love me real or not real"" ""TO Real"" and then a just blank space and they Katniss sitting down in the meadow with the baby and then Peeta playing with his daughter. Now the questions is would I go again to see the movie, probably I will go and watch again.","37 out of 64 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Mockingjay - Part 2 leaves the bunker that housed its characters in the first part to transform the Capital into the public arena that enshrined the franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6671274/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","7 March 2021","Mockingjay - Part 2 then leaves the bunker that housed its characters in the first part to transform the Capital into the public arena that enshrined the franchise. The director Francis Lawrence uses this structure in a guerrilla context, yielding good and punctual action scenes. The director also knows how to take advantage of city spaces (on the surface and below it), coordinating depth and time (pause and speed) to create sequences of calculated tension. Francis Lawrence, again, was not carried away by ""the more the better"". Instead of a festival of uninterrupted action sequences, one larger than the other, the director introduces us to a lengthy rhythm that does, but does not depend on it for the fluency of the narrative. The film takes place in rubble and underground, as if it were a phase of an average infinite racing game. If we stop to think, there is only one frantic moment in Hollywood style in the whole work, when the beasties attack the group in the capital's sewers, a sequence directed with a clinical eye by Lawrence who, with the editing work of Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa, is shaky, fast, violent, exciting, but without losing sight of the characters and the humanity of his actions.In addition, the director again makes good use of the dark photography and the gray unfiltered color palette of Jo Willems (who has worked on the series since Catching Fire) that he introduced more strongly in the previous film continues and is accentuated in Part 2 part, marking the worsening of the war and conditions in the various districts. With that, the fatalistic feeling permeates the whole tape, making evident the anti-warming message of Collins' narrative. It is worth commenting here on the composition of the execution sequence, as the director seems to work in partnership with Willems in order to emulate Leni Riefensthal in The Triumph of the Will, with all the heavy meaning and perfectly within the concept of the film it carries. There is the monumentality of open-plan photography, the tall, solid and geometric structures populating the surroundings, the perfect framing of the action, divided into mill metrically symmetrical quadrants and, of course, the uniforms of all the officers present. This is, without a doubt, a time to be contemplated.Another element that helps in the focus that this film has is the soundtrack by James Newton Howard who, despite not bringing any particularly significant composition, has his work precisely synchronized in the film, avoiding the maneuver of the viewer's feelings. Quite the contrary, Francis Lawrence uses instrumental music to amplify the tension at the right times, without over-wiring what lies ahead. Visual effects also evolved at a rapid pace, something natural for a film franchise that started without much certainty of its success and that gradually gained budgets increasingly larger (The two parts of Mockingjay cost about US $ 160 million). Comparing the creatures in computer graphics in this last part with those we see at the end of the original film is more than enough to show the evolution in this regard. But the same goes for the digital construction of the Capital, which is one of the protagonists of this final war, gaining notorious veracity and the feeling of ""lived space"" that was so lacking in its previous versions.The allegory of the plot is unfortunately current, with the theater of war set up by Snow and Coin being a media show, adequately described by Finnick as a new edition of The Hunger Games. Even the death of some soldiers is announced by the capital with the same fanfare as the Games. Between the plot of political manipulation and the televised battle, the film comes up against its love triangle. Protocol from the beginning, the relationship between Katniss, Peeta and Gale ended up underutilizing the development of the male characters (in addition to taking time from other interesting assistants), culminating in an embarrassing scene in which the suitors discuss the relationship while their loved one pretends to sleep. Katniss, however, has always seemed as uninterested in the novel as in political matters. This disenchantment governs her final attitudes, in a martyrdom that does not materialize, but makes clear the weight carried by the character.
Something that can be frustrating for many viewers is the fact that we see very little of the battle between the Capital and the District Alliance. Although Squadron 451 (a little subtle but very effective reference to the book ""Fahrenheit 451"", by Ray Bradbury) is made up of elite warriors, the group is only there for propaganda purposes, serving as familiar faces to be seen in an area of war. And that makes sense, because ""The Hunger Games"" was never about war, but about Katniss. The young woman never asked to become a symbol of resistance or a martyr to the revolution. Her involvement in Panem's policy started in a personal way, with her attempt to save her sister's life, Prim (Willow Shields), and it is great that her intentions remain so, especially in her final act.In this last part, the director was understandably complex and he preferred to focus on the nerve points: Katniss-Peeta relationship and the game of disinformation. It worked, but it leaves the feeling of some wasted opportunities, such as the characters of Julianne Moore and Donald Sutherland, two great actors clearly enjoying themselves in their respective roles, but without having enough space to chew on the sets with their seniority. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died during the filming, is also present, in his latest role, with some digital inserts of his effigy, but which do not hinder the unfolding of the story or the immersion of the audience. He would play an important role in ending the saga, but that part had not been recorded and was added to Alma Coin's lines.Jennifer Lawrence remains precise in her complicated role as a reluctant heroine, maneuvered by everything and everyone, but she finds Josh Hutcherson, finally showing what he came for, his direct competition. The actor manages to pass on to the viewer the anguish of Peeta Mellark, controlled by President Snow with the intention of murdering Katniss, the character shows the film in a suffocating internal conflict that is transmitted brilliantly by his interpreter. The supporting cast is one of the best that Hollywood has ever put together in a production. We have the always great Woody Harrelson, a sensational performance by the master Donald Sutherland and the great Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks and Jena Malone.The potential of the important feminist discourse that the work carries is again evident, whether from Katniss herself - who in her utopian universe is driven and encouraged by the men around her, and not diminished - or by the prominent and powerful figures of President Alma Coin, Lieutenant Jackson, Commander Lyme (Gwendoline Christie, unfortunately underutilized) and Commander Paylor, the latter who finally has a small but important role in closing the story. Meanwhile, men, be it the love interests of Katniss, Peeta and Gale, their allies, Haymitch, Finnick and Boggs, and even President Snow, are portrayed without much depth and personality, serving merely as means and ends in the pursuit of protagonist for justice and equality against the inhumane autocracy where he lives.However, as in Part One, albeit on a smaller scale, it is possible to feel the weight of dividing the third book into two features of more than two hours each. Although Katniss and his team are thrown into the fire very quickly and the action unfolds efficiently to an explosive climax, the fact is that the various false endings, which stretch the plot too much, break the pace of the story told. The need to please the legion of loyal readers and the desire to make a tape clearly more epic, took away some of the freedom of the screenwriters, who literally transposed every moment after the effective closing of the narrative as if it were a literary work. However, justice is done: the production manages to be efficient enough until it shows fatigue which, in turn, with goodwill, it is perfectly possible to gloss over as a necessary evil and leave it at that.Every journey has its end, The Hunger Games has opened the way for other adaptations of other books and his latest film was worthy to close his cycle. Admirers of the literary work need not be concerned about the film's fidelity to the books. Despite being based on a children's book, 'Part 2' is a dark and violent film. Even if it takes place in a dystopian future, it is impressive how the story traces modern and current political criticism. The Hunger Games is one of the best and most serious juvenile sagas that leaves in addition to an interesting legacy the opening for possible future chapters (Why not explore the war that divided Panem between the Capital and other districts?). In any case, Katniss Everdeen receives an end worthy of her dark history, mature and scarred as her own. Her heroism may have been accidental, but her aim and heart have always been essentially accurate and admirable.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

When the first film came out (2012 oh wow, one film a year) I had just heard of it, and managed to read the books before watching. Now that the films have grown, I have grown with it and am just not that into it as I was before.The acting is great, and everyone is in character pretty well. However, there aren't any performances that I would call outstanding. Most have already established their characters though in some scenes it felt like they were just following the script closely. Elizabeth Banks as Effie is always fun to watch, even though she had very little screen time, her ostentatious character's costume never fails to make me laugh. Additionally Jena Malone as Johanna did have a little character progression and it was interesting (albeit a little dark) to see this side of Johanna. The action scenes and visuals are all also well done. Explosions, guns, technology and all that jazz look realistic and there wasn't too many unnecessary additions. The costume designs look pretty cool too. There are also some new monster creations in the film that did look pretty scary and not something I would like to face ever. The crowd scenes in the capitol seem very like a Roman/gladiator kind of stadium and for me it doesn't quite fit the setting of the story. Of course, the same stage was used in the first film when Katniss and Peeta ride on the chariot and Katniss is introduced as the girl on fire. Well, even then I felt like it was out of place. Overall it is a good ending to the trilogy, but I personally feel like I have outgrown the series.

A mash up of Hunger Games (more of mind-games here than the actual games), a dystopian future aspiring for an utopian one, a morality take on war, emotional bearings - but in the end the movie never seems to get there.Viewers expecting a good mix of action in line with the original theme will be disappointed. The pace of the movie is wavering at best, at times interluded with action & adventurism.Of course the dependable JL carries the movie. However it suffers in its inability to provide the correct amount of weight-age to other performances - to make the essential emotional connect in-line with the darker tone of the movie. All in all not so satisfying end to the series.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Could have used better dialogue perhaps but might be overly slavish to the original material which I haven't read so I cant be sure. If the dialogue were a bit better and the characters had more substance and depth than it might be worth more as a franchise because of repeat watch ability - it isn't.

This one was better. It was a bit long but other than that I thought it was mostly OK. Plenty of new things etc but maybe they were running out of ideas a bit to use zombies at one point that looked like they belonged in a Resident Evil film...Like most good SF films-they always try to wring the most profit they can out of them in terms of sequels often at the cost of quality. Many writers who do Horror and SF are at the root of this problem often trying to extend ideas into multiple volumes that have already been completely stated in one book. Ah creativity...be it ever so long winded. Its really not such a bad SF idea but there have been several similar works done recently-The Giver and the Divergent film series come to mind- teen/young adult films based in dire futures where society lives in 'tribes' in an attempt to 'avoid the errors of the past.' Its not a bad film but maybe we've seen enough in the way of films about Dystopian type futures for a while.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

""Real"" replies a reassured Katniss as she seeks comfort in Peeta's arms. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is an epic finale and a brilliant conclusion to a colossal tale. It all ends right here. Everything boils down to a twisted devious plot well executed by Francis Lawrence. Complemented him a great closure that came winging straight from the rad Suzanne Collins' book.Francis helms a beauty of a movie as he sluggishly walks unfurling the gorgeous plot piece by piece taking the bad-ass score at apt junctures. You could almost tell how much effort has been put into the film-making. Every frame is superbly cut, and changed aptly with the right background score for emphasis. Like a scene where Katniss hugs Primrose and the camera revolves around them leaving only music and their eyes to do the talking. So many such gorgeous frames are imbibed in the flick that can't just go unnoticed.The drama is great just like its predecessors with Jennifer doing a lot of work to hit the right emotions. Screenplay keeps getting better with every progressive line. Both Danny and Peter did a great job squeezing out the right words.Pods in the Mockingjay – Part 2 are thrilling to watch. Surprises are strewn all over the Capitol, and things become quite daunting for the team. Mutts in the movie are terrifying. The fight scenes that follow their inclusion are pretty dope too. If you are looking for action, then that is how little you will get to be really frank. But that's what the saga has always been about. The story! Period. The final bits leave you asking for more. I have never really liked epilogues. The fact that it is all going to get over soon makes me sad. Like any other franchise that has reached a dead end, The Hunger Games too gradually slips into oblivion which is disheartening.Anyways, if you have been an avid Hunger Games fan all this time this epic finale can't be missed. Go for it!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I want a story. With real characters, imaginative, real with intellectual stimulation. A movie that makes you think. One you can enjoy discussing after and the hunger games series delivers. The acting was superb. The subtle looks, the drama, the understanding of the characters they played. Nailed it. The directing was amazing. The shoots of the more intense scenes from the books were gorgeous and the timing spot on. The ""war scenes"" were more often like real war. Terrifying and putting one foot in front of the other. No more heroism then that. You can't fight the kinds of things they were up against. Its not just another tale that says the more powerful win. It's complex.

To me, it's a classic. I have also bought and read the three books.I loved Catching Fire. Then comes Mockingjay Part 1, where Katniss does nothing but cry for most of the movie. Now here is Part 2.Something was just off about it, maybe the balance between action and drama. It was mostly drama, mostly emo, mostly talk. It didn't feel like a complete movie, because it isn't. The movie was split in two, for no other reason than someone decided more money could be made that way, killing the art.Because of that decision, to me the series ends on a whimper. Mockingjay is one book, and it isn't that long. It isn't Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It is kind of like The Hobbit. And just like the The Hobbit should have been one film, definitely not three, Mockingjay should have been one great movie. By the way, Kill Bill, same thing. Twilight, Breaking Dawn, same thing. Can we stop letting the accountants destroy the art?If it had been one movie, maybe I would have been more invested in some of the secondary character's deaths. I haven't seen Mockinjay Part 1 since it came out. The only characters I cared about really in Part 2 were Katniss, Peeta, Gale, President Snow and Haymitch. Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks--great actors who have little to do in Part 2, and who we barely see. What a waste. By the way, those creatures in the sewers, I have seen them before, in Resident Evil maybe.The movie looked good, but it didn't make me feel. Maybe the direction is to blame, or maybe it's the editing. I don't know. A great series that ends bad--not Matrix bad, but I am disappointed. I'm terribly vexed.","12 out of 40 found this helpful.

This episode very much had the feel of winding down rather than wrapping up the story. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it, and not having read the books I had no idea where it was going, however certain outcomes were completely predictable which left me a little disappointed. If you've seen the rest of the series you'll need to see this to get closure. Poignant to see Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch and I can never tire of watching Donal Sutherland playing a bad guy.

Special effects were pretty solid, although there isn't that much of them here. It has couple of nicely done action sequences, but they are far and in between dialogs, which we have heard already before. There isn't anything new this movie can offer.Overall, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" is a mixed bag/. You will see how the series will end, but it by far not it's strongest part.

Loved the books - a real page-turner. I knew the first MockingJay movie (part one) would be a bit slow compared to part two, so I knew what I was going into when I saw the first one and I thought that MockingJay part one was excellent. With this in mind I walked into the midnight premiere on Part Two with expectations of a movie filled with action and deaths and war. But what I saw was a very weird Katniss with some identity crises, that I was surprised to see. We all know that she has been though A LOT. Like a lot. So I'm well aware that she's changed, but the Katniss I saw in this movie, was just not the Katniss I saw in the book. Anyway, the movie plot was alright, they skipped some things, but they always do. Though there are some deaths that they are way too easy to move on from. And for that the movie lost a star (I wanted to give it 7, but no). I know it's war and deaths are inevitably, but they make it seem like it never happened, and that's not how I remember Katniss reacting to deaths before. I like Peeta in this movie - I like how they capture everything about him. How he used to be, how he is now, what he is going through. They did a great job - and the scenes between Katniss and Peeta are great. They get each other in a way that no one else can - they consume you, it's crazy. All in all, well.. It's a good movie, no doubt, but Catching Fire was just a million times better. And I think I might have liked Part One more, than part two.

"10","/10","The one blockbuster you won't expect it to be","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358647/?ref_=tt_urv","kshirad","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33255019/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2015","Which I didn't mean by disappointing. From my point of view, it's different by the way the makers decided to end this movie. For a usual blockbuster, you expect some kind of triumph and cheeriness, especially for a finale. In this case it's not. Somehow it makes this particular 'Hunger Games' even more interesting than I thought.Taking off directly from 'Mockingjay: Part 1', Katniss, now slightly damaged, and her team of rebels are still trying to end President Snow's tyrannical leadership and create a revolution. Now that Snow has filled the Capitol with booby traps that resembles the actual Hunger Games, it is up to Katniss whether her nation can live in peace once and for all.It might sound like it is kind of an all-out-war type of movie with many thrilling obstacles to overcome. If you expect it to be like that, you'd be slightly disappointed. Not to say it's not thrilling, but it comes with a very bitter aftertaste. Unlike the previous installment, it dares to become as dark as it can be.Some reviewers here noted that this one is quite redundant and anti-climactic, making it somehow not a very satisfying experience. I have to say that it's not true. It is in some way very satisfying because of the emotional aspect that has been given by its' main character. Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss Everdeen unlike in the previous ones. She becomes more raw, more spiteful, and more tragic. Which is why the ending left me with a very large impact that gets under my skin and a moral message that winning a war is never a triumph to begin with, that it is only a chance to survive and live for another day with the cost of lives that could be lost, and that loss only becomes a waste that should have never happened.Some other complains about the pacing. While some of them are true 'cause when some people has a short attention span, it could get tedious. On the contrary, it's what makes it more intimate and absorbing, creating a sense of atmosphere that is altogether dull and beautiful at the same time.While improvements should be noted based on its' predecessor, 'Mockingjay: Part 1', that I personally still love, but doesn't give any payoff whatsoever. There's no unnecessary scenes here, but there are slow moments, which are enjoyable in the way the characters communicate with each other. It keeps building up from the beginning, finishing with a conclusion that is a bit twisted than I thought. The actors done really well, as always. No need to mention Jennifer Lawrence, who is already an Oscar caliber and on the top of the heap. She's really the one who drives this movie and giving it more layers than the script has provided. Great actors like Julianne Moore as the cold President Alma Coin and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, who is more serious than before. Others like Elizabeth Banks, Jena Malone and Sam Claflin really supported the movie with their great character arcs. Josh Hutcherson gave Peeta more emotion and depth in this one and who surprises me the most. A noteworthy mention is for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, which I honestly knew little from his role as Truman Capote in the biographical drama 'Capote', who has a sense of attractiveness and calmness as Plutarch Heavensbee. Too bad he died too early before this movie got finished, but his absence doesn't distract anything from the movie.And that is also because of director Francis Lawrence, who also directed the previous two. He gives precision and impeccability to the movie. Script writers Danny Strong and Peter Craig keeps the film sturdy and solid without going on to cheese and cliché, and that is true and faithful to the book.For someone who was expecting a great feeling leaving the theater, I got more than I've bargained for, and in the last scenes (which I won't spoil any of it) I didn't really realize that I'm crying. Truly, that is because of Jennifer's portrayal as Katniss which hurts more than I thought. It is somewhat a non-happy happy ending. And that lingers in me long after I left the theater.Some may well be disappointed by its' outcome. But overall, I hope this movie gets more credit than it deserves. Because it not only gives a true life resonance, it's a piece of entertainment that makes you think from its' moral complexity and ambiguity. And that makes this finale somehow much more memorable and a rewarding experience than it could've been, at least in my opinion.","125 out of 244 found this helpful.

I did like the first ones better but is that not the case with most of the movies that have continuing parts? I watched this one because I needed to know the end of the saga and I guess it's just okay, no big deal at all. You all see it coming from miles away. Jennifer Lawrence is apparently impossible to kill. The action scenes are okay but the movie is again too long to be interesting all the time. The only really good reason to watch The Mockingjay part two is to watch the last movie where Philip Seymour Hoffman appears in before he died. I hope this one was really the last one because you can not milk a story forever.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Which is about all taking to a close and the war that the districts and the Capital, and Katniss and her team goes and want to end president Snow's rage. The previous movie was really disappointing and really not that necessary. Nothing of interest really happened and luckily, in this movie a lot of interesting things happens. But, the beginning of this movie is SNAIL moving, and i mean snail to the part that nothing goes on. But then something happens and you're kind off trilled and think this is going pretty well. But then it starts moving really slow and you are kinda bored. Later in the Middle it picked up back again and really starts picking right back up. Jennifer Lawrence is the main actor of this movie and she does a fine job. But she is actually kind of boring and has no real emotion other than crying or being really angry. That is not character. The action is handled really well but the backgrounds are so distracting, that you cant be interested in the action sequence because of set background. Peeta is also in the movie and he is actually a really compelling character and makes for a more interesting character than the previous films. Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what is trying to achieve, but it is still disappointing that there are some really boring scenes. This movie should be only one movie, not 2 separate ones. 7/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Thrilling and decent sequel with plenty of action , violent fights and emotion. Nail-biting follow-up set in a future called ""Panem"", in which various teens are selected by lottery for a televised fight-to-the-death and each year two young representatives from each district have to participate in The Hunger Games . The participants are forced to eliminate their competitors , teens are given an only chance , all they have to do is survive an on going battle with especially trained young assassins. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem . In this fourth entry Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) takes on the final battle. Katniss Everdeen becomes the symbol of the rebellion after she shoots a force field into the arena of the Quater Quell. She agrees to become the Mockingjay but her main focus is to save Peeta. In this episode Katniss and a team of rebels from District 13 prepare for the final battle that will decide the fate of Panem. Katniss is summoned by general Boggs (Mahershala Ali) to a new assignment. The symbol of rebellion against thedictatoship Capitol, she and the rebels of District 13 poise an all-out war against them; however, this time Katniss has a personal agenda: assassinating autocratic President Snow (Donald Sutherland) herself to gain vengeance not only for Panem's sake but for her own as well. The revolution is about all of us !. The fire will burn forever !. A creature as unquenchable as the sun !. Nothing can prepare you for the end !. Fire burns brighter in the darkness !. The courage of one will change the world !. Stand With Her Every revolution begins with a spark !. Remember who the enemy is !. The sun persists in rising, so I make myself stand !. Remember, girl on fire, I'm still betting on you !.This exciting film contains dramatic events, action, thrills , suspense, blood and is plenty of graphical violence. Adequate but inferior sequel set in a dystopian future, totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol governed by a fascist regime led by President Snow has forged a program for teens, broadcasting a violent competition like a reality television movie. An acceptable follow-up and special effects laden adaptation of the Suzanne Collins novel about a futuristic and extremely bloody TV game show. Excellent action sequences with lethal attacks and blistering struggles. The movie displays intense drama, strong and grueling battles and a suprisingly twisted final . The Hunger Games saga turns out to be a blending about the game to death from ¨Running man¨ (Paul Michael Glaser , 1987) , the tyrannical control by the government of ¨1984¨ (George Orwell) and teen fights from ¨Battle Royale¨ (Kinji Fukasaku) . Jennifer Lawrence is an appropriate warrior in a powerful interpretation as well as Josh Hutcherson. Magnificent plethora of secondary actors give good performances , such as : Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks , Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin , Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright , Mahershala Ali, Sarita Choudhury, Meta Golding Willow Shields, Toby Jones , Robert Kneeper, Elizabeth Banks, Jena Malone , Natalie Dormer. It packs emotive and thrilling musical score by James Newton Howard. As well as colorful and adequate cinematography by Jo Willems, although very dark, preferably taking place indoors . The motion picture was well directed by Francis Lawrence. He's a successful fimmaker (I am Legend, Red Sparrow, Constantine, Hunger Games saga) and usually video-clips director (for Britney Spears , Jennifer Lopez , among others) . Rating: acceptable and passable. Well worth watching .The Hunger Games series based on novels written by Suzanne Collins is formed as follows : ¨The Hunger Games¨ (2012) by Gary Ross , ¨The Hunger Games: Catching Fire¨ (2013) by Francis Lawrence, ¨The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1¨ (2014) by Francis Lawrence and ¨The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2¨ (2015) by Francis Lawrence.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

""The Hunger Games"" itself is my very least favorite. This film focuses on the second half of the Mockingjay book, which as it turns out, is also my least favorite book of the three, but this is owing to the fact that I simply enjoyed reading the previous two more instead of some actual flaw in the Mockingjay book.I'm not here to compare the movie to the book though. Is the movie a satisfying conclusion for audiences, book readers and non-book readers alike? Yes, it is. But to what extent? The film is ripe with drama and thrills. The graphics and effects are brilliant, with one scene in particular coming to mind concerning oil and a lot of running. On the performance front, Katniss Everdeen is as mesmerizing as ever and Julianne Moore radiates dominance as the power-addicted dictator with the remaining cast displaying convincing performances as well. The movie itself is unapologetically bold and spares no expense at thrilling the viewers with the excess of exciting scenes and grim cinematography.But all the CGI monster villains and dystopian locations crafted specifically for further catastrophe and mayhem could not excuse the fact that the movie exchanged the display of genuine human emotion for screaming, dramatic imagery and loud bangs. The film lacked in utilizing the emotional aspects which it had already been given, which it could have built upon, that would probably emotionally rather than visually stimulate viewers. One of the best things about the franchise is the relationships, their implications on the characters and the plot and yet Katniss and Prim barely get 2 minutes of screen time together. I also expected Finncik, who spends quite a lot of time letting his inner emo out while pining for the love of his life in the previous film to exchange more than a couple of sentences with his crimson haired lover.Moreover, the pace substantially begins lagging by the end of the film with an inordinate amount of time spent on Katniss roaming, strolling and looking around. Thankfully though, the film-makers seemed to have a struck a balance when it came to the Peeta-Katniss- Gale love triangle so as not to make it seem quite so tacky or lame enough to induce headaches. And there you have it. While Mockingjay may be somewhat underwhelming for fans of the series such as myself, it is never boring, even when it begins to drag, and there's something for everyone in the movie, whether they be die-hard fans, action movie lovers, hopeless romantics or simply someone hoping to find a good movie to watch.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

Much like Mockingjay Part 1 came off as a hollow, stretched-out introduction with no payoff, the culminating part feels like an over-extended finale that could've been a cracking third act instead of a bloated feature-length instalment. In amongst the needless padding and nonsensical story elements there's still plenty to enjoy though, not least the handful of gritty and brutal action sequences that emerge primarily in the middle act. Director Francis Lawrence has maintained a dark and sombre tone throughout the sequels and this entry – with characters killed off mercilessly and continuing themes of oppression taken to their logical conclusions – is arguably the bleakest of the lot. The uprising against the Capitol's dastardly President Snow (played with sneering delight by Donald Sutherland) is front and centre, but Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) complex relationship provides the real narrative spark. Lawrence and Hutcherson possess a palpable chemistry together, the former offering another wonderfully hard-edged performance whilst the latter provides depth in the dramatic scenes that other, more experienced actors sharing the screen can't bring. Mockingjay Part 2 isn't the brilliant ending it could have been, and proves yet again that splitting the final chapter is dumb, but it's a satisfying enough conclusion for those invested in the series.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

You may recall that we said that Mockingjay Part 1 was a setup for Part 2 as Mockingjay Part 1 was exceedingly slow. Well, Part 2 is slower than Part 1. These last 2-seqments are very slow and are not as good as the first two parts of the Hunger Games. Now, maybe they were all tired because they made all segments (4-movies) in the first year of production. Proof of that is you will see Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee) in all segments as you know he passed away almost after the release of the first segment. See?The first half of this last segment is very slow, however the acting and suspense help carry everything. You still intently watch Jennifer Lawrence as she dominates the screen and rightfully so as she is and will evermore still be an exceptional actress. She is more than really good. The second half opens up some actions and there will be explosions and Katniss' crew dying here and there. We are not sure what to make of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is still unstable and cannot tell reality from fiction as he relies on Katniss' replies when she says: ""Real"" or ""Not Real"" when he questions her motives and what actually happened in the past.Notables : Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman the TV spokesman for President Snow; Julianne Moore as president Coin who is the head of the Rebels; Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne who we thought Katniss would take over Peeta; and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy an adviser to Katniss.There is a major twist later on that no one saw coming and we are surprised (okay: shocked) that Katniss agrees to it. We can only hope that Katniss will do the right thing in time. Unlike in the Bond, James Bond movies the headquarters palace of the bad guy (in this case President Snow) does not get blown up. There may have been some scenes intentionally (maybe) cut out as when Katniss approaches the gates of the headquarters she is next seen within the palace and comes to understand the rebels won and it's all over. (Whaaaat?)What happens next makes up for all the slowness of all that went before. However, when she screams at her sister's cat you may need that box of Kleenex because it is here that she realizes everything (family and friends) she has lost. After that, the ending scenes are totally satisfying and you will go home happy. Maybe this was slower than we expected, but there is no denying that we saw exceptional acting performances from all the known stars. Kudos. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

"","","Overlong, Predictable & Uninvolving, The Hunger Games Saga Concludes On A Forgettable Note","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440728/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2016","Overlong, predictable & uninvolving, the fourth & final instalment in The Hunger Games franchise fails to justify the filmmakers' decision to split the last chapter of the then-intended trilogy into a double feature for it lacks the sense of urgency that finales usually have and apart from brief dose of action here n there, is marred by numerous empty fillers.Picking up from right where the previous chapter signed off, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 continues the journey of Katniss Everdeen, the young & reluctant symbol of the rebellion, as she attempts to unite all districts against one common enemy, President Snow. But her efforts to bring peace to all of Panem threatens to take away everything she holds dear.Directed by Francis Lawrence, the stage for the grand finale was set in place by the last instalment but instead of jumping straight into the arena, he decides to pull the brakes before resuming again. Lawrence's direction is mediocre at best for even when the film manages to gain some momentum, it is unable to hold on to it for long as the director follows it up with an empty filler no one asked for.Every moment of action is foreseeable, some even make you question the whole logic of what just transpired, and the dialogue segments in between are just tedious. Cinematography enhances the grim look of its predecessor by a great deal. Editing isn't up to the mark for the film lacks a tighter structure and at 135 minutes, it's a tad too long. The rest of the technical aspects, however, are in sync with its predecessors.Coming to the performances, leading from the front is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and even though her work isn't as good as it was in the first two chapters, she does an adequate job at it. Josh Hutcherson however ups his performance by a few notches & is better than the rest of the supporting cast. Julianne Moore does well for the most part yet is in full hamming mode during the final act while Philip Seymour Hoffmann & Woody Harrelson don't get enough time on screen.On an overall scale, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 isn't entirely worth the one-year wait and only goes on to show that splitting the final part into two features was an unwarranted move. It isn't that Part 2 is without its moments for it has a few entertaining segments in store but it fails to offer a consistently engaging storyline & is unable to deliver what a grand finale promises. Working in bits n pieces but unsatisfactory for the most part, the concluding chapter of The Hunger Games saga ends on a rather forgettable note.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Interesting dialogue. Exciting moments. Impressive soundtrack.This movie was poor, disappointing. Correct. 5 in all. It gets a 6 due to the amazing acting jobs of some of the leads (Lawrence is fine, Moore is good, Sutherland is great and Hutcherson is IMMENSE).Without thinking much, I can remember some impressive scene from any of the previous movies. The Tributes' Marches. Rue's four notes. Safe and Sound. Isaac's Daughter. The Hanging Tree scene.In this saga, I used to care about the characters. I used to feel with them. I felt moved. This movie was empty. Void. The actors did their best, and so did the director. But the soundtrack was non-existent or forgettable. The script wasn't very good. In Mockingjay I, I could feel how Coin's speeches were getting better, and why they were moving. In this one, no speech was moving. No scene was moving.My favourite in the saga is Catching Fire. Mockingjay I was clearly a transition movie. It didn't have an end, but it certainly had moving moments. Memorable moments.I got out of the theatre after Mockingjay part I with a burning desire to hear ""The Hunger Tree"" again, and thinking ""if the next one is just as good they're going to finish great and will get a cult saga!""I got out of the theatre after Mockingjay part II feeling unmoved, empty... As time is passing, I feel disappointed, cheated and milked.It was obvious that the production had suffered cuts. In the soundtrack, in the special effects, in the settings (the scenarios were much smaller, less epic), in the soundtrack, in the script. Lionsgate knew we were going to see it at the cinema, and instead of finishing with great fireworks, they chose to milk us for the minimum.You should milk cows, not fans. Or you will lose them.I wanted to buy the DVDs for the saga. Now not only I will not, it's going to be months until I go to the cinema ever again.I can't believe they destroyed the potential of this saga with such a poor ending. And it's not bad. It's poor. But I wanted great.","8 out of 31 found this helpful.

In every new Hunger Games I always find myself surprised by how good she is. It is just incredible with how much finesse and class she gives so many nuances and a rich inner life to her Character, whom other less talented actors would have depicted much more over the top.Said that, I join the hype about Lawrence, who is amazing as in everything I have seen her doing. And Sutherland, of course, maybe a bit too ""sweet and polite"", but great.Now, the movie itself didn't live up to my expectations. It is not a bad movie, but it is not as intense as a closing should be. It is of course difficult to judge it without judging the book (which I did not read). But considering that the story itself is very good, I am pretty sure that the problem is the way the director decided to tell that story.First of all I am not a fan of this new trend of dividing the last book of a saga into two movies. Unless the book is twice as big as the previous ones, why splitting it? Besides, I am always curious and excited when I know that only one book is left to end a Saga. I want to know how things will end. And I get disappointed when I realize that the Production decided to make more money dividing the book into two films, so that I have to wait one or two more years.Anyway at least sometimes the splitting results into two strong films. But in this case, unfortunately, it doesn't.Imo, either the book had not the right pace to be divided into two films, or the director did not do a good job. Many scenes are too long and slow, other are confused, some things are left not clear and there is inconsistency in some passages from one scene to another, so that I could not understand how the hell did that character get there, etc. Which is a very bad result for the Director, who had TWO films to tell one book, and still could not get it done clear. I personally believe that one Mockingjay film would have been better than two. Of course it would have been impossible to put there all what's in the book, but not all what's in a book can work well on screen. Overall the movie gets to live of the strength of the story/book, so, as said, it is not bad. But I hoped in a more intense end. I suppose I will have to read the book, to have that.","8 out of 32 found this helpful.

Jennifer Lawrence's acting is also horrific in this one; it seems like she either doesn't identify with her character, or just does NOT want to be there making this movie. This might be the fault of the writer having no idea how to intelligently end this story; but it is all of us who suffered because of it. For context, i really enjoyed the first two movies in the series - but this one just lacks any kind of excitement, feeling, or sense of purpose.

There are only 2 people to blame, the screen writer, and the director. If you do see the movie, walk out once Prim dies, and you may have a slightly better experience, as the movie just goes from bad to ridiculously stupid after that point.There isn't anything unexpected that happens, as the movie does an absolutely terrible job of trying to tease you, and telegraphs the entire sequence of events to you in UPPERCASE, long before things actually happen. This is a perfect example of how to NOT write a screen play. If the story doesn't make sense on paper, it's not going to make sense on film.

They had nerve, surprising plot-twists and where refreshingly brutal - both graphically and emotionally.These last two installments get increasingly cheesy as we go along. The quite compelling actor that is Jennifer Lawrence (loved her work in Winters Bone, Silver Linings Playbook and especially American Hustle - she nailed that) gets reduced to a child-actor in a lot of scenes and looks surprisingly ordinary. This isn't entirely her fault though - some of the scenes and lines she's forced to do are simply cringe worthy! Also, although the Hunger Games-films understandably get more and more serious and develop into a full scale critique of the world powers and a somewhat philosophical film about society as a whole, it sort of ruins the fun a bit. The movies simply get ordinary, slightly irritating and flat in a weird way.The ending is amateurish. It sort of underlines how far this thing has fallen since the first movie was released.Despite all this I'd definitely recommend seeing this if you're a Hunger Games-fan. I don't know about paying to watch it in the cinema, but watch it and then quickly get on with your life!","8 out of 33 found this helpful.

Mockingjay as a whole is so much different compared to the first two movies but Part 2 stood out with it's realistic war atmosphere and all the emotions evoked with a war. Jennifer Lawrence stood out again in her role as Katniss with Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth giving memorable performances too! There was so much suspense, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Plenty of action and a gripping story line. Stays true to the book, I highly recommend this epic finale. After seeing the first movie in the franchise I was immediately captivated, it is sad to think that it's all over, just like Harry Potter.

""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" (PG-13, 2:17) is the final film from Suzanne Collins' blockbuster ""The Hunger Games"" YA book trilogy. So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" isn't game-changing, but it is a very strong, effective and entertaining end to ""The Hunger Games"" saga. Frances Lawrence, director of all but the first film, keeps screenwriters Peter Craig's and Danny Strong's story moving at a good pace and with some surprising twists. The action and visual effects are the best of the series and while there is a lot of violence, on both large and small scales, as with the other films, we are spared an excessive amount of gore in those moments. However, the movie does not skimp on its ever-present themes of the inherent ugliness of war and the difficult moral choices that those fighting war must face, and Katniss gives voice to both.The script is especially good in its discussion and depiction of war, but also in the changes it made from the book ""Mockingjay"". Purists may disagree with the changes, but they are suitably dramatic, give good closure to the story and maintain the spirit of the story's source material. The themes in the books are consistently and remarkably well portrayed in the films – especially this one. The same could be said for the actors' performances. Although this film means saying goodbye to this story, it may not necessarily mean saying goodbye to the general setting or some of the characters. There is some talk of a ""Hunger Games"" prequel or sequel. While we Movie Fans wait for the final word on those discussions, the last movie based on the original YA book trilogy gives us a lot to enjoy, to think about and to miss.

"6","/10","The Games are finally over as The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 delivers a satisfying conclusion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358324/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","20 November 2015","In the storm of movies that are trying to be the next Harry Potter series like with Divergent and Maze Runner, trying to aim for the teen and young adult market, The Hunger Games have been really successful. Unlike the Harry Potter series that had a male protagonist and an upbeat attitude, The Hunger Games has a strong feminist hero that's in a real down beat universe. Some might see the darker environment as a turn off, but I always saw it as unique. And even with the somber tone, it still felt like a tense fun action story that satisfies most mainstream audiences.Last year, we received the first part of the Mockingjay finale that I liked, but criticized for being a little slow and truly only half of a movie. This trend (along with many upcoming movies) of splitting movies is something that rarely justifies it's existence as it only serves to stretch the series on longer then it needs to be. So given how the first part was very dialogue heavy and light on action, I think a lot of people (who haven't read the books) are hoping that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 will deliver on the action for the finale of the series. We open immediately at the end of the first movie where Katness Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who is recovering from Peeta's (played by Josh Hutcherson) attempted murder on her. He was brainwashed by the capital and Katness is his trigger. The doctors have done what they can, but all they can do is wait for Peeta to heel. Their attack on the capital in the last movie weakened them and is finally ready to make the final assault. Katness wants to join the front lines in District 2, but leader of the rebellion President Alma Coin (played by Julianne Moore) and her assistant Plutarch (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) tell her to rest.She defies their orders by sneaking onto a cargo ship that takes her to the District where she meets up with her fellow rebels. Once she teams up with Gale (played by Liam Hemsworth), Finnick (played by Sam Claflin), Cressida (played by Natalie Dormer) and a few commanders, they make their way to the rim of the capitol. Not only is Peeta also coming along, but the Capitol has rigged most of the city with traps as a last effort to drive off the forces. It's up to Katness to make it through the traps to complete her mission to kill President Snow (played by Donald Sutherland).Like the previous movie, Mockingjay part 2 is just as somber and bleak, though this is feels like the darkest of the bunch. Perhaps it relies too much on being somber, as I really wanted Katness to have a couple of moments to breathe. It does keep her goal in mind to end everything, though you kind of want something that will keep her going. I wish there had been some lighter moments somewhere like previous memories as kids or something.As is, this definitely feels like a proper way to end the Hunger Games, giving us an ending that makes sense, even if it's not as surprising as it is in the book. While it continues to stay character focused, there are some well staged action scenes. Fans hoping for more of it will probably be disappointed, but satisfied nonetheless. Jennifer Lawrence was Katness Everdeen and it will be sad knowing she probably won't play her again. Everyone else does well, as well as Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his final role. I'll give this six burning arrows out of ten. While it is the weakest of the films, it's still a good movie to end the legacy. Now that the games are over, it's time for the next young adult series to take the world by storm. Will it be Harry Potter-like? Or Hunger Games-like? Or something different? Cinema is a tricky game.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Bit Better Than What I Expected, But Still Plagued By A Number Of Issues","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648738/?ref_=tt_urv","zkonedog","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7826013/?ref_=tt_urv","26 February 2017","Judging the final portion of the Hunger Games series is tricky because of all the things it had going against it at its release:-It's based on the weakest book in the series (IMHO) -It shouldn't have been broken into two parts to begin with. -A number of it's stars have kind of outgrown their roles in terms of popularity.As such, I went into this film with incredibly low expectations (I almost didn't even see it in the theater). As it turned out, I was surprisingly entertained, though not anywhere near overwhelmed.For a basic plot summary, ""Mockingjay Part 2"" picks up right where ""Part 1"" left off, with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) completely stunned by the brainwashing of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) by the Capital. Because of this treatment, Katniss decides to embrace her role as the symbolic Mockingjay and help President Coin (Julianne Moore) rally the troops. This strategy works, as the coalition of District's seems to be making progress. However, is that just all part of President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) grand plan?The first half of this movie was painfully slow and sometimes even bordering on boring. I had worries that it was going to be a total disaster, to be honest. Fortunately, after the sewer scene with the Mutts that was legitimately scary, the film really picked up. Much like my experience with reading the Mockingjay book, the ending worked for me. I can't really even exactly explain why, but the ending to this franchise is compelling.Of course, this is a series specifically targeted young adults (that just happened to cross-over big time), so it has a few things it has to do, some of which work and some of which do not. For example, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has nothing important to do the entire movie, except fulfill his place in the love triangle of the franchise. On the flip side, though, I had forgotten how many parallels to our conflicts in the Middle East there are in this narrative. That material is a bit heavy-handed and obvious (again, to suit the YA audience), but it works pretty well nonetheless.Perhaps the strangest thing about this movie though? While skewing darker than any of the previous films, which you would think would alienate some of the teens who are just going for the spectacle, it also takes the most ""emotional buy in"" to really get invested (as it relies so heavily on the love triangle), which plays exactly to that teen audience. So, a bit of a tug-of-war throughout in terms of tone.Overall, ""Mockingjay 2"" is better than its immediate predecessor, but combine both films and the narrative is still the worst in the franchise. Again, though, I thought the same thing about the book, so I wasn't terribly surprised. Had they made ""Mockingjay"" a single film, I think I would have enjoyed it better. It would have been better paced and it could have better taken advantage of its stars (by 2015, Lawrence and even Hemsworth are ""too big"" for these roles now).

"","","Very Good Way to Close Out the Series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3386662/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2016","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The fourth and final film in the series picks up immediately after the last as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) decides the only thing left for her to do is to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland) herself.It seems a lot of people were disappointed with MOCKINGJAY PART 1 because there was too much talk and many fans felt that it was drawn out into two movies just so they could charge people twice. As I've said in my reviews of the three previous films, I've never read the books so I can't compare them to this film but for my money this was a major step up from the previous one and I thought this one easily put itself in line with the first two films. If there was too much build-up in part one it was well worth it because this film delivers a lot of great and intense action.Again, I haven't read the novels but for my money this was a very satisfying and entertaining series and it ends on a very high note. I thought the look of the film was quite excellent and there's no question that it was extremely well-made. The cinematography, sound effects, music score and everything else technical were right on the mark. You've also got the benefit of characters that are well-known by now and there's no question that the casting was flawless. Lawrence was the only choice for this role and once again she brings a strong and rewarding performance. Julianne Moore, Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman are all very good as well.I thought the story here was extremely captivating and it certainly leaves you on the edge of the seat as it plays itself out. There's a lot of character development here that actually works and many personal conflicts that play themselves out well. I'd argue that the film did drag on a bit too much but this is only a minor complaint. THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY PART 2 contains a lot of great actor and I found the CGI effects to be much better than previous installments. The direction is very good throughout and manages to build up some nice suspense. This is certainly a very good way for the series to come to an end.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

This two-part final act wasn't as compelling as it should have, but especially in Part 2 we got some great choices story-wise. And that's exactly what makes THG the best YA series in recent years: it may be predictable in its single choices (i.e. the oh-so-convenient death of some characters along the way or the dumb idea of a ""hunger game"" inside the Capitol) but eventually leads to a deep understanding of how society and politics works. Unfortunately the dumb part was much stronger in the last two films than the positive one, making ""Mockingjay"" a good (at best) installment with spectacle but little brains, heart-wrenching but flat dialogs and not so amazing performances. Cinematography has always been a silver lining and so it was here, with dark and oppressive settings, counterbalanced by the cold and sharp visuals of the Capitol's houses and style.Meh story, great ending. 7/10","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

By mature I don't necessarily mean that you've attained a minimal age in years (though I would say that it is unlikely viewers younger than 10 would appreciate the movie). I mean you can equally enjoy not only faster-paced action sequences but also slower-paced drama. As with the books and previous movies, this last Hunger Games movie has intense moments of both action and drama, but also less intense but still dramatically important sequences of people just talking. I suspect this is what less mature or interested viewers have called the ""boring"" parts.However if you like movies that are dynamic in pace and emotionally engaging rather than just one long special effects sequence, and especially if you are a fan of the books, I think you'll appreciate seeing this movie in the theater. Relatively speaking it is a pretty faithful portrayal of the book. The action sequences are brutal and the dramatic sequences are tear-jerking. And on occasion, as with the book, you get hit with both at once several times.","24 out of 40 found this helpful.

Think Michael Bay. This movie has the reverse problem: it's story is cohesive and well written, but it lacks the pay off. I give it a passing grade because it's problems aren't what it does bad but what it doesn't do. Overall, it's a good movie but is the worst of the series due to its lacking climax. SPOILERS When watching a second time, I realized, this wouldn't be a hard movie to make good. Their first problem is following the promo videos. I admire that they're following the book-I'd be mad if they changed it-but that doesn't mean they can't skip it. By this point all the promo stuff and Peeta stuff is irrelevant. A better choice would to focus on a new group of people taking the front of the attack. They could explain it as, ""The capitol has guns hidden throughout the city that we need to destroy before flying in jets."" This would explain the mission and also make for some cool war action. After, we can come meet up with Katniss. Her squad dies and they immediately go under ground, again, skipping the slow parts. The next change would be when they're going to Snow's house. This would be a departure from the book but the book's flaw is Katniss' lack of action in the plot. To make her relevant again, maybe she heard Peacekeepers talking of a trap so she and Gale need to take them down. It'd be cool to see them work as a team and go bad-ass taking down a whole squad. THEN the rebels attack and more mayhem and Prim dies. Lastly, I like how she kills Coin, but this doesn't seem like a reason to not kill Snow. She should've gone over to Snow, whispered, ""This doesn't change anything,"" and stab him cold heartedly. These three additions wouldn't change the story but would insert much needed climax into an otherwise solid story.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Overall a very exciting, action-packed, suspenseful and dark Young Adult franchise. It has come to an end - a very tense and grim conclusion. For the book lovers, the film starts off exactly where it left off, and is consistent with it's close adaption to the final half of the novel. To be honest, the films beginning was a little slow, perhaps difficult to understand due to the films political approach. However it is not long before it corrects it's path things really begin to take place.Nearly everything about this movie was well-executed. The directing, the acting, visual effects etc. are all very solid. Francis has done an exceptional job with story-telling in this one, once again proving his worth as a big-budget filmmaker. Some scenes have been directed superbly, making for some of the most suspenseful and entertaining scenes of the entire franchise. All performances were spot-on, most notably Jennifer Lawrence for bringing a very valuable reality to the character of Katniss Everdeen. There are also some other solid performances from actors Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore... the list goes on. The visual effects and cinematography of this epic finale were both spot-on, complementing the dark atmosphere and melancholy events within the film. The visual effects in the Hunger Games series has often been overlooked in past years. This year again proves its quality in the field - the visuals truly are gritty and beautiful to look at. Perhaps this year they will be recognized by the Academy. Overall it's not perfect, but it certainly is very engrossing and exciting for it's screen time. The general critics consensus for this film is quite average, mainly for it's uneven pacing (perhaps due to the book-split). To be honest, if you liked Mockingjay: Part I, you will absolutely love this film. Even if you didn't enjoy the first part, you will still probably find this a refreshing treat for the eyes, ears and heart. In my own opinion, I would liken the quality of this film to Catching Fire, easily. I thought the pacing, overall, was fine. It's build up of suspense and emotion was quite consistent. The melancholy feel of the film contrasts beautifully with it's humor, which in the end is quite enjoyable. Honestly, there were some scenes that did feel 'rushed' and perhaps could have been expanded upon, but ultimately they didn't significantly detract from the overall quality of the film.Conclusively, when viewing Mockingjay: Part II, watch it with an open mind and heart. If you ignore the opinions of the others (including the critics) chances are you will enjoy this film a lot more!A solid 9 out of 10","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can not think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's. performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta,. Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow.

While I didn't mind the slower pacing of these last two installments, the fact that there was two final installments when there should have been one is already a strike against it. But that's Hollywood finance for you. Outside of the purely financial reasons for splitting the final book in two, this finale continued to explore the interesting political ideas discussed throughout the rest of the series, even if it was a discussion already had in other films, watered down here for the teenage masses. The principal cast continue to deliver effective performances, particularly Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland (who gets some of the film's best moments). The central concern seemed to be how the Rebels' and Capital upper echelons were essentially two sides of the same coin (pardon the pun). Again, while the notion that power can be exploited no matter what side of a conflict you're on is not new, I thought the film handled it well enough considering the pedigree of the source material. For those wondering about the action, like PART 1, there really isn't a lot of it although slightly more than last time. There were two big set-pieces, and both of them were suitably exciting. If your patience was tested during MOCKINGJAY PART 1, odds are you'll have the same issue here, but fans of the book series will probably see this no matter what (and probably already have). Other people might tune in out of obligation (like myself) just to see how things end. Ultimately, the story took some rather predictable turns, but nothing I couldn't live with. The only serious misstep was a coda that felt entirely unnecessary. In fact, 15 minutes could have been shorn from the end without detriment to the overall film or series. So, is THE HUNGER GAMES a great series? I would say no, but it breaks down political ideas for a younger audience in an effective way. If you've seen the previous three, of course watch this one; for everyone else, you'd be better served checking out BATTLE ROYALE 1 & 2.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Basically, in _Mockingjay_, all the characters whom we love wind up as either head cases or corpses. There is nothing remotely resembling a ""happily ever after.""""Mockingjay Part 2"" (the movie) simplifies the novel's story (as it must), but it also gets rid of the sadness, gloom, and PTSD from the book. Collins's message is still there; but the movie is entertaining, not grim.Special applause to Jen.

It still doesn't work. Obviously the execs don't care, because we are forced to see two movies no matter how good they are if we want to finish spending time with these characters, but come on guys. Let's stop this please.As for the actual movie, Mockingjay Pt. 2 did manage to improve upon its predecessor. I was generally entertained with and enjoyed the first two HG films, but MJ Pt. 1 was so slow, boring, and sloppy that it soured my taste of the whole franchise. Part 1 suffered from the usual issue with these films as it was totally focused on the set up, and part 2 was totally focused on the payoff. You can't make a well rounded film when focusing on only one of those two things, but every 2-parter will have this issue. But the biggest problem was that these two movies added up to close to 5 hours, and still somehow managed to be riddled with confusing moments and plot holes. The first two Hunger Games films were able to create complete cohesive stories in half the time, but in double the time, Mockingjay churned out something that didn't really make any sense. Character motivations were all over the place, and plot points and lesser characters were severely underdeveloped in certain spots. By focusing too much on minor details and random establishing shots, we were deprived of substance, which should never happen when you have 5 hours to tell one damn story.But there were a few positives of the film. There were some cool traps and set pieces devised by the game makers, and I suppose the ending was somewhat satisfying. And now that I think of it, the acting was much improved in this film, as a lot of actors seemed to be phoning it in with Part 1. It was nice to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman for one last time as well. Glad that they were able to film some of his sequences before his tragic passing.Verdict:Mockingjay Pt. 2 isn't much more worth your money than the first one, and you'd be better off waiting to see it on demand. I'd recommend watching the first one in close tandem though as it will clear up some of the fog that the 2-parter creates.

Before I went to the cinema, I messaged my friend and asked him if he wanted to join. He messaged back and literally begged me not to go, as he and his friends found it super boring.I went to the cinema anyway, and I have to say ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" is not as poignant and engaging as I hoped. In fact, the pacing is slow, and the film just would not end! There were several times when I thought the film would end, I literally picked up my bag and got ready to leave, and more scenes came on. The final scene might have provided closure, but really not necessary.Another problem is that there is too much talking, scheming and plotting. There is virtually no action apart from the scene involving black liquid, and another scene involving a red tunnel. For a film this long, I would have liked more action to keep the adrenaline pumping.","6 out of 31 found this helpful.

Katniss' is still caught in an awkward love triangle between Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is still in bad emotional shape after being rescued from the clutches of Snow and who may still be on an assignment to kill Katniss, and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who is loyally sticking by our heroine's side as the mission begins. Weighed down with the burden and responsibility of the impossible task at hand, the movie suggests that if Katniss does succeed and survive there may not be much left of her. The assault itself is where the film really kicks off as the near- ruined Capitol is suitably booby-trapped at every turn forcing the squad to go underground which is where the tension is ramped up to a near unbearable level – causing a number of cinema-goers to scream out loud. Lawrence is still on good form and can now play the role in her sleep. The rest of the cast do their best, Gale especially benefits from a more beefed up role, but the majority of the stars are there only to support Katniss. I've always felt the role of Peeta should have been stronger than has always been portrayed. What is quite refreshing about Mockingjay Part 2 is that it is not as straight forward as it seems. Whereas the film appears to be going in one direction, it stops and ventures off in a different unpredictable direction. But unfortunately it's not altogether successful. One death scene is merely brushed over whereas it should be key to the entire finale and instead of being victorious things become very bleak very quickly. The ending is also dragged out longer than necessary. Whilst Mockingjay Part 2 is an improvement on its predecessor, it doesn't touch the highs of the first two movies. All in all it's a decent ending to a decent franchise and although it doesn't really finish on a high, fans of the books should be fairly satisfied with the conclusion.","4 out of 20 found this helpful.

Let me just say this film paid close attention to detail with its book-to-movie transformation. I was literally speechless, then screaming, angry, then happy, confused, and scared. Then finally, everything was OK. See at first I was like oh no,they're gonna tidy it up for a PG-13 crowd. But then I had to remember the end of the first part of Mockingjay when Peeta choked the dog crap out of Katniss. So naturally I start creeping around The Internet looking for spoilers. After I get what I want I finally purchased the ticket and go to the theater. Just got back and I want to watch it again, which is kinda shocking as long as the movies was. Best scene for me was the scene where Katniss quietly and slowly says ""Nightlock, Nightlock, Nightlock."" The whole scene was amazing. Kudos to Francis Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, oh everybody. The whole cast delivered! Every scene was heartfelt and the movie came together beautifully. And another thing I might add is that at the end it was kinda like this is the end(amazingly freaking executed) but alas THIS IS THE END. With others movies, or shall I say book-to-movie transformations they leave you with a sense of yet another sequel. Just seems like the fight is never really over. With The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 I got just that. I loved how it was done. Jennifer Lawrence looks like she'd be a wonderful mother someday. But with other franchises such as Harry Potter(which I love), Twilight, Lord Of The Rings, and heck even stuff like Wrong Turn, Final Destination, Scream, and Paranormal Activity. This movie was like WE WON THE WAR, YOU CAN GO HOME AND JUST LIVE NOW KATNISS. ITS OVER. And it truly felt over, and I felt good about it.","27 out of 46 found this helpful.

Although I wasn't overly keen on The Hunger Games' second entry, Catching Fire (2013), it was at least - along with the original 2012 movie that kicked off the successful movie franchise that helped launch Jennifer Lawrence into super-stardom - decently paced; a tight, nifty thriller with some enjoyable set-pieces. Part 1 of Mockingjay lacked anything in the way of spectacle, and while Part 2 certainly delivers on the action front, it still stutters due to stretching a pretty slim book into over 4 hours of screen-time.Following a slow start during which we meet up with heroine Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) who is coming to terms with the horrors of war and the re-emergence of the emotionally damaged Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in her life, things pick up when Katniss defies the orders of revolution propaganda chief Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the increasingly shady President Coin (Julianne Moore), and forces her way to the front line. What Katniss and her team face on their way to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is a city booby- trapped to the gills with giant machine guns, flamethrowers, and other imaginatively-designed instruments of death awaiting them at every turn. Circumstances have changed but the Games remain the same.What Part 1 lacked most of all was the Hunger Games themselves, and here they are cleverly woven back into the story. As absurd some of the set-ups are (surely a couple of well-placed soldiers armed with walkie-talkies and sniper-rifles would have been more efficient and cost-effective?), they undoubtedly eject the film with the excitement it sorely needs. Mockingjay Part 2 is also extremely dark and violent, pushing its UK 12A certificate to breaking point. One set-piece set in a sewer that sees a horde of snarling monsters chase our heroes in a scene straight out of a horror movie and a genuinely shocking (if you haven't read the books) moment of brutality near the end prove to be brave and mature decisions. And why shouldn't young folk see death depicted without the usual padding or sentimentality?I also applaud the story for taking an unconventional approach to the inevitable Everdeen-Snow showdown, but its here that events take a confusing turn as Lawrence's Everdeen is kept at an emotional distance that clouds her motivations without the aid of narration, and the movie struggles in the closing moments. It's also an ending that should have come the film before, with the slicing of the story resulting in Part 2 going out with a slight whimper when it could have been explosive. On a positive note, it seems that audiences are finally catching on to the kind of studio greed that forced them to watch the likes of The Hobbit for nine hours over three years, as Lionsgate's movie performed poorer than expected at the box office (though it still made a shed-load).","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Meaning, if this is your first encounter with the franchise, you're going to be puzzled by most of what ensues. Katniss has recovered from Peeta's futile effort to strangle her, while he remains in restraints. Initially, she has trouble uttering her own name. Eventually, she embarks on a mission into the District 2 war zone alongside long-time friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth of ""The Expendables 2"") where an enemy shoots Katniss in the back. Predictably, Snow celebrates her death before he learns that she survived. Disgruntled about getting sidelined after her near-death experience, our pugnacious protagonist sneaks back into combat with a little help from smarmy Johanna Mason (Jena Malone of ""Cold Mountain""), but she finds herself relegated to a propaganda mission as rebel forces enter the capital. Once again, Coin relies on Katniss for her propaganda value as the Mockingjay, while Katniss itches for the chance to kill Snow. Our heroes wield a gadget that enables them to detect the presence of booby traps. Snow has turned the Capitol into an obstacle course of deadly booby traps. Our courageous heroine and her unit face numerous close scrapes, and their brash adversaries make the same mistake again and again of thinking that they have eliminated Katniss while she emerges unscathed. Ultimately, Katniss' two confrontations with Snow in the final quarter ignite few sparks.

The conclusion to the highly profitable 'Hunger Games' franchise. The franchise that kicked dystopian young adult films into the mainstream. And now this iconic franchise is coming to a close. A close that is not nearly as epic or satisfying as it should be. In fact it ends on a very low note. After 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' this series was looking to dominate box offices again with it's third and final adaptation. So, to more appropriately dominate, this third book was split in two. This is where I knew the series was going to take a hit. Not since the 'Deathly Hallows' movies has a two way split of a novel worked out. While, Part 1 was noticeably worse, Part 2 does not do much better. This is unfortunate because this had the makings of greatness. It had a superb cast, big budget, and an intriguing story. But money had to get in the way. Studio greed once again has left us with a poorly handled film. Before I get into the specifics I will talk on the films behalf. It's not the worst thing to come out this year, far from it. If you're a fan of the Hunger Games books you will most likely enjoy this film. It has everything you'd expect and want out of it. Again, the cast is great. Lawrence and Hutcherson have great chemistry together, so when they are fighting each other their was noticeable tension. There was a sense that anything could happen between them. This was my favorite part of the film. Another plus is the action sequences. They definitely received more attention then any other aspect of the film, and that showed. They were extremely well shot and filled with great moments. It's to bad that they are few and far in between. Which tends to happen when you split a book in half. There is just to much filler. The film knew that it wasn't working with much so it draws out scenes that have no business being any longer. Conversations don't have any flow to them. They talk slow and expound on things that were blatantly obvious. In doing this the film abandons any subtly that it should've built.Without the help of subtly the film becomes incredibly ridged and predictable. Being able to see what is going to happen ten minutes before it does is the exact opposite of a positive. It robs itself of any thrills that it had. And there are many. All of which I saw coming long before they happened. This makes the uneven pace stick out like a sore thumb. It gets off to an unbearably slow start and ends with an incredibly rushed finale. 'Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2' is about as good as the title suggests it will be. It never seems to rise above expectations, even with all its assets. It's to bad because there is a good story here. While it may be lost inside a clumsy mess of a movie there is no denying that it's entertaining.","4 out of 26 found this helpful.

In brief: This last chapter is a slight improvement on the series due to its action scenes.GRADE: B-The end is finally here as the successfully popular and somewhat disappointing trilogy The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 takes flight once again. For the last time, Katniss and her Scoobydoo crew fight against the evil President Snow and his elitist Capitol armies in a film series which has overstayed its welcome and has gotten progressively weaker with each viewing. At least this final chapter shows signs of life with its better action sequences and ties up its very loose narrative ends in satisfying if predictable ways.￼The convoluted plot immediately picks up where it left off in its previous installment: the rebellion rages on. Having survived the Hunger Games, Katniss has become the Mockingjay, a spokesperson and symbol for the downtrodden class wars and now join forces with rebel leader President Coin and her team. Gale, Finnick, and Haymitch remain steadfastly at Katniss' side and a brainwashed Peeta has been recaptured and is being deprogrammed.After a rather slow start, the majority of this film involves overthrowing the government as a rigorous video game of chance, with many obstacles to avoid as the warriors sidestep deadly booby traps called pods to get to their intended target. (It takes nearly a half hour before the first war scene takes place.)￼Directed again by Francis Lawrence, this time with much more style and flair, the film takes its characters and the political story more soberly allowing stronger development and relationships to build between the riveting battle scenes, a factor sorely missing in the last two outings. The dialog still flat-lines and doesn't build to any emotional reward. Instead it stops the action coldly until the film gets to its next exciting combat scene. Although the non-battle scenes become superfluous and in need of some judicious cuts, kudos go out to two action sequences that more than make up for the price of admission: an encounter dealing with a flood of lethal CGI tar and the other involves a tense surprise attack in the sewers, which are skillfully staged by the director and very well edited to maximum effect by Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa.￼Production values are consistently strong and the acting is more than adequate, even if the screenplay lacks polish. Some major characters, used more effectively in the other films from this series, are treated less importantly here and have minor underwritten status in this last go- round which seems a tad jarring. The series' major strength has always been the casting of Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role. The actress soldiers on, giving the film more gravitas than it deserves. ￼The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 rarely soars. Although this final film stays aloft pretty much of the time and does not crashes like a phoenix, the series itself still burned itself out in its mammoth length and delusions of grandeur. Less would have been more.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com","4 out of 26 found this helpful.

The next day I gave away my copy; equally out of childish frustration and a hope that my able minded friend would confirm my opinions. In the coming months, public perception was as divided as I had anticipated. When the first Hunger Games film came to town, I saw a blockbuster franchise grab a promising foothold that might ramp up to a conclusion that would change my nearly hostile distain for the book Nope.A film based on an existing media gets harsher scrutiny. I've never been in a situation where I've willed a film to take free reign from that material and break a few rules. Ultimately, between these two films, it was one of the most dutiful adaptations I have ever seen. From 390 pages of source material, 260 minutes of film were created. This is a stretch for a shot-for-shot adaptation, but it allows for a rare opportunity of faithfulness. This unfortunate scenario delivered a finale that was as authentic as it was disappointing.Katniss was a relatable character in the first installment, an inspiration in the second, abbreviated in the third, and finally fully plucked of vibrancy by the end. Jennifer Lawrence is shown in close- up for just long enough to get a reaction shot for the first 2 hours. Those reactions never varied from despair or alarm from an explosion. This film was a freight train of war and action steaming toward an end that hardened without smooth edges. This is not to say that the ending wasn't cheerful enough, or too splendid in the face of its preceding tragedies; just shapeless.Entertaining moments came in early progressions. The most enthralling stretch came when an elite squad was put through an hour long Hunger Games trial in subterranean Panem. While not in any way crucial to the story, it was a satisfying amalgam of elements from World War Z and Maze Runner. Due to this dangerous setting, subsequent events didn't allow for time to look back or provide believable exposition to vary the singular motives of any character. The result was a climax that paled in comparison to rising action, all because of irrelevant motivations from previous films that failed to carry through the flames with our heroine.There are moments of calculating body counts, years, and material loss. What it lacks is the counterpart. The reward for all the suffering that our victor endures is not promised and denied, it is never offered. Phrases like ""A free Panem"" or ""The death of Snow"" are used as propaganda for the characters, but remain ambiguous to us. An ending doesn't require happy compensation for struggle or even consolation. This felt like consolation for a different story and conflict.

"6","/10","Better than Part 1, but still suffers from the split","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3368371/?ref_=tt_urv","Vartiainen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30163554/?ref_=tt_urv","8 December 2015","In this conclusion to the ever so popular Hunger Games saga, we get to see our heroine Katniss Everdeen fulfill her purpose as the troops of all the thirteen districts march against the Capitol and President Snow. Let the games, once again, begin.What these movies have always gotten consistently right are the visuals, the spectacle. And that doesn't change in the slightest. I'd actually argue that this film has some of the best action scenes yet seen in this franchise. As Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and the crew accompanying her march through the streets of Capitol, it looks, sounds and feels amazing, with you, the viewer, gripping your seat handles in anticipation and fright. The action also varies a lot more than in the previous films, with some of the action happening in the battle fields, some in urban houses, some underground, some in the streets, and so on.The returning actors also do a good job of keeping up the quality, with Lawrence once again being the heart and soul of the whole film. You feel Katniss deteriorating through the course of the film, becoming more fragile, bending under the pressure, which makes the final twist of the film all the more shocking and pleasing.But alas, the bad stuff. This story doesn't work in two parts. You can see in almost every scene how it has been stretched beyond comfort limits in order to make this into two films. It feels padded, it takes too long, which waters down the intensity, the drama and the tension. By the time the final climax is rolling, you no longer care because the film has lost your attention.All in all Mockingjay Part 2 is definitely better than Part 1. It has more of the good scenes, better ending and more action. But it cannot hold a candle to the two first ones, which had much tighter narrative, pacing and story lines. A disappointing ending to a very decent franchise.","3 out of 20 found this helpful.

But much of this story involved inaction. You keep rooting for something to happen. Finally when the Rebels attack, stuff happens. Some interesting chase scenes, and some good CGI.The characters are so well oiled in their roles at this point, there are no real surprises. Katniss finally gets to show some emotion, and Jennifer Lawrence turns in her usual strong acting. She has that look that is just hard to not pay attention to. And when she finally can show emotion, she's terrific.The story is satisfying. I didn't read the books but I assume the movie is faithful to the story. I think they should have combined parts 1/2 into one movie, and it would have been much better. part 1 was a dud because nothing happened. And part 2 really has nothing happen until the 2nd part of the movie. Don't believe the picture on the DVD cover - there's really not that much action until the end. All told, it's just an OK movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unlike the split finale of other YAs such as Harry Potter, which was a grand chase at part 1 and an epic battle at part 2, and Twilight, which was a pregnancy ordeal at part 1 and another epic battle except it never happen at part 2; The Hunger Games is basically continuing the same beat as the last one. Some may say the first part is all propaganda talking while this movie is the epic payoff, but nope. It's still the same story, the same theme, the same approach and everything else; proving that the split is even less necessary and it would have been a greater film if it was a stand alone in the first place. Because despite of feeling incomplete, it's still a pretty good movie. The stakes are more challenging, the themes are more complex and the finale is just brilliant. And the easy flaw here it was needlessly put into two movies. Even worse, it feels a little too long in moments that doesn't seem to matter, but it's still a quite strong finale of a quite impressive franchise in the YA genre.","3 out of 23 found this helpful.

This has made most of these films unremarkable, yet still very likable and, at times, even lovable. With Mockingjay – Part 2, we are given much of these same traits, notably the great political commentary, reminders of our own power-hungry ruling systems. Unfortunately, though, the ever-earnest saga of the Girl On Fire goes out with more of a fizzle than a blaze of glory. In this final Panem revolution movement, Katniss and her band of misfit do-gooders have found a way to infiltrate the Capital, hoping to take down the malevolent President Snow. It's easy to root for these guys as they encounter Hunger-Games-esque obstacles and puzzles along their way, each set-piece nicely staged and appropriately thrilling. Unfortunately, those moments only take up about 40 minutes of a 2+ hour film; otherwise, we're subjected to the movie's humorless disposition, which focuses hard on the purposeless love triangle, whose only existence is seemingly to get teenage girls all in a tizzy. Worst of all, as a stark defender of Mockingjay – Part 1 and its presence as a stand-alone film, I was sorely let down that so little of consequence really occurs in most of Part 2. Not that I need end-to-end action or constant twists and turns; however, if your movie is so covered in dialogue as this one is, it should be colorful, incisive, or at least entertaining. Instead, it's just vapid and boring, keeping this successfully diverting franchise from ending on the engrossing note it often hit.","4 out of 37 found this helpful.

But an anti-climatic manoeuvre abruptly mutes the bugle of charging (when Katniss finally reaches the gate of Snow's palace) and subsequently declares the war is finished. As scheming as President Coin (Moore), the rebel leader, seems to be, the unsatisfactory closure leaves an impression of implausibility, how come the almighty Snow can be overthrown solely by that move? The worse part follows, Coin, if she is truly as scheming as the story wants us to believe, she is way too remiss to trust Katniss' loyalty, to allow her to get the access of the ""truth"" - who is the real deal behind the explosive parachutes, too early to reveal her true colour (another hunger game just after the hard-earned victory?) and exposes herself as an easy target to be terminated within an arrow's range.On the other hand, although the script is over-confident in its manipulation (the same weak point like Coin), the story does bring to light how often the power corruption resides in the political games, the shadowy flip side of every revolution under the name of freedom for hoi polloi. This could be the reason why THE HUNGER GAMES is above the average YA novels, although only by a small margin.Tellingly, Lawrence is the core of the franchise's success, sports an innate air of leadership, even deadens the cringe-worthy reaction from the unabashed love-triangle (her kiss during a dead-or- alive situation can literally bring a raging Peeta back to sobriety). It is no denying that it is Lawrence's superstar persona that rises Katniss above an average heroine stereotype. Also the coupling of Katniss and Peeta (Hutcherson) shows the resolution of subverting our typical conception, a strong female can find her prince charming being a less dominating male, which sounds and looks like a feminist stand but well-suited in today's world.Among the larger supporting group, expectedly Moore's icy impersonation of Coin is my guilty pleasure, as predictable as it manifests, the reversal of her destiny becomes the most exciting part. A final word to one of the most talented thespian of his generation, Philip Seymour Hoffman, this picture is officially his swan song, not a high-water mark in his illustrious career, but at least it is a blockbuster to be seen by a massive audience, not a bad farewell, so R.I.P. Heavensbee.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

The first movie was the best of the bunch, this being the finale... to say it was disappointing in its execution would be an understatement. Too much focus is spent on special effects while attention to good substance is lost in this installment. In short, it's as if Michael Bay oversaw this tragic mess. The acting (If most of the dialogue is excluded) was not bad at all and clearly the costume designer had fun with these well put together looks. Characters were perfectly made up to look suitably roughed up. I appreciate that they weren't more focused on glamor in the action scenes than grit. The writing is still what I have a problem with and that is the meat of any film. The issues I have with this film would have turned a much better book worthy of the silver screen into a silly soap opera with guns. As it stands the book even as a y.a. novel needed improvement but the film could've done well what the book did poorly, enhancing it to be even more exciting.","16 out of 31 found this helpful.

And I think most of us are glad that it's finally over (apart from cinema owners probably, they made good money with this).And while it had it's moments (this one too), it does not really get a grip and the fascination it might be able to get. The potential is there, but apart from the teenage target audience (who get their triangle love story, two boys, one girl), there is something missing. Even if the ending tries to go out of its way and shed a bit of a different light on things.

At the end of the last movie, brainwashed Peeta Mellark almost kills Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) continue to use her for propaganda. She tries to convince loyalists from District 2 to surrender and is shot. She ignores Coin to join the attack on the Capitol. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) has laid deadly traps throughout the city. Coin is leery of Katniss' popularity and sends the still-troubled Peeta to join her. After getting caught in a trap, Katniss decides to lead the group on an unapproved mission to assassinate Snow.There are some good, some bad, but then we're done. I like Lawrence's conflicted Katniss and her unrelenting love for Peeta. That gave the movie its emotional heart. The best action is the underground chase. The other action scenes are a mixed bag. The first act needs an exciting action scene. There are a few too many speeches which grinds down the pacing. There are interesting political aspects of war which is continued well from previous movies. I have no problem with splitting this into two parts other than finding a better place to start the second part. This is good enough and a functional way to end the series.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was personally shocked at the way the writer wrapped up the whole thing.

The decision to break the final book into 2 installments is also quite baffling, as this was more a case to somewhat milk extra frames out of a story without adding anything to it.Without getting into spoiler territory, this film telegraphs far too many twists and has far too many endings, it sacrifices scope for quantity and quality for style.Terrifyingly, this film may be among the five worst in 2015.","88 out of 215 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Entertaining if you like the franchise, meh if you don't","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3364621/?ref_=tt_urv","Baardaap","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64086922/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 2015","First of all, I haven't read the books, so I'm basing my opinion solely on the movie itself in and out of the franchise.I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 movies in the franchise and for me it's difficult to say which is best, because both have their own flavor which made them very much enjoyable. Both of those movies had a gripping tension and would build up to the individual movies' climax. 'not knowing the books' (albeit aware it was a franchise) these first two movies had many surprises for me to keep me on the edge of my seat.The 3rd installment 'Mockingjay pt 1' was a big let down. Too stretched, no real tension-build-up. It has it moments, but after seeing it twice, the 2nd time I felt it was at least 1 time to many. And with Mockingjay part 2 I fear it'll suffer the same fate.Although much better than it's predecessor, part 2 lacks the tension-build-up from the first 2 movies. The start is quite slow without much shocking events and it's only half way the tension starts to build a little, only to be cut off by long interludes of dialogs in the attempt to restore the relationship by the two main characters and provide the viewer with some more background info.It has some brief intense action scenes, but always followed by a long periods of resting/talking. To me, this felt like a stark contrast with the first two movies, where even the tension seemed to rise during moments of rest.So instead of the overall tension gradually reaching a boiling point, it kinda comes and goes in this finale.The 'climax' doesn't really feel like a climax. I saw it coming from a mile away and then the movie goes on for another 20 minutes of finishing up loose story lines. The most exciting part of the movie is just over half-way of the movie, until the remainder of the group reaches the last safe-house before the supposed 'climax'. And when the climax happens it needs another 20 minutes to finish up. Which is simply too long and I started to expect some killer crazy ending I know Christopher Nolan would probably have done.After seeing Mockingjay part 1, I didn't have too high expectations for part 2 and due to my interest for the franchise and the characters I've come to know, I found this movie entertaining enough to not feel cheated out of my money.However, on its own, I'd give it only 6 stars: the movie takes too much time to tell its story and does not succeed in building up a tension towards an exciting finale. There are plenty of other sf/dystopian movies I would rather recommend.But if you love the franchise, you'll want to see how it ends and it'll do that job in an entertaining way, but I guess that's mostly thanks to Katniss.If you simply 'like' the first two Hunger Games movies, then I might suggest to simply read a spoiler to see how the franchise ends and just watch those first two movies again, because re-watching those is probably more entertaining and gripping than the last two.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

I am a true 'romantic' when it comes to movies or books. I get enough real life in real life. I felt absolutely dreadful after reading the book series, and still wish I had never read it. I rated the movie a 10 on the merit of them fixing the ending of the book series. If you are a classic romantic as I am, I strongly discourage anyone reading the last book in the series if they have that option, and just see the movie for closure. In this one case, ignorance is bliss. Even so, the movie is still an emotional meat grinder, so be warned. I'll let the other reviewers describe the effects, story and whatever else may be important to them. For myself, I needed the movie, but won't ever need to see it again, or waste money on the disk, even though I own thousands...literally. I wish to be entertained when I watch movies, not emotionally drained. For those that like that sort of thing, this series is definitely for you.","74 out of 143 found this helpful.

I mean, all that military personnel had to be trained to adopt to the overground conditions while being told, that they have to wait for the perfect time to start a revolution. How would they ever anticipate someone like Katniss appearing on screen to start it all, that isn´t very productive and that something like the ending of catching fire happens is pretty unlikely.And concerning catching fire: Wouldn´t it have been much easier when everyone, first of all katniss, was initiated to the plan from the beginning? Someone like Haymitch must have known about all of the plans, which had to be pretty detailed to begin with.

After the very disappointing Mockingjay part 1 in which nothing of big interest happened the conclusion could only be better and more satisfying. Hopefully it is but not as much as I would of wanted it to. I thought this movie was going to have a lot more action than it did. I thought this movie was going to be the big conclusion to the saga and the clash between the rebels and the capitol. And it sorta was..but there is still a lot of things in this movie that are boring. The majority of this films feels like a dramatic talking film and not this big fun blockbuster that it was supposed to be. The pacing in this movie is so slow and at times in this film it just felt like they where dragging this story that should of never been split in two films in the first place! There is simply not enough substance for two movies. When stuff happens though it is a lot of fun and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is once again excellent! She's definitely the highlight of the whole movie. Overral mockinjay part 2 is slightly better than part 1 but still not a good conclusion to this saga. The two first HG movies are still the best and this one is just slightly above average. You may enjoy it more than I did if your'e a hardcore fan of Hunger Games but still this was a disappointment.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

From the beginning of the franchise it consists of this Rebellion against the capitol. When the Rebellion finally wins and the capital has finally fallen. Nothing. Happens. Everyone literally just goes home. Katniss and Peeta return to I don't even know where because District 12 was completely destroyed, to have a family. WHAT!?

Action lovers are surely gonna love it as this movie in particular and series in general has lot of it. However the concept of districts and hunger games although appeared solid in the start but with the passing of the movies in the series, remained a unexplained chapter. The producers should have given more screentime to the part of exploring the districts instead of focussing on the Capitol and district 13.

Not enough. In comparison to the likes of Lord of the rings it's not even close. The basis for a 7 comes from the brutality. The honestly of war and the desire not to make everything turn out perfect. I liked that it tried to portray the darkness of human nature. Would I watch again. Probably not. The entire saga is probably a 6.75 if I'm being generous. The last 2 movies lose marks for being stretched further than Dolly Partons bra strap. Not terrible.

I realize that this film adapts the third section, ""The Assassin"", of the ""Mockingjay"" book. The concluding movie is great! Here's why.In ""The Hunger Games:Mockingjay Part 2"" , Katniss leads the thirteen districts of Panem in the rebellion against the Capitol, and where she aims to ultimately kill President Snow.I love how the characters are explored, with their good and bad sides. They don't come up as the two-dimensional heroes and villains. Their acts and emotions flesh them out better. If you're a fan who wants every scene in the book included, well, splitting the book into two movies allows that. Books are longer than movies, so not all parts of the book will be adapted for the film. The pacing is good. It's not this high-octane action film, but a war film that deals with both warring sides: District 13 and the Capitol. Action sequences and dramatic scenes blend well. Political themes are perfectly inserted in this sci-fi war film. This is a teen-powered franchise, and it's nice that teens can connect Panem to our real world, especially in countries where corruption, oppression, and terrorism reign like king.I appreciate the ending. It gives me mixed feelings about happiness, sadness, frustration, and anger.This is a refreshing entry in the sci-fi and YA genres. I highly appreciate this.","62 out of 119 found this helpful.

With the final chapter of the series having finally hit theaters, The Hunger Games film franchise comes to a very satisfying conclusion that puts a very nice punctuation mark on this whole enterprise.Mockingjay - Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off and really doesn't let off the gas until the finale. This is the final battle between the rebels of Panem and the Capitol and it does not disappoint. However, where a lot of movies could have gone and screwed around with the ending of the book to make it more Hollywoodified, this movie does not. For all four movies, the filmmakers of The Hunger Games franchise respected what Suzanne Collins wrote so much that they never really deviated from it. Too many book to film adaptations try to jazz up their source material by adding in unnecessary scenes that clearly show they don't trust what was already a bestseller on the page, and had the filmmakers done that here, it would have diluted the strong themes at work in the story. Thankfully, director Francis Lawrence and company managed to keep the spirit of the book in tact and surpass it with some truly phenomenal filmmaking craft.The Hunger Games books were already so cinematic in the way that they played out on the page, that the idea of adapting them into movies was a no-brainer, and Mockingjay - Part 2 accentuates why with ease. From the highly emotional musical score by the unsung hero of the franchise, James Newton Howard, to the always phenomenal cinematography and art direction, Mockingjay - Part 2 fires on all cylinders behind the scenes to elevate what was already great in the book, to something that really manages to milk out even more emotion than what the written word could. There's always going to be that argument in storytelling circles over which is the better form, literature or film, and I think here Mockingjay - Part 2 proves how film can be effective in ways that literature just never can. When you add together the haunting beauty of an image with the clever choices made in what we see and what we don't see in the editing, as well as the aural nature of the music and sound effects, film can be a storytelling medium unlike any other. There is still always going to be something about the written word that is special and meaningful, you can have more detail in certain areas (in particular in the thoughts and feelings of the characters) that you can never have in a film, but as is the case here, the things that makes films unique makes The Hunger Games franchise one of the best film franchises over the past decade. Of course, a large part of that success stems back to the exceptional cast of these films.From Julianne Moore to a final screen performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman, The Hunger Games movies have always been stuffed to the gills with great established actors. They all do great work as usual, but I don't think anyone quite realizes how much the filmmakers lucked up with the first film in locking down the main trio of Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth, before they all went through the stratosphere (in particular Oscar winner Lawrence). These three are just such good actors that it has always looked effortless for them, with Jennifer Lawrence once more affirming with this film that Katniss Everdeen was a once-in-a-lifetime role for her. The three stars all manage to round out the series with some of their finest work to date, allowing all of the many emotional gut punches that this film packs, really leave their mark.Now sitting here at the end of this whole thing, it really is astonishing to see how great The Hunger Games movies are as a whole. There is a consistency in tone and style that has bled over from one film to the next, which is something most other similar film franchises have struggled with. Director Gary Ross came in and set up the template with the first film, and then with these last three, Francis Lawrence took over and didn't change anything from Ross's vision, he just refined it and made it even more hauntingly beautiful. Then there is the political and social commentary beneath the lovable characters and high emotions that often get overlooked I feel by many who watch these movies and see them as just another action/adventure story. The ideas on government, war, and the media, that Suzanne Collins tried to say through the writing of the books, really carried over into all four films, allowing these films to be something more than every other young adult sci-fi dystopia. It is a rarity to see movies this thoughtful made by the Hollywood studio system and it is why I will greatly miss these yearly excursions to world of Panem.I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 a 10 out of 10!","78 out of 153 found this helpful.

I read some bad reviews on this last installment of ""The Hunger Games"" and I don't see what their problem with this film was. Not that part 1 wasn't good or anything, I thought this film was a little better than ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" simply because part 1 was just a set up for this film. Part 2 was actually better than what I thought it was going to be. This film displayed a great way to end a tetralogy of films that told the epic story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fight to kill President Snow (Donald Sutherland). In this last installment tensions start to rise between Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), which makes the plot a little more interesting. Because I'm a fan of action films, I think this film could have used a little more action but the way the story unfolded fully compensated for that. I thought it was a great film that ended the series very well.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)' is far more focused on moral ambiguity than anything else, which is good because this is its most interesting aspect. Though it suffers from being only part of its wider story, just as 'Part 1' did, it doesn't suffer too much when it comes to its pacing. 'Mockingjay' didn't need to be split into two parts and both of its adaptations prove that; it's easy to imagine a much better movie that successfully combines both simply by trimming the fat. This second part spends too long on its build-up and compresses its most important elements, but it provides a few entertaining and edge-of-your-seat action sequences to make up for this. It also touches on some really intriguing themes regarding revolution, power, war and politics. Even if these are never fully explored, and in some cases rushed, they're a nice inclusion that gives the affair quite a bit of weight. It arguably runs for one scene too long, but the ending is generally satisfying in its own downbeat way. Overall, this is a solid finish to its franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It does that one rare thing that most book to movie adaptions struggle with, which is improving upon the book. Although the Mockingjay book was still very good, it was the weakest book in the series. However, this movie adds more elements and some different scenes, while staying perfectly true to the book, making it, in my opinion, almost perfect. I am usually tough with reviewing book-movie films, so when I say that, I am being 100% honest. Now, onto reviewing the actual aspects of the film... Of course, with 3 Oscar winners in the cast, the acting was magnificent, and as expected, the talented Jennifer Lawrence , who plays Katniss Everdeen, makes this film so good. It's a shame that the academy usually doesn't look at films like this for best actress or actor in a leading role, because Lawrence's performance in this movie is Oscar caliber. Also, Josh Hutcherson gives a very powerful, unexpected performance as Peeta Mellark. The connection between Lawrence and Hutcherson seems so real. Secondly, the action and visuals are amazing in this film. The somewhat quiet, slow beginning leads to the the war-like action in the movie. I don't want to say anything else, other than GO SEE THIS MOVIE.","59 out of 113 found this helpful.

If this was just a standalone movie the plot, character development and action would all be considered pretty weak. But this was supposed to be a BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM rip.The characters are weak, we are given no insight whatsoever about the politics that are at play, the areana battle fights are few and far between, and manage to be both underwhelming and completely unbelievable. The worst part, however, was that the studio decided it was a good idea to simply recycle the REQUIEM Universe and just make a movie of the poorly conceived plots found there, rather than making something original.The only redeeming part of the movie were some really excellent and enjoyable visuals, especially on the cgi stuff. If you really don't know or care that much about BR2 you will probably enjoy this movie. Anyone who really likes Battle Royale 2 and cares about it will simply be less disappointed watching the American's attempts at plagiarism.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Mostly because they should have been ONE two hour long film. Unfortunately this series dies slowly because of Lions Gate money hungry choice to cut this story into two parts. And trust me, it SO does not need to be two parts. I think i could have read suzanne collins mockingjay book in the 4 and a half hours it took to watch both of these films. There is not enough plot, not enough substance to carry into two long films. It leaves for a whole lot of meandering and aimless scenes, horribly slow pacing and pointless feeling subplots. This film fails on a lot of fronts. It loses its interpersonal feel. I hate when very personal emotional film concepts suddenly become blown out into some industrial militirized unpersonal adventure. These films feel deeply inconsistent with its predecessors.Now all this bad being said. They still work. They are not BAD films. They surely stand as a stain on the series, but objectively they arent horrible films. They may be wrong, but they are not bad. I still find myself entertained and invested. They still hold great weight and brilliance into the look of tyranny, anarchy, revolution, doing whats right, chaos and order. I think this series is a brilliant first hand look at those principles. I mean BRILLIANT. That philisophical look, stands in these two films. The only problem is that it is buried a bit in a bunch of odd plot.I love this series and these films dont tear it down. Its a furstrating 41/2 hours but there is worse.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When we last left Katniss Everdeen and her friends, she was in the midst of planning an invasion of the Capitol city in District 1 to seize control of the country of Panam from the villainous President Snow who had just succeeded in brainwashing and turning the love of Katniss' life Peeta and turning into a slobbering lap dog of the capitol. Now, Ms. Everdeen and company soldier on towards The Capitol, destiny and a reckoning with President Snow.I really have to commend this movie on its faithfulness to the book. Director Francis Lawrence really did a great job of turning the book into an action packed adventure. The movie was well shot and the supporting cast did a really good job too especially Jena Malone and Michelle Forbes. The only qualms I have with the movie come from it's dramatic moments between Peeta and Katniss which all come off as hokey and overly manufactured to seem more dramatic than they should be. At the same time, other moments, that actually were naturally dramatic and probably should have been focused on are played a lot dryer than they should have been. Ultimately, I can't fault the movie too much because in actuality, the book played things out in the same way, and what am I going to do about that? Complain that the movie is too much like the book? On the whole, I liked a lot that this movie had to offer. The special effects and action sequences were very impressive and it was very loyal to the source material; so much so that the only things I didn't like about the movie were the same things I didn't like about the book. So if you liked the novels, I definitely recommend seeing the film but if you're just a movie watcher, you might be less satisfied.

I have no idea why this film has such bad reviews. Having been an avid follower of the series since it began I still went into this movie prepared for the worst and ready to be critical if need be (because of the reviews I had heard). Start to finish however I don't think I moved once. I genuinely think this is almost the best of the four, beaten only perhaps by the first for obvious reasons. I thoroughly appreciated the way the directors have kept the films to the book and Mockingjay PtII was no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely outstanding in this film and by all means deserves to be well recognized for her performance. The others also should not be forgotten, Liam Hemsworth really stepped out in this film as did many of the other supporting acts. For those complaining it was slow paced, I am not sure what you wanted. It kept me on edge the entire way through and was actually enhanced by the moments of quieter reflection that other ""action"" movies often lack. It contained immense depth, astounding cinematography and visual effects. Lastly, I think the ending was utterly beautiful. This book, this series, is somber. It's dark, its reflective and it alludes to a number of very serious themes. The directors dealt with this incredibly well. The film is a perfect ending to the series, my only disappointment is that it is the last.","73 out of 143 found this helpful.

Even if it is outside the games, they need still to complete challenges on the way, which wasn't made as interesting as in the games. One of the challenges was literally a wave of black oil, what from my point of view is very used and boring. It has been used in a dozen movies already. They rushed with the final and things went to fast after everything. It was good though that they did a good closing ending to end the story, I think the acting was best performed by the actors here, and nice scenography. Very nice pictures of the area they lived in and the nature locations they were in. But besides that, it was nothing more that impressed. Personally, president Snow isn't such a good villain, but he was better in the final part and more menacing. And lastly the action scenes. They fought some random monsters that was intended to be scary, but didn't look to good. It was sometimes entertaining fighting, and sometimes very boring. Obviously, I didn't expect much, and didn't get much either.

The performances, the action, the soundtrack and the production are remarkable. Jennifer Lawrence is still the best of the saga and it is a shame that this film as the final chapter leaves much to be desired.

This forth installment, is the second movie based on the third (and final) book: 'Mockingjay'. In this chapter Katniss Everdeen plots to assassinate President Snow, while the rebels also wage war on the Capitol. It once again stars the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence, and it costars Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Sam Claflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields, Elizabeth Banks and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (all reprising roles from earlier films). Francis Lawrence returned to direct, for the third time, and Peter Craig and Danny Strong wrote the screenplay (they also co- wrote the last chapter). I think it's a beautiful, and stunning, conclusion to an epic film series (one of my favorites in recent years). The story picks up right where the last one left off, with Katniss (Lawrence) recovering from being attacked by a brainwashed Peeta (Hutcherson). The rebels attack District 2, and take over it's weapons supply. They then continue a bloody assault on the Capitol. Katniss volunteers to assassinate President Snow (Sutherland), but President Alma Coin (Moore) doesn't want to risk losing her as a symbol (for the revolution); if she were to be killed. Katniss, being Katniss, does what she wants to do anyway; and joins the rebel forces. She's teamed, in a rebel squad, with Gale (Hemsworth), Finnick (Claflin), Cressida (Dormer), Peeta and others; in shooting propaganda footage of the brutal war.I'm a big fan of the entire series, and this installment definitely doesn't disappoint. It's unrelentingly dark, disturbing and violent (I definitely think it should have been rated R). It's also completely epic and very moving (I let more than a few tears go). The end is perfectly fitting; and the political commentary is brutal and brilliant. I love Jennifer Lawrence, and she once again gives one of the best performances of the year; but the rest of the cast is decent as well, and I've really come to love all of these characters (especially Woody as Haymitch). For me it was just as exciting, emotional and fun, as the conclusions to any epic sci-fi film series; most notably 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. It's definitely a 'must-see', and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0","57 out of 110 found this helpful.

"8","/10","True to the Book, Part 2 is an ""action"" packed Conclusion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358753/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2015","The four-toned call sounds through the distance, the three-fingered salute extending on the screen to unite a band of rebels in a dystopian era. No I've not gone crazy, I'm just talking about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Yes my friends tonight we discuss the epic final chapter of the epic Jennifer Collins' masterpiece that you've been waiting a year for. Tonight I review Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2. If you remember my last review, you'll know I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""epic"" part 1 with its heavy dialogue and overdramatic songs. Part 2 was supposed to bring the explosive action with Collins dark edge of dystopian war. The good news is that Mockingjay part 2 definitely had more excitement than its predecessor, it just took a while to get there. Like the book, this installment had our heroes walking through the desecrated landscape, and commenting how bad things are. All the walking and talking made me feel like I was back in a Peter Jackson production, alleviated only by some heavy laden special effects that stimulated our cast to yes you guess it run. Eventually we get to some actual excitement that brings that familiar sense of heart pounding horror and displays our warriors skills outside of complaining, despite some shaky camera work in the beginning. After that the action is tempered down to a level many ""action"" fans will like. At this point you might be thinking, ""I don't come for the action. I come for the story, drama, and relationships this movie has."" Well the directors heard you and filled most of this 137 minute time span with these qualities, integrating them with all the walking. Much of the drama centers on Katniss' indecisiveness as to whom she loves, which is only distracted by her lingering hatred of Snow fueling her desire of revenge. The inner turmoil of our characters is brought to full life in these moments, but I wasn't emotionally stimulated in this movie at least not by the characters problems. Unfortunately they didn't add flare for other important moments in this movie, leaving them rather dull. Oh well, can't say they didn't make this somewhat realistic. Story wise this film sticks to the book closely, but the team has made some alterations to fill in the book's vague moments. Some moments add a little more glory to the extras, though the hype of the characters was greatly over exaggerated such as the best shooters unable to hit anything. In addition some of the alterations (especially those at the end) were not really needed and only dragged out the film further. Before you dislike the review hear me out. I get these scenes were to illustrate Katniss' time of healing as she accepts and copes with all that has transpired in the trilogy that the book fortunately glossed over. That didn't mean I wanted to see more bouts of overdramatic screaming (which I hadn't gotten enough of at this point) and verbal animal abuse. At least the epilogue was more fulfilling compared to what the book did.In terms of production quality, the movie is certainly impressive. Our film crew was able to design a war torn world that was savage and unforgiving, just like war. While I didn't feel for the characters in this movie, the cinematography certainly brings out the horrors of the Hunger Games. While the action wasn't what I had fully hoped for, the special effects are still an incredible visualization of Collins work, something truly worthy of the Game Masters especially those mutts. The added movie references, whether intentional or unintentional, were also a nice touch to maximize the darkness of this film. As for the acting, Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch as always. She plays Katniss as strongly as ever while still adding more depth to an already deep character, despite playing the same role she always plays (an angry woman). Josh Hutcherson surprisingly impressed me this time, managing to make Peta not as annoying as he was in the book. His portrayal of mentally disturbed was well done, and surprisingly kept in balance to make you feel for the guy. The other cast members did a great job (mostly), and fit well with each other to make a team, even if they took a back seat to the two leading roles. Mockingjay Part 2 ends the series on a good note. It stuck to the book fairly well, brought the world to life, and had impressive special effects. I can't say it's as action packed as everyone says, unless walking counts, but it still had an edge that got my heart pumping. It is definitely worth a visit to the theater, as if you would miss it, and I feel many fans will enjoy this fitting conclusion to the epic trilogy, or quadrilogy in this case. My scores for MockingJay are:Adventure: 8.0Movie overall: 7.0-7.5","30 out of 54 found this helpful.

The previous film was a huge let down and I hoped that this film would rise to the same level as the second film, the strongest installment in the series. The rebels have now for real taken up the fight against Capital, and the rebel leader Coin, played by Julianne Moore, tries in every way to control Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence. Katniss defies orders and travel to the front on her own mission to kill Snow. With her is her faithful brother in arms and love interest Gale, played by Liam Hemsworth. Also joining the mission is the brainwashed and now dangerous Peeta, played by Josh Hutcherson. Katniss is also in love with Peeta, despite the fact that he now tries to kill her after Snow tortured him. Triangle drama deluxe.I expected a great rebellion against Snow and Capital. Battles in the city with Katniss at the front as the Mockingjay. Unfortunately we get neither because instead the focus lies mainly on Katniss' own side mission. I understand the idea and why we get a smaller more intimate environment to deeper explore the triangle drama between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. But still, we barely even get that. Gale has suddenly developed questionable moral ideals and Peeta can't control himself and sometimes tries to kill the members of the group. Katniss, the reluctant heroine continues just like in the earlier films, to doubt her own strength and self-confidence. Wasn't it in Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 that she should have gotten over that and finally understood the leader she truly is?All of the Hunger Games films are supposed to belong together as one series. Still, I think a lot of stuff is left strangely unexplained or entirely up to the audience to guess for themselves. What does the entire Hunger Games world really look like? I don't recall ever seeing an entire map or overview of the world. Is it only possible to get around by train, or travel to the capital in them and why didn't they focus more on a joined attack from the rebels? I guess the novels explain this further but the films should be able to sort this out better than this. Towards the end we get a lot of endings and some sort of twist that unfortunately doesn't save the film. The weak spot of the Hunger Games series is also its strongest, the heroine Katniss. She is supposed grow to during these four films and become the symbol and leader that she actually is. Instead we get a lot of crying scenes and worrying about either Gale or Peeta. Now that we actually have a strong female heroine on the big screen, why can't she just like all the other male heroes get to take up space, become powerful, determined and shoulder the part as a true leader?In conclusion I think The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2, is barely passable. There were definitely opportunities to make the film better through more change and development in the characters, more focus on the politics and how the world actually works and also gather the story in one place or simply tell it parallelly through editing so we actually know what's happening in other places than where Katniss is at.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

I immediately read books one and two (audio booked them actually) and really enjoyed both of them. After seeing Jennifer Lawrence in the first movie, I was so taken with her magnificent portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, that I very deliberately decided i would not partake of the final novel in the trilogy, but would instead put all of my chips on the last two films. All of the first three hunger games movies were very well done and quite entertaining. Jennifer Lawrence brought a wonderful authenticity to the staring roll and the supporting cast was genuinely entertaining and gave top notch performances as well. Which brings us to the final installment. Rare indeed is the story that can cleverly build upon its earlier successes. The Matrix couldn't do it, nor could the old Planet of The Apes franchise or the Jaws films. These series left viewers feeling very disappointed and wistful for what might have been. Happily for fans of The Hunger Games series, the final chapter ties the previous three films into an exceptionally satisfying package that really made me glad that I had devoted my scarce free time to this film series over the last few years. I will not provide any spoilers to my review, suffice it to say that it unfolds like some unexpectedly beautiful flower that will really have you saying ""holy s**t!"" when it is fully revealed. There are absolutely positively NO loose ends by the conclusion. That said, I will say that I was truly delighted by the way the story utterly surprised me. I think the last time I was so taken aback by a plot twist was the movie ""The Sixth Sense."" So go and see this movie after your Thanksgiving dinner, and you can have two very satisfying experiences!","67 out of 132 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favour","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3359595/?ref_=tt_urv","Tyson14","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54260857/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2015","Well, here we are. Three-and-a-half years and four movies later, ""The Hunger Games"" franchise has finally reached its end. It's been quite the journey as we've followed the Girl on Fire through the 74th Hunger Games, the Quarter Quell, and down into the depths of District 13. Now, the fearless yet emotionally shattered Katniss Everdeen prepares to take on the Capitol in this breathtaking finale. While the ultimate question surrounding the decision to split ""Mockingjay"" into two films still lingers, there is no denying that ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" is an emotionally satisfying and relentlessly dark conclusion to this explosive franchise.While Part 1 of the film served to set up the revolution of the districts against the Capitol while interweaving some brilliant political propaganda, Part 2 focuses entirely on the fight against President Snow. We follow Katniss and her fellow soldiers - known collectively as Squad 451 - through the booby-trapped streets of the Capitol as our heroine sets out to fulfil her self-proclaimed mission of assassinating the ruthless dictator. Part 2 is not short of action in any sense of the word and the plot is gripping from start to finish. Additionally, the subtler and more emotional subplot detailing the rehabilitation of Peeta Mellark was brilliantly executed. That being said, the moment the movie starts, we are thrown right into the action. It's almost as if someone hit pause back in November 2014 and waited a full year to resume the film. There is no ""ease in"" to the story, so if you haven't seen Part 1, watch it first As per the usual standard for this franchise, the acting is nothing short of incredible. Jennifer Lawrence continues to carry the weight of the entire series on her shoulders and her excellent portrayal of Katniss' emotions helps the viewers feel more connected to the plot. She continues to embody Katniss' emotional conflicts so superbly that there's no questioning that without Lawrence, the franchise would not be as good as it is. Of course, the supporting cast is as strong as ever, yet two actors really stand out in Part 2: Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Donald Sutherland as President Snow. Hutcherson does such a fantastic job of portraying Peeta's internal conflict following his torture in the Capitol, especially as he works on ""figuring Katniss out."" He masterfully relays Peeta's emotions as he strives to keep his disturbed mind balanced, and these scenes prove to be some of the most emotionally gut-wrenching scenes in the entire series. Sutherland, on the other hand, fully embraces Snow's character as he slowly slips into delirium over his obsession with killing Katniss (think Voldemort from ""Harry Potter"" but in the form of an evil Santa Claus). His portrayal of the dictator is so terrifyingly good that it continually sends shivers down the viewers' spines.Over the years, the production value of the franchise has progressively improved; as such, Part 2's production is nothing short of perfection. The cinematography is truly breathtaking and helps capture the emotional punch of the film wonderfully. The visual effects are top-notch (for perhaps the first time across the entire franchise), as are the costumes and character designs. The editing was so masterfully done that the end result is a film that is intense, gripping, and dark in tone from start to finish. James Newton Howard's score for the film is simply amazing and is easily his best ""Hunger Games"" score. He expertly weaves in themes from the previous three films while simultaneously introducing new melodies that only elevate the tone and emotions of the film. While ""The Hanging Tree"" (Part 1's stand-out song) only returns in instrumental form, director Francis Lawrence was able to coax Jennifer Lawrence into singing yet another song from the franchise that Howard worked expertly into his ""Hunger Games Suite"" that plays over the credits and will genuinely surprise and please fans.Now, to close out my review, it is finally time to answer the million- dollar question: Was a two-part adaptation for ""Mockingjay"" truly necessary? Last year, in my review for Part 1, I said that I was still unsure whether the split was necessary, yet Part 1 held the potential to prove it was a good move. However, after seeing Part 2, and considering the ""Mockingjay"" adaptation as a whole, the simple answer to this burning question is this: No, a two-part adaptation was not necessary. Part 1 could have (and should have) been easily streamlined into a 40-minute film and slapped onto Part 2 to create a singular, three-hour film. While that is rather long to sit in a theatre, it would achieve the same effect that ""Mockingjay"" was going for without all the unnecessary fluff that Part 1 and segments of Part 2 contain. Unlike ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", which was split because the story really demanded it, it is sadly evident that ""Mockingjay"" was split purely for greed. That being said, Francis Lawrence handled the adaptations so brilliantly that both parts of ""Mockingjay"" are fantastic in their own right and both should be held with high regard.Ultimately, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" brings this dystopian film franchise to a brilliant conclusion. While 2013's ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" still holds the crown for being the best film in the series in terms of the adaptation and the pacing, ""Mockingjay Part 2"" is the most satisfying of the four films and it sends the franchise off with a proper farewell.Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favour.","25 out of 44 found this helpful.

The final Hunger Games! Was it worth the wait? Read on to find out! I remember watching the very first Hunger Games an just remembering that it was all so decent, and yet, worth watching! The whole series is all in order just like the Harry Potter series. They both bare a resemblance: Everyone wanting to stay alive and fighting to save themselves. Only difference is that one has bow and arrow and the other has a magic wand! Anyway, let's get on with this review! The movie follows exactly where ""MockingJay"" part 1 left off, Katniss Everdeen is out to put an end to this war President Snow has started once an for all. This mission/game is to kill President Snow! This movie has it all...Drama, humour, action, Horror and even politics! The cinematography was just brilliant. The direction by Francis Lawrence was excellent. The acting is top notch, especially by Jennifer Lawrence.There are many scenes that just completely take your breath away. Such as (probably my best scene) when they unleash the Mutants to attack the team in the underground tunnels, Katniss and Peeta's relationship and trust for each other. You just never knew (because of Peeta's memory) what he might do next! This film does bare some significance to politics and how they are controlling what we do and how we can do nothing about it. That message, I thought was so true to the way we live. Does it really take a girl like Katniss to save the day? If so, bring it on! The twists and turns keep piling up and you never get sick of them! All I will say is that this movie ends with a bang. If you have read the novels you would have known how it ends. But let me lastly point out that this is Jennifer Lawrence's best performance yet! She just keeps getting better and better. This is no stopping this girl! My (autistic) hats off to her! All in all, if you loved the other Hunger Games and you loved the novels...this one will not disappoint. But it does get boring in some parts. be on the look out for that! 4/5 stars","29 out of 53 found this helpful.

To be clear, the film is entertaining, and fans of the previous films will surely be happy, but just know the franchise clearly peaked with Catching Fire. The Franchise has since bloated it's final film for no other good reason, than to make extra money. All-in-all Mockingjay Part 2 is action packed, often entertaining, but falls victim to a somewhat weak script.Mockingjay Part 2 gives us what Mockingjay Part 1 didn't, more action. Mockingjay Part 2 reverts back to the formula that made Catching Fire so great, while continuing the story of Mockingjay Part 1. By that I mean that the film gives fans a good mix of entertaining action sequences mixed with romance. However, at this point the romantic triangle feels so forced it's more of a distraction, than a sub-plot.The action helps make the film entertaining, but what really makes the film is Jennifer Lawrence's commitment to anchoring the films. At the this point Lawrence has made Katniss Everdeen an extension of herself, to the point that she embodies the character. The grim tone, mixed with the meandering story make Mockingjay Part 2 entertaining from start to finish. However, the film does contain some major weaknesses, especially in it's script.While the story is full of twists and turns, it's still a little to bloated, as it would have been better if the studio had just made Mockingjay into 1 movie. The dialogue, is inconsistent and often too on-the-nose, with characters delivering out of place exposition. While the story has a very good plot twist near the end of the film, it doesn't handle it well, as the story just jumps all over the place in the end. The film also offered very little new substance to the franchise, in the end it would have been a great finale to a singular film.Through all of it's issues, Mockingjay Part 2 helps the franchise come to a satisfying end. Mockingjay Part 2 improves on what Mockingjay Part 1 did, and is probably the better film, but still isn't as good as Catching Fire. The film is thoroughly entertaining, and is full of action despite it's script's weaknesses. In the end Mockingjay Part 2 is a good way to spend 2 hours, and is a good ending for the Hunger Games franchise.","23 out of 41 found this helpful.

But for this series, lucky to be the first film to get away with a big hit, mainly because of teen audience.Honestly, I liked the 2nd film very much, but the third movie was a letdown, especially this one was utterly useless. Because the 80% of the story ended in the previous part and in this, it was a necessary finishing touch with an unnecessary lag.Might have been a better film if the 'Mockingjay' was a single movie. Nowadays there are many strange ways to make money, the art of storytelling in the movies is slowing vanishing while adapting a book for the silver screen by splitting them into two and/or three. This culture has to stop, the book fans are enjoying the original masterpiece, while film fanatic like me is suffering a setback. In this 2 hour long movie there are lots of scenes that simply wastes time to bring sufficient runtime.Due to the circumstances that I mentioned, the flow was disturbed, mainly because of the release gap between the last two films. Emotions are not felt, actions were weakened, you could only recognise it rushing towards the conclusion. And that section should have been the ultimatum, what comes later is what we call 'happily ever after or the other way' should have been very brief, but in here it was not. Like a new beginning of a new story, it went on too far.From the screenwriter's perspective that has to be done. I had seen the split movies like 'Twilight', 'Harry Potter' and others, but this one was the worst among them. Even if you try all the four movies in a single sitting, the first two will be the best you can get and the followed two would surely disappoint you because of the slowness.5/10","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's all fantastically directed by Francis Lawrence, who has really taken this series in his stride, and it makes for so much excitement. The action isn't just cool and fun to look at, though, it manages to still fill you with fear for these main characters; there's so much suspense, and genuinely tangible danger, that it's impossible to predict what's about to happen next.It's a film that's absolutely jam-packed with thrilling action from start to finish, but it still retains the brains that separate it from the other 'Young Adult' franchises. The political situation here is more dire than ever, but it presents the events of this film as if it's true history. The screenplay (and the book it's based on) is so fantastically written, with such brilliant attention to detail that makes it a war film that is completely and utterly convincing every step of the way, and the story remains totally unpredictable right up to the thrilling finale, and although the final ending is a little long-winded (similar to Return Of The King), it's still an astonishing watch.Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is an astonishing finale to this series, not just because of its thrilling action, but its ability to tell an intelligent, convincing, tense and very dramatic story that you just don't get to see on a regular basis.","33 out of 62 found this helpful.

It really was a disappointing ending to a decent franchise because I was waiting for the big showdown between Snow and Katniss. The whole running around in the dark concept, whilst trying to get to the palace, also became quite boring after a while and I personally thought that Katniss was quite useless when it came to planning and executing the whole plan. It was basically Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who ran the whole mission but as Katniss was the ""face of the people"", she got all the credit but she never would have survived if it wasn't for her trusty squad, who done all of the hard work. Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), also got on my nerves because he didn't know if he was coming or going most of the time. I did like the black tar looking substance scene but the battle with the strange looking monsters was hard to follow because it was filmed in darkness, so I didn't know who was who. Anyway, after such a big build up, it definitely was a disappointing ending to the whole franchise and I missed the Katniss song, ""The Hanging Tree"", which I couldn't stop singing after watching Mockingjay 1. Disappointing!Round-Up: I personally think that this movie made so much money at the box office because of the big build up from Mockingjay 1, which promised a great showdown between Snow and Katniss. With Hunger Games: Catching Fire, making nearly $900million at the box office and Mockingjay 1 making $800million, there obviously was something missing in this movie which didn't go down to well with audiences around the world. With that aside, it definitely was a successful franchise which has made Jennifer Lawrence, 25, a superstar and with the X-Men franchise and an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook in 2013, she has definitely had a great run since her career started in 2008. Anyway, the movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, 45, who started his career in making pop videos for Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Green Day and Britney Spears and then he turned his talents to the movie world with Constantine in 2005 and I Am Legend in 2007. After making a Lady Gaga video in 2009, he directed Water For Elephants and then he started his run of Hunger Games movies, with Catching Fire in 2013 and both Mockingjay movies, which were made back to back. Maybe if he had concentrated on this movie as an individual project, it would have been better! It's still worth a watch because it is the final instalment of a successful franchise but if I would have seen the final product in the cutting room, I would have suggested a rewrite.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $655millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/sci-fi movies starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, Jeffrey Wright, Stanley Tucci and Gwendoline Christie. 4/10","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

To be perfectly honest, I didn't care for the Mockingjay book so I only briefly skimmed through. But this movie is still bad in a different way. 1. Yeah it's not boring, instead it's filled with JUMP SCARES! I find myself asking: ""Am I watching a horror movie?"" 2. Katniss is too lucky. Every time someone else dies except for her. I also find her obsession to kill Snow ridiculous. Yeah he's sick and not gonna last. Why not wait? 3. Snow is dumb. He thought Katniss was dead from the explosion without even bothering to count the number of bodies? 4. Excessive acting by Peeta and Katniss. Both spat saliva when shouting/crying. Wow. 5. The awkward/weird love triangle. Katniss seems like she is flirting with both guys. 6. Katniss' arrows never run out. She's like Legolas. However, I admit I like the death scenes. Finnick, Primrose had the audience in tears.

From my point of view I can say that the first part definitely justified it and with this second part I can say that three minuets into the movie I wasn't even thinking of this as a second part, I was just watching a movie that motivated the presence of almost every scene.I cannot believe that the first movie which I really hated because of stupid world building, storytelling and tonal problems has evolved into a film this good and this breathtaking. The craft behind this picture is really palpable and passionate to the point that as I said it is a lesson. A lesson for what, you ask? A lesson for CGI correct use, a lesson for character motivation, a lesson for storytelling pace, a lesson for truly impactive and motivated action and a lesson about cinema, about justifying the money spent on this and giving back to the audience everything they wanted to experience, this is truly a film that respects its audience.If I hadn't seen them myself I could not believe how well the actions scenes are done. Starting just from the set-pieces which are frantically breathtaking, to the camera work which is the total opposite of what the first one is. You always understand what is going on and it always pays off. Moreover the director really doesn't give you a chance to breathe once sh*t starts hitting the fan and he carries you through the whole movie with brilliant moments. Francis Lawrence lets many situations breathe, he gives a beat, he builds suspense and tension and releases them really slowly to the point where sometimes I couldn't take the rush of adrenaline anymore. This is amazing stuff, trust me.But the brilliance doesn't end there, the characters all have fascinating archs and very good performances, Lawrence, Southerland, Moore and Hoffman definitely deserve to be mentioned above all, their commitment to this is admirable and it pays off in some performance moments of perfection. The characters also act as the foundations for what the film thematically covers, which is stunning both in the variety of it both in the way in which it covers them. Action scenes and war scenes become integrating part of these, to the same level of dialogue scenes and mold perfectly into what is at times a deeply dark look at society.Now, lets interrupt the party for a second. The film deserves to be called out for a couple of things. Firstly, a messy starting twenty minutes which shift tone and pace a little too much. Once the film starts to get going it totally transforms in what I described above, but those first bunch of scenes was a little sloppy. Moreover, the love triangle thing is just useless and unmotivated, contrary to what the rest of the film is. Every time it is brought up (not many) my whole enthusiasm dropped. Finally, yes it is slightly overlong.Yet, fortunately it dropped only to be picked up again by the fantastic film we have here. No matter if you read the books or not, I would even say no matter if you've seen the other films: this is a movie which justifies to itself every scene thanks to great work by all the talented people involved.","40 out of 78 found this helpful.

This time, the action begins almost mid-scene, like we'd merely broken for a commercial and not held off for a year of unrelated pursuits. I felt like I needed a ""Previously on The Hunger Games"" refresher, because it's just assumed you're going to remember everything and I, with my sliding mid-life memory banks, did not. Having read the books before the first film, those recollections were already weak and I'm still not entirely sure I associated the right names with the corresponding faces. But I'm getting away from the point, and that's this: Part II is, quite literally, an act and a half of drama. It's also quite hollow, and maybe one thing has more than a little to do with the other. Without a third set of titular Games, it lacks the sense of adventure and originality that added such color to the first two films and settles in as a drab, depressing war march. A shame, since the visuals - a weakness in those early efforts - have suddenly become quite good. The world sprouts with beautifully absurd touches of life (or, at least, there's a sense that it did before the landscape was literally drenched in a viscous black goop) and the larger set pieces have a great sense of magnitude to them. A pity, then, that the main players have all been beaten to the turf and can't muster so much as a smirk, even in their storybook endings. A grim, dazing, unhappy concluding chapter that, while technically adept, is both scatterbrained and railroaded to its last breath.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'll want to see the movies when they come out, and I read the first book. But, what I have to say is while I like Harry Potter, but am not a big fan of it. Some years ago, the big movies coming out that were from a novel were the Harry Potter movies. Since those movies have all come out, The Hunger Games has been the newer movie franchise based off of a series of novels. Will 39 Clues ever come out?I've enjoyed reading Harry Potter, though not my favorite book and I definitely think it's overrated. I mean I think J.K. Rowling deserves money and credit for writing the series, but I think it's strange that she's one of the richest women in England behind the queen just for writing Harry Potter. Although, I think her story is inspirational it just goes too far. There are better stories.While more people probably know about Harry Potter than Dragon Ball Z, I'd say DragonBall Z is a better story and more people seem to talk about Dragon Ball Z. Japan has also had other shows that are better stories including a T.V. show which used the action footage from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers you can now own on disk which is also a better show than the Power Rangers called Zyuranger. in 1988, Japan also had a T.V. show which is probably better known in Brazil that I feel is way underrated and should be better known is a show called Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya. I also feel like 39 Clues is a better faster paced story and more entertaining and easier to understand than Harry Potter. My favorite movie, which my eyes get glued to each time I turn it on is called Junior High Spy. I also like Earth To Echo which I feel is underrated. Now, I'll conclude and write my review about a story that's better than Harry Potter and it's Hunger Games.This movie was awesome, and it's a good way to end the series. I'd say it's the best of the 4 movies in the series. I wanted to see the movie, but I didn't think much of it. I had a better experience than I thought I'd have. This was way better than MockingJay Part 1, as I saw that and forget a lot of what happened in it. It seems like a lot of us didn't care for Part 1, and were ready for this one. I am sure you will like this one, especially if you like Hunger Games. Just because you didn't care for Part 1 doesn't mean you should skip part 2.So, what makes this movie great? When we hear Hunger Games, I think most of us think of the actual games in the arena, to see who can survive the longest? In these last two movies, it's different. These movies seem to focus on the effects of war and a corrupt government. The action from this movie is totally astounding, and will definitely keep you entertained. To me, the action seemed like action you'd see in another movie, and not Hunger Games which makes this movie that much better. My favorite scene would have to be with the mutts. That scene looked like something you'd see in a shooting video game. It was also a pretty scary scene. Something you wouldn't expect to see in a Hunger Games movie. It was just cool to see the characters we know from Hunger Games in this type of action!One other thing I ought to say, is while I don't know too much about Hunger Games, I believe it's supposed to take place in the future. It's interesting how some scenes look modern/futuristic. But, the scenes we see of their houses in District 12 those houses look like they're from the early 20th Century. I don't know why?This movie is definitely worth seeing. You'll have a fun action/scary movie experience while seeing it. It was a good enough movie that I'll give it a 10/10.","56 out of 114 found this helpful.

These characters have never known the districts; they have never known hard work or suffering. Their characters all seem like they were raised in 90's American empire suburbia where their parents told them they were great. Everyone is so concerned about their feelings, forgetting that they are at war. All of the male characters look like they just came from ten hours at the spa. A few ""adult"" characters provide a semblance of structure and order, but it seems more like a group of college chaperones with the focus quickly diverted back to the emotional concerns of self-obsessed youth. The Jennifer as a media tool gets old to the viewer even more than it starts to get old to her character. I did like the intrigue of Coin needing to control, and seeing The Mocking Jay as a threat. That was well portrayed. If only as an excuse to have Peter back on the scene which would otherwise be completely inconceivable. No one has the resources to dump 100,000 gallons of oil into a large courtyard with multiple areas of egress.Once they embark on their underground mission, the pace picks up and the so does the realism.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's action packed, suspense, awesome visual effects and a great emotional conclusion to a great series. Francis Lawrence has outdone himself, the visual representation of the book to the movie was on point! Suzanne Collins thank you for creating an idea that became a worldwide phenomenon. What I like most about The Hunger Games is that it represents what our world is currently going through, how society is falling apart, and how much conflict and war there is in this world. The series is sends out a message towards everyone that no matter who you are or where you came from, the courage of one can change the world. I felt that this movie didn't need to be split into two parts but who cares to be honest. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes action and suspense. Overall, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 is the best movie out of the entire series, the best movie of 2015, and the best ending to an uplifting saga that no one will ever forget. **10/10**","36 out of 70 found this helpful.

The first movie was at least kind of interesting (though I didn't like the violence against children which unfortunately as continued throughout the entire series). I did like some of the side characters better than both the leads. The second film was okay and the third should have been the last as there was nothing in Part 2 that wasn't predicted from Part 1 and couldn't have been included. I agree this some of the critics; I didn't care who Katniss ended up with. I did care about the whole political message but again it was poorly delivered.","37 out of 109 found this helpful.

It gives the series a sense of finality. Jennifer Lawrence, as she always is, is a stunningly talented actress and gives Katniss emotional depth. Francis Lawrence directs this film with precision and never lets the adventurous, large set pieces swamp his story and themes. The consequences and effects of war are fully realised in this final chapter. We see how an unconventional heroine turns the tide of war and turns a nation into an army of fighters. The themes proposed in the first three films are fully expanded upon and solidified.The action is grand, scorchingly intense and Francis Lawrence really pushes his 12A certificate to the absolute max. While the deaths are bloodless, the brutality of the war in this chapter is expressed with mastery. The only issue I have with the film is that the first 10 minutes are a bit slow, with some feeling as if left overs from part 1 (a film I still enjoyed). Overall, a superb end to the series. A must see.","65 out of 135 found this helpful.

This is not your usual sci-fi-3D-CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster. This movie is really, but really dark and it's a good thing because the plot is really serious. The movie promotes itself as an epic action- heavy finale but it's not really that way. It's more like a war drama. If you're looking for action you're at the wrong movie because there are like 5 action scenes in the entire movie. Other than that, the movie is really quiet and there isn't much intensity between action scenes. It's actually really, really quiet. You don't even hear music that much. The movie is pretty good and realistic (except for some extremely toned down scene to keep PG-13 rating) but the pacing is way off. At one moment it's really fast paced and then, again, it goes extremely slow. I already said in Part 1 review that this would be incredible as one movie and here you see the wasted potential even better. This movie is better than Part 1, probably even better than the first movie in the series, but nowhere near as great as Catching Fire, because that was absolutely amazing! This movie is very well shot (especially the mansion part) and is really faithful to the book and that's a big plus (See, The Scorch Trials?), acting is terrific and Lawrence gives one of the best performances in the entire career and gives her best in that one really emotional scene with the cat. Some people may call it overacting but I think the scene was so powerful and I couldn't stand people laughing at that part. And the scene I liked the most in the entire franchise is the execution scene. So powerful, so intense, so emotional, shocking, well-shot and well-acted (I wad blown away by Donald Sutherland in that scene). One more thing that surprised me is Josh Hutcherson's acting. He gave probably the best performance in his career. While it's not the best, fans will enjoy it and it has all the fan favorite moments and is a satisfying conclusion.","21 out of 39 found this helpful.

A circus of flaws, really. But as a viewer who never read the books and who became hooked on the first film during a chance viewing, I will say, shame on whoever allowed this film to be made. And shame on me for watching it.Let me just say for those who haven't seen it - nothing actually happens in this film. The previous 3 films (well mainly 1 & 2) lay a solid framework and create a brutal, yet very believable reality. By the end of the 2nd film you cannot help but stand in the corner of Everdeen and co and watch on as they work to bring down the crushing authority responsible for the 'games'. But unfortunately the director does not want us to experience this triumph. Film 3 is a bunch of filler, whilst film 4 (Mockingjay Part 2) is simply a lullaby.There is no redemption for the majority of the characters. Character arcs get completely left out. Wars happen that you never actually see happen. Fear is ongoing (apparently) but all you ever see is Donald Sutherland on a Television screen spouting his mantra. The Hunger Games/Catching Fire build up tremendous momentum.. but the Mockingjay films are there to sap it all up. But be careful, because this film will sap you up too.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Their is much less dialogue in this film and much more action, and when dialogue does come it all has a meaning. This movie starts out slow and builds up to a epic conclusion. The film picks off shortly after Mockingjay Part 1, and as the war in Panem escalates, the rebels soon turn to the ruling power in the capitol. The start of the film is generally well received and is a bit slow but focuses more on the emotional impact of the war rather than the action, but as the weapons are turned to the center of the country, the action is jam-packed. The action is fuelled by the breathtaking and quite emotional performances of stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. This movie is a great action packed ride and is very nerve racking. It does lack on screenplay in some parts where is is rushed but makes up for that with the rest of the film. If you are looking for a good, quite emotional, blockbuster, and cinematic masterpiece of the year, this film is for you.","62 out of 133 found this helpful.

The first two were alright, then they decided to pull a Battle Royale 2 (though Battle Royale 2 actually pulled it off, so far nothing else has come close) for the final book. The Twilight franchise was awful to begin with, The Hobbit franchise I could see making two solid movies (not three mediocre ones), and now The Hunger Games. The first part was pretty weak, and I did not enjoy it that much. At least after seeing the first part of the Battle Royale 2: Requiem finale I knew there was going to be TONS more to look forward to, but for this I just do not see it being anything better than a disappointment. The third book was the weakest too, basically almost a desperate attempt to make it as thrilling as the others, which I find really plausible for the movie to do too. Also, some certain characters are going to die, though a lot of them, one in particular, has had little to no development (but that's not the movies' fault, the books were the same way) which will make their death very awkward for me. I'm already picturing myself in the theater looking around while on the screen the character's death is taking a lot of screen time and I'm thinking ""This really has no impact on me whatsoever "". Right now the only thing going for it is that it's got decent actors.

The books were telling an antiwar story, they were saying that government is complex, and they were warning that the new boss is almost always as bad as the old boss.Furthermore the books tell us that you cannot win or even try to win a revolution without suffering great loss. And it warns us that warriors are scarred forever. Especially that last comes through terrifically in the movie. I'm glad they didn't pretty up the tragedy that bothers so many teens who read the books because without that we really don't learn the lesson, and that is Katniss's sacrifice really is not worth it. Not a personal level. But oh my gosh, was this movie slow. 35 minutes and I began hitting the ""jump ahead 10 seconds"" button. Three times there were scenes of her walking slowly – and I mean slowly – while the camera circled around her. I hit the 10 second button 10 times in each case and she was still walking. That's stupid. Cut out all that padding and combine the last two movies into the one movie it should've been, and this would be far better.instead of a climactic battle, it is more like the mindful walking tour of Panem's capital city","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The cinematography and the depiction of the characters, particularly katniss Everdeen and Peeta, were nicely done making for a great ending. The opening scene started right where the previous movie left off. Through out the movie, there is a good bit of violence as the capitol fights the districts, but there are some interesting twists you may not see coming if you have not read the books. Coming from a Christian perspective, it is easy to see how depraved the people in the districts and capitol are and without God and how devastating circumstances can get. The people in the capitol appear to have everything, but they are blindly following a leader who, in essance, does not really care for their well-being. Similarly, people everyday, who seem to have everything, in reality have nothing if they do not have God. Overall, this was a good movie with various Christian undertones saturated in through out this movie.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

This was split into two movies to sell tickets, not to add depth or whatever the studio makes up this week. By giving this a rating above let's say 4/10, you're saying that you're fine with this greedy behavior.

It's a heck of a journey, the tense action worth the wait. The downside is you'll see every twist and turn before it happens. Jennifer Lawrence truly stands alone. Her acting feels genuinely from the heart. Hutcherson and Hemsworth, in their awkward love triangle, can barely touch her (metaphorically speaking). One last rallying cry from Katniss is the last straw. Her voice cannot pull off those great speeches, and quite frankly there was enough of them in Part 1. Yes we know you're the Mockingjay, get over it. All four of The Hunger Games films stay true to the book. Everyone plays their part well (although some are short changed).

Jennifer Lawrence really pulled her emotions here and kept you watching on screen the whole time.

"10","/10","A Critique of How Truth is Distorted Through the Fisheye Lens of Media in Climax to Hunger Games series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3448847/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2016","Although it's not referenced in the films, a fisheye lens is a wide angle camera lens which produces a wide panoramic or hemispherical image, so named because the lens appears similar to the eye of a fish. Images caught through the fisheye lens produce beautiful scenes at the price of creating distortion. This is the essence of the Hunger Games series. Edited footage of a news story, a reality show, and media-produced films or videos are filtered through editing processes in which certain aspects are accentuated over others for dramatic effect and/or propaganda intent. In short, it's a analogous to the fisheye lens.In this final chapter of the Hunger Games film series (the last book broken up into two installments), the rebels are close to taking over District 1, the capitol of Panem. Panem's soft-spoken but relentlessly immoral dictator is President Snow (Donald Sutherland) who used the power of media to keep the districts enthralled but in constant fear with his annual ""Hunger Games"". Now, the president must use similar media manipulation to convince the masses of the criminal objectives of the rebels. Throughout the final confrontation, Snow broadcasts ""mandatory"" news reels which distort the reality of the confrontation, often misrepresenting footage to prove the Rebels are not only losing their battles, but the hearts and minds of the people of Panem.The Rebel's figurehead leader is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), now playing a largely staged role to inspire the masses of rebels. While she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) broke with Hunger Games tradition by refusing to kill each other at the end of the games in the first installment, both begin to question whether their actions are of their own designs or of the designs of the leaders of the Rebellion. Snow's opponent is not really Katniss, despite all appearances, but Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the self-appointed leader of the Rebellion. As events play out, Coin appears more and more like the dictator she wishes to overthrow, also using media manipulation to further her cause. And her cause becomes ambiguous: Does she truly desire to free the districts and call for free elections, or does she simply covet the power which is slowly slipping out of Snow's tired and slippery fingers?After a confrontation gone-wrong between a rebel force and members of District 2 who are still loyal to District 1, Katnisse is confined to the Rebel headquarters, instructed she will only be used after the Capitol's defeat. Petta, who was captured then rescued by the Rebels, is suffering from delusions that Katnisse is his enemy. Katnisse goes rogue, sneaking out of the compound and joining the frontlines of the Rebellion. Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) instantly realize Katnisse's move and decide to let her play it out, seemingly on her terms. A squad is hastily formed and they are instructed they can lead the Rebel forces but only as a media show. They are not supposed to engage in actual combat.However, nearly the entire region of District 1 around the president's palace is littered with destructive ""mines"", called pods, which can erupt violently upon sensing movement, either by automatic gunfire or explosions. Then after several misadventures dealing with the pods, resulting in the loss of a crucial figure of the squad, Katnisse reveals her real objective which is above and beyond the orders from the Rebellion: she intends to assassinate President Snow. However, as events continue to play out, Katnisse begins to question the objectives of the rebel leaders. They appear to be engaged in the same kinds of media manipulation used so effectively by President Snow... A brilliant film with an unexpected ending to one of the best dystopian stories since George Orwell's ""1984"". What makes the Hunger Games series ultimately disturbing is how much of its critique of media relates to media today. At this writing, the United States is in the midst of its primary election season to determine the respective presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties. Aside from which side you may be rooting and voting for, all candidates engage in media manipulation. Some crowds at campaign rallies are paid as ringers by the candidates. Photo shoots are carefully choreographed to accentuate candidates' strengths while hiding their weaknesses. Often candidates would rather make pre-written speeches then answer spontaneous questions from journalists. The issue is not whether the world could ever become as Panem. The question is more about how close we already are, and the scariest aspect of Suzanne Collins' original vision is we may be closer than we realize.","25 out of 52 found this helpful.

This is largely due to the source material: the books (I've read them) are just not that good. The most interesting thing in them was the premise--the competition among the impoverished sectors--and the farther the books got away from that, the less interesting they became, as the author was better with plot than with character and not at all skilled in writing dialogue with wit or philosophical depth. The first ""Hunger Games"" was very good: it emphasized the game; it highlighted differences among the participants; it retained the book's smart ending. Sparkling performances in both small and large supporting roles backed Jennifer Lawrence's luminescent performance in the lead. The 'Catching Fire' sequel was also pretty good, with extra kudos for the special effects. But by the time we get to ""Mockingjay""--which must have been split into two movies only to maximize profits--there's not much going on. Particularly in ""Mockingjay Part 2,"" it was sad to watch such an outstanding cast of actors try to make something of a script that gives none of them anything interesting to do or say while they plod on to a predictable ending. All Lawrence can do is look angst-ridden. The few plot developments present are forced and unconvincing. I'll give it a ""3"" only for the continuing high quality of special effects and artwork. The only reason to watch it is if you feel obligated to complete the saga.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the best series ever in my opinion. Except for the last few chapters which were the worst chapters i've had the misfortune to read from any modern series.
I can confidently say that this movie adapts these chapters faithfully without much deviation from the source material.
160 million dollars were spent on this.
Why.The acting felt stilted and lame, but that might have been due to all the characters canonically being depressed wrecks at this point in the series. Which doesn't make for a very enjoyable experience.The plot had comparatively little action for the culmination of a series about a revolution. I'm afraid to say this is possibly the one point where the movie strayed from the path laid out by the book. And for the worse. Instead of elaborate tactical suspense and serious discussion and weighty combat, we are treated to facile standoffs quick flashes of action and loads and loads of talking about inane things. Worse still, with the dialogue being mostly melodramatic there weren't many character moments to make up for all this either.And the ending? Without giving away anything, possibly the worst twists i have ever seen or read, all in one place. Nonsensical, nothing really resolved.
I reserve ratings of 3 and below for movies that teach such bad lessons that they might have a negative impact IRL. The ending here and the behavior of the main characters qualifies for this. Just straight up dumb stuff that i suspect Suzanne Collins just put in to make things more gritty or grounded so as to not have too plain an ending. This is the one point where i wish the movie franchise had just straight up discarded her ideas for being just nonsensical in the context of the rest of the story.An utterly shameful conclusion to an otherwise great trilogy, to some extent due to the need to stretch this into another movie, to some extent because of the ineptness of the storyboard writers, but mostly because of the choice to stay very close to the source material and the original author having a fit of lunacy writing this part or something.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I feel as if the film was amazing. I've read the books, and this one was pretty true to the wonderful, but yet emotional feeling. Yes, there were a few minor slip ups, but every book to film franchise will have those. Francis Lawrence did a splendid job with this film, and I was not disappointed at all. The deaths came fast which I did like that, because it showed you there's no time to grieve, we have to keep moving forward type deal. Except the death of... with the bomb that was very depressing and I wish that scene was more like the book, but it was close, as in close to the book I wanted to see Katniss having that talk inside her mind and everything and the last pod with the lizard mutts at the bottom of the pit, that would've been very intense and gave one final punch to the gut to the viewers, but overall this series has had a huge impact on society. It's not just about fighting to the death, it's much deeper, there's so many connections between the government of Panem and our government in the US. SO hope to see some prequels if possible :)","21 out of 46 found this helpful.

Okay, Jennifer Lawrence is no longer a young adolescent. So what? In this movie she is great! She carries the movie. Indeed, she should be nominated for every major Best Actress award. Lawrence is a beautiful and talented actress. The movie captures her from all angles, including numerous close-ups that capture her beauty. Who can possibly object to that? After all, she plays the principal part. Donald Sutherland is also great in this movie. He plays a great bad guy, someone who can be liked even though he is detestable. That's because he brings a certain classiness to his character, President Snow. Snow knows that whoever comes after him will be worse. The story itself contains lots of action, with heavy emphasis on special effects, most of which are good. Ultimately, the movie is watchable. Despite it being pure fantasy, it contains enough drama to keep the audience engaged. And that is largely due to the presence of Jennifer Lawrence.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

The meat of the story takes place in an abandoned, war-torn city, with the sound of explosions and gunfire ever present. Unsurprisingly though, it's all told from Katniss' perspective. We never leave her side to look elsewhere in the city or the country, which keeps the movie's focus tight and tidy. This is her story after all. This is still a Hunger Games movie though, and between the two parts, it cleverly adjusts it's new tone and direction to the formula of the first two movies. Part 1 was all about the propaganda; of her pretending to be someone else, dressing up and looking nice, trying to win the people over. Part 2 is them entering the arena where it's kill or be killed. Good people die as well as bad people.I don't want to oversell this next point, but what also helps Part 2 classify as a war movie is it's grittiness and attention to realism. War is not pretty, and Part 2 doesn't gloss over it. The mentally tortured and traumatised Peeta is brought back muttering to himself and slipping in and out of psychotic episodes. And the twist at the end is a twist worthy of a political commentary, and yet the beauty of it is that it's not conclusive and certain, leaving a whiff of suspicion in the air. One of the best reasons for this is it's commentary on media bias. The movie is peppered not with propaganda articles, but news reports from both sides that tell the same story differently according to their perspective.Narratively Part 2 does have one stumbling block though, and it's one that's always been present in the previous movies, but never has it been so needlessly drilled in like in Part 2, and that's the love triangle. Throughout the series, Katniss has been torn between childhood friend Gale and Hunger Games ally Peeta. Of course, Gale has been left in District 12 every time, leaving no time to develop his character or his relationship to Katniss, but now he's here in the same room as Peeta, and the movie feels the need to constantly shove the love triangle in our faces. Ultimately it's a pointless endeavour. We've only ever seen Katniss love Peeta, and I don't believe it's a spoiler to say that's how it ends as well, negating the need for Gale's romantic involvement entirely. I feel this movie, and the series as a whole, would've benefited greatly from keeping Gale's interest in Katniss as purely friendly, like a brother-sister relationship. This is coming from someone who's unashamedly team Gale (in my opinion, Gale came off as hugely more likable in two movies than Peeta did in four).That aside, the character work and acting quality in Part 2 is on par. Jennifer Lawrence once again commands the screen as Katniss. She's not a soldier or a warrior, but nonetheless she's seen some s***. With this in mind, her seeming arrogance is merely naivety towards the nature of war. War is not a game, and there's so much more at stake, not just for her, but for everyone in the country. Liam Hemsworth finally gets to do some real work with the character of Gale. In Katniss' absence at various points throughout the series, Gale has become closer to a solider's understanding of war, and what must be done in order to win. He hasn't taken part in any do or die games for entertainment, but he's a stronger and more world-wary fighter for it. He's been there in the strategic planning. Josh Hutcherson is still awkward and annoying as Peeta, but I'll give him credit for the mental trauma he exhibits. Unfortunately he was largely absent in Part 1, and in Part 2 he's just dead weight that the team have to drag along with them at risk of their safety.Visually the movie is on par with especially Part 1, which is unsurprising as they were filmed back-to-back. The vibrant Capitol is brilliantly turned into a dull and grey warzone, littered with rubble, ruins, and game-like traps. However, and I'm not sure whether this was just my screening or the movie itself, it is very dark, thematically and visually. I spent probably a little more than half the movie squinting trying to work out what I was looking at. I'll give credit to the fact it added to the realism of the situation, but it doesn't exactly make for a great viewing experience. It reached it's peak of unwatchability when it decided to stage an action sequence in the dark sewers as well, so not only are you struggling to see because it's dark, but also because the camera is shaking around so much trying to keep up with the action. Everything just becomes a dark grey blur.In all, Mockingjay Part 2 is a fitting finale to what had become a surprisingly deep and emotional franchise. Like the Harry Potter franchise, but of course to a lesser degree with half the amount of movies, it grew as it went along and got more and more serious, more and more emotional, and the subtle subtexts took the forefront to create a political allegory to today's world. Part 2 is the smartest blockbuster of the year, bar none. I give it a very good and thoroughly enjoyable 8/10","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

I have to begin by saying I wasn't a huge fan of the first two movies. I'm not sure why but I didn't get into the whole craze of this series like most people did. I did however really enjoy the first part of this movie and was looking forward to this one. On one hand I thought this was the best of the series. The movie had action, drama and really felt like they were trying to make more than just the next blockbuster. For those reasons I recommend this. On the other hand the ending was very weak and almost distracted from the excitement of the rest of the movie, not enough to keep you from watching, but if you stop watching 5 minutes before the credits it will end on a higher note. All that said the movie is review proof. Either you are excited about watching the end, or you never started the series and could care less. Overall, the best movie of the series, while at the same time having the weakest ending of the 4. I give it a high B+.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

Then it tried to grasp ideas that were far beyond its reach for what is primarily a thriller aimed at teenagers. The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 was a film comprised solely of hefty narrative exposition, scenes with a depressed to tears Katniss and filler. Luckily Mockingjay Part 2 is not the aggravating affair that Part 1 was. Yes, it still cannot hold a candle to The Hunger Games or Catching Fire. But it is a solid end for the franchise and is far more memorable and engaging than Part 1 ever was.Mockingjay Part 2 picks up right after the events of Part 1. Katniss is recovering from her wounds that were caused by a brainwashed Peeta recently rescued from the Capitol. Meanwhile President Coin suggests an assault on the Capitol with Katniss acting as the Mockingjay at the forefront of the action.Let's be clear. Mockingjay should never have been split into two films. There is not enough story and weight to fill over four hours' worth of screen time. But with this instalment scenes are not dragged out infinitely and Mockingjay Part 2 has a natural flow to the events and proceedings. It is better paced for sure, with the right amount of political intrigue so that it never becomes over bearing or bland. There is not a noticeable lack of action and unlike Part 1 at times it is genuinely thrilling. I was far more entertained than I thought was possible with Mockingjay Part 2; particularly after the fact that Part 1 had let me down so much.The characters with this film have matured and as a result Katniss is a stronger protagonist and natural leader. Jennifer Lawrence has far more material to work with here and never stumbles like she did in Part 1. Although the blame for which rested solely on the screenplay's shoulders. The only trouble is that supporting characters are lost within the mix and this time the scenes devoted to character development are abrupt and almost always cut short when they should have been given more room to breathe. Finnick, Haymitch and Gale deserved more screen time considering they are the most interesting characters outside of Katniss.A problem carried over from the book is the all too sudden ending. Without spoiling anything, the final confrontation between Katniss and President Snow falls rather flat. It's never as nail-biting as the directors and writers want you to believe it is. Undeniably a let- down then, when the film makers have been building up to this moment since the original film. But blame it on the writers they should have crafted their own ending; one that had power and respected its ever so faithful audience and fan base.The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 is not, as all the promotional material would want you to believe, the must see film of the winter. But it is a solid enough addition to the saga that remains flawed nonetheless. However, if you are aching to see this film and maintain any love for this series, it is on its own terms worth watching if just to see how the events play out and the endless internal and external power shifts change the dynamic between the complex characters and the overall arch of the story.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Never do we get a flash of leg or bosom that I recall. Her beauty is never highlighted. Instead the audience is her mental and emotional companion as she tries to help Panem break from the tyranny of President Snow's administration.The story has to be given credit for giving her struggle some of the complications of real life. It's not a simple matter of her fighting bravely and skillfully for the greater good. It demands someone we can see dealing with those issues on screen, not someone picked for her great looks only. Ms Lawrence would be difficult to top in this regard, even with any of the great female stars of yesteryear. For me, at least, that alone was worth the price of admission. And yet, we get so much more. My wife and I left the theater happy to have taken the time to go.I would say Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson should be commended for their all too brief but effective contributions to the mix, but then this franchise is blessed with great supporting actors including the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. In fact I'd say this is one of those movies where their contributions seem undeniable and welcome even though Ms Lawrence is quite good enough to carry the whole thing off on her own. Apparently the highly emotional content here demands an occasional distraction.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Didn't capture the emotional impact and the message of the book","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3430812/?ref_=tt_urv","kmalekb","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65838896/?ref_=tt_urv","13 March 2016","In order to properly convey my feelings let me first talk about the book and how the movie completely failed it here. The central message of the book is this: 'War is awful, no matter what you're fighting for, which side you're on or how rightful your claim is'Throughout the whole book we're led to believe that we're gradually moving closer to the real goal: killing Snow. Sure, bad things happen but ends justify the means, don't they? It gets worse and worse. Peeta is broken. Finnick Dies. And then it happens, an event that makes it all meaningless: Primrose is dead. After that we're led through paranoia, depression and pointlessness of it all as we're moving through the fallout with Katniss. When Katniss kills Coin it is a highly emotional event: is she really behind it all? We're in a state of confusion and uncertainty and the whole event shocks us, makes Katniss even more emotionally vulnerable and about to kill herself. Even when she chooses Peeta at the end of the book it doesn't really matter - he's there for her, but in the end all of it wasn't really worth it for Katniss. She learns to cope, she learns to live sort of a half-life, she even manages to have children of her own. But even after all these years she's utterly broken by her loss. None of it is captured in the movie. The whole buildup is excellent, the movie closely follows the books, there is tension, there is artistic sophistication and the moment the first bomb is dropped on the Capitol children it really grips you by the heart and you feel pain, feel how senseless those deaths were. And then the second bomb comes and that's where it goes all wrong. It happens fast, there is no buildup, no gradual realization on the Katniss's side that her sister is about to die and there is nothing she can do about it. After that we're led to the hospital scene and it's all sort of muted - Katniss is sitting there stone-faced, she talks sort of around the topic with Haymitch and her mother, like it's something awkward - there is none of Katniss's hysteria, nail fighting or paranoia. If she were to write the note about it in her journal i'd imagine it'd go something like this: ' Dear Diary,My sister died yesterday. I'm still sad about it, but there's nothing I can do. I visited Snow and he raised my suspicions about Coin. Coin asked us about another Hunger Games and I agreed. After that I killed Coin. It was pretty bad, but then we went home. Things were sort of OK then, but I cried a little. I hope I can learn to live again. ' Which is NOTHING compared to the what was captured in the book. Even the epilogue with her children has too much of an optimistic side to it, like things are good again, which wasn't the point of it at all - it doesn't convey that she was still utterly broken by this point, even after all these years. In conclusion this movie utterly failed to convey the central message and the crucial parts of the work. It simply doesn't have the impact that the book conveyed so beautifully - it all happens, but without any emotions involved and we're left with about the same feeling as watching the paint dry. It's a subtle thing to make it properly, but it was definitely achievable - a little longer shot here, a bit more of a emotion there, a bit of a silence here and make it all more personal by moving it all closer to us. Because those scenes were so crucial to the movie, it's high point, it's definitive moment I'm left with no choice but give it 7/10 for the buildup and 2/10 for the ending, leaving us with 4/10 overall. Had those scenes been shot properly this movie could've easily been an 8-9/10, but as such we're left bitter and disappointed. Now if you excuse me I'm off to read the latter part of 'Mockingjay' to wash the bad aftertaste and forget what a disappointment it was on the screen.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

There has undoubtedly been a saturation of the genre in recent years but led by a strong protagonist in Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen, The Hunger Games franchise has consistently been a cut above the rest. Crucially, Mockingjay - Part 2 does not let the series down in a terrifically tense final installment.There have been many grumblings about the final book being split into two but I thought Part 1 had just enough going on to not give the appearance that it was treading water. Part 2 picks up straight after the conclusion of the previous film with the rebellion attempting to cure the brainwashed Peeta from his vicious urge to kill Katniss, the de facto face of the rebellion. Meanwhile, masterminded by Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the rebels attempt to overthrow the tyrannical President Snow and recapture the Capitol.Part 2 pulls no punches as it retains its dark tone and strongly political plot, refusing to talk down to its young target audience by utilising concepts such as imperialism, the loss of innocence and the fog of war. The former in particular is highlighted when the rebels discover the luxurious life Capitol citizens have been enjoying for decades; with a set-up like this why on Earth would they ever think the current system needs changing? The middle act of the film involves our rebels navigating their way through the streets of the Capitol, evading booby-trapped pods that aim to kill in increasingly imaginative ways. However it was the nihilism of the final act and tense, enthralling final showdown with President Snow which is what made Part 2 so brilliant.It's sad to see the end of this trailblazing franchise with its close-to-the-bone allegories of reality TV and war. But as it leaves the big screen for the last time, it does so on a triumphant note.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Not that I can say that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series started off being ""okayish"" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity. This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.This one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.When something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.How the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.There is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I think the reason some people didn't like it is the exact reason it surprised me, in that it didn't play out exactly like you may have suspected.. I additionally think that like all good series, the final chapter is bittersweet too people, so they find reasons not to like it. Overall a good watch however.Now for some criticism, I thought the direction was bad in that there were some key moments that were a bit rushed through, while other less important moments seemed to drag on. I also felt the screenplay was sloppy in that a lot of extra scenes, and frankly extra characters were kept in that weren't necessary. You could have easily rolled some of these roles into a composite character. Those are fine in a novel, but in a good movie characters should be relevant and one scene should flow into, and build into the next scene. Its fine for a series of movies to have a longer epilogue like this did, and as the Lord of the Rings did, but too much fluff in middle for my taste. I reiterate though that if you like the series this won't disappoint","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

I was looking forward to the concluding of a series but somehow it failed to impress me. I gave it 8 purely because of sentimental reasons. If I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong, maybe it should start with the fact that they divided a small book into two movies (same old, same old) but it definitely weakened the final result. The strength of the first two movies was in the emotional intensity and action packed story line. Although there is a lot (and I mean A LOT) of action in this one, it fails to provide emotional and suspenseful atmosphere. Some important sequences are not striking enough (or at least it felt that way to me), and only because I read the books a few years back I was able to put things together; I kept thinking whether those not acquainted with the books are able to completely understand the final events concerning some of the main characters. On the other hand, amazing cast, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't fail to impress as always, followed by Josh Hutcherson and others.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

Mockingjay - Part 2 gave the series the closure fans long desired and did a great job of delivering the goods people have come to expect from the franchise. Of course, Jennifer Lawrence was once again breathtaking. Her ability to deliver such a wide range of emotions and characters separate her from most of Hollywood. What has made this franchise unique, however, is how the rest of the cast consistently matches her performance, and at times seems to even surpass her. It only took the fourth and final movie but Josh Hutcherson finally felt like Peeta Mellark. His performance in this film will surely be underrated as the franchise will get catalogued with the rest of the teen girl franchises of this generation and that's a shame because he shined. Liam Hemsworth and the rest of the supporting cast also carried their weight. The visuals were also fantastic as the continued ""coming to life"" of the book was a joy to see. The only real negatives with this particular movie are largely tied to the first one. Because this is essentially the second half of an incredibly long film, it felt lacking in plot development. I also thought the director failed to capture what might be the most critical scene in the entire book series. It was still in the film but it was lost a bit in the chaos. Schindler's List comes to mind in how it was able to convey such strong emotions with such simple visuals. I also feel that a similar cinematic effect should've been used at the end to truly capture Katniss' emotions as that key event unfolded. Overall though, I think this franchise will be best suited for marathoning.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I have casually enjoyed the Hunger Games series but was never a particularly obsessed fan of it. The first two movies were decent enough to keep me watching, but I haven't felt like watching them more than once. The dull filler-episode of a third movie bored me nearly to sleep though.This final movie, however, is commendable for daring to take this story in an interesting direction that elevates it beyond the simple good-vs-evil, take down the evil empire, happily ever after fluff that we too often see at the end of other ""epic"" franchises. This is a movie that recognizes that saving the world is perhaps not as simple as blowing up the evil base and killing all the bad guys, something too often simplified in other stories.Highlights: Some faceless mutants show up for an intense action sequence that feels like something from Aliens. I liked it.Best characters: Presidents Snow & Coin. We already know Snow is menacing, but as Snow's rival, Coin proves herself to be more than a match for Snow. Very interesting watching these two go at each other, each competing to out-manipulate the other.Worst character: Peeta. The Hunger Games love triangle romantic subplot is was always kinda lame, but it gets even worse here. Both of Jennifer Lawrence's love interests in this story are unlikable, but the one we're apparently supposed to be rooting for, Peeta, gets to be especially pathetic and irrational in this movie. I found myself hoping for Peeta to hurry up and die through the whole movie and you will too.","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

Along with the source material being so good, it was the cast that was the reason for sticking until the end.Of the four, 'Catching Fire' for me was the best, it could have been much better but at least it tried to (if only slightly) up the ""hunger"" from 'The Hunger Games' and didn't feel anywhere near like the bland and over-stretched set up that was basically 'Mockingjay-Part 1'. 'Mockingjay-Part 2' is to me an improvement on 'Part 1', it's heavily flawed and far from great but there are things that are done slightly better (though the execution is still less than completely successful) over 'Part 1'.The effects are better and less dodgy (the best of the franchise). Although the character development is simplistic, too neat rather than complex and not particularly interesting at least this does actually try to develop the characters. And there is more action in comparison to the very padded and sedate previous film, although they lack excitement and tension and are lit somewhat too dimly. The strengths of 'Part 1' however are the same here, likewise are the flaws, hence why the wording in both reviews is going to be very similar.'Mockingjay-Part 2' certainly has good things. The production values, some over-dim lighting aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The special effects are less problematic than before. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his last films before his tragic ultimely death, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore (although her character arc is a bit flat overall).Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson again have nothing to do and are practically pop-ups.Writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time. The chemistry between Lawrence, Hutcherson and Hemsworth just isn't there.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 2' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched with a lot of colourless and not always relevant padding which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary rather than fresh, tense or exciting. It was somewhat inevitable with 'Part I' but for a franchise conclusion it was unforgivable. The ending is again very anti-climactic, which is a large part of why the franchise doesn't end on a bang and feels so anaemic.In spirit, 'Mockingjay-Part 2' feels very tame, no improvement over the previous films, which also suffered from a lack of suspense, excitement, the conflict not being as threatening as ought and the satirical edge not being sharp enough. The complete anti-thesis of the scary, thrilling and moving stories that the books tell, even when adhering the basic details and such closely the spirit and atmosphere is severely dissipated in film form in all four 'Hunger Games' films.Overall, an anaemic whimper of a franchise conclusion. 5/10 Bethany Cox","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I'm not going to be bothered to lose anymore of my time with this awful movie, there are no spoilers in this review.So, from the whole movie I've enjoyed only one action scene which was remarkably good and the predictable ending! That's it! Everything else is boring, I knew what was about to happen from the first 10 minutes in the movie, and surprise, surprise I was right. One friend of mine fell asleep after 30 minutes. How this movie still has 7/10 is beyond me! Worst movie of the whole year (from what I've seen at least). Do yourself a service and don't see this movie, if possible just watch the first movie and then forget about the series... It's not worth your money. Wait for a cheap DVD or watching it on TV if there is NOTHING else interesting to watch!","18 out of 69 found this helpful.

Almost every moment is edge of your seat excitement and despite its dark tone they still managed to throw some humor in every once in a while. Even the fearsome President Snow has a few zingers. Donald Sutherland was the perfect choice for Snow, and it shows here more than any of the other films. Every word sounds a chill down your spine and you hate him like you should hate all good villains. It is slow at times and some scenes serve no purpose other than to drag out the runtime. But for the most part the movie is exciting and that's what matters. It's an (almost) perfect ending to the Hunger Games franchise.

The acting is great thats certain, but the plot jumps points and skips bits that you just wonder what just happened, like where did she come from or he. I have gotten an insight in the book from my girlfriend, and its key points in the book that explains things to more depth then the movie. The CGI is on point, of course its a high budget movie. Plot is lacking emotion to some degree and isn't what I was expecting the hard stuff in the movie to be shown. Many scenes in the movies leaves you wondering how did the other part feel about that because you didn't get a shoot from it. The Action was more of the focus, then emotion, that was what I really wanted. I was hard in the vote because its just such a big let down towards the book and it was so rushed for a part 2. I wouldn't go see it in the movies, I would probably wait until DVD and blueray release, if you want to sit through a movie with so many cheesy moments and predictable moments and plot jumps that don't make sense and many references to the book and the non book readers that makes you just confused go ahead, at least its entertainment on an lower level and more like a I can take up the book and read at the same time.","18 out of 71 found this helpful.

There are lots of things that I didn't like about the film...1) Actors who spit and dribble to show how cross they really are. Yuck.2) Actors who whisper, and not only whisper but do so in an earnest voice - I really can't stand it.3) The lead characters are terrible actors, all except Snow. It's a bit like watching a school play.4) Not once did I believe a character (except Snow), it was like watching people act.5) The whole story is that they must go on a journey, and there will be peril along the way.6) It probably doesn't need a spoiler alert to say that they succeed on their journey.7) A young girl with a bow and arrow manages to fend of hordes of zombies, hundreds of armed soldiers etc. Give her a BFG for goodness sake!8) The ending is dragged out. About 5 times there's a false hope that the credits will start rolling.9) The hordes of zombies is really out of context and looks like a computer game. Really badly done. If I was playing Wolfenstien it would be fine, but this isn't a computer game.10) Some of the traps are so huge they are ridiculous. And hundreds and hundreds of them. Yet fortunately there's a network of tunnels that bypasses them all. So contrived, so stupid, so cheap.In summary - if you're 12 and enjoy pathetic nonsense then go for it. But if you are an adult with any sense of what is good - avoid it!","18 out of 74 found this helpful.

I was utterly wrong... I'm reviewing both parts here because they are same story just split in two.Catching fire tried really hard to be something different, and special movie on it's own right and didn't get there. But it didn't need to, because it was very obviously just lead up to this final.I guess everybody expected series like this to go out in a typical hollywood grande finale; as action packed thriller with heroes coming out on top.Instead, Mockingjay is slow, thoughtful, nihilistic and utterly depressing gut punch. Brutally honest movie about the realities of human society. I really didn't guess Hollywood could produce a big budget movie like this these days. Especially in this genre, and it really wouldn't work the same if it wasn't.These movies have so many sides that could be written about, so I only pick out one:I expected Katniss to be your typical young adult heroine... Instead being honest dephtful character that only becomes more apparent further the story goes. First glance I thought her coldness and sudden hits of weakness was just poor writing. But shes teenage girl, who's constantly pushed and forced to do everything she does throughout story.She doesn't want any of it and appears cruel and cold, understanding that she is, which makes her hate herself as well as the outside world for it. Knowing that she has to be, she still wants and tries to be good. Finally she goes on to just take her revenge come hell or high water.It goes as you'd expect such endeavour to go in real world. Events pushing her in to a full Travis Bickle mode in the end. She never recovers, eventually learning she can't but live her life, taking herself and world around her as they are.It's tragic story of young people pushed to adulthood by aggression and violence. It's realistic depiction. Not just entertaining hollywood action.The final movie drives home all the other themes as well. World is unfair and chaotic and we rarely can do anything about it. But that doesn't mean things we do don't matter.I have to say Hunger Games might be one the most important scifi stories of 21st century. It's strange people haven't catched that yet, but I'm sure they will in the future.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's almost as much of a trip in to the games as the first two. I also wish they'd quit their jibber-jabber while it's on, but you can't have everything.I like the way this film wraps up the story. It's saved some of the best bits to last and you still don't know who Katniss might end up with, if at all, until one of the many endings (Like Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King, there's lots of bits tied up, even after you're sure that it's finished).The actors all do there jobs well, the special effects are on point and the sets, direction, etc are all good.
Congratulations to Suzanne Collins for coming up with such a great tale, even if it is a bit worrying that this could be our future. The world is that kind of scary at the moment that I wouldn't be surprised.If I had to criticise anything, it would be that they've squeezed a lot in to this one and it seems a bit rushed, but I can understand why they cut the last one off at the point that they did. Perhaps in the future, they will make a TV series, that might elaborate on things in a more well paced way.I'm a bit sad I've finished the quadrilogy to be honest, but I'm still looking forward to the journey again, when I finally get around to reading them.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Just when you think it is over, it tacks on the longest denouement in movie history.The plot of this movie is a group of soldiers have to get from A to B. Their way is blocked by various traps: explosions, automatic guns, and I kid you not, mummies they call ""mutts"".The characters are mostly one-dimensional soldiers. They justify killing civilians and children. They believe their opponents are so wicked, any atrocity is justified. These are the supposed heroes, but they are disgusting.I had trouble telling the characters apart. Characters die, but I could not figure out who died. This was further confused by the heroine coming back to life at least three times.Our soldier heroine has some qualms about killing but does it anyway dispatching her victims with arrows. She has some ""mockingjay"" superpower, but it was never adequately explained. Perhaps that is clarified in part 1.The most interesting part of the movie is the sets. The characters traverse the length of a huge futuristic city, blasted by war. I don't know how they created the illusion. It was completely believable and intricate.Donald Sutherland as the arch-villain President Snow has some incisive fascinating dialogue, delivered perfectly, but he is on screen for only a short time.Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee is also on screen only a short time. His part is quite bland. Using him was a bit of a waste.There is a lot about how deception, lying and propaganda are integral to war. I took these as allusions to American politics.Jena Malone as the bald, drug addicted, jittery Johanna Mason deserves special mention. She was so creepy, again only on screen for a short time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I haven't seen the first part, but it seems I didn't have to. There was no life and chemistry in any of the characters. They could't make me believe that there was love between them, passion for freedom, fear of losing, strength to fight, and sadness of loss. Everything felt so flat and as if no one cared really what's going on. Of course there are some exceptions - the deaf brother, who was the only genuine in his suffering, Jenna Malone character who had some wit and anger for what had happened to her and commander Paylor who had some great presence. The only moving scene was in the end, when Katniss cried for her sister in the house. I couldn't understand what this movie is about. There were no heroes, only villains who kind of won in the end. Everyone died, and the main character couldn't even get her revenge. The two male main characters were so lame and such cowards. They didn't really loved Katniss, and didn't care for her nor they cared for anything else but themselves.The one was like broken puppy the whole time, but he was like that in the other movies as well. The other one was like the indifferent nobody who will stab you in the back. The worse was that they didn't have any depth as characters. Katniss, who supposed to be the symbol of hope and unity was so depressed the whole movie and so scared in a way and indecisive.","18 out of 79 found this helpful.

There were people of all different ages, the youngest maybe seven, the oldest probably seven decades older than that, and the audience of about thirty was decidedly mixed in terms of race, as well. It wasn't until I sat down to endure the final part of ""The Hunger Games"" film franchise that this has been one of the most successful young adult novel film franchises since post-""Harry Potter,"" and after this film leaves the theaters, it'll be a while before another film intercepts the hype. The ""Divergent"" series is close, but doesn't have the staying power, the immense box office draw, nor the pop culture relevance ""The Hunger Games"" does, even now, when its popularity in terms of being the ""gotta read"" book has simmered.Speaking as someone who has been entranced very little by this particular franchise, its conclusion won't make me shed any tears or lose any sleep. Since Gary Ross paved the way for the franchise in 2012, I've been cruelly underwhelmed in some regard by each film in this franchise mainly because young adult fiction isn't my thing; I like my literature with more of a gritty realism edge and ""The Hunger Games"" always seemed like it was capitalizing on a generation that found the idea of a government manipulating and taking advantage of its citizens new and unheard of. In each installment, the drama has either felt stilted and unbelievable, the action too dominant, the camera-work too uneven, or the overall effect and takeaway ideas stunningly minimal.""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" will not make a fan out of people like me, who were simply waiting to get this franchise out of the way and move on to better things, but to say it's entirely joyless and void of some discernible charm is a bit of a stretch. Picking up where the inert non-event of a first part left off, this film opens with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) struggling to speak after severely straining her vocal chords in battle. After a few minutes, however, she more or less regains her ability to speak, like a main character in a TV show with a grave physical ailment that need be remedied in the blink of an eye to help move the story along, so that kind of traumatic opening is pretty foolish to include.With that, the nation of Panem is in the mix of a brutal revolutionary war, with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) proposing her plan to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in order to fully settle all the governmental nonsense and class warfare that has taken place for decades. Katniss unites her closest friends, including Gabe (Liam Hemsworth), Finnick (Sam Claflin), Cressida (Natalie Dormer), and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is still experiencing severe mental problems and bouts of uncontrollable rage. Despite the fact that previous winners of the notorious Hunger Games, like Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Johanna (Jena Malone), control much of Panem and are uniting its citizens, large-scale change will not commence until President Snow is assassinated. Katniss and her band of followers also must find a way to avoid the boobytraps set by Snow and President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the new ruler and commander of Panem.""Mockingjay - Part 2"" plays much like a video-game when it focuses on action sequences; most of the combat in the film feels like the kind of predictable, cause-and-effect nonsense that prohibits a film's violence from being immersing to just plain boring. Being that this film is also PG-13 and meant for the people who were about thirteen or fourteen when they read the book, you can also be sure that desperately little is developed or really shown.The romantic trite from both ""Catching Fire"" and the first part of ""Mockingjay"" is thankfully traded for more development towards the relationships of Katniss, Finnick, Cressida, and Peeta, and things become fairly interesting when we see that Peeta's dual personalities make him a ticking timebomb of a partner in terms of whether or not he actually wants to help Katniss or kill her.If you manage to invest yourself in all the drama occurring in the film and the often poorly lit and unclear violence that interjects the latter, than ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" is a worthy recommendation. My problem here is that at the conclusion of this franchise - which really should've been last November because splitting this film up into two parts resulted in nothing but two almost equally empty and forgettable films - is pretty anticlimactic and melodramatic, as Katniss goes from being a fearless warrior, a sniffling baby, and a content housewife in a matter of about three or four scenes. At the end of it all, the drama is never particularly compelling, the violence is all over the place and only sporadically interesting, and the fact that these two films combined is an affair over four hours is absolutely nonsensical.I return to my point that I was probably never going to be a fan of ""The Hunger Games"" franchise after not particularly loving the second film, though it's probably the best in the franchise. I've never found much connection in this series, and find, for all the acclaim Jennifer Lawrence and Katniss get, that she plays a terribly bland character with little else other than an archetypal warrior presence attached to her empty description of being ""courageous.""

Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), the reluctant face of the rebellion must continue her role as a propaganda icon. At the same time she wants vengeance for all the pain and suffering President Snow (Donald Sutherland) inflicted on her and everyone she holds dear. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 is gruellingly overstretched, it is clear that splitting the movie into two parts really hurt the movie as a whole. Simply put, it is not engaging or entertaining. The continuous drab tone makes an already long movie difficult to bear.Full Review:I like the first two films of the franchise, I even state that in my review of Part 1. However, it all changed when I saw Mockingjay Part 1. I thought it was a decent movie but a definite step back in the franchise. I went into Part 2 hoping this would be the payoff for all the melodrama we had to endure in the previous film. Surprisingly, I found this movie to be even worse!The positive for most people will be the cast. They probably performed better than the script deserved. Especially, President Snow as the antagonist continues a menacing presence in Katniss' struggle in the war. Unlike Part 1, there are some exciting sequences of action but they are just too far and few between. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these parts of the movie because they rid of the constant shaky cam of the previous films and had better shot composition. So this is as good as the finale is going to look.About a year ago after watching Part 1 I was irritated by the fact it was split into two parts, little did I know I'd be even more frustrated with Part 2. First of all this movie is just a collection of going from one checkpoint to the other. ACTION SEQUENCE – people sitting down and having long depressing talk – now rinse and repeat that several times. Even these talks, the long runs of dialogue are about things the characters having been trying to figure out since the first film. A major example of this is the love-triangle of Peeta, Katniss, and the pretty boy Hemsworth Jr. See, we are four movies in and that's how little I care about this love-triangle that I don't even know the name of the third person in the bloody triangle! Even the audience I watched it with audibly ""ugh""ed whenever that came up. I won't go too much into plot but there are some major twists and turns that our main characters uncover. However, due to the splitting of the story, the build-up in Part 1 doesn't have the same momentum into Part 2. Which only led me to question Katniss' intelligence for not being able to see what's clearly obvious to the viewers. I also mentioned how depressing and drab the tone of the movie was. I understand that this is a war, and they are difficult times, but there are ways to bring some levity while respecting the circumstances. Speaking of war, where the hell is the war!? That's right, we don't even see the war in this movie. All we hear is distant gunfire that's it because we are only following one small squad that are only there to shoot propaganda.This is the studio mocking the audience for spending money on blatantly clear cash-grabs. Thankfully I have a monthly movie pass so I don't pay extra, but if you are thinking of spending your hard earned money on a movie to watch, this is one to avoid. There so many instances of snail crawling pace, Part 1 and 2 could've been combined to be one good 2-2.5 hour movie. At the same time I can't fault the producers for the decision because it is clearly paying off for them in the bank account.","13 out of 59 found this helpful.

""The Hunger Games"" is an important franchise for young people to watch, it shaped so many minds and influenced so many consciences. It is a superior revolution film and it showcases humans at their lowest. So many important moments in this entire franchise. ""Mockingjay Part II"" is an emotionally heavy movie, it feels like the end of an era , and many of our beloved characters are lost. And those that remain are so deeply haunted and scarred for life, that you simply cannot rejoice with the outcome. And how could you really rejoice whilst watching a movie about revolution and war. This is the blueprint for everything that has come after this, especially anything dystopian. A really bad decision to split the last book into two parts, it simply doesn't have the same effect it would have had had it been a well-realised long movie.PS: I'm ready to watch the promised prequel and be swept in that dystopian world again!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie was cringe-worthy. Almost everything that came out of the mouth of any character was cringe-worthy. The older actors were much better, they brought at least a little depth to this uninspired creation of our best Hollywood minds. I kept remembering 'Battle Royale' and weeping quietly to myself about how perfect it was comparing to this and how 1 minute of Battle Royale is worth more than all the Hunger Games movie junk put together, and how studios don't give a damn about us, the audience, repeatedly feeding us this trash. And when it was over (with a particularly cringe-worthy last scene), half of Sunday was gone already. All I could feel was regret for the time of my precious weekend.

Definitely don't start a marathon at midnight. Part 2 needs to be watched on its own. It has its own pace that doesn't make sense back to back. Don't watch it tired, you'll need your full facilities to grasp what's going on. Don't watch it expecting it to be a great film in its own right like the first movie. This is definitely an adaptation. I've read the book and it still confused me. If your intelligent you'll get the political and moral point it's making about war. If you're not so smart you'll love the cheese factor. It's slow but action packed. It's predicable but surprising. It's serious but funny. It's both camps - it sucks but it's also good. This is why I've rated it 5 stars. Suzanne Collins has always highlighted contrasts. District 13 is grey, the Capitol is coloured. District 13 are starving, the Capitol take pills to throw up their food so they keep eating. Petia is loving, Gale is practical. The same contrast applies to this movie, or rather in the emotions and reactions I experienced watching it.

Amazingly The Hunger Games churned out four films in four years and the last installment, Mockingjay Part 2, is finally here.Opening where Part 1 left off, Peeta is saved but compromised and traumatized. The rebellion grows stronger, no longer trying to gain momentum but with full traction propelling closer to The Capitol. Katniss finally accepts her position and use in the rebellion and realizes this is the time to overthrow Panem and gain freedom for good.Screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong, responsible for the division and screenplay of Mockingjay Part 1, get to finish what they started. Mind you, what they started wasn't very good and those same flaws transfer over to Mockingjay Part 2. The third and final novel of The Hunger Games series isn't particularly long, unlike the Harry Potter novels that almost required film divisions, and with each part lasting over two hours there isn't enough content to once again justify the film's length.Just from looking at the stills released for this film, you can tell it is going to be monochromatic, but you hope that is just visually and not narratively or emotionally. Unfortunately, the monotone vibe is a constant throughout all aspects of the film and I blame the inexperienced and sub-par screenwriters in part for this. Unlike the first two films, there is no 'game' to ground the plot of the film, this time the civil war of Panem is the 'game'. There was plenty of room for the story to be told through action, emotion and acting. Instead, it is told through constant exposition between leaders and is both tiring and uncompelling. All of the dialogue of the film is either talking about what is going to happen or what just happened, with crude-like finesse for the idiots in the back.Mockingjay Part 2 is evidence of all the minor and minute flaws of its predecessors, dating back to the original 2012 film. In Mockingjay, we are supposed to the see the final culmination of several conflicts between characters, and in reality the war's resolution is secondary. Sure, Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2 include this aspect in the film, but do we wholeheartedly believe it – No. The lack of believable character development between Katniss and several main characters (Prim, Gale and Peeta namely) reduces the film to a rudimentary skeleton that fizzles for its full length.Perhaps it may appear I am being too hard on the YA franchise, especially since I was so disappointed of Mockingjay Part 1 – but they are two parts of the same story and were always going to impact one another's effectiveness as individual film experiences. I am critical because the story is simple and the screenwriters failed the final novel's adaptation. With Part 2 once again going into the minutiae of rallying the districts to overthrow The Capitol, it basically is the nail in the coffin for Part 1 and negates it to complete pointlessness. All that, and in it of itself it is sloppy and lazy, an affront to its fans.Of all the Young Adult books that were lucky enough to garner a film franchise out of their successes, The Hunger Games is the most disappointing. Even the actors appear thankful it is over and tired of their roles, to the point where they all barely try. Lucky for the Director, the score is equally as unrefined as the script, and all of the emotion of the film relies upon and resides in the score.Please check our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.","10 out of 44 found this helpful.

A great series! The characters, the action, the dialogue....it was beautiful.The whole series has been fantastic. The Hunger Games by itself was brutal - children killing children is not nice. But as a preamble, a scene setting for all that was to come, it stops looking like a Western knock off of Battle Royale, and becomes the foundation of a story of strength and courage winning out over fear and hopelessness.And what an ending. I think one of the hardest parts of ending a trilogy/quadrilogy/series/whatever is doing so in a way that leaves the viewer satisfied, gives justice to the characters and doesn't turn the whole thing into a cliché. I haven't read Mockingjay yet, but from what I understand, its pretty close. I don't want to give it away to those of you who haven't read it yet, but the post-action rounds it all off perfectly.I have so much respect for Jennifer Lawrence. The way she takes a role and just imbues it with so much passion and history is incredible. Katniss Everdeen is not the nicest person in the world. She's not the best speaker. She's not the best fighter. But she is a survivor, willing to give up everything for those she loves. And somehow, we know her, through this performance, through every expression and movement, every silent moment, the few words she does utter.Josh Hutcherson too is phenomenal. This Peeta is very different from the one we've known so far. He's broken, trying to sort reality from fantasy. And it's heart-wrenching as the viewer because he was the nicest person, the sweet one, the antidote to Katniss' sourness.I could go on, but I'll simply finish with a recommendation - go watch it! If you haven't seen any of the series, give it a go. If nothing else, this is the story of integrity overcoming oppression, of how one normal no-one can change their hold world just by refusing to conform.It's beautiful.Watchability 9/10. Character: 10/10. Inventiveness: 9/10. Overall: 9/10.confessionsofastorylover.wordpress.com","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I remember being very excited to the first ""Hunger Games"" after reading all three books. My main thing when it came to movies based on books is that it had to be done right. It definitely seemed like the odds be ever in our favor because it became a big hit for Lionsgate and producer Nina Jacobson. Year after year after year, I never wanted to miss a single ""Hunger Games"" film when it came out at the movies. Now my mission is complete and the powerful story of Katniss Everdeen comes to an end in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2"". Now, beware for what I am about to tell you because this is a grim, emotionally gripping and thrilling finale that already had me hooked. It's quite better than ""Mockingjay: Part 1"", to which some fans were disappointed by it (not me, okay, maybe a little), and even though it doesn't reach the epic quality of the first two films, it's safe to say that this is the best finale of a series that's more human and thought-provoking than any YA series out there. Part 2 of ""Mockingjay"" begins immediately after the events of Part 1. After a brutal attack caused by her love, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) due to the ""hijacking"" by the always subtly vicious President Snow (Donald Sutherland), Katniss (the always phenomenal Oscar-Winner Jennifer Lawrence) has reached her breaking point. She vows to take down Snow and the tyrannical Capital. Teamed up with Commander Boggs (Mahershala Ali), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Finnick (Sam Claflin), Katniss seems ready to go, but it's not an easy way to get there. The entire city is booby-trapped with pods. Some are terrifying (like the unforgettable Lizard Mutts), some are disturbing (like floor mines) and some are definitely tricky (like thick black oil and machine guns). As the movie progresses, Peeta joins in, still messed up, and Katniss and the Squad 451 team has discovered that they are in a real-life war, where, as always, there are shocking casualties and no easy way out this time. I guess, we can say that they are played for pawns again and it turns into ""the 76th Hunger Games"", as Finnick reminds us. Throughout this fast-paced movie, it's less humorous and more darker and intense than the previous films. But it's more mature, more stronger and it's quite unflinching when its socio-political issues are shown to us in some moments. Katniss remains the Mockingjay, which is quite similar to Jennifer Lawrence who has become the real Mockingjay. They both have been plucked from obscurity and reached for something big by being what people really want from them and they do succeed at what they do the best. Both director Francis Lawrence and star Jennifer Lawrence (no relation), unsurprisingly, are the keys to making this remarkable series work. (Gary Ross did a fantastic job directing the first one). But I've been saying too much about them in my reviews of the films, let me give some support to the rest of the team. Props has to go to casting director Debra Zane for finding this excellent all-star team. From Woody Harrelson as Haymitch to Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket to the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee to Julianne Moore as President Alma Coin to Jena Malone as Johanna Mason to Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman to Natalie Dormer as Cressida and to, of course, Willow Shields as Katniss' sister, Prim. Everyone (well, not everyone) has their moments here and we get to say goodbye to these beloved characters and worlds that Suzanne Collins created. In the last installment, the stakes are higher than they have been before and Katniss will be tested in different ways that will lead her to make a choice or two that will change the dystopian world of Panem. Plus, it avoids the conventional happy ending and leave us with sparks of hope, even though ""there are much worse games to play"". What an amazing series. What a terrific finale. To quote Effie Trinket, ""Breathe it all in, Katniss. This is all for you.""","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Some critics think this is weak one of all, but I don't agree, don't get wrong it is flawed, I would not say it's the weakest. Action scenes are well done, the futuristic look very real, no fantasy to it what so ever. Jennifer Lawrence is really great as Katniss, giving quite an Oscar worthy performance. So does Josh Hutcherson has Peeta, you just really feel there connection.

However, for some reason, they didn't seem to have nearly as much money for it as for the first two adaptations of the books, so they had a lot of talking and intriguing and expressing of feelings and that kind of crap. When the action came up, which was supposed to be a full assault on Panem, turned into a huge Hunger Game by president Snow, it focused solely on Katniss and her team and left the rest to our imagination. What should have been an epic Save Private Ryan kind of thing was a jumbled mess that didn't make any sense of people moving underground and between destroyed buildings that somehow were entire death traps.Not only did the characters leap out of character, but with extra time on their hands, the movie makers couldn't even build a coherent narrative. I am not even going to go through the individual lacks of sense that made me not feel the story at all, because they are so many.Bottom line: a failure of a film.

Why?! Because the writer just couldn't find a way to answer emotional issues they have. At the time you want to see what is going on in the field this triangle of love slows you down a lot! Why because the writer just couldn't find some other times for their issue and the funny thing is, it all goes to an unsolved mystery at the end!The First half of the film has a very slow storytelling and like part 1 you are just watching the guesses for what may happen in the Big War! That's not the only problem for this part 2 of Hunger Games Mockingjay movie which could be all in one part too!! There are many unsolved mysteries in this part. We wait almost 1 year to find out what happened to the Peeta that he acts crazy and the funny thing is you never find out! You never see what President Snow have done to him, any torture or brain washing or and etc. yes nothing at all! And then after few attacks from him to Katniss all the problem solve with one snow white kiss!! Good very romantic!!! Another problem is you waited all these long to see the big power of Capital and President Snow and during first half of the film you see that he is talking about big war and horrible attacks that come to the Katniss team but what you get is just a mix cocktail of his traps during the Hunger Game 1 and some zombie beasts!!!! Yeah, no big army or smart plan to fill the city with blood!!(As he says in the beginning) the best hilarious problem, at the end of the film, is the triangle love we spoke about. You never get any clue how and why Gale wants to betray against its own people and especially Katniss, because he knows she would be in the place where bombs drop! so in one scene she asks Gale that: have you done it and he says Yes, oh my God, can you believe it, problem solved Gale suddenly becomes the bad guy for no reason and Katniss left all alone for Peeta !wow what could be more tragic than this!!! And here we are achieving the best Part. The moment director and writer surprise you!!! Wow, what it is!! Katniss will go to kill President Snow in front of all people and get revenge? Does she let President Alma coin who we clearly see that is turning a new President Snow with dictator ideas win this war? Oh wow, what a surprise! Katniss just killed President Alma!! I mean come on that was your best shot!!!! Anyway sorry it took long but this movie was really on my nerve after what I saw in Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which was a new idea and admired it but what we saw later was only disappointment. Thank you for reading my review.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"10","/10","An astonishing finale to an exceptional franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3717861/?ref_=tt_urv","DanielJamesAplin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64331962/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2017","""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" defiantly finishes the franchise with a bang, no not a bang something even more than that. ""Mockingjay Part 2"" defiantly gives the fans a more than satisfying conclusion. The plot begins at the same point ""Mockingjay Part 1"" left off. For all past deaths made as entertainment, and for the insidious modification of Peeta, Katniss deems to strike out on her own to take down President Snow once and for all, but being the Mockingjay, the living symbol of the rebellion now headed by Alma Coin, has its drawbacks. Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed. Once again the director ""Francis Lawrence"" is very smooth with his style and truly is the perfect director for these films. He again brings very beautiful visuals to the screen with the locations and brings back the ""games"" in a perfect way. ""Jennifer Lawrence"" was exceptional as always but in this one she defiantly boosts her performance as a character with PTSD. I can proudly say that this is the best she preformed in the franchise and even up to ""Silver Linings"" and ""Joy"" standards. ""Josh Hutcherson"" is very good in this film as well. Although this is his toughest part in the role yet is defiantly not his best as I liked him a lot better in Mockingjay Part 1. ""Sam Claflin"" also boosts his game as Finnick Odair and with a lot more screen time then he had in ""Mockingjay Part 1"". This film has major character development and its amazing to watch on screen. To see where Katniss began at the beginning of the movie to the end blows your mind. But unfortunately the Secondary characters do not have as big character development they still do have some. You can tell they spent every single penny they had wisely on this film. With an extremely high budget of an estimated $160 Million the special effects are exceptional. The underground lizard mutts where very very well done in terms of CGI as well as the multiple explosions and the avenue of the tributes in snows execution scene. The Original Motion Score composed by James Newton Howard was one of the best in the Franchise. With the multiple standouts being, your favourite colour is green, Sewer Attack, Rebels Attack, Snows Execution and the Medley. Once again the Pace in this film is perfect. The aim when Squad 451 got into the capitol was to make it feel like a ghost town and the pace at that point made it feel so much more like the ghost town they where going for. Then it starts to speed up with the majority of the action scenes in the middle at its climax. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" is a more than satisfying ending to the franchise as it goes out with a bang. With exceptional acting, characters, special effects, pace and a perfect score and no flaws. In my opinion it's the best in the franchise. I give 2015's ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" a 10/10""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's not good, either, but knocking it, I won't, because it is just simply not really, really my kind of thing, an adventure heroine for tomboys. But I won a complete box-set of all four, so me complain, no. And it's one big opus, I'd grant anybody that, not to be ridiculed.But...It is kinda dull compared to what you'd expect, given this Katniss Fandom. But yee-whiz, there's a bit in here which will wake the whole theater of sleepyheads. Those white maggoty monstrosities, they erupt onto the screen, ain't nobody yawning in front of the TV no more! Doesn't save the movie as a whole, but if there were more really suspenseful scenes like that (and the immediately following cement shrapnel ricochet bit) then it sure would have been different.When Katniss took aim with the bow, I think everybody knew what was gonna happen. That was so, so obvious. Just saying. When the people began trudging off to the Palace, I thought ""what fools"" hell, this movie sure depicts the masses as stupid sheep. Kinda unlikely that people would have fallen for that ol' gimmick. That one is something I'm not just saying. That's kinda corny, I'd say, in this day and age, in a future with very interesting hologram technology, not the Middle Ages anymore, people wouldn't be so led by their noses.Uhm, Mockingjay, the Mockingjay theme was almost all but absent in the final. No little birdie. Only one twitter on the televised thingie. Just saying. And that costume, I have a big screen, but it was just black and functional, not much of a Mockingjay. Just saying.She chooses... Oops! Not gonna spoil. But she chooses that halfway dorky guy??? Argh. Just saying, no way, bad, bad choice.Overall, the movie joins the ranks of overblown ice-cold movies. Unsmiling cold heroine, think UNDERWORLD and ULTRAVIOLET, not my kind of thing. But those franchises were filled with lots and lots of good stretches, this one, blegh, no, not so much. Not so much at all.But I could see what they saw in the concept of the first one. Sport to the death (for the guys), and a kick-ass heroine (generally for everybody) That first bit of the theme was, oddly enough, discarded. Don't know why. Don't really care, not my thing anyway, but they were sitting there with the golden goose...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, President Snow knows shes coming for him and throws obstacles her way to kill and stop her and her squad. The shocking ending is worth while.

Everyone should witness this shocking finale.""What do all those deaths mean? They mean that our lives were never ours. There was no real life because we didn't have any choice.

Simply fantastic. But then the studio made the worst decision to split the final book, which was also the weakest book, into two movies and what we get is a dull, sloppy, forced filmNow, to be fair, this latest installment was far better than Part 1, but with that being said, it was so painfully obvious that it did not need to be split into two movies. I felt even the actors were over this. I did enjoy the intense moments once Katniss and her crew were finally in the capitol and had to maneuver through the city avoiding deadly traps. There were great moments in these scenes. But even these scenes could not save the slow and somewhat fatigue state this franchise has brought. I think had it ended last year, with Part one and two as one movie it would have ended on a high note, but then they wouldn't get the money from us moviegoers by milking it into two movies. So there you go. It was an okay, one time see. But I have no desire to see it again and by this point could care less if Katniss made it through.","7 out of 32 found this helpful.

We've seen it happen to so many franchises but I thought Hunger Games would be different. The first film is a great film in a contained universe. Catching Fire expanded upon what was great in the first film and reached new heights for the franchise in spectacle and in impeccable execution in all areas. Mockingjay part 1 felt like a solid first half of movie but also managed to complete it's own arc in the process. Part 2 on the other-hand, doesn't come all that close to being the epic conclusion I had hoped for. It flirts with greatness in certain scenes, but it's lengthy run-time and strange ending(s) close off the series in a disappointing way.Katniss and the rebels begin the film trying to do everything they can to get every one of the Districts on their side. Sounds a whole lot like the first part doesn't it? Well, that's because it is. As Katniss and the crew go on their various adventures en route to the capitol, it felt like a rehash of the entire first Mockingjay. It's one of my main issues with the film, we were being built up to an epic ending and satisfying closure, but there really is no point in the film where you get that emotional punch as you did watching the previous three.That is of course with the exception of the second act/middle part to the film. The crew is forced to take their cause underground whilst just outside of the capitol, and the most intense segment of the film followed. The sewer scene is brilliantly shot and directed to create a claustrophobic feel with edge of your seat action. It definitely does that, and this scene alone is worth a second viewing. We also have a few more small scenes that followed that equaled that tension.But I guess my problem is that the film's last 40 minutes go off the rails. Not only are there at least 15 different so called endings to the film, but we truly never get the climatic battle the trailers or other films seemed to promise. I never read any of the books, so I can't speak to that side of things. I know plenty of people who read the books that liked this film. But for me, I just hated where the story went. I hated where the characters ended up. I really felt there were opportunities within that final third act to hit us with big twist after big twists and emotional payoffs, but none of them were there. It's not that I think Mockingjay part 2 is a bad film. I have seen a number of 2015 films that are far worse with plenty of more problems. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this film is a huge let down. It had a chance to have that emotional weight and gravitas that Deathly Hallows part 2 had, but to no avail. Man am I let down right now. The odds were most definitely not in this film's favor.+Sewer scene+Middle act's intensity and tension-Botched ending(s)-Hate where the characters go-Where was the fight for the Capitol?5.4/10","9 out of 45 found this helpful.

Does the acting have to be sub par? This isn't a spoiler alert but if I were to ask 100 people yes or no questions as to what they thought would happen in the movie, 99 would get the answers correct. I love the way Jennifer Lawrence looks in real life and I loved her in Silver Linings and Winter Bones but that doesn't mean I think she can act - because she can't. She is stiff and boring. And, don't even get me started on the tiny wisp of a fellow that played Peeta. The only thing about him that I would consider acting is that he is a man in what appears to be a child's body and it is easy to understand why the 10-14 year olds are going gaga over him. He is unbelievable as an actor, his look is non action adventure and I will never go to see him in any movie. That is, unless he starts lifting a couple weights and gets at least muscular and in shape like the other small fellow yet fun to watch actor named Tom Cruise. He can't act but he is fun to watch. Peeta is not. I recommend this movie if you are on a plane and are half way between asleep and irritated by the guy next to you. I give it a 3 because Jennifer Lawrence is hot.","12 out of 65 found this helpful.

It felt something was missing in there, like it was remote and emotionally detached - an anticlimax ending to something that should have blown up in your face.But somehow I learned to deal with the disappointment, and found out that it was exactly how it should be. This is a story about Katniss Everdeen.Katniss had been forced to fight. She was used as a tool by two opposing political forces. She had not been a fighter before the games, it should be natural that she was not on the front line of the war, and saw little actions. It is befitting for her story to end in a personal level. The deaths were written briefly in the books, and they were just as detached as it was in the movie. Perhaps it's just how Katniss' personality deals with it. She didn't look too emotional when it happened, but we know she'll have her scars for the rest of her life.If it had been done differently, the movie might have more favorable rating out there, but it would lose the feeling of the book.And the book was not an action book, it was a bitter,darker reflection of our modern society - which is already in the grasps of manipulative Media Empires.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutchinson, Liam Hemsworth, Julianna Moore, Woody Harrelson, Elizebeth Banks, and Donald SutherlandAs the war of Panem escalates to the destruction of other districts by the Capitol, Katniss Everdeen, the reluctant leader of the rebellion, must bring together an army against President Snow, while all she holds dear hangs in the balance.The Hunger Games is one of those movie franchises that gets better with every movie, or so I thought prior to viewing this movie. The original was a strong starter to a franchise that held its themes close but didn't quite explore them. Catching Fire featured some breath taking action sequences and a mature drama. Mocking Jay Part 1, which I will refer to as MJ P1, made the decision to be a wrought dystopian propaganda piece that had layers of subtext, which made up for its overlong length. So when I found out this propaganda premise and brutal violence would be meshed I was more than skeptical.My concerns were met with the most timid and lackluster entry into the once great franchise. Overlong and lacking purpose this movie inept. All of this can be blamed on the writers and director since the actors give it their all.The writers opt for a heavy handed approach to its delegate themes and loose the intelligence of the past two entries, this movie feels less like a Hunger Games film and more like a soap opera, that takes itself too seriously and prompts a ton of unintentional laughs. Though the fight and chase scenes, shot by Francis Laurence, are grand they are too scattered to have much effect. The pacing issues that plagued the last movie return in full force leaving audiences wondering why a propaganda story was told, past the first act, instead of epic war movie we were promised. Anticlimactic would accurately describe most of the movie's script. With that being said, the last 45 minutes featured some serious and heart wrenching twists, ripped straight out of the novel for a reasonably satisfying end; that is until the epilogue. The epilogue to this movie adds and extra 20 minutes to the run time and ruins one of the greatest heroines put to the silver screen. Speaking of our daring heroine, Jennifer Lawrence once again shines in her role as Katniss Everdeen. She is reserved and gloomy but understands when a meltdown is needed to demonstrate the complex emotional state of her character. Taking beating one after the other on the emotional and physical level, Lawrence demonstrates a sheer lust for revenge perfectly. She gives it her all and she basically saves the movie.Julianna Moore is also very good in the movie playing both sides of the Coin; she embodies the character. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Chaflin churn out some reliably good performances. Josh Hutchinson plays a sympathetic lead even is he was completely irrelevant to the plot and comes of as more of a liability.Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 is the most middling entry in the series boasting a simplistic script and a plodding pace that is only saved by a handful good performances and some great twists. Hunger Games Mocking Jay Part 2 gets a C+ or a 5/10","9 out of 48 found this helpful.

No review from any authority was going to change that. Well my fellow 10%, I guess this is for you. I am unfamiliar with the source material, but I have been coerced into attending every predecessor of Part 2. They were passable adventures that lacked an interesting setting or characters, but this was partially compensated by some intense thrills. Honestly, this movie is more of the same, but enough worse that I feel it is worth attempting to spare a few undecided souls. Many of Mockingjay's problems can be derived from the division into two parts. I cannot believe there was a creative reason for this. This decision mangles the narrative thread. Part 2 plays the ultimate role in the franchise, but the structure within is completely lost. Every plot point is hyperextend in order to create some semblance of justification. Everything lingers. The division also damages the emotional impact of character deaths. There are many and each should be a piece of passionate punctuation. Unfortunately, those who were not on a first name basis with minor characters coming in are left trying to remember why they should care. The ending is equally messy. There are few emotional peaks in the final third that could theoretically serve as the climax. However, there are still plot points to be addressed so the audience falls from each passionate high. Maybe a more skill storyteller could have utilized this push pull. One intended dramatic scene involves Katniss Everdeen screaming at a cat. Our protagonist is emotionally broken and my fellow audience members were laughing. In the final monologue, the line ""I have nightmares too"", was also meet with a few audible chuckles. What a disaster. I overreact. It is simply a frustrating chore watching a movie so devoid of inspiration. At least the actors tried, the only real highlight. Jennifer Lawrence is too talented to be wasted like this. I might have Star Wars on the brain, but I kept having flashbacks to Episode II. There too was a gifted actress saying the silliest lines in the name of love. That comparison might be a reach. I blame the Jedi hoody warn by Katniss along with the Stormtrooper knock offs. The role players might have pulled it off better only because there was less time to scrutinize them. I am not going to end this by saying Mockingjay Part 2 is a bad movie and you're a bad person for wanting to see it. Go have fun. I hope the books you love so dear are enough to sweep away the little flaws of the film. Just please, don't drag your friend along.","10 out of 55 found this helpful.

The sets are fantastic and some of the special effects are flawless there are just not enough of them. You just know once an action scene finished there is going to be another spout of boring conversation. This means the movie never really gains any pace and you are left frustrated.

In the penultimate chapter of the saga, Katniss Everdeen is ready to take the fight to the Capitol and its autocratic ruler, President Snow. With all she holds dear hanging in the balance, Katniss must bring together an army and take back Panem.To be fair, there are some positives. Finally, Mockingjay – Part 2 solidified the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss Everdeen, which is to say that she practically owned the character throughout the whole movie. When she was emotional, you felt it. Jennifer Lawrence has such great range, so she could have phoned it in. Also, the action was very crisp. With the ""action"" in the first part, director Francis Lawrence knew he had to step it up in the final chapter. He didn't disappoint to that extent, giving us some pretty riveting and intense action sequences. Donald Sutherland as Snow was even better. He does a good job portraying a really cold and sadistic person.Unfortunately, just like Katniss' namesake, things burned out really quickly. The rest of the actors weren't as great or even decent compared to the main hero. While some of the action scenes were great, there were multiple pacing issues within the film, along with some very questionable changes and uneven storytelling. The film suffers from having the two-part split, forcing the crew to elongate a film designed to be only about 2 hours into a two-part 4 hour flick. Also, some of the tension kind of didn't land as it should have. The Katniss/Peeta relationship that the films has been building just doesn't land at all either. I was never sold on the romance and I should have been, seeing as the movie forced that into our throat.It's not all bad. Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 was a serviceable end to a very decent film series. It isn't perfect, but it is serviceable. Rent the movie and check it out, but it's not the magnum-opus Lionsgate needed it to be.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Big Action Finale to the HUNGER GAMES Saga","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3591531/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","4 December 2016","We're four movies deep into the HUNGER GAMES franchise and, while it's been a good ride, I'm glad to be done with it. With the exception of CATCHING FIRE (which I loved), I've found the series could best be described as good, not great. Over the course of the series' release, I've never been excited to see a new HUNGER GAMES. I've just sort of followed it because it was reasonably entertaining and I felt the compulsion to finish the series once I started it. So, unless author Suzanne Collins feels the need to continue the saga, I've reached the end with having finally watched MOCKINGJAY - PART II. It begins almost immediately following the end of the first part (as one would expect) with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) recovering from Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) brain-washing induced assault upon his return to his friends in District 13. The war carries on and the district militia is closing in on the Capitol. Katniss has reached her breaking point with the torture Peeta endured during his captivity and she's ready to bring the war to President Snow (Donald Sutherland). She stows away to the front lines and is assigned to a group of insurgents who are sneaking into the Capitol to produce more propos, but Katniss isn't interested in continuing to fuel the propaganda machine any longer. She's going in with the intention of making her way right to President Snow's front door so she can end this bloody war once and for all.The original HUNGER GAMES caught my attention because the idea of a bunch of kids murdering each other for rich people's entertainment seemed a pretty solid premise. CATCHING FIRE then kicked the series into high gear with what I'd argue is the best of the franchise before the first MOCKINGJAY dropped the ball. The first MOCKINGJAY wasn't bad but it was missing all of the stuff that made the series so fun to watch (i.e. adolescents trained to become gimmicky killers in an arena where even the environment is built to murder you). PART I was a strange entry because it was more a gritty war film where we watched Katniss embrace her role as the district militia's figurehead, the Mockingjay, while dealing with all the PTSD that comes with surrounding yourself in death and destruction. That's cool and all, but it felt unnaturally heavy in tone when placed next to the previous two films. PART II sort of brings it back around. Katniss has got a bloodlust for President Snow; she's a battle- worn shell of her former self and she's focused on her one and only goal. There's still the emotional bits in there to give the movie some humanity but now it's not so depressing. Katniss is back in the middle of her love triangle now that Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta are both back in her life, and we've been around this band of characters enough now that you might genuinely feel something when familiar faces die.In PART II, we bring back some of that old HUNGER GAMES formula with environmental traps. When the militia moves into the Capitol, President Snow and his cronies decide the best means of handling them is to turn the entire city into one giant Hunger Game. Setting aside the fact that there's no way this number of complex, camouflaged urban traps (or ""pods"" as the movie refers to them) could've been set in such a short amount of time and therefore must've been installed well before the events of the movies (no Capitol citizen bothered to question why big freakin' machine gun turrets were being installed behind false panels in their apartment complex?), it makes the movie loads more fun and brings us back to the vibe of the first two movies. Almost half the movie is just Katniss and her crew sneaking through the city and encountering trap after creative and visually stimulating trap. Buzz saw floors, vicious mutants, the aforementioned machine gun turretswe're getting back to basics and I was digging it. In fact, everything was pretty cool and rivalling CATCHING FIRE until that last forty minutes or so. I won't spoil details but, of course, this is the final installment and so everything's being wrapped up. We've invested a lot of time in watching this Districts vs Capitol drama so I was expecting something more dynamic at the end and, for a brief minute, it feels like we're going to get it. Then we don't. Then the movie takes forever to end.I was really enjoying MOCKINGJAY - PART II until that last act. Regardless, it's still a good movie and a fine end to what has become a serviceable franchise that was capable of appealing to mass audiences outside its original target of teenage girls. Fans of the series (who somehow haven't seen the film before reading my thoughts on it here) are sure to be pleased. The HUNGER GAMES movies have been a pleasant surprise and it was a winning formula of writing, casting, and filmmaking that hasn't been successfully recreated since. So go, enjoy the big finale to the traumatizing adventures of Katniss Everdeen and hope the studios don't strong-arm Suzanne Collins into writing any cash-grab sequels/prequels that would spoil its quality track record.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Going into the final part, there are many outstanding plotlines and set ups in need of resolution and each one gets stitched up soundly. And while the books are categorized as Young Adult fiction, there's deeper subtexts to both the books and the movies that are not over-simplified for young fans. It makes sense why, out of all its dystopian counterparts, the Hunger Games had the broadest age range in their audience.Far and away from the previous film, Part 2 builds the first string of action relatively quickly and it hardly slows down past the 45-minute mark. The ""slow"" moments allow conversations that move the personal inner workings (B plots) along with the main dynamics in political power (A plot) and are well-balanced. Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence's chemistry is back and much more fragile and intriguing than ever. With it, so is the strange 'love triangle' with Liam's Hemsworth's character that doesn't quite work at this point in the series.The overall experience of the movie seems to be an attempt to have the audience live through every moment with the characters. Many scenes bleed together and a substantial number all happen in the same day as the others around it. While some moviegoers may like this strategy, it can be very divisive. I am usually on the fence about it personally, but this film takes too many liberties with it. At some points, it felt more like I was watching an action video game than a full-fledged film. However, by the end, that is not overwhelmingly the case.Watching the fallout of the climax unfold is one of my favorite segments in the series and as the final one I find it the most compelling.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first two movies were still great although some of it was rather predictable but the last two movies ........ yeaaaah, no.For starters, the writing becomes incredibly sloppy. You're not watching a classic here - predictable pop-corny tag lines, an even more annoying focus on relationships, sob time every 20 minutes. If done well, it could work but Katniss really becomes a ""girl perfect"" who goes from a crying broken girl to ""moment of epiphany"" girl, then gives an amazing speech and somehow gets everyone's support. It got tired after movie two, we're now at movie 4 and even some of the in-movie characters get sick of it. Especially since they use this trick half a dozen times in these last two movies.Then there's the plot elements which basically consist of ""Katniss refuses to listen to anyone even if it means the deaths of lots of people"" but somehow the movie never makes it clear exactly how egotistical she is.It's not helped that the tactics of the ""Capitol"" are completely baffling - having the most amazing technologies at their disposal, they use it like they did in the first two movies: as if it's all a game, turning it on or off for suspense as if the whole world was still watching it all on TV. It. Makes. No. Sense. Proper use of these weapons would have killed Katniss and company a dozen times over.In the end, it reads like fan fiction. Poorly thought out, sloppily written and it never gets smart, never gets deep.Except the end. The end is what saves the movie somewhat after over an hour and a half of dross. It still makes for a half decent movie but don't expect the quality of the first two movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In many ways he expresses the love for life, the sacrifice and the responsibility that it means to be alive and let live by giving Katniss bread in many different ways, literally giving her bread but also making her hungry for life: She even describes the kiss in the cave and the kiss on the beach as an instant in which it leaves you hungry for more. Peeta was offering Katniss the chance to pursue life through a kiss.""Panem et Circum"" means to denounce the immobility of the citizens of Rome against the intrigues of the leaders and the maneuvers they use to control the population. On the other hand it is a historical fact that the ruling class was funding grandiose celebrations to ensure calm for people drowning in the illusion of the happiness of the masses. On my opinion, this is still happening, ofcourse not as explicit as The Hunger Games show, but it does, and for me it all goes back to what Plutarch says to Katniss at the end: ""Now we are in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated. But collective thinking is usually shortlived. We are fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it.""Good reading and enjoy watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the movie is well-made with great special effects and strong performances from the cast, it falls short of its potential. As with most book-to-movie adaptations, the book is better.The film picks up where the previous one left off, with Katniss Everdeen leading the rebels in their final assault against the Capitol. The action scenes are thrilling and intense, and the film does a good job of capturing the horrors of war. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful and emotional performance as Katniss, but the supporting cast members are often underutilized.One of the main issues with the movie is its pacing. It feels slow at times, and the story drags in some parts. It also lacks the sense of urgency that the book conveys so well. Additionally, the movie changes some key elements from the book, which may disappoint fans of the series.Overall, ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" is an okay movie, but it is not as good as the first film in the series. The book is definitely better, and fans of the series may feel let down by the movie's deviations from the source material.

However, I was hoping that the outcome of the saga would be a little better, but I was wrong. This is the worst film in the franchise and the most unbearable. Again, it wasn't necessary that long. Here it becomes even worse because it has more action scenes and can be more drawn out. The ending is a sad moment, not because it is emotional, but because an outcome so bad that it took two films to happen is deplorable. Nothing excites you and few moments manage to hold your attention. The Hunger Games has never been a high quality franchise, however, the end managed to be worse than the rest.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I personally wasn't bored watching any of them and I recently binged all four movies back to back. The only thing I will say is it's a bit depressing, but that is kind of the point and I always say if a movie can elicit an emotional response (other than hatred of the movie) then it is well done.I read the books but don't remember all of it, I do remember some of the scenes being fairly identical to what happens in the books and there is a lot going on.I would equate this series a lot like the Harry Potter series, they drew that out into an extra movie too and I didn't mind that one bit.As for the quality of the movie it is top notch. Great acting, great action, great special effects and a pretty decent bad guy that gets enough screen time that the character feels deep enough to hate.Would recommend to anyone who likes sci fi action but I would say this is not a stand alone movie you probably should at least watch the one before it if not the whole series. Don't listen to the haters give it a go.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie hits right home with this theme in a way that democratic and luxurious societies won't understand or enjoy.Mockingjay pt2 delivers a suspenseful and emotional ride as Katniss and the other rebels set out on a mission to kill the ruthless president Snow. The film plays heavy on its politics, showing the ugly side of revolutions. It would have been easy to make a pure good vs. pure evil scenario, but the movie shows a lot of gray areas and stresses on the fact the no one is incorruptible, which is far more enjoyable in terms of storytelling.The film also does justice to its characters in their final journey, and has great performances by its two leads. J.Lawrence excels in portraying a determined Katniss fighting to subdue her tortured emotions for the sake of a bigger cause, she perfectly balances the strength of making sacrifices and becoming merciless in war without losing her humanity. Hutcherson gives his best acting shot as a confused Peeta fighting battles both on the ground and within his mind, and his monologues arrive with several meaningful moments that remind us of what 'The Hunger Games' were all about. However, its D.Sutherland's and J.Moore's sickening performances as two similar nemeses, that elevated this young-adult film to a whole new level.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While I enjoyed the first two movies in the series, I found Part 1 rather unmemorable. But one could simply chalk that up to the new strategy of making single books into two films, which has not proved successful in any instance thus far. I thought the movie had plenty of potential, and was mildly entertained during some points, mainly the march to the capital, which did seem to keep everyone fairly engaged. The constant need for a lackluster-rousing speech by Katniss started to chew away at my enjoyment during the first half. Coupled with the whole somber vibe of Peeta and the if anything annoying tension between him and Katniss, I quickly started to lose interest. All the emotional moments I found almost laughable, since the movie in no way engaged the audience enough to empathize with it's characters. It's as if the filmmakers just hoped everyone was attached enough from the first three films that they didn't think they had to add any appeal to empathy. Even when they did slow the film down and attempt to draw in viewers emotionally, the scene would cut dramatically to a different sequence so quick that you could wonder if there was any point to the previous scene whatsoever. The pacing of the film was an utter disaster, in my opinion, and that's what ultimately caused me to rate it a 4. The jumps from action sequences to over dramatic and repetitive conversations was just too much for me. It's a poorly made movie with mildly entertaining traps and action that leaves you unsatisfied and shaking your head at the end.","7 out of 42 found this helpful.

It isn't unusual for me to read the book(s) after watching the film(s), but for some reason there's always a worry that the movie isn't going to live up to the book when you've read the book. I have to confess that this is very much the way I felt about the Hunger Games movies.The splitting up of the Mockingjay really smacks of the movie producers earning more revenue rather than any artistic reason. To be fair to the producers it's mission accomplished as the combined box office for the 2 Mockingjay movies will be well in excess of the Catching Fire movie.As for the movie itself it is very hard to feel much empathy with Katniss(Lawrence), Peeta(Hutcherson) or Gale(Hemsworth) as they take on the might of President Snow. Some of the set pieces are reminiscent of the Mission Impossible franchise scenes which are just dumb and implausible. Personally I hope there isn't a prequel for whilst there's potential for it to be good, there's much more potential for it to be a stinker!","5 out of 27 found this helpful.

Under Frank's helm, the horrors of the war against the capital is in full display and sincerely felt. His portrayal is honest & unnerved in showcasing the deadliest tactics and the body count that ensues. As a result, stakes are higher and well perceived, action is INTENSE AS HELL which is the film's highlight & outcomes are shocking to say the least. And this is from someone who read the book!As for the acting, props to ALL the supporting characters. Despite being relegated to the sidelines, their brief appearances deliver poignant scenes. It is only Jennifer Lawrence's acting that I reman aloof as it is too ""cinematic"" & less natural for my taste. Nevertheless, we have her to thank for an iconic Katniss.Overall, Frank Lawrence's adaptation adds a resounding closure to the one of the best dystopian film franchises we have today. It is a great watch for both hardcore fans and casual movie goers looking for a film with substance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The war of Panem escalates and so Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the reluctant leader of the rebellion, takes her team consisting of Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Cressida (Natalie Dormer) and others to Capitol in hopes of assassinating Snow and returning peace to Panem. In the meantime she tries to return Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) to his normal state. Other characters include President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her associates (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Mahershala Ali). Woody Harrelson, Jena Malone, Patina Miller and Elizabeth Banks are also on hand.I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em (mainly 'cause my wife likes 'em). I gave the first one a 7/10 and the next two devolved in value. This final sequel is a natural extension, but like the other films there's not a lot of action and the drama isn't very compelling, but it's okay. It comes across as drama for teenage girls, which shouldn't be surprising since that's the target audience of the books. Nevertheless, Jennifer is a likable, fair protagonist and I appreciate the realistic air and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept. The movie (and series) just needed more oomph and depth. However, I salute Katniss' decision to do what she had to do to Hilarity at the end. Oh, wait, that wasn't Hilarity.The first and third films were highlighted by the great closing songs ""Abraham's Daughter"" by Arcade Fire and ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" by Lorde, but the second and fourth films lack such a highlight.The film is overlong at 137 minutes and was shot in Georgia, USA, Germany and France.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10 Stars)","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's like suddenly the audiences are watching a different cinematic universe when they are all adapted into the first two. As such, part 1 is boring and slow, but as we all get to see part 2, we have the patience to forgive that it takes time to build up the ground for the story of part 2 the final. However, it turns out that's not the case.Part 2 is even boring and the pace is strange. Sometimes it is too slow in the drama part that you are like watching Steven Spielberg's Lincoln. And the action part is too short to create a tension like the first two. What's the success of the first two Hunger Games, are the anxiety that the characters may got kill in every minutes and the contrast of the high glamorous society with the middle age look sections. In this film, you cannot see these elements going on. This in- consistence makes the audiences draw back from the film with lots of disappointments. The story line is fine but the directing just ruins the whole franchise.Unlike the Harry Potter and Twilights that has a point to split the ending into the two films, this mocking jay is absolute a failing in doing so.","8 out of 51 found this helpful.

Francis Lawrence returned to direct this fourth and final movie based on the popular young adult novels by Suzanne Collins. Mockingjay Part 2 continues the disappointing direction of the series, focusing on politics and propaganda, rather than on the visceral action and interesting characters that made the first two films so enjoyable.Some quick thoughts about Part 1 before I begin discussing Part 2 in further detail: I don't believe this novel should have been split into two films. The Mockingjay book is just as long as the first two novels in the series, and Catching Fire, in particular, did a great job of adapting the novel into only one film. But hey, it's all about the $$$.Mockingjay Part 2 continues the uninteresting storyline in which District 13 is attempting to portray Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) as the symbol of the rebellion. Katniss is bottled up for a majority of Part 1 and Part 2, acting in propaganda videos and being babysat by those around her. She rarely gets to use her bow and arrow to actually fight for herself. Katniss doesn't need her bow and arrow in order to be defined as a strong character, but the fact that she doesn't have a huge role in the actual rebellion is a huge waste of her potential.Mockingjay Part 2 is also very slow. There is nearly an hour before there is any action, and there are only a few major action sequences in the whole film. Yes, the first two films are largely without action until their respective Hunger Games, but at least in those films you were being introduced to a new world and interesting characters, not watching an advertising campaign. However, there is one action sequence in a sewer that I thought was exciting, and suspenseful.There are no bad performances in Mockingjay Part 2. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, and the supporting performances are all fine. Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta, and while he does a fine job with what he's given, he is limited by the fact that his character is brainwashed throughout. This is disappointing considering I always found him to be one of the more interesting characters in the world of Panem.Without any spoilers, the film's ending is very anticlimactic and feels very forced. The ending dampens the events of the previous films and really made me wonder, ""It all lead to THIS?""Mockingjay Part 1 started the negative turn in momentum in the series, and Part 2 could never get that train back (to District 12) on track. *cue Rue's whistle*If you liked this review, check out more of my reviews over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com","4 out of 20 found this helpful.

I am one of those people. But, to be honest, the film disappointed me... I've been expecting something better. No, I haven't wasted my time, but I didn't enjoy this creation. The book reader sinks in action between the first 10 pages, but in film, you are watching the first 30 minutes and still, nothing's happening. I had started to get bored. The weakest part of script is that... okay, there are a lot of unexpected twists and moments, but this is the backbone of film, the film is based on this. And it's impossible to watch this movie for the second time, because there will be nothing fresh. The idea is quite original, but quite flat as well. The only thing that I cannot complain about is visual effects - that's majestic. So. The film is better than the big part of action movies. At least I am trying to believe this statement. You will enjoy dramatic plot twists, but I will not watch this for the second time, because there will be no drama, intriguing parts or something like that left. I recommend this for easy and light Friday evening with your friends. Nothing more.","4 out of 22 found this helpful.

"5","/10","This Story Just Went Way Off Course","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3362600/?ref_=tt_urv","caseynicholson","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29348863/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2015","Okay, so for starters, I've not read the books at all. I only got into ""The Hunger Games"" series with the first movie, which I thought was great. The second movie was fine, the third one took me a second viewing to really appreciate, but after seeing it again I was into the direction that everything seemed to be heading.And then last night I saw ""Mockingjay Part 2"", and I have to say that the whole series just ended quite oddly. There was plot twist after plot twist--so much so that it was obvious that the author was just adding in those twists as a way to shock the audience and to keep things fresh, as opposed to telling a genuinely entertaining and engaging story.I will say that the film was extremely well made. All of the things that I normally am quite critical of that tend to make or break a movie for me, this movie did well: the pacing of the film, the acting, the dialogue and the way the film told the story it set out to tell were all exemplary. And, sure, even though I disliked the story that was told, there were nevertheless moments when that story was interesting--Katniss's eventual confrontation with the film's twin antagonists, for example.Still, the story just didn't do it for me. It would be hard to say much more without giving it all away in a spoiler, but just note that this movie doesn't lead toward a heroic resolution in the sense that one might expect. There is a great sense of unease at the film's conclusion. This wasn't the story I thought I was paying for or wanted to see.The last thing I'll note is that while the movie is well made, there is also a sense in which the film comes across as a Peter Jackson movie (LOTR/The Hobbit films), which tend to be criticized as being heavy on computer graphics that seem to be made for video game prototypes. At several points it seemed quite obvious that the main point of the film was to set up its video game rendition, as opposed to advancing the film's plot.All that said, I have to go for 5/10 stars on this one. Its well made and somewhat entertaining, but what it gets right in the storytelling department it fails in the story writing aspect.","6 out of 39 found this helpful.

And yes Harry Potter did the splitting movies into two because well, the book itself was freaking huge, so huge that a little toddler can reach the top shelf by standing on the freaking book. It's completely pointless and now every book adaptation movie is doing it just to cash in more money.I didn't like Mockingjay Part 1 that much. Nothing interesting was developed in that movie and part 1 was nothing but a set up to the next movie, which you should never do, because when you do a marathon of all of the movies, part 1 is the one that you want to skip. That's what Part 1 was 'a set up' and it doesn't stand on it's own as film (In my opinion). But all that a side, I sawed Mockingjay Part 2 a few days ago and it wasn't that great. It was way better than Part 1 when comes to something happening, but that's not saying much, because while I was watching the movie I had the same uneasy feel that Part 1 gave me and not in a good way. It isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't great.The one major positive that I can give that was all throughout The Hunger Games franchise was Jennifer Lawrence. She has so much to do here and really makes her character shine in this movie. She once again dose a great performance that wasn't over acting or being too dramatic, but it was simple and locked down. She was without a doubt the best part of this movie.This is a very dark and grim movie with no comic relief from the other characters, and these no messing around here and that element in the movie dose work...sometimes. These many scenes in this movie that was overly sad and so dramatic, to the point that I said to myself ""Oh my lord, this movie is so miserable and grim"". I know a finale like this isn't going to end quietly and it worked sometimes, but sometimes it overly did it.This is Philip Seymour Hoffman's last movie and I think the movie did justice for his character in a respectful way due to the actors passing. I know it was hard for the cast to deal with Hoffman's death, since he's character had a major scene in this movie that he never got a chance to film due to his death. I thought the movie did great job of working around it respectfully. R.I.P Philip Seymour Hoffman.Now for the problems: The first half of this movie and the last is so freaking slow with it's pacing, to the point that it was basically killing the spirit of this movie with the lack of energy. The movie never made me feel like the stakes were high as it felt too easy. There was never a moment that made me feel like I was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails worried for what's going, because as I said before the stakes never felt high to me. That's really disappointing and I had so much high hopes for this movie to be an intense finale with a satisfying ending...well I got some of that, but not the satisfying or intense part.Was the ending satisfying? well, it was fine ending, but not the best as the movie didn't know how to end. The endings were dragged out.Overall Mockingjay Part 2 will satisfy some fans of the franchise. I do think it's better Part 1 as I felt like a lot of things were happening. Unfortunately this movie dose have the same problems that Part 1 had with it's pacing and it's lack of energy. I didn't think this movie was great and I know for a fact that five years from now I will completely forget about this movie.","5 out of 34 found this helpful.

It's like nothing is here, nothing, nothing but a terrible unbearable torture 80% of the movie. I didn't get it why Peeta must be there at all, and the hell are they doing, and suddenly it becomes a zombie or alike movie where the characters die one by one.And suddenly there's twist that's also not very twisted, and everyone is like losing their own characters. This is so stupid, they should just combine it into one movie. Everything in this movie is not neccessary and too draggy (yes, it's like they keep repeating the same thing over and over again like the audience don't get it), and the relationship between Peeta and Katniss? It just portrayed really bizzarely.It's so empty, I couldn't empath a bit from the perspectives of the characters. It all went down after Catching Fire, they said. Well, I still give Mockingjay part 1 8 stars, it gives emotional waves throughout the movie, but this?No. No. No. This is a big mistake. It just makes everything about Hunger Games goes unappreciated. I give this 3 stars, but actually for the fun ride for those 3 previous movies. This one. None.

To be honest I expected the last two movies to have gone downhill as happens most often with producers losing it to dish up something even more exiting than the last box office success. And sure, there was some of that action but especially the ending was very very good .. Unpredictable and true to the character of the Mocking Jay: Fierce yet fragile and genuine, which makes up her strength. Plus the music at the end pleased me entirely. I will give this a ten just for being made so true and gentle and patient enough to show some emotion, where we're usually treated with shallow jokes, punchlines, flashcards and sensation to produce a forced smile on our numb faces. Anything to avoid genuine feelings it seems at times, quick .. make a joke! Never thought I would but I loved it .. splendid. The imagery was stunning and the details, such as the designs of the Capitol buildings very well done and reminiscent of ominous and grandiose communist regimes as we still know them around the world. I was surprised the last two movies received a slightly lower rating, they certainly did not disappoint. There's a valuable lesson about what society should do once they spot a psychopath in power .. end it on the spot, so we can all enjoy our lives in peace","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.In this film, Katniss decides to go beyond what is asked of her by the Resistance. They wanted a mascot, someone to pose and advertise their cause. She decides to take the initiative, be at the front and take part in the decisive battle for control of the Capital. She wants to kill Snow. On the other hand, she fears Peeta's mental health, after he has been rescued from the hands of the dictator. After all, he still suffers with the marks of torture and deep brainwashing he suffered.It is difficult to describe what I felt when I finished watching this film. This tetralogy was one of the most tasty and interesting that I have seen in cinema in many years. Loaded with an epic sense, a sweet scent of adventure, good action scenes and touches of social criticism, the story is very good and definitely worth it. All three previous films were able to take advantage of this and give us the best. It is true that the previous film did not seem so good, but I did not expect the disaster that this film came to be! Compared to the others, it seems made by amateurs and confirms that the idea of dividing the final book into two films was terrible. This film simply had little to tell us other than the final assault on the Capital, which should have been the final and culminating half of a third and final film. But pulling money out of the public and making them pay sounds better, and the movie industry has to bill, so let's make two films for the silly viewers to pay a little more and the studio to make a few extra million dollars.The cast remained at the same level as the previous films. If this film failed, it was not the actors' fault, but the director, Francis Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but does not bring anything new. Katniss continues to look hot in war and cold in love. Donald Sutherland was excellent, although he went a little too far in his madness and seems to be really crazy in some scenes. Julianne Moore, who gave life to President Coin, turns out to be a pleasant surprise in that she is not quite what she appears, but this turnaround was to be expected by the way the film prepared it. Josh Hutcherson continues to do a decent job, but not pleasant to me. All the other actors, who had more or less opportunities to give an air of value and talent in the previous films, practically disappear.The film is loaded with scenes of a lot of action, explosions and shots. If everything seems real, thanks to excellent sound effects and first-rate CGI, the same cannot be said of all the costumes. Peacekeepers, for example, look like Star Wars imperial soldiers. A careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and very realistic fights, along with an excellent soundtrack, complete the production values.A lot of action, explosions and shots, good actors doing the best they know, but without material to work on a film that has very little story to tell... this is how we can sum up this film, which was certainly a disappointment for many who they had enjoyed the previous films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What happens to characters after the end? To critique a story, not only we must see the words written, but also those meant, what happens between the scenes, or after the end. We a dystopia, criticizing modern issues of course, and not the future, as any dystopia or eutopia (and not utopia). And we see a hero! As always. What about the rest of people living there? And how more sexist can it get (meant spoiler), the ending? The hero -and a few more characters- can do a big success , like a revolution. But what about the rest? We can't all be big success, otherwise no one would be. This is a competitive view on society, and most stories are based on this, as well as a ""villain"" who makes the protagonist ""the good guy"" for no apparent reason: they good guys don't seem to make any big choices: they were just born in this world and (violently) fight for their lives. It also glorifies violence to some extent. And how can a story (action or not) be without all these? It can, and I have read it.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015) left me yearning for the spark that ignited the franchise. While the acting maintained a baseline competence, it lacked the emotional depth needed to truly engage the audience. The film editing felt disjointed, with scenes dragging on unnecessarily, and the pacing stumbling like a wounded tribute. The strength of the series, once a beacon of dystopian storytelling, flickered dimly in this installment, overshadowed by a weak and predictable plot. The music, a potential lifeline, failed to elevate the viewing experience, becoming a mere background hum. Cinematography, once a standout, fell into the shadows, offering little to salvage the visual journey. The message, while present, felt diluted and lost amidst the mediocre execution. Mockingjay - Part 2, sadly, became a forgettable finale to a once-promising saga.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't get around to seeing parts three and four until this year when I heard that there's a prequel coming out soon. From what I could tell, the last movie reminded the viewer that you can't appeal to your oppressor's morality. And now ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2"" features a scene where Katniss reminds her compatriots who the enemy is. This could apply to any situation where those in power try to turn the people against each other to stay in power (divide and rule, as it's known). Sometimes it does take one person to call out the lies.Anyway, it's not a masterpiece, but still a worthy end to the series.

I would only recommend seeing this entry after reviewing Mockingjay part one.It is difficult to view as a standalone entry. It is more of the same rebel fight against the Capitol evil that you saw in that entry. The cast make a good effort in their roles in particular Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman reprises his role as the curiously named Plutarch Heavensbee in scenes filmed just prior to his untimely death.Other questions still remain such as the curious love triangle between Everdeen and her childhood sweetheart Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta Melark (Josh Hutcherson). The film suffers from sequel syndrome and CGI overload in some sequences. Other great actors such as Jeffrey Wright as Beetee seem under utilised. All in all I would only recommend this film for TV or DVD viewing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is the fourth and final film in the transposition to the big screen of Suzanne Collins' trilogy of young adult novels - the last book has been turned into two movies - which I read years before the films started to appear. HG3B"" picks up exactly where ""HG3A"" ended, with the leader of the rebellion by the 13 Districts against the controlling Capitol at the evil heart of Panem, the archer Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), recovering from an attempt to strangle her by a brainwashed Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). As always, Lawrenece is terrific and, as her character has developed in the films, so in real life her acting career has been ""Catching Fire"". Hutcherson is better in this final segment as he has a more complicated character to portray. And Donald Sutherland and Julianne Moorre are both icily convincing as the presidents of Panem and the rebellion respectively. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman makes brief appearances, since the two ""Mockingjay"" films were shot back-to-back while he was still alive. .This fourth movie is the darkest of them all - both literally (especially when the action goes underground) and metaphorically (when Katniss finds that she had been increasingly manipulated by those whom she ought to have been able to trust). There are no Hunger Games as such in the final novel of the trilogy but, in this last film, effectively Panem itself has become one gigantic Hunger Games as Katniss and her combat unit have to battle all sorts of mortal challenges in the form of pods and mutts. Unlike a superhero blockbuster movie, there is no long-running final battle in which good clearly triumphs over evil; instead Katniss struggles through a whole series of physical and moral challenges that result in a serious blurring of the line between good and evil. Katniss has to make some choices, both on the battlefield and in her love life, and in each case she does what she knows to be right.This has been a satisfying franchise that has stayed faithful to the original novels throughout. The original source material told a compelling story and Collins ensured that the movies stayed true to that story. Francis Lawrence did an excellent job on the last three of the four films. Above all, the central role was perfectly cast. We may now seen the end of the Mockingjay (although there is talk of both a prequel and a sequel from Collins), but assuredly we have only just seen the beginning of the glittering career of the talented Jennifer Lawrence.","0 out of 11 found this helpful.

With several key players returning to the fray this delivers what's expected, though at times it's much darker than you'd think, but the story lags, the third act is much too drawn-out, and the conclusion doesn't have enough impact to make this an epic-scale finale. Its reach may have exceeded its grasp, but it still has entertainment value thanks to a stellar cast of actors. **½","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
