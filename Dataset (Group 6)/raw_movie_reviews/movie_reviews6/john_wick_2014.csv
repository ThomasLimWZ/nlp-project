It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who's a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today's action movies, it doesn't use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what's going on.","393 out of 461 found this helpful.

Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.","462 out of 632 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The best action revenge film of all time from 2014 so far!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3357633/?ref_=tt_urv","ivo-cobra8","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15140057/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2015","John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that ""Mayhem"" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn't a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they've messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.","202 out of 315 found this helpful.

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn't have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½","11 out of 13 found this helpful.

In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. If you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.","173 out of 281 found this helpful.

Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles. Just don't try and do too much.+Stunts & action +Score/soundtrack +Reeves makes it believable+Villains aren't stupid -Body count -Weak script 8.4/10","91 out of 141 found this helpful.

It's just kind of a generic action thriller to me. No different than a ""Bourne"" or ""Taken"" movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.As for the story, it's basically not there. What's worse is the fact that the movie goes out of its way to constantly remind you that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as a character is someone who is incredibly lethal and dangerous and feared by criminals. In my opinion, this completely kills whatever dramatic weight the cheesy storyline that ""they killed my dog and stole my car"" plot has to begin with.I guess people liked it well enough because it's got three sequels and more to come. Personally I don't think it's any better than the average Netflix Original action movie. Huge skip in my opinion.","26 out of 39 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Keanu Brings a quiet believability to this action throwback","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3144454/?ref_=tt_urv","potablepictureshow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57142354/?ref_=tt_urv","19 December 2014","John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, mise–en–scènes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.Blarv Score out of 10: 8.8","286 out of 488 found this helpful.

I was told by a friend this was good but it's been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.Keanu's great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the 'hero' and doesn't kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it's always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn't reinvent the genre or anything but it's entertaining.","117 out of 206 found this helpful.

""John Wick"" is a fast-paced and adrenaline-rushing action flick, but not the traditional type of action movie, like ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"". Since a good fifteen years or so, there seemingly exists an additional new sub-genre within the world of action/thriller cinema, which is best described as ""Shoot 'em Up"" films, and ""John Wick"" neatly fits into this category. Other examples include ""Shoot 'em Up"", - duh - , ""Crank"", ""Hardcore Henry"", ""Free Fire"", ""Taken"" and ""Everly"". You guessed it; - these are films with very thin plots and without any proper character development, but they primarily focus on non-stop violent action, excessively over-the-top gunfire action and a practically immeasurable body count. They are entertaining if you're in a completely undemanding mood, I reckon, but they are quite unmemorable as well. Moreover, despite all the action and bloodshed, these films are sort of boring, because they constantly repeat the same old ""bang-bang-you're-all-dead"" routine.The most interesting aspects about ""John Wick"" are definitely the structural framework and background stories the script constantly hints at. The rudimentary plot of an invincible and stoic hitman coming out of retirement to extract vengeance of a personal nature is really old and has been told hundreds of times before. The organization in which our protagonist operates, however, is intriguing to say the least. He knows everyone, both the ones supporting him and the ones he's shooting up, there's a sort of code of conduct that includes the use of specific coins and the respect of neutral zones, the cleaning up bloody shootout aftermaths is referred to as diner reservations, and even the local law enforcer doesn't seem surprised when John answers the door with a bloodied face. None of these particularities ever get explained, but then again, there are at least three more films.The sole thing to bear in mind when watching a film like ""John Wick"" remains: don't ask yourself any questions. Where does the never-ending supply of redundant henchmen keeps coming from? Why can't anyone hit a target expect for the hero? Why engage into a fistfight when there's a possibility for a clean shot? Why capture your target instead of killing him straight away, for that matter? You know he'll just escape again and kill you instead. Most importantly, why didn't anyone at least try to apologize to Wick for murdering his puppy?If you seek logic and answers to these questions, ""John Wick"" is a terrible film. In case you accept what it is, there's entertainment aplenty thanks to the impressive stunt work, the solid performances by Keanu Reeves and the supportive cast, inventive little gimmicks, and a whole lot of mean people that get punished for making the wrong career choices in their lives.","56 out of 77 found this helpful.

The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!","197 out of 332 found this helpful.

It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.","455 out of 795 found this helpful.

But it brings more body action into the shooting scenes, so it becomes more stylish. Great to watch it at home, not boring at all, if you don't expect something like 007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and body almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for the film like this. But the enemies have less impression. They are fine but not new, bit similar to villains from 90's action movies. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun, and you've already watched every other great action movies like Born Ultimatium or 007 Casino Royal.","33 out of 63 found this helpful.

JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.JOHN WICK isn't a perfect film; some of the dialogue is sloppily, some of the writing is too broad, and occasionally the music is intrusive. However, when it gets things right, as it frequently does, you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride. The clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director, so the emphasis is on realistic, superbly choreographed action sequences, and they're hard-hitting and plentiful. The nightclub set-piece is the obvious highlight, but nearly all of the action here is spectacular.Keanu Reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best, alongside SPEED. His dry, laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick, MAN OF TAI CHI. The supporting cast is basically unnecessary, but Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen all put in decent turns. In the end, though, JOHN WICK is all about the action, and quite simply it rocks. Bring on the sequel!","26 out of 42 found this helpful.

After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.To say ""John WIck"" is a violent film is a gross undestatement. Once the dog dies, it's pretty much a bloodbath from then on...with Wick dispatching countless goons VERY realistically on his way to ultimate revenge. And, he doesn't just kill a few...he makes sure to kill them by double and triple-tapping his prey. Blood and mayhem make this a lousy film to show your kids, mother or Father O'Reilly when he comes over for a visit!So, aside from being a bloodbath, is it any good? Yes, it's an excellent all-action film...but....it IS hard to watch and is essentially a giant gore-fest. In many ways, it's like the Sonny Chiba 'Street Fighter' films....that violent and that dedicated to making sure all the victims are indeed dead! Mindless violence....albeit well choreographed violence. Not really my sort of film...perhaps it will be yours.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

You had me at Number 4! O. K., So why the 6* Rating? Fair enough question! The Original Music, by Tyler Bates is nothing short of phenomenal! Look at his IMDb BIO! It is very impressive! From a technically crafted standpoint, WICK is truly excellent.I couldn't help but notice Eva Longoria receiving Number One Producer Credit here. My hat is off to her! She really knows what elements (Although they're not really MY elements!) are needed to forge both a real crowd-pleaser (75% of viewers rated this 7 Stars or more on IMDb!) and a solid box office success! WICK grossed over 43 Million, more than double its production cost! The cinematography was inspired, at times even artistic. The sound and sound mixing were at least a cut above your average Hollywood movie, which, to be honest, is really saying a lot! And other visual elements, such as sets, costumes and locations were all impressive.Absolutely must get one other thing off my chest. Despite the numerous fight scenes being extremely well choreographed and the endless gun- play having been blocked out meticulously... AND having sat down to watch with rather low expectations, WICK stretched Suspension of Belief well beyond the breaking point! Perhaps we should add Fantasy to Action, Thriller in the introductory genre description! Still, for those of you who are ACTION junkies, and I know there are a lot of you out there...It is a sure bet you will end up in that 75% I referred to a bit earlier!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

In essence a revenge flick, 'John Wick' details the titular ex-hit-man's mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his dog, the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife. As it turns out, the people he's pursuing are related to his former employer. I'm not the hugest fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor, but he nails the role of John. It's largely a physical performance, with John being a seemingly introverted, rarely talkative individual. This sympathetic, almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal, merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance. A great return to form for someone who hasn't really had a decent role since 'The Matrix Trilogy' or 'A Scanner Darkly'. A lot of the other cast members, such as Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo, as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on HBO programs, receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios. Nevertheless, they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence. Being directed by a stunt choreographer, it doesn't really come as a surprise that 'John Wick' has some ridiculously well-made shootouts and car chases. A highlight is John's rampage through a nightclub, gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his dog's killer. As opposed to a lot of the uninspired, uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years, 'John Wick's' set-pieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic quality.The film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society, a world that John is forced to return to. Everyone appears to know each other (John included), from 'waste disposers' to bartenders to hotel guests. It comes across as an unorthodox (yet welcome) hybrid of Guy Ritchie and David Lynch tropes. On the whole, 'John Wick' is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films, aided by its excellently-crafted actions scene, and a solid protagonist in the form of Keanu Reeve's John.","25 out of 51 found this helpful.

There are many movies like this one, shoot em up type of things. The expendables was one of them, and from the previous 2 films, this one did not excite. All 3 of them in my opinion are terrible. Many of these types of movies are terrible, with the plot being too cliché or unable to make sense with, or it is too unrealistic. This movie was much different.When I first saw the trailer I was happy to see Keanu Reeves back, for he had not come out with many things since the Matrix. Then I realized what the movie consisted of and my emotions changed quick. I went to the theater hoping it was at least better than the expendables or any other movie that is like that, but it was entirely different. The plot i admit was cliché, and the fact that John Wick could kill that many people and survive is a little ridiculous, but the movie is very enjoyable! The actions scenes are amazing and very fun to watch. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and this is probably going to be a reboot to his career. He does not disappoint in this movie, in fact, this is in my opinion his best acted movie. If this movie didn't have good acting in it it would not be as good. There are some flaws to the movie as in any other, but I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year. This film is rated R, and for a reason. There are an occasional F bomb, and no sexual themes in it. The movie is rated R for violence. There is some blood spray when people are being shot, or from being beaten. There are also some mature thematic material in the movie involving the death of his wife due to I believe is cancer or some other disease, and the brutal murdering of his dog that was given to him by his wife. Now take note that the movie revolves around the dog and john getting revenge on the people who killed it. I would strongly recommend not showing this movie to anyone under the age of 14.Overall this movie is excellent. It doesn't take much thinking to watch, but definitely excites. If you love movies, GET IT ON BLURAY. 9/10","32 out of 61 found this helpful.

He goes to her funeral and receives the condolences from his old friend Marcus (Willem Dafoe). Out of the blue, John receives a special delivery at home with the last gift from his wife, a cute dog that becomes his pride and joy. John goes to the gas station in his Mustang 1967 and the Russian Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) asks the price he wants for his car. John tells that it is not for sale and returns home. During the night, Iosef, who is the son of the powerful Russian mobster Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), breaks in his house with other gangsters and steals his car, beat John and kills his dog. Soon Iosef learns that John Wick was the unbeatable hit man Boogey Man that worked for his father and he should have never messed with him. Now, John Wick has lost everything he had and he wants the head of Iosef and he is back. But Viggo decides to protect his son at any cost and will pay the price. ""John Wick"" is one of the best action thrillers that have been recently produced by the industry, with a great story of arrogance and payback. Keanu Reeves is sensational in the role of a hit man that returns to his previous life to seek revenge against the man that took everything he had to support his grieve. It is cool to see the code of honor of killers and mobsters and how John Wick kills his enemies. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""De Volta ao Jogo"" (""Back to the Game"")","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

At glance, people might find it quite silly, but the movie touches no irony within that plight, it simply just pictures a desperate man with nothing left to lose. However, it still displays a strange mix of tones: it introduces the story as some sort of a serious tragedy, and then we discover that this world turns out to be surrounded with a punchline of him having a normal reputation of killing people. The combination of gritty revenge thriller and tongue-in-cheek world of assassins is fine, but how the film connects them can be a little uneven, but once the guns appear, the fun is presented perfectly. It just lives up to what it is meant to be. There isn't anything big, neither mind blowing. John Wick is as straightforward as any fine revenge movie must be, plus an odd brightening flavor.Despite of setting up with a bleaker drama, John Wick actually builds a cooler mythology of its own. Sure, Wick basically has a legend of being the most lethal hit-man his enemies will ever face, that also defines to the characters who personally know him. Example is a cop who just found him wacked a few bad guys and still lets him go, because he is ""John Wick!"" It's his thing! Everyone else in this world also has their own backstories, there must be some richer stories behind them, but in the end, that's just the movie giving this typical revenge flick some personality, and it indeed helps, keeping the experience from being stale.The plot never compromises with any twists, it just slow burns to the point until the anti-hero finds his target. This slow burn can be a little dragging, it introduces too much exposition that most of it turn out not going to matter in the end, they are probably designed to build more tension. The movie is better when it's finally on the action. The film biggest credit here is the camera work. There is not a shot that misses some sort of violence. Every gunshot and fist has to present the consequence on screen which manifests his boiling anger. And even without the fights, there are still some slick, stunning sights to see around. Predictably, Keanu Reeves must be the only one who is taking this silliness seriously, which makes sense since his character is the only one who is in real pain in this fancy mission. That vast seriousness just perfectly suits at depicting Wick's desperation and madness, also his fighting hits even harder compared to those days in The Matrix. But the show stealer here is Michael Nyqvist who brings the joy in his nutty yet menacing performance as the villain.John Wick sometimes feels like there is a larger world meant to be explored or a deeper theme to be considered, but the film has priorities of following the classic roots of the revenge genre. It's not so bad since it makes for an easy viewing through its fine looking action scenes, but it also leaves a lot of potential hanging. But if you are only here for Keanu Reeves back in action, then this movie totally sells, in fact that is what we are all here for anyway. Still, we might have thought of some possibilities if the movie was more ambitious, but then most of us won't think it matters. It's already stunningly crafted, if not original or special. Just sit right in for a straightforward show of violent gunfights.","21 out of 47 found this helpful.

Keanu, as John Wick, has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so, entirely understandably, he decides to take revenge. Keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of people.Here's what I liked about John Wick: clearly, whoever was in charge, really loves film and/or knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there. The clichéd bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and unique.I won't expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done before.What I really want to talk about is the fight scenes. This is the first time since the Bourne films that I feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography. All the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles. There was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning. I genuinely can't think of another actor who would have pulled off Keanu's character and choreography as well as he did.During the inevitable 'sit-down' with the bad guy and his men, they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a 'captured' female assassin, nevertheless; Keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character. I thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really well.I think it's time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film: the kill film. I wouldn't label it as action because I expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around. If you want to watch a good revenge/kill film, this is definitely the one.9/10","29 out of 60 found this helpful.

I fear for many it has been over-hyped, or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell. What it's selling is extremely well done action, and if you're content with just that then it will deliver in spades.Keanu Reeves plays the retired super-hit-man John Wick. He's pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks (it's a little more personal than that, but I don't want to spoil it.) This sends John on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers. It really is that simple.While the plot is as bare bones as it gets, there's a surprisingly deep world being built. It's a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while they're on the job. It's a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away. It's a stylized world to be sure, but it's an intriguing one as well. It also helps that it's populated by some recognizable faces. Just the casting of folks like Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, and John Leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works. Many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world work.But really, you're here for the action. And it's stellar. Firstly there are wonderfully long takes, no rapid cut trickery here. You know exactly what's going on and where everything is. And I personally LOVE the fighting style that John uses. While he appears to be a decent shot, his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets. It's actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies, the bad guys (especially henchmen) go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body. John Wick is a professional, and he takes no chances. Even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head, just so John can be certain that he doesn't have to deal with that person again. It's fast, it's efficient and it's thrilling.The film loses a little big of steam towards the end. The natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go, and the final action scene isn't as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be. That said it's not a deal breaker, and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending.","25 out of 52 found this helpful.

But thanks to his former stunt double Chad Stahelski, Reeves once again finds himself headlining a solid action flick that has plenty of buzz around it.Despondent over the death of his wife, retired assassin John Wick (Reeves) spends his days moping around his house, with a beagle puppy as his only companion. The dog arrived on his doorstep shortly after his wife's funeral, a final gift so that John wouldn't have to carry on alone. But an untimely run-in with Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of a local Russian mobster, results in the theft of John's 1969 Ford Mustang and the death of his puppy, leaving John with nothing to love - and nothing to lose.Yes, that's a ridiculous segue, but it also perfectly conveys the tone of John Wick. The premise is unapologetically silly, but Reeves approaches the material with such fervor that we quickly forget about his motivations. It doesn't matter that Wick is singlehandedly disassembling the infrastructure of the Russian crime syndicate because of a dog - what matters is how much fun the film is having while he does it. Wick stalks from scene to scene with the precision of The Terminator, scarcely wasting a single movement as he dispatches bad guys in impressive numbers, with equally impressive methods. Surrounding the nearly non-stop action is an interesting mix of supporting characters, including Ian McShane as the owner of a hotel for assassins, whose roles dictate that no business be conducted on the premises, and Willem Dafoe as Wick's mentor, Marcus, himself an expert sharpshooter. And we can't forget Adrianne Palicki, a fellow contract killer out to collect the $2 million bounty placed on Wick's head by Tarasov's father, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who also happens to be Wick's former employer.Stahelski, who first doubled for Reeves on The Matrix before moving on to several other films with the actor, including Constantine, Man of Tai Chi and both Matrix sequels, has teamed up with longtime collaborator David Leitch for John Wick, a stylish revenge thriller that heralds the arrival of a bold new voice. While Stahelski is credited as the director due to DGA regulations, this is very much a team effort, as Stahelski and Leitch have channeled their decades of experience as stunt coordinators and second unit directors into a remarkably original film that boasts some of the best action sequences in recent memory.While John Wick certainly isn't a perfect film - the script is paper-thin in more than a few places, and Reeves has a handful of laughably poor dialogue deliveries - it never stops having fun. This is a film that refuses to take itself seriously, opting instead to just strap in, buckle up and enjoy the ride. And as long as audiences can follow suit, rather than searching for some deeper meaning, they should find themselves pleased with the results.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","17 out of 37 found this helpful.

There's been decades of action films but this one was just different. Every action set piece was executed perfectly and while it clearly a work of fiction and essentially a grounded superhero film in style, it's realistic in its approach to the film genre. Reeves took himself to another level in preparation for all these films but this is the one that set the bar for not just the remaining films in the series but for action films in general. The gun play is top notch, the hand to hand combat is fluid yet there is a struggle between combatants which gives it the realistic feel.I recommend the entire film series and each one just ups the ante as they go on but the first one is the most important action film since the 1980s.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","High Energy Action Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3325041/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","28 September 2015","John Wick (2014) *** (out of 4)After the death of his beloved wife, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) comes out of retirement when a Russian mobster's son breaks into his home, steals his car and kills his dog, which was a gift from his deceased wife. Soon the mobster (Michael Nyqvist) puts a contract out on Wick's life knowing that he's coming for revenge.JOHN WICK isn't a film that is going to be studied in film schools and it's certainly not going to be for those seeking ""high art"" or ""meaning"" in their movies. No, JOHN WICK is a terrific throwback to the crazy martial art flicks from the 70s. I couldn't help but watch this film and think of someone like Sunny Chiba in the STREET FIGHTER series. This film here is, of course, a lot more friendly to today's times as it contains non-stop bloody violence as it appears Wick just loves head shots.The film works so well for a couple of reasons with the first being that this character really fits Reeves style. By now we shouldn't expect too much for Reeves. Often times he sleepwalks through his roles with that laid back approach of his but that quiet nature actually works extremely well for this character. That certain coldness Reeves brings to the film works tremendously well as you can't help but root for him and cheer each time one of the bad guys fall. Nyqvist is also very good in his role as the Russian mobster and he too makes you believe his character. Willem Dafoe is also fun in his supporting role.The film manages to have some nice style and especially during the action sequences. There's no question that this here is one of the most violent action pictures in recent years with the action scenes containing a great amount of attention to detail but they're played out so well that it almost seems like you're watching a video game. Most of the gunshots, and there are hundreds, are in the bloody to extremely bloody range but the film is just so much fun that even those who don't normally like that type of stuff should be able to still have fun. JOHN WICK certainly isn't the work of Orson Welles but it's not trying to be. It's goal was to be a bad ass action film and it succeeds at that.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

He is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in almost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good choice.

The directors of the film David Leitch and Chad Stahelski both do a excellent and fantastic job of directing this movie and I found out that these two are actually stunt men. The villain was good, the action scenes were shot perfectly. Towards the end of the movie felt a bit cliché for me. You know in every action movie that the main hero is facing off the main bad guy and they shouting out one liners at each other, you know what I mean and that to me felt like the writer's got lazy half way through.John Wick has to be the biggest surprise for me with it's intelligent writing and nail biting action scenes.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

However, as soon as the positive buzz about John Wick started to come around, I started to become more curious about checking it out in theaters. It felt weird seeing great reviews out of a revenge story at first, but in the end, it turned out to be a pretty good action thrill ride.John Wick takes the plot of a hit-man coming out of retirement to duke out justice on those who dare to mess with the things he loved and turns it into a fairly unique story. Sure, there are certain clichés and a delivery of cheesy lines at times, but the movie manages to not take itself seriously and makes those aspects work. Although it may a paper thin plot to begin with, its serviceable enough to introduce our characters and jumps straight into the action.The acting throughout is also serviceable enough for the type of action-driven story the movie was going for. Keanu Reeves may not be the greatest actor in the world and I can probably name 10 other actors that are worse than him, he somehow manages to put on a good performance. Its his best work of acting since The Matrix and I believe Reeves was meant to be an action star along the lines of Schwarzenegger and Statham. As for the rest of the cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, William Dafoe, and Dean Winters, lets just say that they do a solid job portraying their given characters. They aren't really bad by any means, its just the main focus is on John Wick since he is the title of the film.In terms of technical aspects, its pretty much the strongest part about the movie. The lighting gives the film a very dark and gritty feel throughout its run-time and its certain shading of blue colors also adds to the film's bleak environment. Every camera shot is smooth and steady and they keep a tight focus on showcasing the fast paced action on screen. Speaking of action scenes, they are also executed brilliantly through excellent choreography and great editing, all without having to resort to unnecessary shaky cam.John Wick is one of the best American action flicks to come out in quite some time. It may not be on the same level as The Raid 2, it still come in pretty close in terms of high octane action. Its simple story and characters give you something to work off of and its adrenaline fueled action sequences will have you on the edge of you seat and wanting more when its all over. If you are the type of person who craves this crazy level of vengeance and violence, then you owe to yourself to go and check out John Wick. Definitely worth a recommendation.","24 out of 51 found this helpful.

Five years after crashing a bus through LA, he reaffirmed his star status in the then groundbreaking sci-fi action flick, The Matrix. Since then, the actor of mixed ancestry has dabbled in a number of high-profile projects and indie titles, produced an acclaimed documentary and directed his very first feature. But he has yet found a role that ranked alongside Jack Traven and Neo.All thanks to stunt coordinators and performers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (founders of action outfit, 87Eleven), Reeves has finally found a character that redefined his flagging career. Forgive his almost soulless appearance in 47 Ronin, you want a badass Keanu Reeves action vehicle, you have it in John Wick. The script by the little known Derek Kolstad reeks of minimalism. It's purely a lazy action movie, one that frankly never pushes beyond the boundary. Yet somehow it works under the hands of Leitch and Stahelski and the casting of our leading man.With hardly a lull, Reeves plays a mysterious ex-assassin, a man so powerful at his craft that people jitters at the mere mention of his name. However, Wick decides to retire after his wife fell sick and after the death of his beloved partner, devoted his time to care for his pet dog – the last gift given by his late wife. Unfortunately, the son of a Russian mobster, Iosef (Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones) punctuates Wick's quiet life after he took a fancy to Wick's Ford Mustang. Isoef ambushed Wick at his home in the middle of the night, took his muscle car and gasp killed his dog! The ruthless act trigger the anger back in Wick and what follows is the ultimate revenge against those who are hired to stop him from killing Iosef and the target himself. The movie is structured predictably that you already knew what's coming. To its credit, John Wick is never pretentious, it served to entertain and it accomplished its goal with much ease in the end. Leitch and Stahelski are such old-timers in the stunt field that most of the action seen in Wick is both beautifully and brutally executed. Men are often stabbed, kicked, disabled and shot in the face and to the talented production designers, the numerous action sequences actually took place in a number of different locations such as a disco club, parking lot and hotel room just to give it a little variety. The raw bloody gunplay reminisces one of early John Woo movies and it's definitely a visual feast. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela (Max Payne, A Good Day to Die Hard) provides the movie with a chilling moody feel at the same time, keeping his lenses glued to the ground forsaking the usage of crappy shaky cams.Just when you thought Kolstad's storytelling is so uneventful, he manages to throw in surprises after surprises. Besides, the laugh- out-loud sardonic humour, the world of thugs, assassins in John Wick is much more than mere clichéd tough Russian mobsters, a promising setup for more sequels to come. Killers stayed in a luxurious hotel and they trade using only gold coins. A specialized crew is hired to clean up crime scenes and disposing the bodies. There are rules to abide with and everyone in this world comes with a price.Besides Reeves doing his tough guy routine and should I add he is damn good at it, Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) also has a small role as Wick's wife seen in a brief flashback montage. Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist (Ghost Protocol) plays the movie's main villain, Iosef's mobster daddy and he plays it uber-cool. Everyone's favourite character actors Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane play a fellow assassin and a mysterious hotel's owner respectively.When it comes to voting for a stylish action packed movie for 2014, John Wick easily wins hands down. If you missed Denzel Washington hunting down Russian thugs in The Equalizer, then don't miss Keanu Reeves hunting down Russian thugs. It's just as crazy but with a dog in the latter, I declared John Wick the winner. Who can resist a cute puppy with Bambi eyes?","14 out of 36 found this helpful.

Once I saw the film, I could've kicked myself for missing it. This is a relatively straight forward action film, that spends just the right amount of time setting up the main character. Then, the movie kicks into high gear, and it doesn't let up until the end. Believe the hype on this one, it is a gem of an action film. The fight sequences are well-choreographed, and this can't be emphasized enough, filmed cleanly with no shaky cam. Keanu gets a lot of flack for being a somewhat wooden actor. Maybe this is true, but it suits him well in this film. He's supposed to be some truly fearful man, so when he decides to tell you why he is on this quest for vengeance, you better listen. The nightclub scene is iconic, and he owns it. The rest of the action is solid, but not much can hold a candle to that scene. The film loses a beat in the last act, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film. On a somewhat personal level, the opening scenes establishing John's relationship with his wife, when he receives her final gift, and when he finally tells Viggo why he is on this mission of vengeance, along with the absolutely excellent action combine to make a movie that is well above the average. One of my favorite movies of 2014.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

A chance encounter with a Russian thug sees Wick's connection to this life severed, and he sets out for vengeance – a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the city.Although it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base, this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence (with Wick seemingly looking to get extra XP from headshots). There is of course a limit to the appeal of this, but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film, as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic, instead selling itself hard and fast throughout. Mostly this approach works; with minimal set-up it is not long before the violence begins in earnest, and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout, with slick design and satisfying set-pieces. The style does help because, with Wick being pretty much the Terminator, it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril, so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movement.Reeves is a good lead for this, since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic – both of which he can pull off. He is surrounded by familiar faces, all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each, but all of which give the film a sense of quality – and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes (also fun for fans of The Wire to see the couple of faces showing up). All told, this is not the reinvention of action movies (as some have said) but it just a reminder of how they should be done well – enough emotional grit for us to care, and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way. It is nonsense, as so much of this genre is, but it is visceral, tough, dark, and really quite fun.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

He receives a dog as a final gift from her. On his second day with the dog he encounters thugs who want his car. He tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless, his dog killed and his car stolen. And he wants revenge.Everyone knows that Keanu Reeves doesn't have the best acting range. But when a roll is prefect for him he shines. And this is exactly what happens in John Wick. The film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top. As much killing as Keanu does is basically to get revenge for his dog. Which is borderline stupid but Reeves really sells it. Totally investing in his character and motives. Another notable actor here is William Defoe. While I thought his character was underused he wasn't underwritten and that was a nice little thing.The world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal. As reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in New York City. Characters presumably know what they mean and don't bother explaining them to you. This is for the best. Being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is, is gripping. It makes the world feel like it's been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks. As lush as the world is, shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen. The focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots. Some shots don't even seem to be focused. The action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best. Maybe it was just the Theater I was In I don't know. Another problem for the movie was it's ending. Well I'd go as far as to say the entire 3rd act. *SPOILERS* Not much of a spoiler as we all knew Reeves would have his revenge. But after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour. Attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here. It feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him! And tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times. This is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlong.Overall John Wick delivers on super cool action, a surprising level of emotional, and a world that feels real. John wick is a fine piece of cinema.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

It doesn't have a crazy plot that makes it easy to get lost its just basic. You don't have to wait long for the action to begin and when it starts it goes pretty much right through to the end. I really hope that this is the beginning of a franchise because it certainly looks that way. I hope this film gets some attention because I didn't hear much talk about it and its run in the theater went by fairly quietly (although it did make 50 million bucks of profit). It also great to see Keanu Reeves find a role that seems to spark a comeback for him. Keanu has been a huge action star for over 20 years and its nice to see him back on top. John Wick may become one of his significant roles in the future.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals John's car and murders his puppy. Now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost. You have heard and seen this type of plot countless times, there are no surprises here, you will predict everything. But is it fun? Oh yes it is. Keanu owns his role and is a complete badass. So despite the unoriginality of the plot, John Wick is filled with some of the most original gunfights I've seen in a long time. Overall this movie is an entertaining pop-corn action flick that is well worth your time.Full Review:I think most would agree that Keanu Reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents. So even though he has been in some terrible movies lately I still find to be a likable actor. I just want him to return to his glory days of being Neo, and John Wick seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that, so I was more than I excited to see it.Let's be real here, this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise. However, Keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool. You can see Reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you can't help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot (strange thing to cheer I know, but you'll know what I mean). Most importantly, this is an action film that actually shows the action. From what I can remember there was not a single shaky cam, every gun fight is brilliantly shot (pun intended) beginning to end. I also loved how precise the movements were, John Wick would always land a headshot and if he can't then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head. Just plain awesomeness.John Wick is not without its problems. As I mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal, so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging. Also I was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end. The rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed, and left more to be desired. One of the positives of John Wick is the rich criminal underworld. It is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions. There is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world. I just wish we got to explore more of that world because I found it to be so intriguing and unique. I am sure they will if there ever is a sequel, which I do think this movie deserves.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching John Wick. Yes it has some flaws, but I was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is. One word to sum up the movie would be ""personality,"" because even if it is working with tired story and character concepts John Wick does it with style and fun.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's basically the best one ever made. I'm not usually this positive when it comes to evaluating film, but I believe that this particular one deserves all the acclaim and more.The thing that stands out most has to be the action sequences. They are unlike most found in modern cinema with long, uninterrupted takes and beautiful choreography that really lend themselves to the realistic, bone-crunching feel of the film. Although the complexity of plotting left something to be desired, the filmmakers more than made up for it by building a rich, creative, history-laden world around their characters.The Action: The superb action in this movie can be directly attributed to the co-directors and their star. Both directors have been performing and coordinating big-budget film stunts for years. Chad Stahelski even doubled for Keanu Reeves in several films. Reeves's stunt background and dedication to learning his character's gunplay and martial arts styles helped bring his scenes to life in a way that would not be possible with other performers. Because of the crew's skills in the art of choreography, less cuts were needed during fight scenes which afforded them a more immersive feel.The Music: I have never been one to get too worked up, or bogged down, by the soundtrack of any given movie. Here, however, I found myself enthralled in its effectiveness. The gentle tune ""In My Mind"" by M86 and Susie Q really stood out by paradoxically fitting perfectly into the hot tub club scene. On the other end, Marilyn Manson's ""Killing Strangers"" provided a jolting assault of the rock variety to wake me back up for the next action sequence.The Supporting Players: Numerous interesting characters populate this original world. The performances that stand out the most come courtesy of John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick. Their introductions pulled me right into their specific areas of the criminal underworld without feeling too overbearing. Though neither muggs the screen for more than ten minutes, their impacts are felt immediately and leave a lasting impression.The Continental: As well-executed as John Wick is, I don't think it gets nearly enough credit for its creativity. The best use of this aspect can be seen inside the hit-man hotel, The Continental. This establishment primarily hosts assassins and other underworld types to be waited on by a staff providing world-class service to its patrons unlike any other. Most importantly, the hotel pulled me in leaving me wanting to know more about the history of this world to which we had just been introduced.The Plot: My biggest gripe with the movie has to be that the plot wears quite thin at times. Having scanned countless other reviews before writing my own, I know that this is not an unpopular opinion. It's really just a classic tale of revenge where the protagonist pursues the antagonist until somebody gives in. The reason John Wick does not suffer for its overly simplistic plot is that it stimulates the viewer in other ways like a good-old-fashioned sense of humor. It never takes itself too seriously.I can't image that they'll come anywhere near matching the magic of John Wick with its sequel, but I'm excited for Chapter 2 all the same. As long as they expand upon the interesting underground lore presented in the first movie while preserving the high quality action scenes, I have no doubt that Chapter 2 will satisfy my need for more John Wick.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Very Solid Action Film With A Great Turn By An Awesome Cast","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3109923/?ref_=tt_urv","cadillac20","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2619078/?ref_=tt_urv","23 October 2014","John Wick was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago. Coming out of nowhere, this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people, and for good reason. It boasted the promise of excellent action, with Keanu Reeves returning to form as the badass lead. And a badass he is. John Wick is the kind of action film we don't get these days, and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action film.First things first, John Wick isn't going to win any big awards. It doesn't really do anything new, even in terms of innovative action. None of the characters are fresh and the story isn't really that original. But none of that matters because it's so stylishly crafted, the acting, direction, and writing so smooth, and the world so well designed, that any action junkie can get behind this slick, heavily stylized, action packed romp. After a flashforward, the film details the current state of John Wick's life. His wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard. After her death, he receives one last gift from his wife, a puppy to help him keep from being alone. But it isn't long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife. With this taken from him, we find Wick falling back into his old life of assassination and violence. See, John Wick was once part of a world of criminals, assassins, and killers. And, according to the primary antagonist, he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey man.And it is here where the film picks up. Where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary, from the moment John Wick becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film, it's almost non-stop action. The biggest challenge the film had was setting up Keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film. But I can completely reassure you that Keanu is a complete badass here. While he still is not the fine, domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like Liam Neeson, he has the skills necessary to prove that you don't mess with John Wick. Whether it's playing up the role of a superman, capable of tackling a younger, equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury, or taking on a dozen men, all armed, in a matter of a few minutes, Keanu doesn't need to rage, pull out a booming voice, or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats. All he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease. If you don't believe Keanu is the feared killer he's trumped up to be at first, you will by the end of the film.What helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. As stuntmen, they clearly know their action. They eschew the typical, modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice, long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting. This offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills. Keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically, with his time spent in the Matrix and more recently Man of Tai Chi and Ronin 47. The directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up. It's authentic and completely badass. Supporting him are an array of actors, including Wilem Defoe as an old friend in the business, Adrienne Palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take John out, and Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen as father and son gangsters, the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against Wick. Nyquist is especially good, a villain that isn't completely evil, and even a bit likable, who we're immediately introduced to as someone who doesn't necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do. He's entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that, under different circumstances, might have actually been an ally to Wick. Action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years, with few theatrical releases and most being VOD. But John Wick is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action. For any action junkie, John Wick is an absolute must and I can only hope that this isn't the last time we'll see this Wick.","20 out of 46 found this helpful.

In the past eight years or so, Keanu Reeves practically went off the map and no one knew if he was still acting anymore. Then, he suddenly decides to pick up where he left off and return to action. ""Everyone's been asking me if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back- John Wick."" With the plot of John Wick somewhat laughably mimicking the career of Keanu Reeves, we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action film.I do not usually give the plot of the film but I feel it is appropriate for this one. John Wick, a once great hit man, comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had, showing he has not lost his touch at what he does. With the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life, that plot sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves's career. That is why I thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him. I would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have seen this type of movie many times before. In fact, John Wick reminded me a lot of a movie I saw a month ago called The Equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with John Wick. If it was the first time I ever saw a movie with this plot, it would be one of my favorite films. Sadly, it is not the case and I never was really surprised with the direction the movie went.Enough about that, time to get on to why I still liked the movie. The main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film. It did not try to do more or get overly complicated in it's own plot leaving the audience lost. It was clear-cut and direct, what many films are not successful achieving. There is no one is better to achieve it than Keanu Reeves. I am not sure if the script was written with Keanu Reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly. Whatever the case may be, the intimidating, quiet, resourceful guy pretty much describes Keanu Reeve's bread and butter role. The rest of the cast did their job accordingly, but Keanu Reeves definitely shines in his return to action films. If you are in a theater where they are showing both John Wick and The Equalizer, flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally. Still, I recommend you see John Wick at some point while it is still in theaters.

I knew it was in the action thriller genre, and that was about it.And now that I have seen it, I must honestly admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie. I was more than entertained by the storyline, and the sheer volume of action sequences in the movie is more than sufficient to keep any action fan more than happy. I will actually go as far as to saying that this is actually among the more enjoyable and entertaining of movies that I have seen starring Keanu Reeves.The storyline, in all its simplicity, is about a retired gun-for-hire, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves), who just lost his beloved wife. And as a small puppy shows up at this doorstep, as a last gift from his departed wife, John finds some reason to continue on in his grief and his downtrodden world. However, when a group of Russian thugs steal his car and kills his puppy, they have no idea who they are messing with, nor the magnitude of his skills and capabilities.While the story is fairly simple, it is tremendously entertaining, and the added spice of all the action sequences really help lift up the movie to a very enjoyable level. The action sequences are really well executed and equally well filmed.""John Wick"" is not a movie that requires any thinking from the audience, so you just simply sit back and enjoy the action.I am rating ""John Wick"" a solid seven out of ten stars. And it was good to see a movie of this scale from Keanu Reeves. If you enjoy action movies, then ""John Wick"" is highly recommendable.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

After a long drought on bad quality films, Reeves aimed to get back into the good graces of audiences by making this completely over the top action film. While the story is pretty generic, the action and the directing is simply top notch. If you want intense action scenes that are simply amazing R rated fun, mixed in with some fabulous acting, then you are looking in the right direction. This is my review of John Wick.The film was written by Derek Kolstad and this is only his third writing credit. His prior two movies were both direct to home video action films. I have watched both of those movies he wrote(One in the Chamber and The Package). Having already watched some of his efforts in the past, I knew story wise this wasn't going to be perfect. However, the story is good cheesy fun. Reeves character(John Wick) has a tough life with the recent passing of his wife. She leaves him this sweet little dog as a gift to remember her to grieve with someone. One afternoon Wick is at a gas station and these thugs start up a conversation about his sweet 1969 Ford Mustang. The one thug ask Wick how much he wants for the car, only to reply that it is not for sale. They of course aren't happy, so they break into his house at night to kill the dog and rough him up. They of course have no idea who this person at the gas station was. This starts the chain of events that leads Wick back into the game. While the underlying story is cheesy, it is sweet fun for this genre of films. While Kolstad's effort won't net him any awards, it should make his name more popular as the characters and the set up for the action is simply amazing. I give his effort on this film a big thumbs up.The film was directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Neither of these two have ever directed a film before. They have both worked as stunt coordinators. Reading into that before you go see the movie could sound some alarms, but they shot this film perfectly in my opinion. The action scenes are fast and very intense. The hand to hand combat is stellar work, and with no shaky cam action, the audience can really savor each moment in the bigger action scenes. While there is some downtime in the film, the acting plugs those holes. Keanu Reeves headlines a fabulous cast that also includes Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, and Ian McShane. The acting as I just said was top level in this film. Having so many acting legends in this one film is great because action movies do have downtime where characters need to drive the film. While there is some downtime earlier in the film, the amazing acting more than makes up for it. The first outing for these two is none other than something perfectly done. This is a fun action film that hardcore fans of the genre will love to watch. The R rating also helps as there is a great deal of blood and other over the top moments that you can't get away with on a PG-13 film. This was a fantastic effort and I cannot wait to see their projects in the future.Joel J. Richard scored the film with some original music from Tyler Bates. Both have worked on bigger action films, so they know how to add a great deal of depth to a score. I really enjoy the score in this film. The bigger action scenes have some great pieces as the action is moving along. There is never really a moment when I was underwhelmed by the score. I love a great score and this is certainly one of the better scores from 2014. Both Richard and Bates get a big thumbs up in my opinion.Overall, this is one thrilling joy ride. The action is fast paced, with some downtime that fills in perfectly with some great acting. The actions scenes are shot perfectly and the hand to hand combat is very intense. My only real complaint is some of the downtime tends to drag on a bit, but it doesn't hurt the film all that much. Fans of the 1980s action genre will love this film. Those on the fence, well jump on over. This is a great film to see and it is worth every penny.I also want to talk about the IMAX version as that is the version I watched. The IMAX version adds a tremendous amount of quality sounds, which in turn adds to the fantastic score. The picture level of course is certainly not there as the film was not shot using IMAX cameras. If you can view the IMAX version on a discount showing that would be the best bet. Otherwise, I don't really think it was worth the extra price of admittance.9/10","22 out of 52 found this helpful.

John Wick is definitely portraying Keanu Reeves rather than the other way round who used to be expressionless or impassive, cool and less talking, and perhaps his personality and life experience might be the two important factors that make him suits perfectly in this character full with sorrow, miserable and anger. More than three quarters of the film are filled with stylish scores, adrenalin-rush and thrilling action art sequences captured in great angles and cinematography, but the emotional built-up and the relationship with the cute puppy in the beginning seems to be too short, pushing the film towards a slight monotonous ending.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is stripped down, precise, and slick. Wick has style akin to Michael Mann's Collateral but trims some of the philosophical edge off. There are multiple uses of well-timed awkward humor even. You might laugh, you might cry, but you will be entertained, and isn't that what we want? Maximus Decimus Meridius knew it, so he told the Romans in Gladiator.John Wick is the best assassin out for vengeance film I've seen since Lee Jeong-beom's The Man From Nowhere, released in 2010 and available on Netfilx streaming service now, I highly recommend it. The film begins with John falling out of the driver's seat of an SUV badly wounded and bleeding from his abdomen, it looks as though it is the end. We then travel back to a time when this man had peace and harmony in his life until his wife died from a terminal disease. As a parting gift from his wife, John gets beagle puppy via delivery service. John is able to grieve and heal his spirit taking care of this cute dog. One day he is filling his bad ass 1969 Boss Mustang up as some young cocky Russian man offers to buy it, John declines and drives away. The Russian doesn't take no for an answer.In a night raid at John's home the gangsters get the better of him and kill the puppy in the process but not Mr. Wick. This is their death sentence. John comes out of retirement and systematically works his way through these mafia thugs as an art form. As Christopher Walken speaks of his friend Creasy in Man On Fire; ""A man can be an artist at anything, Creasey's art is death."" John Wick is an artist of death, everything he picks up is a weapon, but especially guns. Director John Woo may be credited with inventing his so-called 'bullet ballet', but John Wick wields guns the way the fabled samurai handled their katana. You could call it Gun Fu, but not the unreal type seen in Equilibrium.Keanu Reeves really gets a chance to let lose in this and I loved it. By the time he says the line ""I'm thinking I'm back!"" you'll want to stand up and cheer. He gets to use some of the Kung Fu he's been adept at since The Matrix along with the gunplay, and even some good driving stunts where he is clearly the one driving and not a stunt driver. Willem Dafoe who is one of my favorite actors has a good supporting role as a fellow hit-man who's known John a long time. The Russian mafia kingpin is played by Mikael Nyqvist, who was Mikael Blomkvist in the Swedish film adaptations of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy (known here as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). He is menacing and understandably angry with his son for bringing John's wrath upon them.If you like no apologies action films this is for you. There's even the obligatory, exclusive-techno-nightclub shootout scene through a crowded dance floor. If you're still reading you should stop and get to your local cinema to see Mr. Wick in fine lethal form.","15 out of 33 found this helpful.

Second the reason Viggo's son doesn't know about wick is because he's young and all the other gangsters have been around a lot longer than him, plus everyone thought wick was retired so why would they tell the son about a retired guy?

What is cool is reputation Keanu's character brings in, in the style of ""your reputation precedes you"" and ""my name Wick, John Wick"". In fact, Wick is originally Belorussian, as revealed in the sequels that are better than the original, and movie is not anti-Russian, in fact, Russian mobsters used to be John's friends and employers, just happen to have a millennial son or should we say SOB, with typical entitlement and lack of character issues, together with millennial trademark, an entirely empty head. The franchise plus dogs up my grade quite a bit. Taken on its own merits, the movie is little more than stylized game-play of some doom game descendant, that lacks most in the area of elementary logic. Wick kills close to 100 associates of the stupid entitled millennial's poor mobster father who is his ex boss and who respects him still, but when given a clear chance to rid of this ""baba yaga"" Wick menace, the boss does not take it. This is perhaps the most glaring plot-hole, but there are many others, since movie asks us to suspend disbelief too many times. Realism dies early in the movie, but as a substitute there is an alternative universe in which assassin coins are used for assassin business, and there is that Continental assassin safe house hotel. Such infrastructure implies abundance of assassins but who are they assassinating every day? Not even small army would need this but in war zone there is no shortage of targets, perhaps there needs to be so many assassins since they keep killing themselves at such a rate, but it is perhaps best not to overthink anything in this piece of stylized gun-game-play. It is comforting to think that life of one doggy who you barely had for a week is worth countless hooman lives, dog owners would certainly unleash hell on those who dare kill our best friends, so noble in their disposition, so uncorrupted by temptations other than juicy treats, so loyal and superior in character that, yes, he who truly knows humans cannot help but adore dogs.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Losing her to cancer, he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy, with whom he eventually connects. Things are set in motion when few Russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him & killing his dog. And so the ex-hit-man comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from him.Produced & directed by the first time filmmakers in Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators, John Wick marks a stunning directional debut for both of them & is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers. And Derek Kolstad's screenplay doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters & gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about Wick to get the plot moving.Technically, there is a lot to admire about John Wick as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot. Camera-work makes its mark in the close-combat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage & isn't ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam. Editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the film's events.Coming to the performances, the film features a capable cast in Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo & others, amongst which both Reeves & Dafoe end up impressing the most. With a character that's tailor-made for his talent & combined with his magnetic screen presence, Reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance & easily steals the show. Dafoe follows him close & despite his short role, manages to leave his mark.Yet the best thing about John Wick remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out. With its debutant directors already well-versed in the field of action choreography & stunt work, the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to single-handedly elevate John Wick into the league of cinema's finest action entertainers to come out in recent years.On an overall scale, John Wick is a smart, sophisticated & incredibly well-polished cinema that nicely balances its high-octane action & finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent, kinetic & relentless entertainer. Helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about, boasting a script that knows where to draw the line & spearheaded by Keanu Reeves' badass performance, John Wick is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out there.Welcome back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome back!","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this. Both John Wick's wife and the dog she had gifted him, get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths. The movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music. And Keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with "" The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed"". Ever since the Matrix movies released I've always wanted Keanu to play meaningful action-oriented roles. Unfortunately he hadn't managed to bag such roles until he signed for this movie.Keanu's looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going through.Also, another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing. In an 'out-an-out' action thriller like this, it's imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection. Willem Dafoe does a fantastic job as Marcus.So Keanu Reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus. Whch is why people should go to the nearest theater and watch this movie as soon as possible.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3.75 stars Family value: 1.5 stars'Fortune favours the brave' English translation of John Wick's tattoo'Do not mess with a man's dog' is basic knowledge in film class 101. From Old Yeller to Turner & Hooch, the dog serves as the catalyst for some of the key events in film history. John Wick is no different. Wick's last gift from his recently deceased wife is a puppy named Daisy. She serves as a connection to his wife and as comfort during his grief. Through a chance encounter with the Russian mafia, he is robbed and without spoiling too much of the story, they mess with the dog. Which unleashes a tale of revenge and a horrific day at the office for the men who robbed John Wick. Call it arrogance or naivety, these thieves robbed the wrong guy. Wick only recently retired from being a hit-man. Wick was not just any assassin, but The Bogeyman, feared by the mere mention of his name. The thieves cause the emotional tipping point for him to unleash his revenge on the dark criminal underworld. The story takes Wick on a hunt for the men who 'took away his opportunity to grieve' and through the process, his past is revealed and the audience is introduced to the hit-man's hidden world. His target through most of the film is Iosef Tarasov played by Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), who seems to have perfected the pathetic, elder son role in television and on the big screen. The unsympathetic character of Iosef seems to warrant the inevitable vigilante justice from his introductory scene. As with most revenge films, the believability of survival of the main character goes beyond comprehension, but it is an undeniable, guilty pleasure to experience. Keanu Reeves (Matrix) is the champion for the average man. He never comes off as too smart or fit, but is at his best with little dialogue and multiple points of action. This film happens fast and is over before you can consider the sheer lunacy of the concept. The debutant directorial team of David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, give Reeves the perfect storyline to capitalise on his strengths. Like all of the action in this film, they seem to understand that the best lines come quick, subtle and hit their mark. John Wick is a simple story of revenge shot against a dark, criminal landscape, but moves beyond the cliché. Do not misunderstand, this film is exceptionally violent, but the actions of Reeves are projected thorough the film with a force that is fuelled by well drawn supporting characters. Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe manage well orchestrated dialogue and fill in the necessary back story to quicken the pace of the film. They allow Reeves to be the action lead and he is only required to deliver memorable one liners. The quick linguistic delivery adds the needed levity for the audience to catch their breath. The film deserves its rating due to violence and language, but it does open the door to many conversation points. John Wick wrestles with the love and loss of his wife. Opening a door into the raw emotion that occurs in the life of a spouse that grieves. The loneliness, love and anger spins together into a mix that is not healthy in this film, but warrants consideration and discussion. Should people be given allowance during a time of trauma of the magnitude? The other significant plot point that should be considered is 'The Code.' When the movie moves to The Continental Hotel, things get interesting. This is a world where hit men and women go for a place of neutrality. Winston (Ian McShane) is the owner and stresses the code that underpins this violent world. Only those within the system seem to know the code and understand the penalties for breaking it, but the bigger question is who is the one who determines the code and how should justice be enacted? John Wick is merely another revenge film, but even the simplest of stories can open the door for the bigger questions of life and could even fuel conversation for those who regularly attend these films. Leaving the cinema... This is a simple, but well made film. Cinematic simplicity is a fine line. The creators of the film have to determine what to add or take away for the effectiveness of a film. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but with John Wick it works. This was the right film to capitalise on Keanu Reeves strengths and was a fresh telling of a well worn story line. If you remember anything, don't mess with the dog!Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is revenge the answer to injustice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:17-21) 2. What is biblical justice? (Psalm 7:9, Romans 3:5-6) 3. Who determines right and wrong? (John 3:19-21, Matthew 28:18)Please study the rating before going to see this film.

"6","/10","101 minutes of Keanu Reeves laying out henchmen after henchmen in a revenge thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5228312/?ref_=tt_urv","kikoydaba3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37367224/?ref_=tt_urv","1 November 2019","John Wick stacks the body count in a wickedly fun revenge thriller starring Keanu Reeves about a retired assassin drawn back to a previous life of murder and violence after a vicious break-in and theft led by a Russian mobster's son. Despite a thin script, 101 minutes of gratuitous violence ultimately pays off due to sheer spectacle, some stylish direction, and incredible action set pieces.Keanu Reeves has never been known as an actor with a wide range but instead limited to certain roles that show little emotion. As a character, John Wick is perfectly suited for Reeves. Characterized as an unassuming quiet, grieving widower, Wick is actually a no-nonsense former assassin in retirement after finding love. Coupled with director Chad Stahelski, a veteran stuntman and coordinator, and Reeves' history of playing badass male leads, this is the film to take Keanu Reeves back to previous career highs not seen since The Matrix trilogy and which would go on to launch a successful and critically well-received franchise. Reeves owns the role of Wick. The casting couldn't be more perfect.Primarily, John Wick is centered on loss and revenge. Wick is out for blood against the people who took away everything important in his life. As an exploration of the aforementioned themes, the film only goes skin-deep, failing to dig deeper into the character's persona and background. Majority of Wick's history is shown through flashbacks and subtle dialogue. While the script leaves a lot to be desired, the character interactions aren't preachy, grounding the film on an emotional and human level. More importantly, Wick does not really grow as a character. He's not placed in a situation that questions his motives allowing room for him to grow.The film takes its themes seriously, but perhaps intentionally, it's also a satire on the futility and value of masculinity. Characters within the film present this dual approach of tackling a subject matter common in Hollywood cinema. Iosef Tarasov, played by Alfie Allen, embraces hypermasculinity with his arrogant, selfish and entitled personality being the son of Russian Mobster Viggo Tarasov, played by Michael Nyqvist. John Wick is the exact opposite with a laid back attitude. Iosef initiates the plot of the film when he and his group conducted a vicious burglary that beat Wick, ransacked his home, killed his dog left behind by his deceased wife, and stole his treasured car. Unknowingly to him, Wick formerly works for his father and is nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"", Russian for ""Boogeyman."" As Wick hunts down Iosef, the opposite occurs between the characters as Iosef's toxic hypermasculinity is exposed as fraudulent when faced with an actual credible threat. Wick finds again the machismo he once discarded.Themes of loyalty, word of honor and brotherhood are also present. Marcus, played by Willem Dafoe, is Wick's mentor and friend. Hired by Viggo to kill Wick, he broke the contract when another assassin, Ms. Perkins, comes in and vies for the prize, probably also out of mutual respect. He is tortured then murdered when Viggo learns of his betrayal. Ms. Perkins is killed for breaking The Continental's policy of no ""business"" transaction within hotel grounds. Lastly, Viggo is killed by Wick by protecting his son. In the criminal underworld, death is the ultimate fate.John Wick's strengths are its direction and fight scenes. For lovers of neo-noir, Spaghetti Westerns and Hong Kong martial arts cinema, Chad Stahelski has great command, specifically in the cinematography department, in paying homages to his film's influences bringing a unique testosterone-charged modern twist of the genres. The score is also great from Tyler Bates, containing a mix of techno and rock music.The sequel has lots of potentials that the first has failed to tackle. Put a heavier emphasis on character development, not just lip-service dialogue. Here's to hoping it exceeds the first.6/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Story: well the story is based on revenge and it's interesting to see how these kind of story end up, but the annoying part is that all he is doing is just killing they could have just showed us a background of his story
Also I liked that he wont stop at nothing to get his revenge it shows us that he's detrement I really liked that about the story.
Character: Keanu Reeves played John Wick really well. his look, his hair are well suited, speaking of suits the suits in the movie look really good and it makes him look like a villain.
Most of the characters did a good job in the movie. Also I really enjoyed Keanu Reeves shooting skills he shoots like it's a real gun whcih is really nice .
cinema photography: They did a good job in terms of continuous shot while he was shooting people
The low light/ dark shots were nice not too dark no to bright
So yeah I gave it 8.0/10 since they didn't show more of his story rather they showwed more of him killing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Other than that I say that GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!!! movie starts like this..... The movie's setup is almost comical in its simplicity. Reeves plays the hero of the title, a legendarily immortal (almost Keyser Söze-like) hit-man who retired from the profession five years earlier when he fell in love. But his wife has just passed away, and some hot- headed Russian gangster (Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen) has foolishly interrupted his grieving by stealing his 1969 Ford Mustang, beating the snot out of him, and killing his dog. And you just don't mess with a man's dog. John Wick is back in business. Decked out in a natty black three-piece suit and a scruffy beard, Wick is a classic man of few words. He's Clint Eastwood minus the cheroot and the spaghetti. I'd be surprised if he speaks more than a dozen lines in the film. But when he opens his mouth, you can be damn sure he means what he says. His is the language of high-caliber bursts of lead and acrobatic fists-of-fury beat-downs.","11 out of 25 found this helpful.

But still, I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be something wrong.I am a big fan of Keanu. And I do not mind action movie with simple plot, as long as it looks cool. Nevertheless, I was brought down big time. The plot is unbelievably ridiculous. It will leave you amazed, wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt intelligently insulted, to be honest. And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed. John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and grunts, and moans. Nothing else. Everything cool about him is what you heard the others say before the fighting starts.I hope this review can actually reach someone, and help to stop them from wasting their time watching this movie.

Called to be the best action film of 2014, John Wick is a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of it's director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator. Each armed combat we have the opportunity to enjoy is wonderfully imagined, well polished and sublimely executed by a Reeves, that finally, is back, and apparently with a name that could have the title of legend. Filling the 101 minutes of pleasant clichés, Derek Kolstad delivers a script with a new and unique underworld, made out of rules that must be obeyed and a moral code that can be broken if the price is right. With a simple plot, good humor and a Keanu Reeves back to his days of anti-hero chosen by chance, John Wick is a possible franchise that should continue with its beautifully made clichés, that should exaggerate their camera movements and that should fill with cameos every table of that little new world.

I'm not a Keanu Reeves fanatic, I just like very good movies and he starred in this on. So my son recommended we see it and I agreed, but I did not know what to expect. I do know Keanu has made the best movies of his career, when he moved away from Hollywood main production companies. This film, I think, brought it all! It is about a man, not a good man. A man with quite an evil past, and has put that past behind him. So now it is just him and his Dog. Then it begins, I mean really begins. It opens into some of the best action scenes I have seen in years and they are not flash filler, they really work! This movie moves you from sorrow to anger to wanting revenge! Such a great movie, I had to buy it for my personal collection. So I recommend at least renting it. There is graphic violence because of the nature and lifestyle career of the characters, so no young people recommended!","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

If you liked Jack Reacher, you'll love John Wick.

First review for the retards who saw the movie and rated 1*.1.Movie is about an ex hit-man (obvio)= retired, so in the movie like the character says ""he is rusty"", and thus when the fellas break-in to his house he got hit, the first hit was on the BACK. of his HEAD. Someone please explain to these fools some anatomy.2.Those who've worked with him know him, he is not Einstein or GOD that everyone in the world know him. In Mafia world the kid is new, unless he likes learning history books, he wouldn't know.3.He didn't miss the hit on kid dude, the hit was on the glass but accurate, then he had a hostage etc., he is using a short range weapon, consider movement and distance to target too. dude buy some new specs or brain.4.He didn't kill ""female assassin"" cause: a)It was continental grounds b)He wanted info.5.I will agree after vigo gets him, he could've done better,dude he wont just kill John, vigo will torture him, the ""bag"" scene wasn't much of a torture that I will agree. The bounty was before he burnt his vault to the ground buddy.Now do I have to really point out who have ""brain cells"".Now for those who didn't see yet.The movie is well scripted as any action movie can be. The mag rounds, even safety switches. There are a few holes obvio, but is rare compared to other of the same genre - you know sometimes he forgets that he was hit by a car etc.., the delay of Parkin's death, the pillow shot. A few like that, you do understand by now you're trying to find holes as if it was based on a true story :D :D, that shows how good this movie is.Its worth watching buds, and please use your brains too. The sequel is good too.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Highly entertaining for the majority of the runtime thanks to the heart pounding music, breath taking stunts and Keanu Reeves himself. The cinematography used in this film is extraordinary especially during the night club scene where I have never witnessed Keanu Reeves kick that much ass since the matrix. There were stirring hand to hand combat scenes and verbal responses to the death scenes as I sat in my chair feeling the adrenaline throbbing in my insides. As for the performances, the acting was satisfying enough for an action flick, except for Willem Dafoe he was excellent, but c'mon he's always excellent. The action sequences were handled very nicely every shot was sharp and precise unlike recent action films that use shaky cam techniques, where you can't even identify whose fighting who. Which makes this a very refreshing action film, and highly satisfying for any one who wants Neo back on the big screen. I would highly recommend this film for any action lovers or any Keanu Reeves fan *(and Willem Dafoe). Hands down best 2014 Action flick and a successful resurrection for Kenau's career.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

The story which starts off as interesting loses your attention almost as instantly. A retired hitman (or so they call him) single-handedly outmanoeuvres a flock of gangsters, including their boss.Performances: Keanu Reeves as the titular character carries the burden of almost everything that happens in the rather short run of 101 minutes of the movie. Alfie Allen (hey there, Reek!), Adrianne Palicki and Ian McShane are decent in portraying their characters. Michael Nyqvist shines as the baddie boss.Overall verdict: John Wick is another one of those stereotypical action movies, the only difference being that there is way too much action and gravity-defying stunts stuffed into it. While a section of the audience might enjoy this action-packed flick, I'd rather like to watch a movie that is equal on both fronts-the story and the action.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The choreography is great and really delivers that fantasy that John Wick is just an indestructible assassin.Unfortunately that's about all the movie has to offer.The plot is minimal, almost tacked-on. There is no character development. There is nothing this movie has to say. There is no intrigue, no drama, no comedy, no romance (thankfully). It's just one and a half hours of constant action choreography with a laughably weak ""video game"" plot. It like like watching someone play a video game. That may be your thing, but for me it wore very thin. By saying all that I almost feel like I've given away spoilers.What makes John Wick most disappointing though, is that Keanu's been in better action movies, with better action scenes, and with philosophical themes and social commentary. Like... ""The Matrix""? Compared to that movie, John Wick is very weak indeed as a piece of cinema. I don't understand why people rate it highly - although it works as a piece of cathartic release, or something to watch for ""Netflix and chill"" - where the point of the movie is not to actually watch it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It could be more creative, with a movie like this you can do anything that fits the excitement, but some things are very basic, like the exposition, some times it does a great job at the ""show don't tell rule"", then right after has the characters talking about John Wick's back story instead of just showing us, like I would prefer.

John Wick incorporates everything you could possibly want in an action flick, with a great soundtrack, great filming techniques, and just outstanding action. I really think this is Keanu Reeves' greatest movie. All the plot holes others are talking about aren't plot holes at all. They are just part of an amazing action flick that is meant to take people to a different reality, which has is why people go to the movies in the first place. I could not stop thinking about this movie for days after I saw it. Sorry for not being the greatest reviewer and writer, but you will not be disappointed if you go see this movie.

"9","/10","Destroying Convention with Gun-Fu","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3123168/?ref_=tt_urv","stephenlovelette","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25447573/?ref_=tt_urv","13 November 2014","I'm done marginalizing film tastes in terms of genderis originally how I began this review.Yet it's the antithesis of my gut response to John Wick:""Highly recommend for mainly male moviegoers,"" my heart mentions as the credits roll.The cranium cogs start whirling.""Isn't that rhetoric unproductive? Shouldn't we discourage that type of thinking?"" my intellectual side fires back.Thus prompting the rough introduction.While reviewing J. Wick on The Screen Rant Underground, two of the hosts offer a counterargument in mentioning their wives' dislike. One goes so far as to say she 'hated it.'(Side Note: The words 'hate' and 'boring' are the two most overused descriptors in the English language.)'Violence' and 'Romance' occupy the extremities of the gender Venn diagram.Men prefer fighting; women prefer feeling. Simple as that, folks.""It's a social construct! The best movies lie in the diagram's center! To mention the pattern is to perpetuate it!"" the brain chimes in.The inescapable reality is: The paradigm exists.Whether I like it or not.To put an untidy bow on my point: Isn't it stilted claiming a movie is excellent (better than great), but for male audiences only? Doesn't that imply John Wick is terrible, if viewed by a female audience?Surely there are women who enjoy gun-fu. Shouldn't they feel insulted by the suggestion?Anyhow; you catch my drift.Here's my Top Five Movies with the Protagonist's Full Name as the Title –1. Donnie Darko 2. Annie Hall 3. Forrest Gump 4. Happy Gilmore 5. Billy MadisonJohn Wick is similar to Denzel Washington's character from last month's The Equalizer.Both protagonists are similar to Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, who is also an ex-CIA agent.Say what you will about his surfing abilities in Point Break, Keanu Reeves is terrific as the leading hombre.Keanu's John's less virtuous, and less lady-magnet than Tom's Jack, but they both can drive in reverse like champions.Which marks the first of three lessons I learned from J.W. about firearms.Lesson 1) If you must drive at enemy gunfire, do so in reverse.Keanu's acting is great. Soft-spoken and pragmatic; sympathy sits with him quite nicely.Plus he does all his own fighting and stunts.In the hand-to-hand combat; the viewer can tell he's absorbing all the blows. He falls off a balcony!Keanu's just terrific.The action scenes are phenomenal.Throughout the entire film, the epic fight sequences rival the best in cinematic history.The gunplay is realistic and grounded. You've never seen such concrete shootouts.Lesson 2) Due to recoil, hand-held assault rifles can only be fired in bursts.Wick manages to dispatch a number of thugs in an organic fashion.It especially illustrates the possibilities for less cutting, and more believable action in the film industry.Lesson 3) Those who wield a pistol at the ready (like a cop entering the home of a serial killer) live longest.The stuntwork is absolutely spectacular; far too much fiddling with convention to mention.During an explosion, there is an actual stuntman in the foreground nearby the exploding material.He catches fire! It's awesome!Who doesn't love John Leguizamo? Talk about reliable.Alfie Allen catches critical heat for playing a similar role on Game of Thrones, which is unnecessary. He does a fine job for what he's cast as.Good to see WCW's Kevin Nash playing a small part.Ian McShane is terrific as always. Somebody's not paying him enough.Willem DeFoe plays a man who serves vegetable puree rather than booze at a meeting of criminal wits. Yet another shiny bullet on DeFoe's lengthy list.Adrianne Palicki plays a solid murderess.Ironically enough, the only time I was 'taken out of' the movie is during footage of her stunt double.Finally, the off-type villain is performed excellently by Michael Nyqvist.John Wick may be the poster-child for breaking cliché; which is shaping up to be the number one theme for cinema 2014.Catch it in IMAX while it's still in theaters.There's no stinger after the credits roll.But hey. I'd be down for a sequel.","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

I grew up with the over the top movies of the 80's like Commando,Rambo and so on. I loved those when i was young, if i watch them now i can't make it further then 10 minutes but John Wick took me back to those times.In recent years a lot of directors tried to make a movie like this and failed simply because they took themselves too seriously. John Wick just is what it is, a very violent movie without any pretense to being more. The direction is great, the production is great, the acting is good. It takes me back to the movies of my youth.Of course this is isn't the best movie ever made, Michael Nyqvist shouldn't be in a Hollywood production in my opinion and what i don't like of the modern movies is the very obvious CGI wounds and blood, it is just not good and very distracting.But i give this movie a solid 8, i really enjoyed it, don't expect too much just relax and watch it","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Whenever Keanu Reeves dons a beard, he turns into this believable bad ass that is fun to watch. While I don't think the character of John Wick had really any amazing hand-to-hand fighting skills, his real skill was the point blank range shot. No hesitation, just one after another killed by his skill for doing this. It was quite brutal, I'll be honest, but nonetheless very effective. Theon Greyjoy was unrecognizable (at first) as the snotty son who thought he could get away with killing Wick's dog. I loved the whole hotel/safehouse aspect of the story, that was pretty cool. I haven't seen the sequel yet but I've been told it's better than the first one so I'm looking forward to seeing it soon.Overall, I would recommend this movie to action lovers for sure and maybe those who are looking for a good action movie because there hasn't been a good one in quite a while it seems.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The two have done stunts in many, many films and their understanding of good action choreography really comes to light in John Wick. The numerous fights are fast, frenetic and creative. Reeves is certainly at the best he's been in a while, but don't expect to be blown away. The catatonic nature that has held him since the mid '00s seems to be fading away. Just reference this and 47 Ronin (2013) and the fantastic Reeves directed Man of Tai Chi (2013).The rest of the cast seems to be having fun, especially Dafoe who cameos as an aging hit-man. Nyqvist is the other standout in the bunch, delightfully adding dark comedy to his bits rambling about the dangerous John Wick. There is no doubt that this is Reeves' show, but everyone else doesn't seem to be just phoning it in. The set design and the cinematography are absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are held in intricately detailed environments, most notably a neon-washed nightclub scene that will really dazzle your eyes. The color palates are suitably washed, with sudden bursts of color such as in the aforementioned night club. Where everything production-wise comes together correctly, the writing seems to be what holds this down from being an action classic. It is at times witty and engaging, yes, but its mainly a mish-mash of tired clichés to string you along its gorgeous set pieces. The revenge story is one of the oldest in cinema. Hybridizing it with the ""you killed my dog, now you'll pay"" trope was clever, but ultimately not enough to stand out. In the end, John Wick is a fun flick worth watching with a group of friends. Don't expect much cerebrally, but be sure to keep a sharp eye for the rich detail put into every frame of this well- crafted action film.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

In the 50s and 60s they had Western gunslingers like Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. As opposed to the jungle soldiers of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.One facet of these films that I feel are not often brought up are the settings. In the Westerns of the past they were commonly set in barren deserts or the high plains of the United States. Whereas the aforementioned eighties by comparison, where often set in foreign jungles like Vietnam.John Wick in many ways marches to the beat of it's own drum. Firstly by giving the retired assassin a incredibly emotional reason to return to his former life. As well as by utilizing a modern industrial environment to enhance the gun fights.Besides just aiding the fight scenes, this setting is built up. By introducing to the audience already established world building elements. That really makes the world feel lived in. Such as the body disposal men, The Continental Hotel, and finally the implied existence of The High Table. And all of this is even further fleshed out in future entries.There are a multitude of reasons why this film is phenomenal. But the final of which I have to mention is the cinematography. Which is brilliantly used to hide Wick in shadows until his efficient kills. Giving him an almost other worldly presence on screen.

"6","/10","Non stop monotony--beautifully filmed but a linear plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3129941/?ref_=tt_urv","secondtake","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20961309/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2014","John Wick (2014)I thought the weak point of this movie would be Keanu Reeves, since he's not the best actor in town. But instead it was the monotony of the killing, on and on, all at the same pace, with hardly a break.I'm not complaining about violence here—that's what this kind of revenge movie is all about. Reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin, one of the best, and he has to come out of retirement (you'll see why in the first ten minutes). And he is now after some of the people he once worked for, so they are formidable foes, and cruel.But that's about it. The process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie, and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses, the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy. Mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting. So, how to make a movie that has this one-liner idea work? With psychology, cleverness, surprise, and even failure sometimes. You won't see any of that here. You also won't see humor. By luck, the preview for my showing (in a theater) was ""Die Hard,"" and what a reminder of a terrific action movie, where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies. But there it's funny, there are constant twists and turns, and you actually care about the hero.That's another problem here: you care about Mr. Wick because he was wronged at the start, but he's not a sympathetic person. You just don't really worry about him. I suppose you know he won't die right away, so you are ""on his side"" more or less, but not with much investment. In a weird way, some of the villains were more compelling than Wick—the main bad guy is a terrific Michael Nyqvist (who is always really good), and Willem Dafoe plays a terrific small, key part.I might have left a movie this straight forward if it weren't for one thing—it's photographed well. The camera, light, and generally the editing, are all elegant and almost pretty, in a good way. The sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty. Good stuff, and it had my eyes glued.Now give the thing something more and glue the rest of me.","10 out of 30 found this helpful.

The action in this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy. It didn't have long boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some action to start. It was perfectly done, much like ""Predator"" or ""The Equalizer"" or, better yet, ""The Matrix"". In fact, while watching this film I was reminded of the ""Matrix"" a time or two. No mystery why. The acting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the small screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and believable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like I said, it's simple but it's good.

Keanu Reeves....I swear everything I see him in, while most of the movies I enjoy, his characters in them I usually don't...they all seem to come from the same type of mold...all rather coldish in some aspect, dryish stale, not saying he's a bad actor, he just seems to always be the same person in everything...maybe it's just me. This is why up until this movie, my favorite character of his was always Ted in the Bill & Ted movies cause he is so different from the other characters he's played. Firstly, this is one heck of an action movie, I kept finding myself sad whenever I thought it was just about to end, just to have another action packed scene come in instead and be joyous again..lol. The soundtrack is Epic (for me anyways...I'm a musician with a similar style so it really stood out for me.)Reeve's character though....reminded me a little somewhat of him in Constantine...only in that in both he's a bit hard/cold good/bad guy, but in a totally different way in each of them...I don't know if it's just his unshaven, badass look in this movie, or his acting, but I didn't feel like, ""Oh, this is just Keanu Reeves again,"" and more like, ""This is John Wick."" Meaning the character itself stood out so much more, if that makes sense. May sound silly to some. I also love the way how he's so precise in his movements when going after people. I so wish I had gotten to see this in the theater. Sure there may not be a whole lot to the story, it's simple and whatnot, but for the person going into this wanting pure action such, this is perfect. I heard a lot of bad reviews stating ""oh this has been done over and over, it's old, nothing new, seen it before, blah blah blah."" But...take 3 movies, all very high grossing...Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai, and Avatar....all 3 have a similar premise which is mostly why haters of Avatar disliked it...said it was too much like Dances With Wolves....I kinda thought The Last Samurai fit that premise too, but love that movie nevertheless and unless I just haven't heard it or something, I've never heard people dis The Last Samurai like that...meaning I think people went into Avatar expecting something like even more complex, bigger, different in whatever way they were hoping for....I think the same happens here with John Wick...even though it has a good rating, all the bad things I hear about it are almost all the same.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Its stunning choreography, seamless switching-up of fighting styles and without a doubt; its cast, are impeccable. Reminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as 'Taken,' and 'The Man from nowhere;' John Wick enthrals the audience with it's visuals while keeping you connected with it's personal performances. Keanu Reeves was born to play the part of John Wick; the nice, quiet guy with a big dark secret. If you're looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully grasp it's countless layers and subplots; go watch Memento, or Donnie Darko. If you're looking for a movie you want to watch twice because you have to show your buddy what a bada** Keanu Reeves' is; then look no further. John Wick is as manly as a steak dinner washed down with a 6-pack of PBR.

Like I anticipated, judging by reviews, it was well worth my time. However, what I didn't anticipate was how ordinary the story was. We've seen this type of story many times where the Hero has an excuse to kill a lot of people.What separates John Wick from other films of this type is it's style. I don't remember seeing people get shot in the head and then blood splatter in such a way. Many times this happened, and it's very effective. But more than anything, it's Keanu Reeves' focus that makes this movie special.Many times I'll watch a film, and look to see the actor, ""acting"", or just going through the motions for a paycheck. The last Indiana Jones adventure comes to mind. But throughout every frame of John Wick Keanu Reeves is 100% focused on the character. In the fight scenes, many of them, I never saw a stunt man. That was Keanu, potent, violent, and effective.For me, the movie could have used a little more exposition, i.e a little more Bridget Moynahan, and a little more of his bonding with the dog. There probably was in the original cut, but I'm sure some hotshot exec said ""cut all that stuff out. They just wanna see Keanu kick ass!"" But don't get me wrong. This film is a must see, for stylized action sequences and particularly, Keanu Reeves' performance. The latter is really something to see.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

We would be hard put to name even one film after that. Last year, he directed a martial arts film called Man of Tai Chi, where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man. That did not fly too high, except perhaps for some hardcore action fans. For this year though, the buzz for this film ""John Wick"" was simply too high to ignore. The plot is ripped off the plots of many other old-fashioned action films, especially those from the 1980s. JOhn Wick is a retired hit man. He is still very depressed about his wife's death. One day, a group of thugs break into John's house and destroy his wife's one most precious gift to him. John finds out the perpetrator Iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss, Viggo. John then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left alive.Yes, there is not much about that script to be excited about. However, for their first directorial effort, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the stunt coordinators for Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix"", make a spectacular debut. Their action sequences were fast-clipped, very exciting and relentlessly brutal. Be it gunplay, knife-play or martial arts, Keanu Reeves made a perfect action hero.A lot of this film's success also comes because of Reeves' excellence in dramatic acting. Okay, so there only few of those moments. We will remember fondly his devotion to his wife, which Reeves was able to project very well without words. He was sincerely in those touching scenes.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

That makes it seem more real.The grittiness of the action scenes also adds to them.Choreography is brilliant, cinematography is beautiful. These action scenes have a clear ""flow"", i.e. don't degenerate into a collection of fast moving extreme close-ups. The storytelling may be simple, but extremely well done in a visual way.

This movie starts of very strong, with a plot that seems like it is about to elevate this movie into something more than just another action flick. It almost looks like it will delve into that rarely seen realm of an action flick with a decent story. Then it gets about halfway through and becomes so very predictable and rather boring. I rarely use the word boring even describing average to mediocre action films but that is exactly what happens to this movie about halfway through. How can a movie full of action be boring is something the people who made this film should ponder. I cannot really blame the cast as they all were pretty good in their roles, the story was just straight booty after the halfway point. This is a prime example of a movie that should have ended like 40 minutes prior to when it did. When the main character achieved his goal is when it should have ended but the just had to add on another 40- 60 minutes of movie which just made everything up to that point seem like a wasted effort. Shame on the writers, directors, financiers, and all the behind the scenes magic that made this movie for not realizing this movie was headed into the absurd realm sooner. You would be better suited spending your cash on almost ANY other movie at the box office this weekend if you insist on seeing this film. The saddest part of this is that Keanu Reeves (and all the cast) actually did some pretty good acting in this film, not his usual phoning it in. Anybody who says this movie is more than a below average action movie is not somebody who has seen the movie or a person with poor film taste.","10 out of 32 found this helpful.

Fortunately, John Wick puts Reeves back on track again - he is the real ""filler"" in this movie, there are a few short scenes without his presence, and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen. True, one can find similarities with his character in e.g. Matrix and A Scanner Darkly, and the plot has several flaws and airy-fairy moments, but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner, with both multiple angles and endings. Reeves/Wick is a gloomy and firm man, his deeds are certain and final, yet dog- and wife-related scenes are nice and touching. And the locality of Hotel Continental is unconventional.Apart from Reeves, there are many other distinctive performances as well, practically all who have verbal roles. Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov) is a due antagonist to Reeves; rather frequently, there is no proper confrontation because the ""bad guy"" is more versatile/fascinating than the ""good guy"" (or vice versa).All in all, the movie in question is no Tarantino, but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

This is a relatively watchable action/revenge picture with a title character that could have as easily been portrayed by a cereal box as an actor. The good news is Reeves makes a great cereal box. He doesn't have to speak, and barely has to act. The mood and style of the picture are well accomplished, and the plot is straight linear: widower, retired hit man John Wick is out for revenge on the Russian mob punk who stole his car and killed his dog. Since Reeves is at his best when he is not speaking, there is plenty of time for him to slaughter a boatload of Russian mobsters in pursuit of said revenge. And the actions scenes are well executed. (Pun intended.)The film is enhanced by some well placed characters, well crafted by fine actors. Ian MchShane, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Dean Winters all turn in well drawn, interesting and amusing characters whenever there is a break in the action. Bridget Moynihan plays Wick's flashback wife in a kind of gratuitous cameo. Not much to do for her, though what little she has to work with is done well.There is already talk of John Wick becoming a ""franchise.""The producers might do well to take a cue from the Bond films and rotate the role of the title character.

The movie has been directed by Chad Stahelski , a stunt coordinator and stuntman having contributed his talent and professional services in movies like The Matrix , Van Helsing, Point Break, Die Hard 4.0 , Rambo (a Burma) etc. In view of the above it is abundantly clear and painfully obvious that John Wick features impressive action scenes, well oiled stunts and fairly violent imagery. As is the case with with most Keanu Reeves filcks, the movie has a dark and an almost grimy feel to it. The story however is fairly straightforward much unlike The Matrix (which I consider to be a huge relief, since unintelligible plots are overrated) . It is a revenge saga and employs some very typical elements to accommodate a lavish quantum of bullets and blood .The soundtrack is impressive and adds zing to the pace of the movie . Talking about pace, the movie is not very slow but some sequences seem stretched , which is really surprising given the short run time of the movie (barely 100 minutes). But the action is well directed and hence we can overlook this blemish.It is an entertaining action movie devoid of any psychological complexity or ""grey"" areas. If you are a Reeves fan do watch it for he has done a good job in this movie as well.

Then she dies and for him not to be alone she had arranged for a Beagle puppy delivered to him at home. Then the son of mob boss Viggio (Michael Nyqvist) - who John Wick used to work for - wants his car ( a souped-up 1969 Mustang ) beats him up and kills the puppy. John Wick recovers and knows what he has to do. Let the games begin. Most hit-man stories have the hit-man (or a narrator) tell about his life and the specific numbered rules he lives by. And during the time of the movie, we will see this hit-man break every rule he has. This time it's different. This time it's pure revenge. We don't know the rules John Wick used to live by. But make no mistake about all this, now John Wick is out to make things righthis way (get chills saying that?).To be clear we learn that everyone, including Viggio, is afraid of John Wick, but Viggio must protect his son from John Wick. The rest of the movie is a well-orchestrated choreography of gun fights. Some special effects regarding vehicles are included and are quite good. The cinematography in this gun-fest is also quite good. The music is non-stop heart pounding throughout. Hit-man Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is contracted by Viggio to take out John Wick. This is insurance in case Viggio's men don't get the job done. Keanu Reeves is the right actor for this movie. As John Wick, he doesn't talk much but his stares speak volumes (don't forget his guns too). In fact, I have always seen Keanu Reeves as the right actor for any movie he is in. After his character's beating when the car and the dog were gone I felt his pain and loss. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much.Rating: B","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I thought to myself...'Oh great, another shoot em up revenge type movie', and it is that but it's all in how the movie is made. Keanu Reeves does a very good job and was a good choice to play the character of John Wick. There is lots of originality to be found in the movie and that is what gives it the ump! This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored at all. Go see it in the theaters and you will not be disappointed, trust me.

So whatever way, you're thinking it's going to end, that's the way it's going to end. John Wick is about a man, a retired hit-man, who lost his wife before having a puppy in his possession because it is the last gift she gives him, but when everything is taken away from him, he's out for blood and yeah, it's personal. It was good to see Keanu Reeves back and actually making you believe his character was a hit-man once in his life. It wasn't much speaking. It was all about the fight scenes. It became nonstop and didn't slow down. It's definitely a step up from 47 Ronin. In a way, this film will remind you of The Equalizer, BUT The Equalizer was a lot better. It was still a good film for Reeves, and hopefully, we'll see him again like this. If you need a film for this weekend, something to have you on the edge of your seat and just enjoying an adrenaline rush, go see John Wick.","7 out of 23 found this helpful.

First of all, Keanu Reeves is pretty good on screen, and plays an interesting avenger. The bad guys seem to have an endless supply of stupid employees who allow their heads to be blown off. Sounds stupid? But the directing and movement of the characters during the incredibly long scenes of destruction are quite amazing. It's sort of a Kill Bill thing. Anyway, it is engaging. I did like that cast. The kid that was in Game of Thrones (who was eviscerated in that show) was a nice foil for Wick. We also have the fellow who is Mayhem in the insurance commercials. Of course, there are enough loose ends for the sequels (which number two at this point). I probably won't bother if they just have more of the same. Put an actual plot in there and you would have a bit of balance.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

If you are in the mood and itching for a brainless revenge tale and over the top action, John Wick will scratch that itch. Granted, as it was mentioned by others, there are plot holes and sequences that defies logic and common sense. But a movie is a movie, it is like a fantasy that plays out on a big screen. Ask yourself, does any of your fantasies stand against the trial of logic? I guess not. So lets move on. John Wick was lethal and ruthless professional hit man, and he was known for that. But he got out and he got comfortable. That's why in the beginning of the movie, he was a little slow and rusty. That was not a plot hole or scripting error. But as he step back into the dark world of the past, he started remembering and picking up the pace. He's becoming the legendary John Wick again right on the screen. And you feel that, and that is damn satisfying. Keanu Reeves is John Wick! His woodiness and dead eye stare adds to overall feel of a killing machine that he was. Different from the roles he played before, he's more mature, more weathered. The sign of aging and roughness of his appearance now made him perfect for John Wick, and his usual arrogance and stubbornness just made John Wick more bad ass and fearless. He's perfectly dressed for cocktail party, but he kills like a rabid dog on drugs. He's effective and merciless, he cuts right to the point and no bullshit. He rarely talks. When he does open his mouth, nothing fancy or philosophical comes out. He wants revenge and he makes sure that he gets it. I don't know about you but I dig that. It's like a breath of fresh air. No more melodramatic moral dilemma. When all you had was taken away from you, you want to be John Wick, no freaking question asked!This film has the style of noir and carnage of manga. It is not big on logic, but it is what it is: a no bullshit and no brainer revenge tale. You want to mess with me? Okay, let's see if I kill you all, how you are going to mess with me now?","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

For action fans, I would definitely recommend it, the camera work is still yet dynamic, and allows us to see a great view of the action while not obscuring anything that happens. All of the action scenes are quick, to the point, brutal, and have consequences for all characters involved. John Wick isn't presented as invincible, just highly skilled and lucky. His character has been out of the assassination game for over 5 years, and that makes Keanu Reeves playing the part a bit more of an easier pill to swallow. Although I might want to bite my own tongue here, because for a man nearing 50, he carried out every scene to the letter and in my opinion was more tough and convincing than he ever was in any of The Matrix films here. I saw influence from another great 00's action flick, The Man from Nowhere, which if you haven't seen but enjoyed this, I would highly recommend. John Wick has a lot of style, the locations are spectacular, I often found myself asking ""Where did they find this place?"" Gorgeous Victorian and old school architecture to high tech modernized homes, you really feel that you've covered a lot of ground watching this. Another element of the style is the world it takes place in. It's a very stylized, slick graphic novel type alternate reality, where coded language, an honor code amongst assassins, and even secret resources and hotels for them is all the norm. The film doesn't treat any of this as strange and takes you along into this bizarre world, revealing more and more at a time, while including things such as John Wick running out of ammo multiple times to keep it refreshingly grounded. Again, in terms of writing, story, or acting, this isn't a critic's dream. I saw this with a friend on a lazy Saturday morning after having some Waffle House, I feel that is exactly how this movie is meant to be enjoyed. As an added note, as a martial artist myself, I appreciated the use of Judo and Jiu-Jitsu on film, most movie fight scenes are 90% striking based and are afraid to show ground and grapple work. Good on them for not being shy of it. John Wick gets a 7 out of 10 for slick, well choreographed action and a quirky, dark humour sheen, complete with a high body count.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a simple action movie that never wants to be anything more than that, it never gets too complicated, it's story is easy to follow and the action sequences are amazingly choreographed, it's a huge surprise to know that it's made by two first time directors, because they already seem like professionals. I felt the movie needed more depth, though I did certainly feel certainly feel for the main character, they glossed over the story about his wife, it should have been more constructed, it's only an hour and forty minutes long, and they easily could have added an extra fifteen minutes to develop their relationship some more. The performances are excellent, there are some top class acting from the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willie Dafoe and Ian McShane, but the best performance certainly goes to Keanu Reeves, who shines in this film and, for the first time since the Matrix, he feels like a real action star, his characterisation for Wick is terrific, he's flawed, emotional and vengeful, it's a character that we can easily feel for and support. Action packed and a ton of simple fun, I would recommend John Wick to anyone looking for a good action. A hit-man comes out of retirement in order to take down the men who took everything he loves away from him. Best Performance: Keanu Reeves Worst Performance: Omar Barnea","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

And he does know that I suffer through them, therefore, we don't watch them very often in our household. This movie I not only watched all by myself but enjoyed every minute of it! So why did I start watching it by myself in a first place? One evening I felt like watching myself some eye candy that is Reeves, so sue me. I was prepared, however, to stop it any minute I got tired of it.Also, my first language is Russian; so yes, I get annoyed too when American/British/Australian actors try to pass of as Russian dudes, when I can't understand a single word spoken in awful Russian. But I watched many other movies where a) Russian guys are bad and/or stupid guys and b) speak incomprehensible Russian. Why should this particular movie be singled out? It's not the point!As other reviewers noted, this whole movie is all about fun and pure entertainment. And when I do watch a movie, I want fun and entertainment: not to be depressed, shocked, and saddened out of my wits. Real life can do that sufficiently enough.The first 20 or so minutes were depressing, but they went by fast and served as a backstory. After that...done! Enjoy the ride! I don't think I have ever seen such upbeat action movie where I found myself laughing on numerous occasions. And I agree, there is something Tarantino-esque about this movie but I actually thought that this movie was much better, as it dialed down the gore while keeping surreal atmosphere throughout.In short, this is entertainment people! This is why we go to the movies in the first place! I am just getting sick and tired of all the ""art"" pieces portraying real word/life/struggles, etc which regrettably are more and more prevalent these days.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just another action film in which my easily impressed friend announced was his new favorite movie.Turns out, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Sure it doesn't have a deep plot or interesting characters, but it has a twist on modern action movies that I haven't really seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was actually quite humorous. I found the over-the- top-ness to be quite entertaining. The action is good, nothing special though. Typical action movie action. EXCEPT! John Wick reloads his gun! That's right, this action movie is not only creative, but realistic! Now that's a rarity in action movies these days. Overall, John Wick is different, and it scores points on that level. However, the ending was forced which really took away from the experience, and the action, plot, and characters really aren't anything special (except John Wick reloads), which is where it loses points. I understand that it's an action movie, but that doesn't excuse it from key points required in making a good movie. In the end, if your looking for a solid action movie, then John Wick is the movie for you.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The irony and spareness of the storyline are some its best features. It successfully and succinctly establishes John Wick's character and why we should care without drawing out a melodramatic backstory. The film is quick and to the point much like its protagonist, yet creates a detailed and engrossing underworld of which I found myself wishing to see more. Every character is a bit of a cliché, but that's kind of the point. Stahelski is never self- conscious in the decisions he makes with the film which makes for a robust, yet focused action film. As far as the acting, Keanu Reeves brings the believable and understated rage of a hit-man being forced out of retirement. While no one was going to win an Oscar for their performance, the cast was perfectly suited for the movie. Each actor embodied their role and appeared to truly inhabit the film's surreal and fantastical settings. Whoever cast the movie did a killer job (pun intended).The action sequences are artful to the point of humor, which I think is great. The crisp and imaginative movements of John Wick could belong to a ballet of violence rather than an action film. It's like a less believable yet more impressive Jason Bourne, but I honestly think I'd rather watch John Wick any day.At one point in the film, I had a complaint. I cannot detail too much without spoilers, but let it suffice to say that the pacing was off for a few scenes about three quarters of the way through but quickly pulled itself together before the end. Lastly, I am tempted to respond to negative reviews but I am pretty sure John Wick would look at the couch critics disinterestedly for a few tense moments then turn his back and walk away knowing he was better than them. I do have to say though, for those persons wanting so-called ""realism"" then you should probably stick to documentaries, and even then...","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everything is... ordered, like something in a Japanese film. There is a code for everything, a way to do things that has to be followed. That is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything, people don't take them. I am pretty sure somewhere there is a Japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swords.The choreography is decent, with Keanu doing a combination of Matrix and Equilibrium moves that (finally!) are not all in slow motion. The basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends. If you don't appreciate the style, then the film will be wasted on you.That being said, I have to say that I think the film was not that good. It was not bad, but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable. As such, one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie. One of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had. Forget that Bridget Moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy Adrianne Palicki was completely underexposed, but actors the like of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film. Instead, they were relegated to minimal supporting roles.Unexpectedly for the film, but totally expected of the actor, the best action scenes where those involving Daniel Bernhardt, who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth. He was so good that it just showed he could have kicked Keanu's behind any time he wanted to.Another opportunity was a detailing of Wick's glory days. Instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient Wick was when he was a contract killer. Really? He wasn't that way in the film! Keanu played his usual silent brooding self, but at least in one scene, the one where he shouts at Viggo to give him the son, he shows the potential that was lost in writing his character.Bottom line: a rather average action flick, feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie. Instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed, a strong contouring of the characters, at least of the main ones, would have been a lot more effective. Like many others, I am sure, I was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was, unfortunately, underutilized.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Wick is a former assassin whose wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan, in a thankless role) dies from an unspecified disease. The lonely and distraught Wick receives a final present from her one night: a beagle puppy named Daisy. Soon, Russian creeps led by the infantile Iosef (Alfie Allen) break into his home, steal his car, and beat Daisy to death. Now Wick has nothing left to live for but revenge, and he goes after the Russian mob - his old employers - with a ferocious tenacity.This viewer felt about as bad as he could for Mr. Wick, given that the characters - all of them, really - are thinly written. While it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a non-stop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains, there's not that much humanity. The guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre. Fortunately, he does take *some* lumps before this is over, and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for him.There is a ton of violence, and a ton of digital splatter, although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers. The pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety, until the story - such as it is - begins to take off. While all of this is mildly amusing, ""John Wick"" doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before in scores of action-revenge sagas.Keanu is once again a figure in minimalist ""acting""; in his one attempt to truly emote, he does his best, but he's still not that convincing. Ian McShane and John Leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles; Willem Dafoe gets a little more to do. Swedish star Michael Nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss. Allen is such a weasel that he can't die soon enough. Adrianne Palicki, like Nyqvist, is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman. Other familiar faces include Lance Reddick, Dean Winters, Daniel Bernhardt, Randall Duk Kim, Clarke Peters, Kevin Nash, and the always welcome (if much too briefly seen) David Patrick Kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples' messes.""John Wick"" is an agreeable enough, but also forgettable, way to kill 102 minutes.Six out of 10.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

At the start of this movie we don't know who this man John Wick exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car, but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a dog so that he could move on with his life. And not any old dog or some mangy thing from the vet, but the cutest goddamn puppy that you could ever lay your eyes on. Needless to say things look good... until Wick happens to stop at a gas station, a Russian s***-head talks some crap (good ol' 'Reek' from Game of Thrones Alfie Allen, who is another good s***-head here), then that night the mobsters come to his house, trash it, beat him up and, worst of all, kill the dog.The writers go for a premise that's fairly easy and borderline lazy; of course we want to see Wick get the payback on these guys - even as they were once his former employers and ironically, in order to really retire, he had to pull a number that set up the Russian mobster's empire in cozy terms - because they killed the pretty-witty-wicky dog! As the Dude would say in Big Lebowski, this aggression will not stand! What ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage, peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people - Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Dean Winters, Adrienne Palikci, Lance Reddick (remember him from The Wire and Oz?) - and that's about it. In that way it's admirable as a kind of meat-n-potatoes flick for the guys (and maybe some girls out there too): watch Keanu Reeves kill a LOT of people. But there are two things that I didn't expect out of what is basically a gigantic action kill-fest that is a time-waster: 1) the fight and stunt choreography, and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together, works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time. You can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether it's Keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor, or just him and Palicki getting dirty (not *that* dirty, the fighting kind) in a hotel room, or three cars in a high speed chase. It's not chaotic but it is intense work and I got more drawn in to it than I expected.The 2) is that there's a whole lot of good background to this world that Wick is in. What I mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book (for adults) in a good way: it's like there's this whole set up functionality for someone like Wick to work in, to the point of almost (or simply being) satirical. I had a big laugh at one moment when a cop (just one) comes to Wick's place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night, they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him, and he just gives him a 'have a good night' and walks away. Then the cleaning crew comes (what do they do when they're *not* cleaning up, or maybe there's always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this New York), and then there's the hotel that Wick stays at while he looks for Josef, and it's run like a hotel *for* the criminal element, as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that, maybe, they keep it down a little.This is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic, but this added to my pleasure watching the movie. I wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that McShane's character seems to run - like some old film-noir he sits in a jazz club (lit very prettily, this is a colorful movie for big chunks) - and that Reddick is the concierge I suppose. The problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience it's still a shallow action movie. In a way it may work for this kind of material that it's simply ""you stole my car, you killed my dog, and my wife...""; for an audience coming to this, maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters. But I wish the filmmakers, who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals (Dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hit-man by the way), had gone a little further.As it stands I liked it, though by a certain point - like say in the last twenty minutes - it starts to get into overkill territory. I was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms. But if you're looking for something challenging as far as engaging/challenging and audience's sympathies, you won't get it. This is all about Reeves punching, kicking, slamming, knifing, blasting, crashing, shooting, choking, and doing everything under the sun, and while he's not Neo here he might as well be.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I mention this because part way through this movie I couldn't help but realize how eerily similar it is to The Equalizer.The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, was about a retired, highly skilled agent that was living alone because he had lost his wife. He was drawn out of retirement by the Russian Mafia because of their iniquities.John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves, is about a retired, highly skilled assassin that lives alone because he lost his wife. He has also been drawn out of retirement by Russians because of their iniquities. That's where the similarities end. Even though John Wick is a good movie I give the nod to The Equalizer over it for a few reasons: 1.) Denzel over Keanu. Reeves still has all of the range of a cardboard cutout.2.) The story. Every vengeance/vigilante film requires an impetus for the revenge/vigilantism. Sometimes we, the viewer, don't really care what that reason is, we just want to see some professional butt whipping. Even if that is the case, that's not to say that some causes are not better than others. The cause in John Wick was good just how it came about was very elementary.3.) The head scratching moments. John Wick has three moments that leave you scratching your head with a puzzled look on your face. They are fairly obvious as they are right out of the movie cliché manual. It doesn't cripple the movie but it makes you wonder: in this day and age with a hundred years of movies to refer to, why drum up the same old good guy and bad guy clichés?Those are my only beefs. They aren't enough to ruin the movie well, they might ruin it for some. Once the action kicks into gear it's a real treat. John Wick is masterful with a gun. It's like he took martial arts classes with guns. Instead of giving you a well-placed punch or kick, he uses bullets. And there was something they did well in this movie which I'd never seen in a movie before this one. John Wick had to often, and quite obviously, change magazines in his weapons. John Wick made it very apparent that his guns do not have magazines with unlimited rounds, and that you very well may have to replace a magazine at a very inconvenient time. That was refreshing.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Most of its action pieces rely heavily on close combat and gun. It is stylishly and sleekly done with a tormented Keanu Reeves at the centre of things. The choreographed action sequences are very much close and personal with the brutality of every shot fired and every blow landed resonant in the shots. The directors who were formerly stunt directors have infused variety in the settings in which the action takes place and keep the action flowing. And one thing that really got me interested was how the movie weaves a community of thugs, smugglers, assassins and mob bosses. It seems as if it is altogether a different world with its own set of laws, ethics, codes and loyalties. Since the story is an internal one happening in the underbelly of New York city, this is the only world you get to see and it is intriguing and fascinating, so much like our world and so much unlike ours driven by our desire to survive and thrive. John Wick is the kind of action movie that is rare to find nowadays. If you like some old fashioned vendetta movie and love to see Keanu Reeves kicking some asses, this is the movie for you!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Yet those who did decide to give it a chance, seem to love it very much. It's 'Certified Fresh' on Rottentomatoes and has a 7.5 rating on IMDb as of right now. Impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the next....after the next....after the next.An ex hit-man comes out of retirement after he's attacked by three thugs in his home. This attack leaves him beaten, without a car and a dead dog, which was given to him by his recently deceased wife. Big mistake. Once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts, the owner seems to instantly recognize it. The man asks, who's car this is. Who cares? The young spoiled brat replies. I can tell you one thing, we beat his ass to get it, and his stupid dog too. Bam, punched in the face. The kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father, who then calls up that mechanic. Did you punch my son in the face? Yes sir, I did. Why, he asked. Well sir, because he stole John Wick's car...and killed his dog. Oh crap.This sets up the film, the classic revenge tale. Nothing really new here. We've seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one. This time it happens to be a canine. The dog is adorably cute and my wife was in tears...TEARS I TELL YOU, when they killed the poor pup. About one scene before it happened, she says to me, ""Are they going to kill the dog?"" Terrified of the answer that I would not give her. Well, yes, they did. She instantly wanted John Wick to kill EVERYONE. So I guess when a dog gets it, you instantly want those responsible dead. Funny, I feel the same way. When people die on film, no big deal, but when an animal dies, all hell breaks lose. After that is out of the way, John Wick suits up to take out those who have wronged him. It just happens to be the son of his former boss. So when the boss finds out, he knows he's in trouble. So now he has to get to Wick before Wick gets to them. Thus, the body count piles up. It piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion, as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years. Wick uses his guns with precision. Shot to the chest, then to the head. It's robotic. One man against a dozen? Fair fight.To say the action in John Wick is stylized in an understatement. This is one of the best action films in years. Chad Stahelski, a stunt coordinator, makes his directing debut here. So he knows his way around a fight, being responsible for such films as the Expendables, The Wolverine, Tron: Legacy, and many many more. I like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair. See what they can bring to the table. The man clearly knows his stuff, so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve. He nails it here. One impressive sequence has Wick going into a club, with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one. First silently, then when all hell breaks lose, with calm and ease. Bottom line: This is one FUN film.Reeves never impresses with his acting ability. It's kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. One scene here has him actually showing some emotion, which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the dog. The rest of the film is how bad ass can Reeves look while taking out dozens of people. The answer, really bad ass. Familiar faces show up, such as Willem Dafoe, as another assassin. Adrianne Palicki as a beautiful....well...assassin. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series, plays the Russian Mobster, whose son, Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy, gets him into this mess. As if we needed another reason to hate Theon. Finally Ian McShane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few. The world created in John Wick is interesting to me. These assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access. There are hidden clubs, hotel rooms, etc. How can all these assassins and hit-men be in a club and not want to shoot each other. Well, there seem to be certain rules. Don't break them, or there might be consequences. Those club scenes are really fun. Jonathan Sela, the DOP, bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes. Giving it a heightened look and feel. Everything about the film feels smooth as ice, just like John Wick. The directing style reflects the lead character. Aggressive when it needs to be, but calm and collected most of the time. When I say aggressive, boy do I mean aggressive. Wick acts like a man with nothing to lose, no fear. He will walk right into the lions den to get the job done. John Wick is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me. While some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film I call it high class action fun. FUN is the key word here. Watching John Wick dispose of those bodies was fun. Seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun. Seeing Keanu Reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best? You called it...fun.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

Amongst the abundance of them comes John Wick with its on location feel and slick action sequences. Wonderfully directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch's with great action scenes and Derek Kolstad's solid dialogue Wick goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. Its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director Guy Ritchie or Paul McGuigan. Stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence, blood baths through a hotel, church, cars and blood spattered clubs. Unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool, complemented by the lighting, sound design, music tracks and score from Tyler Bates.The cast are unprecedentedly on form with Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki and memorable Willem Dafoe. Bridget Moynahan and Ian McShane cameo with John Leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show. Keane Reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence. Even with its dark tone it's more fun than the comparable excellent Equalizer. Yes, like all actions there's an obligatory Jason Statham/Van Damme-like showdown/fight off and John Wick is unavoidably reminiscent of Get Carter and Payback but as a revenge action it is as completely rounded as they come - recommended.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Theon the d**k less a**hole from Game of thrones was being his usual d**k self in this movie and decides to kill John wick's dog and steal his sweet ass mustang. Little did he know that John wick wasn't just some normal guy. And we get our revenge action movie. You don't kill someone's dog and steal their ride, you just don't. While many people might find the plot stupid or something, let me tell you, there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale. The movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly. But underneath all that revenge, there is some really cool world building going on. There are these rules, managements, neutral zones etc, which push John Wick from being just a simple brainless revenge movie. I hope they make sequels to it as there is A LOT of potential for this become an awesome franchise. Coming back to Keanu Reeves, HOLY S***, he was awesome in this movie. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again. The dude kills it as John Wick. He is cool, he is sleek and he is a total Bada**. Hell, he might give Liam Neeson and Matt Damon a run for their money. :p You appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90% of the stunts in this movie. Because of that, the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in Hollywood movies and made the action SO MUCH BETTER. Couple that with good cinematography, slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack, and you get yourself an awesome RARE action movie. Another thing this movie did well was that even though John Wick is shown to be one of the best or THE BEST in his work, he is not invincible or immortal, at the end, he is a human. Many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way TOO good that it takes you out of the experience. I really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team. Highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a Keanu Reeves fan. 8.5/10","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

The premise is good and the film well-constructed but the pacing is poor. It takes far too long for the action to kick in. The first hour is all setup, with characters repeatedly telling each other (and the audience) that John Wick is really tough. However, it takes forever for us to actually see this, with only one good action sequence in the first hour. When the action finally kicks in, its pretty glorious, but it overstays its welcome in the final act. With one dramatic fight scene after another, towards the end John Wick feels too much like a video game, with the protagonist simply proceeding through enemies like levels.Keanu Reeves reminds us in the overlong opening act why producers and directors don't hire him for his acting talents. Fortunately, once the first hour has dragged on, he reminds us why we do hire him - he's a complete badass who at 50 plus years old is absolutely still in his prime. Dean Winters and Alfie Allen are excellent casting additions, though not exactly for acting talent, but for the presence they bring to the film.Overall, John Wick is a nice time-killer and most promisingly, constructs a world I would love to revisit (in a better paced sequel).","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions.

But you don't even notice the paper thin plot because of the strong characters and well directed action scenes. There were not a single dull moment in this hour and half long film. It was very good that writer/director didn't waste much time on the John Wick character's back story. We got to see the glimpse of his life and that was all the viewer needed. The mystery behind John Wick only grows when we see the first reactions of some other characters, when they learn that he has been attacked. It wasn't only John Wick's character that actually evolved without much development. Every talking scene we learned to know the players more and more, but just enough to keep them mysterious and keep us still interested. It's something that is missing in most of the newer action films. Real powerful acting work. It was real pleasure to see Keanu back at his top form. And kudos to the screenwriter who managed to write Russian dialog that actually sounded little bit like Russian, not just some pointless gibberish. And of course the actors, who managed to speak it understandably.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I then immediately destroyed the DVD as a public service.The makers of this material should be arrested and imprisoned for corrupting society. And anyone who actually enjoys watching this ordure should immediately seek mental health advice. What plot there is can only be described as infantile and absurd. The film is simply a vehicle for promoting video games where the player searches out black hooded figures to exterminate them.We are expected to believe that a trained hit-man is woken at night by his puppy only to be hijacked by three (naturally) Russian mafia gangsters who beat him up, steal his treasured car and kill his dog.This same man then kills literally hundreds of security guards and other hit men who come at him one by one in a morbid procession of death. Night club revelers carry on regardless as security men are gunned down in their midst. Other security guards have their throats cut whilst seemingly standing there helplessly waiting for death.The concept that all these security men all have partners, mothers and families does not deter the hero. We are encouraged to think that any scale of revenge is permissible under all circumstances and to all proportions even though most of these murdered guards didn't actually do anything against him.The only merit of this film is that it represents perfectly the mentality of American culture; namely that if a cell of terrorists kill a few thousand Americans we are entitled to launch decades or war thereafter, bring tens of millions of innocent Muslim civilians into endless suffering and destroy the entire culture of the Middle East. Disproportionate revenge is the spirit of our age and John Wick is it's prophet.","86 out of 175 found this helpful.

Thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate, but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre. 'John Wick' is a tale of revenge, a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed. The plot works because it doesn't try anything new, in fact it takes you back several decades to Lee Marvin in 'Point Blank'. Keanu Reeves's character of 'John Wick' is a throwback to Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and every other bad ass who doesn't bother to say much but shoots instead. This in itself is refreshing, just a simple action thriller with no over-complicated storyline and ingenious twist. This movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time; 'The Equalizer', mainly because Keanu Reeves is a much different actor to Denzel Washington. John Wick is for the lovers of hard action and no frills!","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

Sure the plot isn't anything grand, but that isn't the core of this movie. A movie such as this needs a spark and how to go about it from there on. It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment like ""The Raid"" or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed with action like ""The Raid 2"" but it'st still a pretty cool movie. And seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus. Like I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but the stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like action movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldn't. You could really tell the directors got their ideas from past action movies, anime and video games. ""Max Payne 3"" really came to mind while watching this.7.5/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

While both films serve well the purpose to kill time when you have got nothing special in mind, needless to say both movies are easily forgettable. Neither of the movies offer griping story, stunning performance or brutal action. In my opinion ""John Wick"" is slightly more entertaining. For one, Keanu's character is somewhat more developed and believable as a hit-man returned from retirement. Two, there is also a parallel storytelling of underworld structure and code. And three, John Wick has got style. However, if you are in a mood to see bloody violence, go watch The raid 2.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

You may think that you're watching a dark drama driven by revenge.Fortunately (more than unfortunately I guess) this is not the case. It is a pop movie made to please the audience in a tongue-in-chick manner. You enter the world of mobsters and payed assassins where everyone is known, everyone goes to the same place for entertainment, follows rules and is slick and understanding! Like ...Cheers, where everybody knows your name! So this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It's just for fun. And after numerous killings, lame martial arts moves and macho one liners... you get exactly that.All the clichés you know well from thousands other movies are here too. The villain (so to speak because everyone is a villain) instead of killing his captured victim right away and solve all of his problems in an instant, starts blubbering philosophical BS and chooses an unconventional way to kill him (instead of let's say a bullet in the head).So is that kind of the movie.Is it entertaining? Well yes. I think so. I wasn't bored for the most part. I learn quickly to ignore the plot holes and just tried to enjoy it.Overall: It's a popcorn movie, so go get your popcorn! P.S.

JOHN Wick."" The boldest and ballsiest shoot them up film discharged in years. With a straightforward reason, an implicit mythology thus numerous severe head-shot kills that you need to ponder whether John Wick's whole preparing has been spent mastering Call Of Duty, this film conveys more than only 101 minutes of extraordinary activity, it gives the makings of a welcome, crisp establishment. Numerous will view it as something of an arrival to shape for Keanu Reeves and it is reasonable to consider it such, however simply because - critically - he isn't obliged to really act that far out of his customary range of familiarity. As a previous hit-man lamenting his wife's passing, Wick is a man who is sincerely cut off. And after that, when Russian hooligans break into his home to take his sweet ride, thrashing him in the process and slaughtering the puppy that his wife purchased for him from past the grave, Wick returns back to his old methods for being a stone-cool executioner. In any case, we win on the grounds that Reeves is obliged to do small emoting other than the odd cry at an opportune time. Indeed, it's telling that the couple of minutes where eyebrows get raised are the point at which the film is by all accounts considering itself excessively important, and these generally happen when Wick gets truly irate and Reeves winds up wrath snarling like Bale's Batman attempting to make himself really inhale fire. More to the point however, executives Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (the last setting off uncredited because of a DGA question) know how to arrange marvelous activity set-pieces, which joyfully make up around 80% of the film. With over 20 years of motion picture trick work under each of their profession belts, Stahelski and Leitch plainly know how to make the best of their projectile ridden beats, conveying smooth, quick paced scenes of all around made executioner confusion. The majority of this makes for a consummately serviceable requital thriller, a Death Wish return to a type that feels decades old in any case, just to go that additional mile, John Wick is raised to date with a key component required for any film to be effective in this day and age: it feels like a comic-book adjustment. As the film advances, it is set up that, not just does John Wick have a close super-powered level of capability in terms of executing individuals, however there is a whole system of hit men and hitwomen, who keep a set up code of honor, arrangement in a unique money and even have their own place of refuge – an inn oversaw by the unshakable Lance Reddick who caters for his visitors' requirements with balance and self-control. It's not until you achieve past the film's midpoint that you understand this is yet another motion picture that has made its own universe to investigate, an increased reality with heaps of potential for future spin-offs. All of which may make you feign exacerbation. All things considered, who needs another establishment with another 'verse to be wrung dry? It's difficult to gripe however when John Wick is such a smaller, punchy film without an ounce of fat on it. In this first motion picture of a mooted set of three, there's no space for over saturation of the idea, or for cushioning out with hybrid references and referrals. It's only a short, sharp, projectile driven bulldozer of a motion picture that snaps necks and smothers brains. What's more, if that isn't sufficient for you, go re-watch The Lake House or something","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has a simple plot that moves quickly to set up the action scenes. The writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters. It could have been just another mindless action flick, but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once. John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired legend in the assassin world, mourns for his dead wife. Her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace. It doesn't take long for Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) to mess up John's path to these things. In response, Wick delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for Iosef's actions. The story weaves Wick's past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including: the female assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), friend (Willem Dafoe), and former employer Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He faces the difficult task of breaking Viggo's organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him, Viggo's son.Put this on, sit back, and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of: action, a simple but tight story, and an enjoyable time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Keanu Reeves is the perfect cating choice for this movie he can kick so much ass and i have to say that i can't think of anyone to play this role he just does so much and puts in effort and care for thre character and i love how he can go from someone who seems soft especially all the stuff with the characters wife and then become the scary hitman who could kill you in 5 seconds and that is quite some acting and i could honestly talk about great Keanu Reeves is in this role for so long that he goes for me from being a actor who i thought was good to being one that i want to see more movies with him in them.
also in the cast is Michael Nyqvist,Alfie Allen,Willem Dafoe,Adrianne Palicki,Dean Winters,Daniel Bernhardt,Toby Leonard Moore,Bridget Moynahan and Lance Reddick while the supporting cast was good they really are over shadowed to Keanu Reeves and they are good i just don't think they were the most dynamic cast and had a rushed time on screen but really they could have been used a little more.
John wick for me was good there was some pacing issues for me in some of the parts where i thought they were trying to pan the run time but that's really what i thought and i really liked this the final act was one of my favorite final acts in a action movie from recent years and the action scences involving the gunplay was great and the hand to hand combat was also very well done they have done it in such a way where i can really belive that the action was real and overall the movie delivered on the action violence and the drama all in one and i thought that overall John Wick was very enjoyable and defiently a action must watch.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was very excited for his reign but this ""boogeyman killer"", ""Shadow-man"" looked a little rusty. Maybe because of his retirement?
I did root for John Wick all the way through but when the bad guys clearly have more than one chance to easily kill him and they DON'T but instead decide to throw him around it makes me feel a little awkward.
Some shallow choreography in the shoot outs. It seems John Wick is the only one that can shoot straight, EXCEPT, that is, when he has his first clear shot at his main target. Haha!
Also seems he's the only hitman who can see his opponents first- more especially when he's walking from room to room & wall to wall shooting them like targets.
Also the arbitrary ""rules"" of a ""code"" between all the community of hitmen/women was up in the air and disconnected from any of the stories momentum.
In an action movie all these details make a huge difference on the pay off.
All this production needs is a good script and better choreography.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Reeves also turns in a surprisingly good performance. If nothing else, this movie deserves respect for its attention to detail. These filmmakers really know what they are doing, they craft and layer this thing with a passion that makes it highly pleasurable to view, right down to the subtitled conversations, being very in sync with whoever is speaking, to a degree that makes reading them faster. That's what this movie is, fast, quick, constant action, with a simple effective story and great performances, also with a passion and professionalism that makes it stand out from the rest.

BUT... I can only agree with the 1/10* review of 'shudmeilas13' from November 2014 titled 'This movie is a bad joke'. PLUS there's unfortunately many more plotholes than he mentions.
Every negative point he lists is very true, besides his first one with the russian accent, I didn't really care about that one. There was barely a scene where I did not shake my head and shrug, because the writing was just SO illogical.
I can take a movie where's a lot of shooting and action, I love that. But if the plot has so many holes that you wouldn't even need guns to shoot some, that is the worst sign. Hope the 2nd one is better, I like Keanu Reeves and the setting and I really want John Wick to be good and not a badly written mess.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Only for this is creative, thought provoking, mentality shaping, and indoctrinate viewers for the importance of our beloved pets, which should be considered our family. Besides the arguments who presented us with an excellent plot, very well written and structured, we also need to give props to the very competent director, who did a perfect job. Alongside, the photography and the ambience of this movie was meticulously constructed, into a dark, silent, yet real and serious atmosphere.When we talked about the cast we only had good things to say. There isn't, without a doubt, anyone in Hollywood more capable to portray John Wick character better than Keanu Reeves. He is John Wick. He was born for the role. The supporting veteran actors were also well known to the public and fulfil this piece of cinema with quality and realism, making the plot even more plausible and believable to the craving audience.Overall, this is not the typical action-revenge/ professional assassin movie, full of incredible stunts, drugs, secret mob societies, and revenge. This film is much more than this. This work of cinema has deepness and a lot of layers on it, with a lot of subjects treated.A movie with such quality that I will rewatch it over and over again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

With support work from a whole mess of ""I know that guys"" and a blow-away effects budget, it's a real riot to watch, not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds behind the fight scenes. Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some ways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of the show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars, ferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality, stereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on and on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream. Cinephiles, well just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission. It won't be too difficult.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't care about critics of his acting ability or style. His style is unique and that's what separates him from other actors. Over the years he has been put in a certain mold, the mold of the quiet weird guy. Neo or Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still, that type. Think of Tom Ludlow from Street Kings. That would be as close to John Wick as you can get as far as comparisons. But John Wick is much more bad-ass. He is a retired hit-man who has found love for the first time. The description on IMDb describes what happens so this stuff is not a spoiler. He loses his wife and you can tell that it was devastating. After her funeral he receives a pet carrier at his door and signs for it. It is a puppy. Cute as hell! It is a gift from his wife, a last gift in order for him to grieve with someone and not alone. You can tell he falls in love with the dog. Between that and the fact that it was a gift from his dead wife, it makes the dog that much more important. When a mob bosses son, (Alfie Allen), and his crew decide they want Wicks 69' Mustang, sweet car indeed, they break in and catch him off guard. He is retired. They beat him senseless and then kill the dog. Bad move. They should have killed Wick, but they don't know who is. But his father does. Viggo, the Russian mob boss and former employer of John Wick. He then has to explain to his disappointment of a son that he just killed the dog of the man that is not the boogeyman, but he is the guy you call to kill the boogeyman. From there things go from bad to worse for all involved. A lot of death. A lot of blood, gunfire, hand to hand fighting. Car chases, explosions and slimy hit-men and women out for a bounty. There is also a hotel that is specifically designed for the shady world that John Wick and other hit-men live in. Pretty cool. Keanu is at his best in this movie, not just physically, but emotionally. Yes, his character is quiet just like you would expect from Keanu. But once he gets going, he is one scary dude. Cold as ice. Great acting by all involved and great story. Just a wonderful movie all around. I don't care how many movies they make in this genre, as long as they all stand up to John Wick.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

If you want to see an awesome movie without a plot, solely based on constant fighting and violence that feels, go watch The Raid instead.

I give it a 10 out of 10 because for what it is....... It's damn near flawless. Very violent and brutal action scenes and Keanu is an absolute beast in this. I read one review saying this was a comedy and just to clarify that there is almost zero humor in the movie. Keanu is calm and just professional as can be almost the whole movie. Minus the accent he almost reminded me of Jean Reno in the professional.

I felt that Michael Nyqvist as the main antagonist was cool and at the same time menacing along with other secondary villains. Another best part of the movie was that this film was not dragged like other action films in recent times. I am definitely waiting for the sequel which is releasing in 2017 and would hope it would develop into a better franchise.

A few days later he goes for a ride in his vintage muscle car. At a gas station, three shady men approach him and offer to buy his car. Wick refuses but the three follow him home, brutally attack him, kill his dog and steal the car. Losing Daisy, the only living link to his wife, lights John Wick's wick. The former assassin takes matters into his own hands.Using his former skills, Wick learns that the three men are Russian mobsters, one of whom is the son of mob boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He is also Wick's former employer. When Tarasov learns what his spoilt son (Alfie Allen) has done, he attempts to extend Wick an olive branch. Wick, however, is already on the warpath and out for blood. Keanu Reeves' performance is badass, full of energy and even demonstrates some emotional range, a welcome change from his usual wooden performances. He continues his career-long habit and does most of his own stunt work. Michael Nyqvist, best known for the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films, is intimidating and over the top as the mob boss. Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen is despicable as the mob boss's son, and like his character in the TV series, you'll love to hate him. However, his Russian accent is almost laughable.One of the film's best aspects is its creation of a whole new criminal underworld. A 'clean up' service for body disposal is accessible to hit men and there's an establishment called the Continental Hotel, a safe haven where professionals are forbidden to carry out 'jobs' on the premises. The professionalism and efficiency of the mob network adds more layers to both the story and main character. Wick's wit and proficiency, are clearly a product of a sophisticated culture of rampant crime. This also gives the film potential for a sequel. John Wick is a simple revenge story, with fast-paced action and hand-to-hand gunfights some critics are calling, 'gun fu'. The film is consistent with the gritty reality of other action films such as Taken and The Bourne series. For all who enjoy a good action flick with lots of guns, explosions and high voltage fight scenes, this is the movie for you.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

An amazing movie, quick yet badass kills, and I'm not saying any to spoil the movie, but just general amazement throughout. I'm just sad that this film will probably get forgotten.

The movie is rather boring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very interesting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much ""over the top"". The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This movie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was also surprising.

John Wick hinges on the simple premise of a retired hit-man who plows through the Russian mafia and leaves a mile-long body trail, all because they killed his puppy. And stole his ride. Somebody has to pay! As silly this may sound, the film plays it all with a straight face, and it works because there is a good amount of heart to the setup. In the opening scenes, we see that this is more than the story of a man, his car, and his dog; it's the story of a loss and betrayal. Once the appropriate pathos is established, John Wick rises as the tough and skilled action hero we can root for. It doesn't take long for the butt-kicking to commence, but once it does, it's densely-packed, fast-paced, relentlessly-brutal, and very well-executed. Whether shooting, punching, stabbing, or running bad guys over, it is quite a rush to watch Wick descend into the criminal underworld and find payback.As exciting and stylish as the film is, what really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is the title character. The film successfully evokes sympathy for Wick - the man who lost his wife, before losing everything else - and it provides a solid reasoning for why we should care about whether or not Wick succeeds. As the film goes on, Wick's journey takes him through a bizarre criminal world with its own set of rules, codes, and even currency. It turns out that it's a world Wick is already familiar with, and he has a history with most of the minor characters that pop up. Thus, the film unearths stark themes of how the past, present, and future are entwined.This film is well-shot, with great-looking photography and editing. It is especially refreshing that the action scenes are solid and steady, with no fast-cutting or camera shake. I also think the color schemes and nighttime cityscapes lend the film a dark and grimy type of neo-noir appeal. Acting is fine for what it is; you may not think much of Keanu Reeves, but this film is proof that the man can act. His portrayal of John Wick is quite spot-on. And he can kick a lot of butt very impressively. Writing is not the best, but it gets the job done. This production has pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music choices, and the music score, feature really heavy beats and hard rock cues, and I found it awesome that way.John Wick, much like A Bittersweet Life, is a dark crime movie with lots of action, but also a lot of emotional backing behind its characters. It's a simple story that's told well and features plenty of satisfying setpieces. Recommended for at least one viewing.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

John Wick is one of those films and not only has that formula but it does give it a fresh take with a well-written script, polished performances and well staged action sequences.Directed by stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski (alongside David Leitch) in their first directed feature film, they both know how to handle an action flick in terms of direction, pace, realism and quality. They indeed use the best out of the well written script from Derek Kolstad, who ensures that not only is the action present and moving the story along but the character development and pace are taken seriously for the audience to follow and connect. Story goes that John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves, who is indeed back in top form not since Constantine) is a retired hit-man who is grief of his recently deceased wife and is coping with the gift of a dog from her to help John with the pain and loneliness. Whist out for a drive in his 69' Mustang, he comes across Losef (played by Alfie Allen from TV's Game of Thrones) and his mates who offer to buy his precious ride but John declines and sets off his way. But soon after, Losef and co invade his home and brutally beat him, kill his dog and steal his ride. Having survived, John sets out on vengeance on Losef, but when he discovers his background history to his past employer (Michael Nyqvist in bad guy form again), the war between two sides erupts into revenge that only one will live.The action sequences as mentioned are in top polished presentation, consisting of fast kinetic fist fights and shootouts. The use of practical stunt work is in favor rather than use CGI for the impossible and the results from its director are clear from experience. One of the best sequences of the film is the club house, where John attempts to kill Losef and his protectors by single handily taking them on one-by-one. The character of John in particular is ruthless and deadly throughout the film and Reeves pulls this off with ease, it looks like a mix of the latest James Bond (Daniel Craig), a dash of Jason Bourne from the Bourne films and Bryan Mills from Taken all rolled into the one character. But there is emotion with him, as you see in the first half hour of his fall from peace and again it lacks with most revenge driven films.The villain is the opposite but the cunningness, determination and will to stop John is indeed there, and the magic of Nyqvist brings this to the screen (he was the main villain in Mission Impossible 4, but he is much used better in this film). The supporting cast includes the talents of William Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Adrianne Palicki and Dean Winters to name a few and they all do give the film justice.John Wick is a surprising return to the 'Revenge' genre and it has indeed suppressed what The Expendables 3 should have been (not to say that it bad) but in terms of story, action, character and presentation it's indeed worth the ticket price to see it and I highly recommend it for action fans of Taken, Faster and Dead Man Down.","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

A really big problem. All of the characters that he plays, turn out to be Neo (The guy who saved us all from the machines in 'The Matrix'). They all even have the same face!!But seriously, the guy is perfect for a lot of the roles that he has won (The Matrix, Point Break, Speed), its just that its wearing a little thin now. One thing is for sure, other than a Razzie, Reeves wont ever be picking up an award. This film sees Reeves playing the titular part of 'John Wick'. We meet him just after he has lost his wife. Not in a shopping mall, or out on the beach silly....she has died very recently. There is something of a mystery around 'Wicks' history, who he is, what he does, where has he come from...but all those questions get answered throughout the film.The film asks little of Reeves. The action is blisteringly fast, and some of it is genuinely.....'Cool'. The gun fights and hand to hand combat are handled with a visual panache that I haven't seen in a few years. Chad Stahelski and his team certainly have a firm grasp of how a 'fight' should be conducted. The great thing about having an action film starring Keanu Reeves, is that with all the action taking place, there leaves little room for Reeves to talk. He really says only a hand full of words in this film. Dog lovers be ware, there is a scene on par with Mad Max 2. You have been warned, and you will end up hating Alfie Allen even more than you do watching Game Of Thrones. A classic, by no means, but this is the kind of film that you can disappear into, watch, and never think about again. I don't think I will ever watch it again, it was a perfect 'Throw away' film. A good waste of 2 hours on a Sunday night.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I wouldn't go into the plot of the movie. However, I will share my point of view as a critic: Positive: 1. The surprise element of the movie was John's old friend Marcus. The character gives a very good support to John and we get to know this only when he prevents John's death. 2. The music used during the Action scenes was very good approach. 3. The movie is very stylish overall. Negative: 1. Firstly, I was expecting some fist fight or any martial fight. There was two fights in the movie without the use of Gun. However, these fight were for very short duration. 2. Lots and lots of shooting. At one point of time, I got the statement that John Wick is a very good hit-man or as they call Boogeyman. So, killing every mobs throughout the movie was a bit boring.3. At the end, if John wick had taken the breed of the dog which was killed, then it would have been very good.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It does have its shortcomings however. John Wick fails to deliver new action thrills and sticks with the same old movie tropes that we have become accustomed to. Just as The Matrix set a tone for this ""almost masterpiece"" it suffers from ""I've seen that before, oh, but that's a great scene"" I recommend John Wick for people who like action and a simple plot.

I don't understand the negative reviews here. I think people were expecting character/plot development. This is not that. This is a revenge movie. This is THE revenge movie.A good revenge movie needs a few things: a believable cause for revenge, a hateable baddie, and great action sequences. Without giving spoilers (just watch it already though), I feel like this movie has strong checks all of these boxes. If you view this movie through this lens, there is no way you will be disappointed. The people who didn't like this must have been expecting a romantic comedy lol.Gun play in this movie is some of the most accurate and interesting you will find. Reloads happen often, misses happen on occasion, and fighting happens seamlessly. Keanu allegedly did something like 97% of the stunt work for this movie after spending months training in various martial arts and firearms. If you don't believe it, youtube Keanu at the range. I mention this because it is evident in the seamless cinematography that can be captured because the direct can have wide hand-to-hand and firefight shots.Watch this movie and give a review so we can get the score higher.

John Wick is a new action movie starring Keanu Reeves, directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Since a little while I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and I watched many of his interviews; he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman. I've heard and read many positive things about John Wick. It's one of the best action movie of the year and possibly Keanu Reeves' best performance since a long time. It doesn't arcane back to the 80's action movies ,actually it's an excellent 2014 action movie, no nostalgia required. Firstly, this film blew my mind and Keanu Reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see. He is the perfect actor for the lead role. Everything he does is cool: driving, fighting, shooting and even speaking. All those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie. He is bad ass but also as he's retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie. Plus, John Wick is a slick looking movie, with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well. The main villain of the movie starring Michael Nyqvist (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Millennium) is absolutely terrific, Russians seems to always be the bad guys. In fact all the acting on this film is really good. I think it's actually Keanu Reeves' best film since The Matrix. Mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor, it's fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes. He knows how to sell action; but I'm not only talking about physical work, he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair; he does a very great job with all of them. The screenplay is good, it's not only a revenge/ killing movie. There been a lot of action world creation, you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal. I completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path. I have a dog. If anyone hurts my dog for any reason I'll do John Wick on them. Plus, the Club scene is the best scene of the whole movie, it reminds me of a club scene in Collateral which is crazy good action. However, the only flaw I could see in this film is the end; as my mum would say: the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast. That's it. Finally, John Wick also sets up ideas of sequel (not being forced like in The Maze Runner). You are able to see the character's evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie. John Wick's the nicest guy ever just don't screw with him. Overall John Wick has incredible shoot out sequences, it's anon-stop action movie that actually has a clever script, a really awesome hero, a great villain (a few great villains actually). It does everything an action movie is supposed to do, it understands what its doing and does it extremely well. Go see this film!","8 out of 21 found this helpful.

Overall, a movie that is not so great in its own right with its lackluster direction, acting, and screenplay, but is an enjoyable watch because of its intense action scenes and character writing of John Wick (painting a character that will be fun to see what happens next to him).Pretty Bad Direction (The choreography of action sequences was very well done (Some of the best I have seen), but the moving of the story forward and the direction of actors was bad considering how dull the movie really was), Bad Acting (Pretty Good from Keanu Reeves (Able to handle the action sequences in a great way and is a strong prominent figure throughout the movie (With some good moments in dramatic acting), but has some really questionable scenes that may be in fault from the direction he was given), Acting on a Spectrum from the rest of the cast (Anywhere from very bad and emotionless (like Alfie Allen) to decent acting (like Willem Dafoe))), Good Story (Though it is filled with cliches of an ex-conman coming back into the fold, the storytelling and character writing of John Wick is very good to paint him as the ultimate figure to not be messed with), Pretty Bad to Decent Screenplay (The dialogue was very bland but there were some good moments), Score was just present (but did help in the action scenes when present), Good Cinematography, Good to Very Good Sound, Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Especially, when showing the firefights), Good Costumes (Even though it is just a suit, they really helped create an iconic character in John Wick), Plot Structure was decent for the most part (but does follow a typical action-movie one), Pacing was incredible fast to where the runtime was very short (But this helps in giving pace to the character of John Wick), Build to climax was prevalent and noticeable in its prep for the action; climax was well executed and a fun part of the movie, Tone of the movie was very dark and grungy (adds to that John Wick feel); but there is a lot of dryness from the deadpan that it kinda takes away from this, The action scenes of the movie were some of the best choreographed action scenes I have ever seen as it is just so physical and technical that it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The constant action, the music, the well chosen actors, along with Reeve's ever, ""less is more"" presence grabs you nicely and keeps you entertained.

I love films, from foreign, docs,festival to the Hollywood blockbusters of all genres. I hunt for certain directors, and I do love intellectual films or some might call them art flicks. But the genre that I do miss is the action trash ( grind house films ) In the glory days of VHS, many films were released only for the VHS market. Many of those are the simple, dirty action films, some are bad and some are so bad it's great. Well..John Wick reminds me of that. No BS, revenge films.If you are aware of the Charles Bronson's Death wish, John wick has a similar idea. Recently I am very happy with what Liam Neeson does ( Taken 1,2 and A walk among tombstone )John wick has similar feel . Don't expect Cannes films or look for holes, this is, like I said a B movie on a mainstream market.

It's certainly a matter of setting expectations, but I personally was not disappointed. If violent action movies are one of the genres that entertain you, good chances that you will not be disappointed either.Rule #1 to enjoy such a film is to accept the conventions of the genre. The story takes place in the parallel universe of the crime underworld. Although bodies start to accumulate in piles pretty soon, there is no policeman in view with the exception of one cop showing up at one point, looking at the scene of the carnage and wishing good evening to the hero who happens to be a professional killer. This parallel universe is not lawless, it's just that the laws or better said the rules are different. There is a code of honor, there are territories of neutrality, and there is only one punishment - death - for breaking rules or trespassing borders. At the roots of the story stands a failed tentative by the main hero to break the cycle of violence of his profession and jump in the universe of normal people. All this is just memories when the action starts. This film is for Keanu Reeves what 'Jack Reacher' is for Tom Cruise and I suspect that at some point even taking the name of the hero as a title is not a coincidence. It's the start of a series and the second installment was not too late to come.Assuming you bought into the story and the convention, there is some good stuff to enjoy. Stuntman Chad Stahelski is sitting for the first time on the film director chair and he delivers exactly what is expected - a coherent story telling and perfect choreography of the many action scenes that occupy more than half of the duration of the movie. Keanu Reeves delivers what is expected, and a few other fine actors show up in small and even smaller supporting roles. Cinematography is just beautiful, with combinations of dark colors that fit well the violent dark universe that they populate. If you can just forget how sketchy the whole story (or pretext) of the film is, you have good reasons to enjoy it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This, combined with well done visual effects and sound design, kept the audience on the edge of their seats. But despite this, the concept the plot is based of is quite shallow.

It's probably somewhere in the middle. It reminds me a lot of those mindless 80s action films that were led by Silvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.The plot is simple. No problem. This is an action film and there's plenty of it. Think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity. It all looks pretty too. This is supposed to be a fun movie. I get it. But it would've been nice to see more realistic gun fights that showed John Wick's using his entire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead of just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting accuracy. I'm not sure how this film got rated above a 7. The film looks pretty but the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting. If you want to watch an action film that's been recently released and are similar to this I suggest watching either Shooter or Olympus Has Fallen.

'John Wick' brings us everything we wished for from quick action, simple story, and an accessible premise--get the guys who killed my dog and stole my car. What's even more brilliant than the simple story is the style this debut director has developed almost by accident. We have excellent neo-noir cinematography, quick and witty dialogue, and grungy 90's video game rock play in our eardrums, sprinkled in with excessive gun violence and relentless kick-assery. If this first installment of a great idea doesn't fulfill your aggressive emotions, I don't know what will.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The premise is as simple as it is effective: John Wick loses everything, and goes on a revenge spree. The reason why it works so well, is that the characters and the setting are both very interesting, and the action scenes are very good.The movie is set in an almost comic book like world, where there's a community of hit men and people in the underworld, with their own set of morals and code. They all use certain businesses (or services), which ties them all together. It's this universe that makes me curious for sequels to John Wick. The characters in this universe are mostly quite fun, and a lot of that owes to great casting. The way they gradually reveal John Wick's past is interesting, and it leaves you wanting to know more about who he once was.But, despite all the good things about the movie, it never elevates above its genre.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love action movies and this movie has everything to be a great action. The story is very nice, the acting is great, the fighting and shooting scenes are great and everything else is very good. The story was easy to understand. Memorable characters and Keanu Reeves was just plain Awesome! There are a lot of new faces in this movie which would make me feel it's good, but the actors have all put their best in to this film and you can see it on screen. I have seen so many films that just don't capture the viewers eye, this movie keeps the viewer glued to the screen in till the end. Keanu was a great choice for this role, he plays a hit-man with ease, but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowd. He is perfect in this film. This is the type of movie people will see over and over again. Waited in a long line to see it but it was well worth it. Amazing special effects, great acting, great everything. Best movie I have seen all year. Keanu Reeves is back after a long break and he is better than ever. This is like a combination of Speed and the Matrix combined. John Wick is the real deal. It is amazing action picture, filled with strong performances by a cast, along with superb action set-pieces and a genuinely interesting world to boot. Reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is still a genuine movie star. Can't wait to see John Wick: Chapter 4 in 2021.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The cast, lead by the ever underrated Keanu Reeves, is exceptional, and really help to lift the material to another level.'John Wick' may not be art, but it doesn't aspire to be.

In the run up to the 4th movie I have decided to re watch the first 3 movies again, I have seen them a handful of times and I do really enjoy them !!! So I may aswell fire up a review !!John wick 1 was something very fresh in an age of action movies, what I believe drove it's success and appeal to an audience that seemed to grow and grow was the hand to hand combat, John using many different fighting techniques, weapons and all of it felt and looked so real, there were so many continuing shots and it's a testament to Keanu who performed the majority of his own stunts.The story is simple, his wife passes and leaves him a dog who ends up getting killed by a Russian thug who is the son of a high up Russian mobster. Believe me when I say it's not the story we show up for, it's nice to get it and in further movies we do, but it's the action.With so many comic movies and other action movies I can't think of many that even come close to these fight scenes, Netflix Daredevil would be the closest.I enjoyed most of this movie, not to gone on the last 20 minutes to be honest but overall it's a fantastic movie. 8.5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Yeah, I'm Thinking Keanu Reeves Is Back!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3111705/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","26 October 2014","American cinema has been continually producing very bland and forgettable action movies (The Equalizer serves as a recent example— does anyone even remember that movie?). This year's earlier martial arts showcase, The Raid 2, easily beats out everything else from the genre's crop, and that is especially including the Marvel/superhero movies that are more about spectacular set pieces than innovative, fascinating action choreography. Well, maybe the American Kung-Fu fan/renowned action star is the best chance we have at an effective American action film at this point. ""People keep asking if I'm back; yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!"" Keanu Reeves returns to staple badassery as John Wick who has recently lost his wife to cancer. After the painful funeral, he unexpectedly receives a delivery package at his door—a final gift from his wife in order to help ease his grief: a cute, little dog. Of course, trouble never ceases to find Wick and after unintentionally pissing off a group of Russian mobsters at a gas station, they give him an unpleasant visit where he witnesses the murder of his dog and suffers a brutal beating. Oh, it's on! Little do those guys know who they're messing with—a bogeyman who has even spooked the mob boss into beating some sense into his culprit son and letting him know what exactly he has done. John Wick—with his deadly skills teased and his true background mysterious— readies his weapons, and pure ruthless revenge ensues from there on out. The movie accomplishes just what American action cinema fails at every time. The action sequences are filmed with the use of astonishing cinematography—plenty of wide shots to perfectly display everything that transpires on-screen without confusing the audience. The camera invariably gives us a good layout of the particular environment, which is followed by John Wick's clever utilization of those surroundings to break bones and rupture skulls. In fact, the film is so embellished with glitzy style that even its subtitles come all vibrantly colored with a catchy font and ingenious screen placement. The majority of the film is set at nighttime, and thus, we get that metropolitan vibe along with a dusky color palette—an alluring greenish/bluish hue. In addition, a groovy, cool soundtrack incessantly complements the impressive action sequences; the best segment taking place in a violet-lit, intensely-staged night club as guns blaze and dubstep drowns out the screams. And despite Keanu Reeve's transparently limited acting range, this tough-as-nails role certainly plays to his strengths with the intimidating monotone one-liner delivery and that never-ending, rigid look of sheer ire. Unlike The Raid 2 however, there's no compelling narrative to give the film's duration any necessity to continue. John Wick simply comprises one action scene after another. Unfortunately, the combat gets repetitive fairly quickly—repeating wrestling techniques (choke holds, etc.) and blowing brains out with the same up-close strategy—and it honestly feels like the plot struggles with where to proceed next. ""Oh, I need to kill this guy, and now I have to kill this other guy in another location."" The story essentially follows this formula and hopes that the viewers find that adequate enough for non-stop entertainment. An hour in though, it clearly begins to drag and doesn't show any sort of storytelling restraint in terms of when enough is enough, which is the same issue The Equalizer shared. If this high-octane extravaganza was only slimmed down by thirty minutes, it would've made for a far more satisfying and memorable experience, but I just can't say that John Wick even compares to the consistent mastery The Raid 2 boasted. This one has its fair share of cheesy, awkward moments (albeit with intention) but also just overall shallowness. With that being said, beholding the first hour alone makes it worth seeing over every American action movie this year (I still don't know if that says a lot about the staleness of the genre nowadays, or if I should just accept that John Wick surely possesses stunning quality?).","3 out of 18 found this helpful.

I was looking forward to this movie and for the most part I was watching it with a huge smile on my face.The action is brilliant. Reeves does some original stuff in his fight sequences and makes them look believable.But there were several scenes which took the movie down a few pegs in my opinion. Keanu's super tough character John Wick struggling to take down a girl who looks more like she should be selling perfume than she would be capable of fighting and killing? Sorry, this is not remotely believable.John Wick getting caught and needing to be saved time and again throughout the film? How amateurish. Watch the Bourne trilogy instead. Bourne never made the mistake of letting anyone know where he was, which is why he was always a step ahead of his pursuers. If he ever got picked up he'd planned it in advance so as to attain information. By contrast John Wick continually blundered into situations that would have seen his end in an even half way real world.But the fight scenes were original and awesome. Oh yeah, and regarding Keanu's acting being terrible, which is what I've read from others here on the discussion board and in reviews: he cries when he reads his wife's letter and he makes it look more believable than most actors I've seen dealing with similar emotional scenes. His acting was great.So, will you walk away from this film considering it a masterpiece? Not if you like a decent amount of believability and logic in your story lines.But is John Wick worth watching? Yes, if only for the fight scenes...I may even buy it on Blu Ray just for those moments.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

JW is a retired assassin and we all know that, in the movies, it doesn't take much to bring a man with ""a very particular set of skills"" back into the game. Kidnapping his daughter usually does it but, if you want to be sure, kill his dog. This really makes Wick (Keanu Reeves back on cracking form) mad. Of course, we knew who the bad guys were even before their mistake with the mutt because they speak Russian and the subtitles are presented in comic book style to add to the fun.There's minimal plot but maximum action in this film directed by Chad Stahelski (Keanu's stunt double in ""The Matrix"") and David Leitch (another veteran stunt coordinator). Wick is not out simply to disable his foes but instead never leaves death in doubt and he is no silent assassin but absolutely litters the screen in bodies in a riot of action and noise that somehow escapes the notice of the New York Police Department. According to those who count these things, the original ""Taken"" movie clocked up a body count of 35 but Wick racks up a much superior 76. I saw the movie on an IMAX screen so I was both shaken and stirred.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie takes sometime to build on but when it does , there is no turning back. Each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues. It gives an holistic view of gangland and rules they live in and high respect for each other. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Keanue Reeves is back in form and I loved him after long time especially post Matrix series. He does well in dialogues delivery and will be appreciated for his acting.Overall, a kick-ass action which will pump up your adrenalin. Good 3/5","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is about these kind of tales we can get behind, choose a side, and that's usually enough to justify the violence in most movies nowadays. John Wick is a revenge story, and on merits of it's action scenes a pretty amazing ride. However where it excels in quick paced action it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in story.John Wick is a well to do man in his 30's, seemingly wealthy, and in love. His wife is beautiful and she has a way of making him whole, but these things rarely last, and his world is about to come apart at the seems. He has a hidden past, something he isn't proud of, but it's what has given him this life of luxury and the ability to spend so much time with his wife. Shortly after the beginning of the film, in which we find our main character badly wounded, we enter a series of flashbacks where we learn his wife had become ill to some unknown disease, and he has very little time to process this loss. As events unfold, John returns to his old ways, on a killing spree against new foes and some old ones as well.The story that unfolds isn't great by any means, but there are some real amazing action sequences of such military precision that they are a pleasure to watch. Keanu Reeves underwent 4 months of firearms training and it really shows through his work. Some of the best action sequences are the close quarters hand to hand combat, where John Wick used a lot of Japanese Jujitsu, but incorporates his firearm in so many of the moves (slightly reminiscent of the film Equilibrium 2002). Although some might be turned off by the level of violence and high body count, this is really why you watch a movie like this.Unfortunately the plot itself is so outrageously thin and badly written that it kind of ruins the whole thing for me. When I think of the classic revenge story, a few titles come to mind right away. Oldboy (2013) or Django Unchained (2012) for example. The main characters of these films are men obsessed with revenge, and you can easily understand why the characters would go to such lengths to get back at the people who have done wrong by them. This is what John Wick is missing, I couldn't understand why a man would throw his life away for the memory of someone who is already dead. He goes up against an army of Mafioso's and leaves bodies all over the city, and anyone who gets in his way is a dead man... but why? I couldn't grasp that concept in this film, and it left me so unsatisfied and crying in disbelief.So, it does have some of the best fire fights I've seen in a film, and excellent hand to hand choreography (Michael Nyqvist nearly lost an ear!), but the whole premise of the movie kind of fell flat in my eyes. But I hear this is the first in a trilogy so they have lots of room to improve story line in the future.6/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Is it possible not to root for a masochistic protagonist who feels the need to slaughter the people who did them wrong? Whether it involves Uma Thurman slashing Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and an odd assortment of Japanese bodyguards or Lee Marvin thirsty for retribution after being left for dead, there is something lip-smackingly satisfying about seeing a badass make fair and square with all the wrong people.""John Wick"" is as much a comeback vehicle for Keanu Reeves as it is a sumptuously shot throwback to the days of Charles Bronson and Sylvester Stallone. The film doesn't necessarily update what we've come to know about the revenge movie over the years — it, instead, provides for a refreshing take on a subgenre that, in a world accustomed to Liam Neeson threatening kidnap happy terrorists, has gotten a bit dusty. Here is a movie that knows it's predictable, but is smart enough to understand that going through the motions just won't do this time around. Like the ""Kill Bills"" before it, everything is so stylistically visceral that we hardly have time to roll our eyes and remember that the hero always finds the fulfillment they're looking for. We have to sit back and enjoy the blood soaked ride. Reeves, after years away from the action scene, portrays Wick as a man wounded by his past. He was a hit-man years ago, but left the scene in pursuit of a blissful marriage. As the film opens, however, his wife has, as it seems, died of a serious illness (which is never explained). Damaged assassins are never a good thing, and after his grieving process is interrupted by a gaggle of Russian thugs who steal his car and kill his dog, something in Wick snaps. He goes from loving husband to murder machine in a matter of seconds, and so the film goes on autopilot, but not in the ways you might expect.The plot feels very been there, done that, and Reeves, who I've always labeled as the most wooden leading man in Hollywood, goes through the motions without a single ounce of emotion to back him up. (Even in a scene where he breaks down, we are hardly convinced he looks anything other than a circa 2009 Kristen Stewart's father.) Somehow, though, ""John Wick"" doesn't seem to be about plot, or Reeves, for that matter: rather, we are intent on how the plot is executed, how the action set pieces set themselves apart from the other thrill heavy movies of the decade or, cough cough, ""The Matrix"". And, for the most part, we are presented with an entertaining revenge movie, one who takes its gun fu very seriously and one who just finds violence artistic as long as it's done right. Chad Stahelski, making his directorial debut here, is confident in his every move, making ""John Wick""'s sleek thrills pack more punches than your average pulpy exercise in madness.This is a well-made movie, no doubt, but I'm not so sure it presents us with anything new. It's all been done before (though here it's quite a bit more stylish, obsessing itself with a Michael Mann reminiscent tinting process) and it's been done better. But maybe I'm just cynical because ""Kill Bill"" is close to being the best thing ever, and no revenge film can ever come close to its greatness. It's hard to get over your first love, after all.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

A companion in a form of a puppy who he was informed to cherish as he grieves alone. Coincidentally crossing paths with three sadistic men who threaten to tear down his world. John reverts back to the previous life that he dutifully tried to leave behind in order to begin anew. Carefully unveiled to be the most ruthless assassin to have ever lived known as Baba Yaga, The Boogeyman. John seeks to settle the score with the memory of his loved one as fuel to the fire.Despite the familiar premise, John Wick is more than just an average vengeance tale. The focus is centered on a broken individual who desperately wants to hold onto what is most valuable to him. Dos vidanya, to anyone who tries to take what does not rightfully belong to them. Keanu Reeves gives a tour-de-force performance as the titular character. Encapsulating all of the emotional drive and vulnerability of a man who simply has nothing to lose. Quite unfortunate that Reeves' career was on a nose-drive before his initiation into the franchise. This film not only revitalized his career but showcases his talent as Reeves' had performed 95% of his own stunts for the outstanding action sequences in the film. Making the character his own that is now adored by fans of the action genre. John Wick is a powerhouse introduction for what has been deemed as one of the greatest action-oriented franchises of all time. The lore is simply fascinating as there is another world going on that is invisible to the naked eye with all members using a unique transaction system, bearing tattoos and assassinating for hire.

"6","/10","Ruthlessly efficient action that still left me wanting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3284351/?ref_=tt_urv","brchthethird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9426311/?ref_=tt_urv","25 July 2015","Word-of-mouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not, but it can also lead to erroneous expectations. I went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp, and to a degree that's true. I just thought it would also be a little more fun. JOHN WICK is by no means a bad film, but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal, well-choreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story. The setup is that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who gets dragged back into the life after a Russian gangster's upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his dog. That's it. I wasn't expecting anything deep, mind you, but I would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue. It was straight-forward almost to the point of being boring at times, and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like MAD MAX FURY ROAD, or the manic humor of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE. To the film's credit, the action goes against the current trend of flashy camera-work and tricky editing, so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography. And even though a lot of it takes place at night, geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other. These elements were also well-supported by some good special effects, bullet hits, etc. In terms of the world of the film, there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld, one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency. The film was also well-acted for the most part, despite the characters being so shallow apart from Keanu Reeves' John Wick. To me, the film largely wasted talented actors like Ian McShane, Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do. When it comes down to it, all the film really has is Keanu Reeves' charisma and some admittedly good action, and that wasn't really enough for me. Bringing this back full-circle, expectations can make or break a film and I think I went into this expecting a little too much. For the die-hard action fan who doesn't really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets, JOHN WICK will do just fine. For those who expect a little more from a film, there's plenty of others to choose from.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

John Wick the latest one I saw, is overall quite similar to another recent action flick The Equalizer. One retired specialist is brought back in action to destroy an entire mafia gang. It may entertain hardcore action lovers, but for me its utter boredom. At least, The Equalizer was backed up with some story, which is almost absent here. John Wick is an ex-hit-man who had retired to leave peacefully with his wife. Unfortunately she dies o cancer and all John Wick is left with is his super-cool Mustang and the dog his wife leaves as a gift. But John is pulled back into the action when his car is stolen and dog killed by the mafia head's son. Driven by grief and revenge he decides to take down the people involved using his super-hit-man skills. That's basically the entire story and what fills the 100 minutes is routine monotonic action sequence. They are not bad being nicely shot and well-choreographed actually. The problem is the lack of intent and the totally predictable nature of the script which made it less engaging. There aren't any twist in the story too which is surprising. Just plain straight forward action. If that's all you I believe you will end up having a good time.Just like in The Equalizer, John Wick easily kills dozens of men failing to do so only twice and both the times escapes in what I would say the lamest part of he script. I found it hardly realistic. There is absolutely no tension built up as you know that John Wick can easily kick everyone's asses. Character build up is weak, dialogues just forward the action sequences and acting nothing special. Keenu Reeves gives an honest attempt though, still I couldn't connect with John Wick that much to completely root for him. To end, this was just another forgettable action film for me.RATING: [2/5]","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

One of the most praised action movies of all time...One of the defining traits of John Wick is his commitment to efficiency; he moves with tactical precision to waste no movement and often kills his target without giving them room for any ceremonious last words before their demise. Keanu Reeves deserves immense credit for his dedication to tactical training and personal fitness to ensure that he does the vast majority of his own stunts, which is evident in the final product. Few actors are able to do what he does on screen, and even fewer are able to make cohesive action stories that effectively display the mastery of that craft. That dedication to making every second count is palpable in the pacing of the films.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot was a bit weird but I enjoyed the Matrix style, gun tooting action. The last few Keanu Reeves movies have shown a moody side to his acting, compared to the earlier days of Bill & Ted and I must admit, I'm kind of liking it. His no nonsense demeanor really worked as John Wick but there script was a bit sketchy. Anyway, the movie is about a ex- assassin who has recently lost his wife and become a recluse in his house with his dog, which his wife got delivered to him after she passed away. Whilst filling up his car at a petrol station, some Russian gangsters offer him money for his car but he kindly turns them down and he goes on his way. This is were the plot was a bit weak in my opinion! For some random reason, the Russian gangsters turn up at his house and they beat him up, take his car and kill his dog. I was hoping that there was going to be a twist in the story which would make that aspect make sense but they were just being total out of order. Anyway, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) decides to go on a killing rampage, trying to get to the culprit who killed his dog but he has to go through the Russian mafia which puts his life in danger, along with his close friends. The storyline is pretty straight forward but there are a few elements that were a bit sketchy to me. Now, he's supposed to be an untouchable assassin who people call the ""Boogeyman"" but he was getting beat up, near to death in most of the action scenes. I don't know if the director was trying to make it seem realistic or not, but the way that some of the characters was describing John Wick is yet to be seen. OK, he was going around by himself causing havoc in New York but if it wasn't for Willem Dafoe, he would have died a few times in the film. With that aside, I did like the action scenes and the whole dark, intense feel to the film really worked. There definitely has to be a sequel because the John Wick character is really needed in Hollywood at the moment. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I really can't believe that Keanu Reeves is 51 and it's now that he's decided to become a action hero. I suppose it's after all the training from the Matrix movies! Anyway, his movie career started in 1986 in the popular Youngblood, ice hockey movie with Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze but he really hit the big time with the Bill & Ted movies in 1989. After getting branded as a comedic actor, which he didn't like, he decided to turn to action movies with Point Break in 1991 and Speed in 1994. In between those movies he took the lead in Bram's Stokers Dracula, which didn't go down well with the critics because of his accent and Little Buddha which also was a bit of a failure but he bounced back with the Devil's Advocate and, of course, the Matrix trilogy. Since then, he has struggled to find a genre that he was comfortable with and he starred in various movies like Hard Ball, Sweet November and the Gift. Constantine had mixed reviews along with Scanner Darkly, which was a brand new way of filming and then he came out with two disappointing films which were Generation Um... and Henry's Crime. Recently he has turned to action movies like Man Tai Chi, which he directed, 47 Ronin and, of course, this movie, which he plans to star in a sequel. In total, his movies have grossed nearly $3Billion so he has had a impressive career to date. He's never been comfortable around the whole Hollywood scene but he has proved to be a bankable star, even though he doesn't like to admit it. Anyway, this film was directed by Chad Stahelski whose done the stunts in over 70 movies which include Point Break, the Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2, Die Hard 4, Rambo, X Men, Iron Man 2, the Expendables, Tron Legacy, Sherlock Holmes and the Hunger Games so he really does have a impressive portfolio when it comes to stunt coordinating. This is his first movie in the directing chair and after its success, he plans direct the sequel, hopefully with a meaningful storyline. Anyway, for his first project, I was quite impressed with the result and I can't wait to see John Wick causing more havoc again.Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $79millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers about a ex-assassin who seeks revenge after Russian gangsters kill his dog and steal his car. 6/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The fight scenes are top tier with the cinematography being second to none. Though I can understand someone liking this film more I view it more as a perfect building block for the insane story ahead, keeping itself simple as to not over do you with what's yet to come.

John wick is a grand piece of action which has bullets ( like lot of bullets), great dialog, cool 80's reference & few funny moments which are missing in today's action movies. keanu reeves look was amazing & the fight choreography reminds me of movies like collateral & the even the influence of martial art movies are quite visible. The villein is quite strong great dialog, good sets & different languages. For all the movie action gun battle lovers, John wick is a great piece of action which would surly take your adrenaline level to the top.P.S- If a John wick prequel is made, it would be great to see how & why john wick is so bad ass. 5 star for this amazing movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That's all it is. It's thick with clichés, silly dialogue, plot holes, bland characters, and a watery feel - in fact, one could argue that that aspect pulls the viewer out of the experience. But at the same time, it's full of lowest-common- denominator emotions, great cinematography, fast and fun gunfights, and it has a huge overall entertainment value. If you're looking for a smart movie, this is not it. But if you're looking for an expensive, flashy, studio-quality cinematic FPS, this is absolutely it. It'll make you pause and yell 'Are you serious? That's asinine', but you'll still laugh when someone gets hit with a car. I think it sums up 2014 pretty well, actually.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Solid action scenes with a light comedic element to it, with things happening similar to Fast and Furious where the hero achieves a new super-hero level of abilities.

Chad Stahelski's stylish, loud, brash and unwaveringly violent opus of revenge is a highly watchable stock standard tale of a scorned man on a warpath that we've seen before, yet never seen quite like this.Front and center to this incredible body-dropping journey is dog lover and suit wearer John Wick, played by the thankfully watchable Keanu Reeves (almost like 47 Ronin was a bad dream). John is clearly a man who at one stage in his life utilized his skills of killing for a price and as per usual got out once love came his way. John is a man that even the ""bogeyman"" fears and a man who doesn't take kindly to having his puppy brutally murdered by a bunch of Russian thugs. The story of John Wick is slight and could've easily been written by a teenage boy whilst playing the latest Call of Duty but there's a market for these throwaway action flicks and up and coming director Stahelski clearly knows this.Directing the film like it's been injected with a drip feed of Red Bull, Stahelski barely stops to breathe in amongst the processions of finely tuned and impeccably crafted gun fights. From a home invasion firefight, a nightclub massacre and rain soaked battle at a port, Wick finds himself literally fighting across New York in increasingly OTT yet sufficiently satisfying gun battles. Stahelski cares little for trying to be realistic and the films tone is almost comical in its treatment of hotels for hit men and ""waste disposal"" crews and you get the feeling this film was aiming to be more John Woo than James Bond, which gives it an added sprinkling of charisma even though we all know Keanu Reeves isn't exactly the poster boy of emotional embodiment.If you don't like a liberal dosing of blood and a body count to match then John Wick is going to be a living, breathing nightmare for you, but for those looking for a well-oiled and at times almost fanciful rendition of the revenge tale then John Wick is going to be a new favourite of yours. A welcome return to form in many ways for Keanu Reeves and a calling card for director Stahelski, John Wick is under no illusions to what it is and neither should the viewer be when judging it. With a sequel already in the pipeline, it's pretty clear that John Wick did its job and hopefully can do it once more in the years to come.3 pencils out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a repeat of so many other movies. The action was stiff and repetitive, and absolutely lacking in reality. The story was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous, and the concept of Reeves being able to do even a small portion of what he was pictured to do, was just absurd. Can hardly believe actors of Reeve's caliber could even consent to act in this B-grade rubbish. It's like a kid's movie - all impossibility and fantasy. Nothing gripped me at all, not for a moment.

It is unashamed of this, it boldly pronounces this. It is pure action incarnate, like the movie 300. If you're looking for something deep, look elsewhere.This is not to say that there is no plot - the story fits in (and thought-out the sequels) nicely enough. This should be seen in light of the other movies, as a collection or part of one panoramic picture. In doing so, you will unearth the plot which I will not be spoiling here.If you're sick of what one would stuggle to call a ""storyline"" in modern movies, this is great break from that. It is akin to The Northman, one of these gems or an 'out' for the typical trash in circulation.Keanu Reeves plays his part excellently. Cold, ruthless, and original. In fact, compared to other classic action films like the Transporter, his style has a bit more ""realism"" to it. With a rigid repeatable technique, he kills his enemies.My real rating for this is an 8.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film stars Keanu Reeves as the title character, a retired hitman who is forced back into the game after the death of his wife and the theft of his prized possession - a vintage Mustang.One of the most impressive things about John Wick is its stunning action sequences. The choreography is impeccable, with Reeves and the stunt team pulling off some truly breathtaking moves. The fight scenes are intense and violent, but never feel gratuitous or over-the-top. They are always in service of the story, and serve to highlight the skill and determination of John Wick.But what sets John Wick apart from other action movies is its attention to detail. Every aspect of the film feels carefully crafted and considered, from the stunning cinematography to the intricate world-building. The film takes place in a unique universe where hitmen have their own currency, hotels, and rules of engagement. It's a world that feels both familiar and completely new.One of the standout performances in the film comes from Willem Dafoe as Marcus, a fellow hitman and friend of John Wick. Dafoe brings a quiet intensity to the role, and his scenes with Reeves crackle with chemistry and tension. Another standout is Michael Nyqvist as Viggo Tarasov, the film's main villain. Nyqvist plays Viggo with a quiet menace, making him a formidable opponent for John Wick.But ultimately, the film belongs to Reeves. He brings a quiet intensity to the role, conveying both the pain and determination of a man who has lost everything. His physical performance is also incredibly impressive, with Reeves performing many of his own stunts and fight scenes. It's clear that he put in a lot of work to bring John Wick to life, and it pays off in spades.One of the things that sets John Wick apart from other action movies is its commitment to world-building. The film creates a rich, complex universe that feels like it could exist outside of the confines of the film itself. From the Continental Hotel, a safe haven for hitmen, to the intricate rules that govern the world of assassins, every detail is considered and adds to the overall experience of the film.But despite its impressive world-building and stunning action sequences, what really sets John Wick apart is its emotional core. At its heart, the film is a story of love and loss, of a man driven to violence by his grief. It's a powerful and relatable story, and one that elevates the film beyond its genre trappings.Overall, John Wick is a stunning achievement in the action genre. It's a film that is both beautiful and brutal, with incredible performances and some of the best action sequences in recent memory. It's a film that deserves to be seen and celebrated, and one that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

John Wick was directed by two former stunt men, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, who seem to have a grip at what they're doing because they don't take any of the fun away from the action scenes. Derek Solstad's screenplay is pretty straightforward. We are introduced to the main character, John, who is grieving over his recently dead wife. She leaves him a cute puppy which will help him during this grieving period, but a group of young Russian mobsters break into his home one night to steal his car and in the process they kill the dog. That brings John to his breaking point and we discover pretty soon that he is no common man. He was once a feared hit-man who later retired after meeting his wife. Now he is set on getting his revenge and the action begins. John is the typical hero we can route for and identify with for his loss, while the villains are ruthless and deserve to be punished. We've seen all this in almost every other revenge film, but what makes this one stand out and feel fresh is that the action scenes are stylized and energetic. So despite having a predictable plot you are entertained with some of the coolest action scenes of the year. This is no Raid 2, but it does get the job done. There is one particular action scene that takes place in a nightclub that is fantastically choreographed. These are the strongest moments of the film, but if you are looking for an original plot look elsewhere because this is very predictable. There are some interesting elements that Solstad introduces in this world where the mobsters have a series of codes and rues that they follow giving it sort of a video game vibe to it at times.In order for the action scenes to work for a film like this where they aren't cutting the scenes every second you need to have an actor who can pull them off. They found the right one with Keanu Reeves who definitely knows his stuff. He delivers in every action scene with some fantastic choreographed moves. The mobsters build him up as someone they fear and respect, and once you see him in action you believe it. He also delivers during the quiet moments as well despite not having the best dialogue to work with. He was made for these roles and delivers. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Alfie Allen (from the Games of Thrones series) is getting typed cast as the hateful villain who behaves like a child at times. His father is played by the excellent Michael Nyqvist, who John Wick used to work for. He knows his kid made a mistake but tries to protect him nonetheless putting a generous reward on John's head. Willem Dafoe, Lance Reddick, and Adrianne Palicki get some screen time as well and they were a lot of fun. The way everyone treated John when they realized he was back in business was also another nice touch that the directors made and help lighten the mood at times. This was an extremely entertaining film with some of the best action scenes of the year despite all of its predictability.

Keanu Reeves makes it watchable despite the script.John Wick is newly widowed and his late wife gifted him a puppy which has been killed by the wayward son of a Russian mobster who has also stolen his car. However it is soon revealed that Wick is an ace hit-man and now he is back to get revenge and get his car back.This means various shooting and fight scenes. Wick is the man who the mob would call to kill the boogeyman. Yet we have scenes where minnows are easily dispensed with but the alpha male somehow survives.There is a female hit-woman out to get Wick and somehow he leaves her alone to cause further mischief. The Russian Mobster whose son Wick wants to kill is also let go by him when you would have thought it would had been better to shoot him fast.It is entertaining schlock, the plot is full of holes. Reeves acting is not stretched, he is required to be mean and moody, say a few words and do a lot of shooting.","36 out of 71 found this helpful.

Every shot from the first to the last is beautifully color graded and designed. The performances were outstanding from Keanu Reeves playing the humbled hero to Alfie Allen being very Theonish (Game of Thrones).Yes, the movie is a little bit cheesy with its ""Rambo: First Blood"" incentives, but it's a lot of fun.

I've become more surprised all the time that movies like this don't get the attention or box office. Yet Hunger Games, Divergent or Friday The 13th part 20, continue to make money.It's Violent.

Some poor souls choose to cross John during the worst and most painful time of his life, and it just might be the biggest mistake they will ever make in their now short lives.John Wick is experiencing the most painful sort of heart ache a man can go through. His wife dies and to make sure he's not alone she arranges for a dog to be brought to him after her death. Later some men wanting his car break in and beat him up and kill his dog. John Wick is also not your ordinary man, he is a man of focus and sheer will and he is to be feared. And now he is a man setting his anger, revenge and grief upon those responsible.Keanu Reeves does what Keanu Reeves does when he is brought on for a role in a movie, and it is just right for the character of John Wick. The film has a nice medley of characters to keep viewers hooked on the fun. It also takes a look at the hit-man social circle and the honor code associated with the inner sanctum.John Wick is the type of film that is so visceral in a fictional kind of way you can really only view it for entertainment purposes. Lucky for the film, it has to esteemed and professional stunt men directing their first feature film at the helm. David Leitch and Chad Stahelski bring the quintessentially masculine fight scenes to life with extreme savagery for the ruthless and merciless hit man. But John Wick is not just a shoot 'em up and blow 'em up film – it actually also has a pretty solid story thanks to Derek Kolstad.Please check out our WEBSITE for full reviews of all the recent releases.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Keanu played Keanu, no real dialogue short choreographed fight scenes and lots of close ups. I can get over Keanu because the pure foolishness of the entire movie is what the Expendables should have been, a collection of great actors (and Keanu) in a fun happy shoot-em up movie.It was refreshing that people with guns decided to USE guns, no silly fighting smacking each other with guns if there was a chance to shoot someone it pretty much happened.Go see this movie, enjoy it.

The film has a surprisingly strong start by relaying what happened to Mr. Wick to cause him so much distress. In a way it's a very clichéd story about a man seeking vengeance that has been done an uncountable number of times. However, when the action picks up it only slows down for cleanup(literally) and a little bit of exposition. One thing I will note is that this is probably Keanu Reeves's best performance in a long while(however you want to take that) he is actually capable of emoting for a few sparse moments throughout the film, but I digress. Unfortunately, he really can't carry the weight to make this an amazing film. This movie suffers from an often pretentious style that really tries to shove it in your face. The smooth, gentleman-like assassin world is interesting but when the film is done through and through you'll realize that there was so much potential wasted for the sake of clichéd theatrics and situations that were obviously contrived. The one thing that the creators did manage to do perfectly was the soundtrack, it always hit the ""badass"" note and felt appropriate. The fight scenes were mostly superb with Keanu moving swiftly like he dropped a few years, but a few(and trust me you'll know which ones) were way too ""hollywood"". If you're looking for an enjoyable action flick that isn't overly thoughtful(which is what I was in the mood for when I watched it) I'd recommend John Wick7/10-It's Average","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Of course you shouldn't expect some deep thought provoking movie. This is action. It's like an action movie from the 80s or 90s - done better than any of them.Some things are done so amazing that I think are likely attributed to David Leitch and/or Chad Stahelski. Perhaps it's their stunt background that's really made them understand how these fights should look, and how people actually handle injury and gunshots that's severely lacking in most movies. There is no people taking a shot to the chest, flying back 50 feet, and croaking. There are not people standing around taking their turns on John Wick. Nope, people are double taped. Everyone is finished off with a shot to the heart or chest. John Wick is taking on multiple people at a time with them attacking him like you'd expect. This may offend some, but I'd say this movie makes even legendary movies like Ip Man look BAD. Yet, at the same time, John Wick seems completely human, as he should. There is this perfect balance of him just appearing to be the really good assassin that he is, without seeming to have super powers.The only reason it's not a 10/10 are a few shortcomings: Michael Nyqvist's acting falls short on occasion, in my opinion (and yes, Keanu's acting in this moving is actually really fantastic). I find it a little odd that John Wick isn't more often looking back over his shoulder to make sure there isn't something there(but the choreography gets more right than just about any movie I've seen). The skip-to-end opening scene that so many movies do now days is also here. Sometimes those are good, but in this case it was really pointless. The exposition goes by great, and they really should have gotten right to that and skipped that.","9 out of 25 found this helpful.

Okay he's basically choreographing all the same moves as he learned in THE MATRIX but thankfully Reeves doesn't have to do much involving the skill of acting - why break the habit of a life time ? - but as a no holds barred enjoyably mean thriller with its tongue firmly in cheek "" Sorry to disturb you Mister Wick but we've had a complaint about the noise"" it's very entertaining .

Directed by stunt men and first time directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a retired and extremely dangerous assassin/hit-man, who leaves his 'fraction' so he can spend time with his wife. Until his wife Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) unfortunately dies due to a terminal illness. When he is driving home from her funeral, he stumbles upon 2 Russians, who show a little too much interest in his car and his dog, a gift from his late wife. He is awoken late at night by his dog. As he goes downstairs to confront the noise. He is attacked by the same 2 Russians. They beat him and kill his dog. Now he doesn't like that, not, one, BIT.The action in this movie is phenomenal, fast paced, and always keeps you on the edge of your seat. By far the best thing about it. On the other hand, the script is pretty darn ridiculous to say the least. coupled by the poor acting chops of Keanu. You'd think that after over 20 years of movies he'd be a little better at it by now. The acting from the Russians with the exception of Michael, is even worse. One redeeming factor of this is that, although the script is bad. The general plot and story unfolds well, which gradually makes the movie more fulfilling.All in all, unlike most of the US action movies just being about a guy killing everyone and with a poor handled story and even worse script, John Wick only has one of those things. Thus making it more superior.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Seriously... EVERYBODY has to be so damn tough... EVERYBODY has to revenge bloody EVERYTHING... I'm talking about the bad guys here... Not to give anything away, but they REALLY set you up fully to expect and enjoy the revenge that has truly been earned by these fools.Sorry to go off like that, but although necessary and ultimately entertaining, it is still SO bloody frustrating from a strictly intellectual point of view, that these stubborn Evil @ssholes Never EVER know when to quit! GEEZ... Well, clearly giving it a rating of '8', I really did like the film. Most entertaining. VERY reminiscent of the minimalist Clint Eastwood 'Man with No Name' films. But, brought up to date.The story is simple and with so many reviews, there is no need to go into it more here; but watching the film I got the strong impression almost like I was watching a video game. And, I mean that in a good way. The action was SO smooth and choreographed. This is STRICTLY Revenge / Action entertainment people; and VERY good entertainment at that if you enjoy revenge tales. But, don't expect Mamet or Shakespeare here; that is just not the point of this film.That's basically it; I don't know why I am writing a review when there are nearly 500 already (normally I don't) but, since I had such a frigg'n BLAST watching this, I just wanted to weigh in as saying that it is LOTS of fun and very well done. Keanu is absolutely perfect for it, despite your opinion of him. If you like a good, Action / Revenge Thriller, then you probably will really enjoy this. It's not overly deep or over the top violence wise. It just does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it beautifully...","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Hardly ever have I seen one in which a major Hollywood actor has had to endure such a poorly produced crime drama as John Wick.It is a shame that an actor with the potential of Keanu Reeves has to work in such a meaningless film. I sure hope he does not go the way of Nicolas Cage, whose last good movie was made in 2003 (Matchstick Men). My fears though of a career collapse are slowly but surely being realized with Keanu as this makes a two-for-two terrible movies list (47 Ronin was in the category of WTF). I will have to watch Generation Um... and Man of Tai Chi to see what calibre of production Reeves has been partnered with of his last four films.As for the film itself, John Wick is a totally un-enjoyable movie not only because the plot line is yet another US State Department propaganda piece using Russians as the bad guys but because the audience is not given the tools to sympathize for any character, both ""bad"" and ""good"" alike.The aftertaste of John Wick is a dark, dreary monolithic crime drama revenge movie that elicits zero compassion, respect or other noble feelings and imparts not one lesson of humanity to the audience. It does its job though of leaving a dark impression of Russians and a vaguely justified negative thought-impression of that particular strain of people.","74 out of 158 found this helpful.

I'm big on Keanu. No homo. But j/king aside, John Wick is the movie that proves Reeves is still in the game. Ironically, the titular character is doing just what it's titular leading actor is supposedly doing; coming back and staying current. You only have to watch the movie 15 minutes to catch the tongue in cheek remarks thrown out ad nauseam to this.Keanu is all over this movie. I don't know how he manages to stay in-shape after 50; it's clearly himself doing most of the stunt work. He might just have the fountain of youth shoved somewhere in his body. (He is The One after all...) It's still good ol' stone face Keanu. Not as hammy as Keanu from Constantine, or as cold as Keanu from DtESS, but somewhere in between. The guy is all about subtlety and jest. He is forward, without being forward. I like it.Willem *ucking Dafoe!!! Is there any role this cat cannot play?! Seriously, you had me at Dafoe. I think Dafoe is competing with Freeman and Jackson for most utilized supporting actor in Hollywood. He's NEVER a main, always some BAMF supporting cast member. And as always, he's just too good not to love. Even in Fault in Our Stars, he was a lovable crass cynic, but in this movie, he's one of the characters who you just know is a true badass. Keanu ALWAYS picks characters who are loners, yet somehow attracts the guardian angel types, or people who just want him to win. This time around, Dafoe is Wick's guardian angel.Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist are the true breakout actors in this film. Allen, as we all know from Game of Thrones, is easy to hate, but hard to love. He plays this role much as he does in GoT by being the prick mob boss's spoiled brat son who has a penchant for not thinking two seconds ahead. And the mob boss, Nyqvist, is probably the best representation of a smarmy yet sophisticated Russian Don since... well he's probably the first really well adapted Russian mob boss we've ever seen! Jack Reacher went up against the Russian's, and I know there's some in Person of Interest, but Nyqvist's Viggo Tarasov has the swagger, brains, and even compassion to stay fresh and noteworthy, well after the film's ended. He's even got this breadth about him, a foreboding barrel chested strength that you don't see a lot of these days, good casting choice! Both actors played their respective wells true to form.I'd like to say more about other actors/characters in the movie, but it would honestly contain spoilers. You don't have to even watch the trailer to find out that this is a straight shoot 'em up, true to the core. The freaking dog dies, how much you wanna bet others will too...Read other reviews if you want to find out about plots, subplots and pacing. John Wick stays fresh and thrilling the entire way through! The stunt work's amazing, the acting is slightly campy yet engaging, the premise is simple, and the movie's a blast!","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

I won't say any more than this or mention the other films in his career but I saw it this morning and had a great time. Reeves is brilliant in this film, which is about an infamous retired hit-man (one-man killing machine) who plunges back into the underworld in the pursuit of revenge. If you've seen the trailer the story is as simple as it appears: a pretext is to give Keanu the opportunity to be entertaining-as-hell as a gun-wielding bone-crunching badass. Luckily the magic works and a cheesy, tongue-in-cheek, actioner becomes a breathless explosion of Russian-hit men and mobsters. Yes, Russians are back on the menu. Why is this entertaining? Because it's Keanu, and he's back. No offense to Arnold but we all know who's cooler. The movie is superficial adrenaline-fueled fun and has the style and skill to keep you involved in the mayhem. Personally, I thought that there was just the right amount of everything. It doesn't avoid cheesiness but it doesn't matter when you're here to have fun. I'd like to make the point that the Russians portrayed in this film are purely fictional representations of mafia-members and I hold a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of the true Russian people.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

This was a near flawless action film with original sequences, a great cast, powerful scenes and a trip back to a noir theme (an underground culture of economy and honor among killers) that seemed to die out in the action films of the 80s. The closest to this, was maybe Ronin from 1998. The camera work was phenomenal and dialog above passable. When you have a movie audience sobbing and cheering, you have a good emotional grasp of the material. This film achieved art.

The plot doesn't really have twists, and there are basically no subplots to speak of; it's just a straight line from beginning to finish. Reeves plays the titular retired hitman who's just lost his wife (to cancer) but who receives a beagle as a final present from her, delivered after her death. He has the dog for like two days before Russian mobsters invade his house to steal his vintage Mustang and kill the dog just for kicks. And thus the most plausible revenge plot in history is set into motion. There's a LOT of violence. A lot of characters die. Some of the action is very reminiscent of The Matrix. The weaponry is impressive, as is the hand-to-hand combat. There's a lot to love about John Wick the movie, as long as you're part of the intended audience, i.e., the action-movie fan.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wick a violent, visceral fast-paced high kill-rate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it. Reeves owns the screen, and reveals a physicality which belies his age. He throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional 'mechanic' anti-hero.The story - I'll admit - is a little far-fetched if you take it too seriously, the bad guys are a little hammy and one-dimensional but Reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of Wick which shows off just how good he is. The martial arts are unusual, original and superbly choreographed and, like Jackie Chan, Wick uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action anti-heroes, he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it. Cute puppy scenes, cuter puppy and Keanu scenes - is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy? The brutal scenes with the dog - Daisy - will upset some but bear with the film. It's quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with Reeves and the story, there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living, is capable of, and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punky/rock soundtrack.Watch it. Probably a favourite for boys everywhere, martial arts fans, Keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble. It is a stunningly shot film... an old school feel, slick, and dark and totally entertaining.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Despite delivering some authentic roles in remarkable blockbusters the guy Neo as we know disappeared along with the Matrix a decade ago possibly into the depths of a Matrix itself. His chief contribution from the asylum was frequent mediocre roles that didn't do justice to his potentials and a load of tedious second-rate movies that we didn't see come and go; and yes, except one or two. Keanu is a good actor, a typecast action hero. He could have done a lot better, choose some notable characters or somebody could have saved this poor chap by giving him a role that he truly deserved. And finally it took director duos David Leitch and Chad Stahelski to become the saviors. Keanu is saved. Or in more apt words, Keanu is back. This is his best movie released since a long time. Ignore the aforesaid statements. Considering his movies of the past decade the 'Sad Keanu' Meme was totally legitimate.John Wick is a wickedly entertaining 100 minutes of exhilarating marathon killing spree show that will make your butt go flabbergasted; with comparatively less elaborated plot and forthright twists. It doesn't have an impressive story arc to brag about but a straightforward account of a retired hit-man seeking vengeance for the killing of his beloved dog. And boy does he seek that out with style and elegance. It also features an awesome soundtrack.The quirk about the movie is its action and in its execution. And the fight sequences are likely to be one of the all-time best in films. Keanu Reeves literally invokes the phantom of some dead martial art legend to make your limbs uncomfortable doing nothing. He is said to have undergone four months of learning judo and some nutcracker techniques developing special close-quarter combat style and wicked skills. And does it reflect throughout the movie. John Wick is mostly about the remarkable style of action. Its approach toward the assassins and their cult offers some rather exciting insights into how do they pull off the jobs and how things work in their terms and conditions. I'm not a big fan of action movies. The one reason I discount most of those movies is due to their unconvincing and improbable outlook of a superhuman hero to whom logic and physics doesn't apply. John Wick on the other hand boasts not about the impossible and implausible abilities a man on vengeance is capable of fostering. The character John Wick is portrayed as a highly skilled assassin; someone who was in the business for a long enough time to master his moves. There is no fancy action movie cliché like bullet repelling body, instant recovery, flying off of buildings or the insane jumps. The crispy combat style and background music pumps some impressive energy into the action; John Wick is one of the best action flicks I had seen. There isn't a solid story or a clash of brains but if you are fan of action movies or looking to watch something for fun and get pumped up, then there isn't a better entertaining action flick released in the recent years than John Wick.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a Russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence. Denzel Washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role. However, Keanu Reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role, which was sadly lacking in TE. Washington looks bigger, stronger and more physically imposing, but never displays any particular skill at martial arts. The fights in TE are shot in semi-darkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts, so Washington's character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be. In contrast, the fight scenes in JW are masterfully choreographed. One can not only see, but follow the action. Reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero, skilled with guns, knives and his bare hands. The Russian mobsters are much more menacing, evil and capable in TE than in JW, where they are adequate, but less memorable. These gangsters are three-dimensional characters with flaws, foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable. They also have conflicting agendas, whereas the gangsters in TE are more narrowly focused and unwavering. JW also has a much better production design. The color palate, costumes and cinematography blow TE away. Neither film is perfect. JW starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that don't need bolstering. But once it begins, maintains a steady action pace. Between the two, JW is much more enjoyable and Reeves is a better action hero than Washington. JW doesn't have quite the panache or complexity of ""Django Unchained,"" ""Rock 'n' Rolla,"" ""Smokin' Aces"" or the underrated ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" but it's a solid effort by all involved.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Here comes John Wick, from marketing to execution, a bare-bones action flick that leaves nothing to be desired except a better plot. Reeves' titular character is a retired hit man who is unwittingly robbed by the son of a Russian mob boss. In the process, John Wick's puppy is killed. The puppy was a gift from his dead wife who died of cancer days before. Apparently, John Wick feels he has nothing left to lose. John Wick is determined to destroy the man who killed his puppy, no matter how many Russian mobsters must die in the process. And boy, do they die! In terms of action/adventure, special effects, etc. this film is an example of doing more with less. The action scenes had none of that CGI music video feel; they were all realistically choreographed and shot, which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief. The performances are about as good as the script will allow, but nothing stands up to scrutiny. With John Wick being as unstoppable as he appears to be, it's odd that he would have been the hapless victim of a home invasion. And why, why won't we listen to reason? As the film is aware, ""it was just an f-ing dog.'","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

A tight 90(ish) minute film that takes a brutally simple and emotionally engaging plot, adds some fascinating world building and delivers some of the best action sequences Hollywood has produced in a while, all on an impressively low budget.Keanu Reeves is perfect as John Wick, fully committed to the physicality of the action scenes and as well showing John's emotional vulnerability between headshots. This all culminates in a terrific speech that confidently announces the return of one of Hollywood's best and nicest leading men.There's also a strong supporting cast here too. Willem Dafoe is effortlessly cool with an understated friendship with Reeves. Michael Nyqvist does an amazing job at showing the fear that John Wick instils in people. Finally, there's Ian McShane and John Leguizamo who are instantly likeable in their small roles.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, it puts most other Hollywood action films to shame with its endlessly impressive and always comprehensible action. It's also extremely stylish with fight scenes drenched in neon and rainfall.The music by Joel J. Richard and Tyler Bates is amazing, creating an instantly iconic main theme that's equally good at conveying the fear of John Wick as any of Michael Nyqvist's speeches. There's some needle drops here as well that really work tonally and stylistically.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The former slightly outweighs the latter, so I give John Wick a 6/10. Would recommend waiting for this to come out on your favorite video service to watch, unless you're desperate for something to watch in the theaters. Still, I have to give Hollywood kudos for attempting an original R-rated action film, and hope this is part of a continuing trend that can lead to better action movies for adults.","2 out of 18 found this helpful.

The 70's with Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Roger Moore, Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds. Or the 80's with Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stalone, Steven Segal, Arnold Scwarzeneggar, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson and Van Damn. Something happened in the 90's with regards to the action genre, and Keanu Reeves was the only actor from that time forward who ever seemed to keep the tradition going, I liked Speed, the Matrix better and John Wick best of all. Reeves like all the names I mentioned get's guff for not being a ""Serious Actor"". My retort..who cares? While hold overs from early years like Willis, Segal, Gibson Van Damn and stalone continued making descent action flicks after the 90's. Reeves is the only actor I can think who basically came on the scene in the 90's who stayed true to his roots and is single handily keeping this genre alive. John Wick is a dark film that reminds me of Blade Runner, Dark City, and From Hell with regards to production, only the lens filter used in this movie was so dark it almost becomes distracting. (this is not the only recent film I can think of that has this problem) Aside from this one technical problem, the movie was perfect. While not as gritty as Able Ferrera's Fear City or as comic book as The Payback from the 90's it seems to meet in the middle of these two films somewhere. The action scenes are some of the best ever put to film, the soundtrack animates the movie as much as the fight sequences, and it has absolutely Zero political correctness factor to it which is so refreshing. I liked this movie a lot. Long love the man of action.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (former stuntmen and fight coordinators) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. It's a pretty cool and stylized action flick that's also a great comeback for Keanu Reeves.Reeves plays John Wick; a former hit-man who retired when his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), became deathly ill with cancer. As he's grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her, in the form of a puppy named Daisy. It's explained, through a letter from Helen, that she wanted John to have the dog to help him cope with her passing. John quickly becomes attached to Daisy; so when Russian gang members break into his house and kill the dog, as well as steal his '69 Mustang, John decides to come out of retirement to get revenge. Nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members, as well as John's former employer.John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film and Reeves is great in the role. I think Reeves has gotten much better, as an actor, overtime; probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently. It's great to see him back in action and cooler than ever. I think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well, he's already a part of the video game 'Payday 2', and a film franchise seems very likely. The movie is also a great showcase for Leitch and Stahelski, as directors, and I can't wait to see more from them too. If you're an action fan you definitely don't want to miss this one!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

An aging star or other has his agent fish around in the market for a script where he will have to look pained in spots, heroic in others. Liam Neeson seems to do this yearly. Denzel found a new franchise last year. Statham makes his living this way. There are probably any number of identical scripts floating around at any given time that fit the criteria, one is picked from an agency's hat or because it slightly stands out.Someone is brought around to direct, a crew is assembled. Along the way a few spots open up for known actors to get a paycheck in return for a few minutes of screen time, a few of them here. Work is done, perhaps a hundred people go home with money to make mortgage, from set dressers to McShane. If decent enough, it makes up its money with some profit, viewers get their money's worth of gunplay. There's nothing wrong with this, work is work, it's how anything gets done; it's that this particular one never convinces as anything other than what I just described, people dragging themselves out of bed to go to work, and this line of work has spoiled us to expect so much more than people simply doing it. When Dafoe talks with Reeves at a funeral within the first few minutes, that's not a conversation between characters who immerse themselves in the significance of some story, it's one actor standing where he was told to and repeating lines after the other has finished doing so.","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

This film had those in spades: A compelling storyline and revenge thriller with excellently defined characters. The powerhouse presence of a resurgent Keanu Reeves. A film that was not afraid to take risks.The irony is that even though this first John Wick film would be surpassed by its sequels, it still has something none of the sequels would have themselves and that would be a memorably detestable villain played by a convincing Alfie Allen. This spoiled and spineless wastrel makes his mark as Wick's antagonist and I dare say that no subsequent villain has been nearly as memorable.

More often than not, I pass. This revenge, he-against- everybody film is an exception, and what a wonderful, welcome one it is.John Wick is the kind of action movie I love, one in which you find yourself nodding in agreement, enjoying fantastic cinematic violence, rooting for the hero, knowing he should prevail but not sure whether he will survive or not, appreciating the journey and thoroughly enjoying the ride until the climax.The plot is not ground-breaking stuff. It can be summed up in but a few words, and yet simple works well in this case. There are no stupid plot twists, no maddening plot holes, no illogical actions. The characters are believable, their motivations clear enough, it's all quite easy to understand and enjoy.That is not to take way from the work the writers and directors did in this movie. They built a rich, realistic universe, one in which the viewers can easily get immersed. The action is tight, the filming, very well-done, capturing every hit, stabbing, bullet in precise fashion. It's gritty and stylish without going overboard. Performances are mostly pretty good, too.In the end, this is a pretty good action movie. It may lack a bit of emotional depth when compared to genre classics, but in this day and age, a throwback film like this is a true blessing. While you won't be left thinking for days about this one, John Wick is a very fun film to watch. (+) Great action scenes, sound performances, a well-crafted, believable, straight-forward movie that gives action fans exactly what they hope for.(-) Nothing too ground-breaking. An effective, enjoyable action movie, but one lacking a couple of elements to be a truly great one.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I want to know more of it, more from the characters, more about the history of 'The Continental' and I'm pretty sure everyone wants to see more of 'the Boogeyman'.John Wick is a solid movie, with a great argument, great action sequences, an understandable motivation and - last but not least-a great Keanu.

I do not judge the script though. Great acting of most of the players, good handling of action scenes, and I think very good directors. But why the dog? Why did anyone think the dog could made sense and serve the purpose in the film? I mean, a former hit-man, a cold blooded killer, a guy who is supposed to have little empathy with life in general, decides to decimate his former employer's underground empire because the death of, after all, just a dog? I got the meaning of the dog, okay? But the significance attached to it is so complex, it is about an emotional transfer from dead wife to his peace of mind and soul, tantamount to philosophical levels of understanding! This in my view throws the very premise of the movie into sheer uncertainty to the viewers. Why couldn't be much simpler, such as in for instance In order of disappearance, where the guy's son is murdered. Let's imagine the following premise: wife shows up at the outset, is kind, beautiful, gets more substance, borrows the sports car for shopping, the same scene at the gas station and, suddenly, after she gets back home, a bunch of drunk Russians kill her accidentally with a baseball bat just to steal the car who they so very much liked, and all this with John not being at home. Even more, Viggo' s sun was supposed to know who John was, since he is the son of the boss right, but, and this would have gone just fine along the lines of the movie, he was stupid and drunk enough to forget about his name (which the wife had mentioned at the gas station while refusing to tag a price) - even after 5 years of John retirement, the son would still have been a dead man and provoked the kind of anger and disaster etc etc. what do you think?","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

There's lots of violence and brutality. It's well executed, but it's not particularly special...except I would suggest in the honesty with which it is what it is, and doesn't pretend to be anything else.The movie deliberately chooses the weakest justification for the protagonist's one man war against the russian mafia that it can, as if to say ""We're not going to waste your time with deeper motivations. You're here for the bang-bang and boom-boom."" And so the entire plot moves on the bad guys killing his dog, and taking his car. That's it.My main complaint against the entire Wick franchise is that it gets eye-rolling to hear every character sh-- their pants over what a bada-- John Wick is....and yet they they try to kill him anyway. It got old...right around the second time it happened. And it happens several time each movie.But you're here for the bang-bang, and there is alot of that. And it's better done than most action movies. The action is stylish and fast, yet seldom confusing. Bad action directors confuse you with alot of rapid cuts and situations where you're not always sure what's happening.

And the sequence of negative occasions for such a man really could bring him back to an unstoppable killing machine.

There are two story lines here; my review of the movie and how this movie got a 7.9 IMDb rating.First the movie. There was a early moment in the theater when I thought maybe this is all a gag, a clever gag. Kinda like those mini feature spots reminding you to turn off your cell phone. They do a nice job on some of those in theater messages. Perhaps this will evolve into a Djangoesque tongue in cheek graphic novel. All this critical analysis language doesn't belong any where near John Wick. On location the actors must have looked at each other and said...really? Or maybe, my agent said we are supposed to shoot a movie today. Any movie fan with an eye for action movies will notice the poor fight scenes. I counted 6 identical fight moves straight out of the 70s cop shows on TV where somebody is flipped over using one arm and a throw. Every fight scene was the same fight. Movie audiences have evolved quite a bit since the 70s. John Wick is predictable, it's heartless, it's painfully slow with no shortage of terribly awkward dialog. I am done throwing fancy words at this mess.Now the rating. I have relied on IMDb for solid reviews for many years now. For the most part I have agreed with their rating, I could argue a half point here and there but 4-6 points? My guess is the John Wick studio has found a way to game this system. Crazy idea, right? To me it's more plausible than the plot line of the movie. Somebody at IMDb should look into this because it would be our loss if this gets out of hand.","78 out of 173 found this helpful.

The plot is a simple revenge story, but by no means generic. John Wick is a retired hit-man, who misses his wife. One day, he receives a dog as a gift. But all goes downhill when a Russian gang steal his car and kill his dog. It turns then into a cat and mouse chase. So as described, the film isn't exactly super complex, or emotionally driven (though it does give us enough to sympathize with the main character, and give us also enough to be invested), but it is obvious from the very start that film doesn't try to be so. It instead gives you well choreographed action sequences.Surprisingly though, John Wick is a compelling character to get behind, thanks to a tight script and a passionate performance by Keanu Reeves. the film could have benefited had the musical score been added, adding more subtlety and nuance, for example, when he receives the dog and reads the letter, the scene could have been more powerful without the voice over and the music. Now let's talk about the action. This has to be one of the best directed action set pieces in the genre. The camera work is very graceful and stylistic, allowing us to witness the entire action scenes, knowing when to cut and when to give us the full picture. It's something that's not common in modern action films, and for that, the action is glorious, The key to this is because the camera is focused. There is no stupid shaky camera, or unnecessary cut edits. It just lets the scenes naturally flow. The cinematography is also brilliant and visually gorgeous, giving a scene of hostile and loneliness, as well as a violent, dead environment. It is easily the best aspect of the film, and the reason why John Wick is such a good movie. Overall, the film is fantastic and i would recommend it to any action movie fan.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In some places the effects were easily noticeable (sometimes terrible). And last but not least the move felt cheesy, it felt like they try to paint this super powerful image of the main character (just like internet does with Chuck Norris).Now with the good points: as I mentioned half of the cast was pretty bad, but Keanu Reeves was really good, I also liked Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo Daniel Bernhardt and Clarke Peters. Some of them had so little screen time, but when they did, it felt so refreshing to see an interesting character after the sea of average. And obviously the most important thing is the stunts: a lot of the time they were impressive and kept me on my toes.All in all, John Wick is a pretty good action movie. I wouldn't give 7 if it wasn't for Keanu. I feel like he's a good actor and he deserves a good movie once again (after the matrix trilogy), but this wasn't it. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you, Keanu!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It really justifies Keanu's acting potential in style with the Matrix movies. The movie has a decent plot, although easy to figure out. Some lovable characters, especially Willem's! However, as a Swede, I simply cannot get over the fact that even though Michael does a decent job with the acting, his accent destroys the credibility of his role. The dialect and accent is so obviously from a Scandinavian country and not near how Russians speak having learned the English language later in life. I cannot comment on the actual Russian dialect itself, but the English is way off. It's too bad really, he should've gotten help with a language coach to hit off that accent. It's easy for us Swedes to learn English, however, when done this poorly, it just becomes a bother.All in all, 7/10 fruit loops.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

From 20 minutes in to the ending of the movie it is almost non stop action. Kianu Reeves is incredible in this film. I would even go as far to say it's his best performance ever given. When the film gets emotional, Reeves is absolutely believable and you feel the hurt his character is going through.One of the things this film did that made it great is how realistic it is. John Wick actually runs out of bullets throughout the movie, which is something you don't see a lot in action films. They also build up the characters really well. They make you absolutely hate the antagonists, and make John Wick seem like an unstoppable machine, which he is.My only complaints with the film is at times it does seem really clichéd. The hand to hand fight sequences were also lacking a little bit, but other than that, John Wick is definitely worth watching, and I can't wait for the sequel.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was excited to see Keanu returning to the modern action genre, and as John Wick, he does not disappoint. Keanu steps out from his usual monotonic delivery and on several occasions in the film, he is given the opportunity to showcase his acting abilities, which for much of his career have lay dormant.There is more to John Wick than just a standard revenge flick, There is a depth of character and a subtleness in the cinematography that is often missing from such genre films. The action is interlaced regularly with moments of levity, tension, and even sadness. John Wick is not your typical shoot 'em up action flick. Yes it has a gratuitously high body count, and some of the take-downs are brutal in their efficiency and ruthlessness, yet underneath all the blood and corpses there is a vast undercurrent of emotion and symbolism just waiting to be discovered. I highly recommend this movie. 4.5 out of 5 Stars","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

However there is a style and intelligence present in this script that elevate the experience way above the norm for the genre.I was reminded of Jack Reacher (2012), Payback (1999) and Get Carter (1971). All R rated movies, unfortunately for the 15 year old boys who would absolutely love them. It's irritating to me that the commercial need for the PG-13 rating has steered action films toward the comic book adaptations where death on screen is generally avoided. Although the film takes place in a heightened fantasy version of New York, it maintains a quite realistic style of fighting and action choreography. Most of the fights are settled by someone getting shot and killed.There are a lot of angry, one-star reviews on IMDb. These are from people who don't like the genre and were expecting something character-driven. The professional reviewers rated the picture on how well it achieves what it set out to do, and it was quite well-reviewed indeed by those professionals.The release didn't have a huge push behind it and it was a so-so performer at the domestic box office, but I think the essential enjoyability and quality here will translate into strong results as a rental. It did manage to edge out Expendables 3, a massively dumb effort to appeal to the same audience, and one that was crippled by its efforts to achieve a PG-13 and a broader appeal. It's good to see Keanu Reeves here in a project that is a perfect fit for his screen presence.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I think I don't have to explain how these revenge movies work: they (the character and the audience) need a reason to take/want revenge on the bad guys and then you can brace yourself for the violent killing spree that leads up to the main prize. What Keanu lacks in sympathetic warm charisma (like Denzel) he more than makes up in coolness and style. John Wick is just badass! The fights are excellently choreographed (Wick uses the Central Axis Relock System in combination with martial arts moves) and the gunfights are fast and furious. The overall design of the sets and costumes is very slick and stylish and the soundtrack also features some cool tunes. Although the script wasn't written with Reeves in mind, it does feel like it fits like a glove. John Wick wasn't a great box office success but I bet this will grow into a cult hit on DVD and Blu Ray. Do check it out!","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Impressive Film, But A Bit Overhyped","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6121078/?ref_=tt_urv","austinbmoney","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111066647/?ref_=tt_urv","24 September 2020","So this film has been out for about six years now, and ever since the first trailer came out, I had always wanted to see it, because a Keanu Reeves action film is always something worth seeing. I never ended up seeing it in theaters, and always wanted to wait until it came to a streaming service, but it never did, so I decided to rent it yesterday. I do want to say that maybe this film was overhyped for me a little bit, as I have only heard good things about it, so I was a little bit disappointed with the final product. However, this is still a really good movie, and I definitely plan on watching the other two as well. The film has a pretty basic premise, retired hitman John Wick lives alone with his dog, and when some Russian gangsters rob him and murder his dog, he decided to come out of retirement and get revenge.
For a film that was made on a small budget, the cast of this film is stacked, and the choreography and special effects are fantastic. Not only does this movie have Reeves, but it also has Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, and John Leguizamo, just to name a few. And many could argue that this is the film that started Reeves' career renaissance, which is good because ever since he finished working on The Matrix trilogy, he had a long period of time in which he starred in a lot of mediocre films. So, not only is the acting superb in this film, but like I said before, the special effects and choreography are some of the best that you will see in an action movie. This actually doesn't surprise me because the director of this film, Chad Stahelski, has actually been a stunt director since the early 90s, so he clearly knows what he is doing. He also just does a great job at making a film that is on a twenty million dollar budget, look like a hundred million dollar film. Another thing that the movie does well is it takes the simple generic action movie plot, and makes it really enjoyable. Typically movies that follow this basic premise don't actually end up being all that great, but this movie manages to take that basic premise, and give it it's own unique qualities that separate it from the competition, and that is how it managed to spawn a franchise. Another thing worth pointing out is that this was Stahelski's directorial debut, so I would say that he did a fantastic job.
Overall, I can't say that this was the best action film ever made or anything of that sort. I did come into the film expecting it to be that way based on all of the things that I had heard, but sadly that was not the case. There are a few flaws with this film. One thing I would have liked to see more fleshed out was the story. It is a pretty prominent thing in the first ten minutes of the film, but as soon as the action starts, the story doesn't really matter anymore. There are also a few things that aren't really explained or solved by the end of the film, so that was a little bit annoying. These aren't major things, but if they had been done differently, it still would have made for a better movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is an enthralling and gripping thrill ride of a movie, that builds to such a crescendo that you won't even know whats hit you when it finally does. It's slick, witty and powerful. There's a message hidden in all the action and drama this movie delivers. A message that will likely stay with you long after the movie is over. Keanu hasn't been better than this since the Matrix. Here you see Keanu really deliver on all levels. Michael Nyqvist is masterful and brings everything he needs to and then some in his portrayal of Viggo Tarasov, I don't think Viggo could have been played any better, seriously. And Willem Dafoe really knocks it out of the park as Marcus. Honorable mention to Alfie Allen in his portrayal of Iosef Tarasov as he really did great work in his performance here. The riveting feeling of the film, is has all we often hope for in a film like this and we're reminded again that is what we ideally crave.

It's a crucial requirement for hit men to have a mediocre first name and quirky last name, as seen with Bond or Bourne, by this standard, John Wick has secured himself in pantheon of action heroes. His tale follows the known formula of one assassin returning to his old life, but what makes John Wick stands out is how vibrant and exciting the movie portrays him. From the nuance, visual and audio, everything looks like enhanced virtual reality or a very polished video game.Keanu Reeves, despite having impressive resume, might not be the most dynamic actor. He doesn't transform himself in every role, like say, Tom Cruise. However, with good direction and material, both are present in this movie, he will perform amazingly. This is one of Reeves' best roles aside from his in Matrix and Speed, he brings the air of confidence along with hidden yet excessive violence. Reeves display a good emotion as the character, and he also moves with certainty like a hit-man would. There is expert use of close quarter combat technique with multitude of fire arms and knowledge of martial arts for the foundation of the character. Although it is heavily brimmed with action elements, John Wick is also equipped with a bit of emotional baggage. From ancient time, the loss of loved one is an acceptable motive for incoming rampage.The movie is exhibited with flair, its use of color is simply impressive. Every set piece is done with meticulous vivid visual. The camera angle makes it as though the world of John Wick is seen in different light, almost in the setting of enhanced modern noir. Each action is choreographed meticulously and it's a paramount aspect to make him believable as a lethal force. One of the best things about the action is how the fast pace can be captured with precision. Oftentimes movie employs shaky camera or highly uncoordinated editing. This movie manages to display action with clear focus and crisp movements, even at more crowded setting it never relents or overload the viewer with too much visual information.Soundtracks help a lot with solemn tone and faster techno rhythm. It's probably one of the best soundtracks of this year, rivaling Hans Zimmerman's from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. There are not many action movies with this high of production value, it certainly packs enough fiery punch to leave a scorch mark for sequel, I won't be surprised if there's even a video game of it. With no Bond, Hunt or Bourne in sight, this may be the time for John Wick.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

If it is action you want, action you get – no holds barred and thoroughly gratifying.Helming the film is David Leitich as producer and Chad Stahelski as first time director, both expert fight chorographers and stunt doubles from over two decades of action thrillers. The latter was also responsible for those genre defining action scenes in The Matrix trilogy, besides standing in as Keanu Reeves' stunt double in other films. Speaking of which, Reeves hasn't been in anything memorable since the aforementioned trilogy but returns to form as the titular mob assassin whose very mention irks jittery nerves from New York City cops to the Russian mafia and everyone in between. Mourning the untimely loss of his wife, Wick is brought out of retirement after crossing paths with his former mob employers. Not only do they steal his 1969 Mustang, they also kill his adorable puppy – a posthumous gift from his wife to ease her passing. Now what do they say about taunting a man with a short fuse and nothing to lose? With an arsenal of firearms at his disposal, Wick unleashes a bullet barrage and won't stop until mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his overindulged son Iosef (Alfie Allen) join the ascending body count.Although lacking a meaty story, Derek Kolstad's script might seem like yet another revenge film that glorifies characters with a 'particular set of skills'. Needless to say, characters with this skillset are on the rise and just recently we saw Denzel Washington open a can of whoop-ass in The Equalizer. Where John Wick differs is in its unapologetic approach as a violent revenge film with no room for dramatic twists and turns. This is also what makes the film fun to watch because all you have to do is take in the thickening layers of brutality following each wave of fluidly filmed fight scenes.With intense shootouts (a hefty dollop of which are gritty head shots) and close quarter brute force, the action rarely slows. If it does, it's during moments of straight-faced humour and Kolstad's strategic placement of supporting characters. Willem Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki play fellow assassins. One aids Wick while the other is contracted to kill him. In the neutral zone is Ian McShane who plays the owner of an upscale hotel that serves as a safe house for all assassins. It's a clever touch that says a little more about their profession and the unwritten code of ethics that goes with it. As an only perceivable downside, there isn't much emotion from anyone except Daisy the ill-fated dog. Then again, it's a snug fit for Reeves and the payoff is watching him live up to Wick's reputation of a stone cold killing machine. One scene even has Viggo reciting a verse that fables Wick as the bogyman himself. I'm thinking more along the lines of Keyser Söze in the flesh. Wick-ed indeed.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

The trailer looked like the type of movie I would immediately be turned off of (despite loving action movies). All I can say now is wow, I had fun in this movie, like 'edge of my seat shooting at the screen with my fingers' fun. If the hearting thumping adrenaline pumping electronica/metal soundtrack doesn't get you in the mood for mayhem, then you can just delight in the now 50 yr old Keanu Reeves ascending to the highest level of action star. Seriously, the movie is just him running around 2 hours shooting people in the face. Now a lot of people will be turned off by the sound of that, but that's basically all a revenge movie is. The plot synopsis is literally just 'Russians mess with a retired hit-man and he has to kill them all'. Don't hate it. Indulge in the gratuitous action. Eat popcorn to your hearts content (or until it leads to heart disease). I ain't afraid of no John Wick!Similar to The Equalizer a few weeks back, John Wick's strength as an action movie is that it excels in all things visual and technical. This movie is sleek, sexy and downright fun. The visuals are perfect for a high energy, high octane shoot-em-up and are complemented by a score that gets you pumped up for violence. On screen Reeves is supported by tremendous actors like Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick. Even the ""Mayhem"" guy makes an appearance. They all embrace that the fact that its just an action movie and the strength of the film is that it doesn't try and pander to the audience with some god awful message about morality or over-complicate the story.Visually I thought there were some pretty fun elements like the way the Russian subtitles were presented, and that all the stunts and special effects are meticulously crafted and choreographed. It looks and feels like a movie should where everyone knows the main character is a force to be reckoned with. Seriously, Wick just head- shots everything. Expect lots of violence and expect to be entertained. That's all you can truly hope for in a good action flick and yet John Wick adds that little extra bit of humor and style that set the standard for the genre in years to come.

At first, John Wick seems to be an outdated action movie. But then while watching it, it seems to be a never seen before action thriller. Without going much into the story line, I would like to emphasize on the movie's fresh look.Every rule that was used or created for a gangster or retired gangster movie (Especially, Carlito's way) has been renewed in this movie. The story line is simple on the paper but when it comes to writing screenplay for this movie, every old run must be broken and be redefined. And then the execution must have a lot of improvisations.Be it the entry of the protagonist, relationship with his murdered wife and the dog, the ending, everything is shown less than what we have already seen enough in previous films. The main focus has been put on the action part and everything else is shown as implicit part of action.The cause of the revenge is totally funny at times but has a fresh and serious look on the other side.Without Keanu, the movie would not even be justified. His screen presence makes the movie more than watchable. The screenplay and direction are brilliant. The music is loud at times but suits the theme of the movie.I would give 9 out of 10.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

It has a great cast with very serious and grim performances, while still being charming and intimidating. The film starts off with a very generic plot - ""mans wife dies, leaves a dog - home-invaders kills dog and steals car, man sets out to avenge the crimes."". 
Even though it had me bored for the first 10 minutes of plot-building, I got so immersed as soon as the action and dialogue started popping. The cinematography and style is so beautiful and different from other action films, which makes it a unique and fresh breath into the genre. The film is also filled with stunning performances from Reeves and the compelling antagonist - even a surprise performance from Willem Dafoe. One thing I noticed during the action, is the fact that the kamera-work has shy completely away from ""shaky-cam"", which is much harder to achieve and so pleasant to look at. It makes the action more tangible and easy to follow. Even though the plot is not really a new thing, it's unveiled and structured with such grace, that the only critique - is the simplicity of it all. But overall a really satisfying action-flick, that clearly blew me away.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was quite impressed by the group that attended the same screening as I did - everywhere I turned I could hear the same variation of ""oh it's a movie about a guy whose dog gets killed and then he goes to take revenge by killing a lot of people."" Sounds ludicrous I know. That's kind of the whole point though.John Wick is not a story-driven movie. It is, however, a fun and funny, action-driven cinematic ride. I knew exactly what kind of film I was going to see and I got that and so much more. John Wick is a badass (who also happens to have an impeccable sense of style), does not really say much (part of what makes him such a badass) but knows quite a few ways to get rid of the people he decides to get rid of.Guns, snipers, knives, things that go boom, fancy cars, a storm of violence interspersed with a few (intentional) laughter inducing moments. It's a movie that does not take itself seriously and does not expect its audience to either. It just gives you pure, unadulterated entertainment. Impressive supportive cast - it took me a while to recognize Michael Nyqvist (a Swedish actor) in a role of a Russian mobster. The parts of the dialogue that are in Russian are translated in an almost cartoonishly stylized manner that makes those scenes resemble a comic book more than a movie (I was half expecting to see text bubbles appearing).It's a phenomenal B-movie that introduces an interesting view of the criminal underworld - juxtaposing classy and crude, unwritten rules in a manner of ""honor among criminals"" I'd say. It is a ""testosterone in overdrive"" type of movie but one that I believe will appeal to women as well. (if for no other reason than because John Wick is so incredibly cool) I know I'm grateful that I got to see it on a big screen - I think it's the only way to truly immerse yourself in and appreciate all the long, uninterrupted film takes that will make you hold your breath.Need I even mention that I'd be thrilled beyond belief if there ends up being a sequel :)","9 out of 28 found this helpful.

What it does have is visual style and brilliantly staged action sequences, lent all the more physical impact by Reeves doing most of his own stunts.

Non-stop action from beginning to end. I'm not sure it even matters what it's about, but a retired and grieving assassin kicks back into action after the puppy his recently deceased wife gave him is stolen along with his pristine 1969 Mustang, not to mention when he is beaten to a pulp for no real reason whatsoever, but this man, John Wick, survives beatings, stabbings and just about anything else you want to do to him. Frequently. Keanu Reeves plays this character well as it requires all action and little acting. The blood and violence is unending and there is never a dull moment, but there are some unintentional laughs such as him being able to kill everyone imaginable in sight in this revenge bloodfest except for the one man he is actually after who is such an obvious target in their first confrontation scene running around in a towel. The bad guys also seem to have the same aiming problem getting Wick himself. However, this is not a film about logic. It's about action, violence and mayhem and it is relentless. I saw this when it was released nine years ago. With all the brouhaha about the third sequel, I thought I'd revisit this. I didn't remember a moment of it probably because it's more or less the same thing from beginning to end.

Certainly did not like his last string of movies. I decided to give John Wick (and more: Keanu Reeves) a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Though director Chad Stahelski sure knows his action flick clichés, the film doesn't fall for the trap of one dimensional characters and tries original takes on standard action movie situations. Well done. Furthermore, the movie is also saved by a carefully chosen cast and great supporting roles: small but humble roles played by former The Wire actors (Lance Reddick, Clarke Peters) and Willem Dafoe for once as a good guy makes sense. Michael Nyqvist does a great performance as sympathetic but evil bad guy boss Viggo Tarasov and Alfie Allen (singer Lilly Allen's brother and well known for his role as Theon Greyjoy) is the guy you love to hate Ioseph Tarasov.This stylish, cool movie is a perfect fit for Keanu Reeves, who's style of acting works best in movies where he doesn't have to show too much emotions. Didn't even notice his Californian 'Bill & Ted accent' this time around that ruined some movies for me in which he played (Much ado about Nothing for example: a surfer dude playing in a Shakespeare play)","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

If that sounds a touch silly, that's because it is, but this movie whole-heartedly embraces its bonkers premise and revels in presenting a genre film with tongue firmly in cheek. Screenwriter Derek Kolstad builds a semi-fantastical world where hit men (and hitwomen of course) have their own underworld currency, a special hotel sanctuary with doctors on site and a nightclub where hired killers can unwind, and, obviously, a guild who ensures the assassin moral code is upheld. This endearing self- awareness ensures John Wick is amusingly engaging between the numerous action sequences, which are, surprisingly, of an extremely high calibre. A blend of the economic gun-fu from Equilibrium and the close quarters krav maga made popular in the Bourne trilogy, the expertly choreographed fight scenes (tacked on finale excluded) are frenetic, exhilarating and joyously violent. Reeves is clearly having a blast playing the revenge driven yet cool-as-a-cucumber protagonist, whilst the rest of the cast – including Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, Michael Nyqvist and Alfie ""Theon Greyjoy from GoT"" Allen – do what they can with shared screen time; Palicki's arrogant hired gun shining brightest. A B-grade flick wrapped in A-grade style, John Wick is exceptionally enjoyable.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Problem is Reeves isn't known for playing this type of character and took away something from the film.However, since the film has got a cool plot to it, it's still pretty good even with Reeves as the lead. Reeves plays John Wick, the deadliest hit-man ever, that just so happens to be retired because he fell in love. Well, his wife died and left him a puppy. He encounters some punk Russian kid that wants his ride. Later the kid shows up, takes the ride, kills the dog, and beats up John. Well, he messed with the wrong guy. It just so happens the kid's mob dad was the guy John used to work for and now he wants revenge.What's cool in the movie is the whole hit-man code speech, the Continental hotel (where one doesn't do business), paying with these gold coins, and making a dinner reservation. The ending is where the film falls apart and just becomes another action flick with the ""hero"" out to get the final bad guy. It was rather silly, but the first 80 minutes was really good.FINAL VERDICT: Check it out, good story for action fans.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

John Wick is a great movie but it was geared towards providing entertainment value and not too heavy on trying to garner Academy votes. Simply put, this is the greatest action film of the year. That is a lot to say when you had Snowpiercer, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Edge of Tomorrow, and The Raid 2:Berandal all hitting the big screen before John Wick. What makes this film rather unique is not the storyline. There isn't much substance to the plot. John Wick kills well over 100 plus different people in this movie. That is not a spoiler by any means. But nobody expected Keanu Reeves to be cast as a retired assassin who must fuel his yearnings for vengeance with a fresh body count. The only other actor that could of played the title part for this movie is Chow Yun-Fat. I viewed this movie in IMAX and you can most certainly tell the film was not formatted for IMAX viewing in any way shape or form. Yet it just felt good to see John Wick conduct his own symphony of death on a bigger screen. The bottom line is that if you like John Woo action-style movies and enjoy a pretty high body count this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a movie to take a first date out on or treat the kids to this weekend you may want to reconsider. Sorry for not being very descriptive. I believe it's best to let you watch the relaunch of Keanu Reeve's film career with this deadly masterpiece on your own accord. You won't be disappointed.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Keanu Reeves plays a retired assassin who, after learning that his wife has died a sudden death, becomes victim to a rookie gang of Russian criminals who steal his car and then kill his dog. The gang soon realise they've picked on the wrong person as John Wick's reputation is well known in the criminal underworld and what follows is the unleashing of Wick as he wreaks revenge on those who committed the crime both efficiently and brutally.It's a simple premise where Reeves once again proves his action chops having scored big with the ground breaking Matrix franchise. Here he creates a cool, hard edged character set in a familiar yet stylised world who is aloof, unapologetically brutal and mesmerising to watch.With two directors at the helm, similar to The Matrix, John Wick delivers the goods and is a visually stunning film noir action thriller that goes for the jugular rather than wasting time on sub plots or exposition. The highlight of the movie for me was the thrilling nightclub sequence where Wick relentlessly goes on the rampage to seek out those who had ruined his life and serves up his own brand of cold blooded justice.With John Wick 4 hitting cinemas this year it has taken me 9 years to finally get around to watching the first movie and I can't wait to see what the sequels have in store. I've always been impressed by Keanu Reeves since I saw him become an action star in Speed (1994) and he is still doing his own physical stunts some 30 years later.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is doubly so for John Wick. First is the almost automatic comparison with The Equalizer. Another retired professional killer forced out of retirement into an all out collision with the Russian mob, (boy, are they once again the popular bad guys in town). Well, despite some obvious casting advantages the earlier release has over John Wick, mainly as far as the leading role is concerned, The final result is working in favor of John Wick. It's plot is much more believable than The Equalizer's, it's fight scenes are way more real, look less like a choreographed ballet and more like a fight to the death, in which both sides are drawing blood.The second comparison I feel that I must make goes a bit further back, all the way to Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven. Another man with a bad past coming back to avenge a seemingly minor crime, this time not hired but much more driven and there a few other similar plot twists which I can't discuss without adding a spoiler. Once again we have a film debating the nature of evil, and when is evil not really evil, and John Wick doesn't do too badly in this comparison as well. I must refer to Keanu Reeves shortcomings as an actor. His range is well known as limited but he usually has a flare for choosing the right roles for his abilities, he does exceptionally well here, despite some early wooden moments at the very beginning of the film. The rest of the cast is superlative, apart from Michael Nyqvist, who's delivery in English leaves a lot to be desired. Yes the language should sound foreign in his mouth, but the emotions should still be there, and they often felt forced too me. The rest is very well done, the pace, the cinematography, all were right on the spot for the film. A proof that action flicks can be thoughtful and emotionally true.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

Just thought it was another forgettable movie that will join the bargain bin in a few months. But after viewing the trailer, and hearing some of the reviews, I thought I should check it out and see whether the reviews and hype was genuine. I will say as a fan of action films this provided some solid adrenaline and non-stop action. Now in order to have such glorious and justifiable violence in a film, the main character needs to have motivation and something really bad happen to them. What would make a man more angry than having his prized car stolen and a dog given to him by his dead wife killed by ruthless gangsters! Enter John Wick and let the hell fire begin as he mows them down in a glorious rain of bullets and explosions. If there's an action film this year you can mention in the same breath as The Raid 2 it is John Wick (Sorry Expendables 3). It is definitely one of the more stylish, fun and original action movies I've seen in a while and reminded me of such classics as Equilibrium or the hyper-violent Hong Kong films like Hard Boiled or The Killer. Asides from the action, it has a solid supporting cast and I know Keanu may not be the best actor, but he has certainly improved from the old days and does a great job in this movie. Willem Dafoe is great as always and Adrianne Palicki also does great in her role. The directors did a great job staging and shooting the scenes and providing a solid environment for it to take place in. Overall, a solid and fun action packed film that will surely satisfy your blood lust for some Hard R action. This is definitely one of the best of 2014, up there with The Equalizer and The Raid 2. This movie rightfully so will stand as an action classic of this time. 8/10","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

If you are not a fan of gratuitous violence, blood and gore.....stop now, this film is not for you. However if you are a fan of the action/thriller genre with all of the above included the. I thoroughly recommend this film. Keanu Reeves has definitely matured, this film, although a little wandering at the beginning, was gripping stuff. Reeves plays John Wick, a professional hit-man who fell in love and retired. When everything is taken away from him he looks for revenge and with his reputation definitely preceding him, he systematically exacts revenge from those who must pay. This was set in New York, a city beautifully shot from above, at night, looking straight down. Wick's world is one with rules of it's own, and you just accept this story without wondering why the good citizens of New York are not getting their knickers in a twist about the bodies and car wrecks piling up. Elegantly written, these people simply do not exist and the story continues on regardless. It wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realised that the film was produced in part by Eva Longoria (of Desperate Housewives fame). Not everybody's cup of tea but I'd definitely raise another Earl Grey.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

He doesn't have super-human abilities, he does well, but not magically. His minor character development presents a person who you would believe could be real and who would respond the way he does in the film - though you don't really get to fully understand that until later.Best part (for me) is that consequences of actions are shown. I can't really explain that more without adding spoilers... so I won't, but by the end of the film it should make sense.Also, you can see a camera man or stage hand in one of the many many many many fight scenes - which is always a bonus.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Check. Actor who has lost his way with the public after a successful franchise? Check. Fun, entertaining and utterly badass? Double check. Don't let the trailers fool you into thinking this is in the vein of the bad slew of action films we have had recently with actors like Arnie, Sly Stallone and Liam Neeson trying to get back on form, John Wick actually succeeds in being everything it wants to be and everything its audience wants.. and Keanu Reeves kicks serious ass as the title character. Word of advice.. do not mess with John Wick.The plot follows John after the tragic death of his wife who leaves him a puppy as a last gift to help him cope with the loss and to make sure he isn't alone. When Russian mobsters try to buy his vintage car and he refuses they get mad and decide to kill his dog. This sets John off on a revenge rampage and brings him out of retirement to take out everyone who took everything from him. As a dog lover this was hard to watch, but seeing Keanu Reeves mow down rows of mobsters will never get old. This film could have easily been like other action films today with a mediocre plot stretched over 2 hours expecting to be loved. It knows what it is from the get go and after a slightly slow opening we are given a treat for action fans and a real guys film (not that women cant also enjoy this). Aside from Keanu Reeves, Willem Defoe is in this film. Recently it feels like Willem Defoe is still being used to throw in to minor roles in films for the sake of it.. but for him it works, so props for that. We recently saw him in both ""The Fault in our Stars"" and ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" but in both films whilst he could have been played by almost anyone.. he was significant and great like he was in John Wick. At first he almost felt like Jason Statham in Furious 7, popping up when he was needed to be a threat to the main character (which isn't such a bad thing) but he becomes more than this which was cool to see.But the show is very much Keanu Reeves own and he knows this. The dialogue was delivered well from him and whereas he was a badass in The Matrix.. in this film he was a million notches above Neo. Every action scene felt like a video game in the best way. The nightclub scene was particularly pulse- pounding and made me feel right in the moment. It is guaranteed that any scene featuring John Wick and a room full of bad guys is going to be beautifully stylised and absolutely absurd. I can see this being a nice, small franchise which could work way better than something like Taken and it would be cool to see John's back-story unravelled. In the end i enjoyed this movie a hell of a lot and for any fan of action movies this is a must see. Keanu has never been better.. Just never mess with his life. If he is anything like John Wick then i feel sorry for anyone that attempts it.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's an action thriller that starts with a jarring bang and never lets up. It's a modern-day western over-run by black hats. It's Refn's Drive, only faster, louder, funnier, and wilder. It's punchy and smooth, tough and violent, and refreshingly brash. It's also relatively straight-forward and by-the-numbersbut if you're gonna make a straight-forward, by-the numbers revenge thriller, take note: this is how you do it with hutzpah. Reeves plays a grieving husband whose wife, as her dying action, gets him a puppy to cope with the loss. When some Russian thugs break into his house to steal his car and kill his dog, he goes on a calculated killing spree to exact revenge. It's a corny, stupid premise that succeeds in part from Keanu's own personal history and the genuine sweetness in the dog-owner relationship. It's a fully formed universe of characters that we meet (the gangster hotel manager, the eccentric lobby boy, the good-natured dead-body clean-up crew) that nicely compliment the effectively awesome yet human Wick. Sure, there are moments of exploitation, and some may think it's just vengeance porn, but I disagree. The attitude of the film is pitch-perfect: it's an angry film that doesn't let its rage get in the way of its immense entertainment, and is never too serious for its own good. It perfectly balances the fast-loud with the slow-quiet. The non-linear storytelling, the sharp humor, and the portrayal of what happens between action scenes all give it a cool feel. Mindless entertainment? Maybebut when something's this excellent, who cares?","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

A short while after a gang approach Wick with the intention of purchasing his car. Wick refuses to sell the car and has a minor altercation with one gang member and promptly drives off. Later, the gang track Wick down, beat him up, and kill his dog. It turns out that Wick was a former employee of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) who is the father of the man who killed Wick's dog. When Tarasov gets wind that Wick is the man that's coming after his son, he does everything he can to defend himself against someone whom he knows is a formidable adversary.When I saw the premise for this film it reminded me of Revenge For Jolly - a truly awful film involving people getting revenge against someone for killing their dog. This put me off watching this film initially as I feared that this would be another awful 'dog-related' revenge film. Thankfully John Wick is a million times better than 'Revenge For Jolly' for several reasons..... Keanu Reeves plays the title character of John Wick and it seems that he was channelling Liam Neeson in the Taken films. Inevitably, Reeves suffers by comparison because he arguably lacks the screen presence that Neeson brings, but he is still effective here - although sometimes it is hard not to feel as though you're watching a poor man's Liam Neeson in a poor man's Taken. Even though it feels like a poor man's Taken it is still very enjoyable basically for the same reasons that Taken is a good film in that once it gets going it very rarely loses momentum guaranteeing that boredom will not set in.To me it felt like directors Chad Stahelski & David Leitch had watched a few Luc Besson films as the style and the fight choreography are very similar. It's fast and frenetic and both directors do well to get a credible performance from Reeves - he's not the most reliable of actors, but is actually quite good at being emotive here and screenwriter Derek Kolstad does a good job in setting the story up and getting some heart into the film.As with most action films you get the impression that action comes first and writing comes second as there are a few flaws within the script; for starters we don't learn much about Wick's former employers, nor do we learn much about what they're all about. I didn't really understand why they needed to steal his car at the start or what was going on at the place where they delivered his car to? Was it stolen to order? It also seemed contrived that the gang were able to find Wick after they left him - unless they followed him home???? So yes John Wick has its fair share of flaws and yes there isn't much in the way of originality here. However, if you're looking for a fairly fast-paced thriller with plenty of impressive action sequences then this is definitely worth your time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Orphic Hymn to Mars","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7188642/?ref_=tt_urv","Cineanalyst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1888886/?ref_=tt_urv","2 August 2021","It's not about a puppy. That's not the essence of the ""John Wick"" revenge myth. It's an abstraction; the wife wrote as much in the attached note with the gifted pet. The dog was all he had left of his late wife. Much like some obtuse entertainment critics, the mobsters don't grasp this concept. There's a bit of a pun at the center of all of this, too, for the word ""underworld,"" which relates to both the world of Russian gangsters and assassins and the afterlife in Greco-Roman mythology--plus New York. That the hotel concierge is named Charon, after the Hades psychopomp, and collects the gold-coin equivalent of obols rather gives it away. Thus, the canine represents the dead wife, John Wick is Orpheus--the action movie equivalent of a poet playing music and dancing with gun-fu--and he descends to, turns back to, the underworld in the vein of seeing or resurrecting his wife. Note the ending--part of which is also at the beginning--in this respect. It adds up, including seeing his wife via our technology of ghosts, motion pictures--the video on his phone. Neat, too, that the beginning frames the narrative as a sort of dream, as he collapses and closes his eyes, and we're not sure whether he's dead, unconscious or asleep, but regardless what follows is the memory, or revenge fantasy, of the events leading up to that point.""Orpheus and Eurydice"" seems to be the primary myth here, which may be surprisingly a common one in cinema. Personally, I prefer, for instance, the one with lesbians, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019), despite the absence of weaponry and automobiles, and there's also Jean Cocteau's Orphic trilogy and ""Black Orpheus"" (1959), among others. But, at least a couple other character names here suggest other myths. The wife is named Helen, as of Troy, whose death, to paraphrase Homer, launched the god of war (or devilish boogeyman) upon a thousand ships. Moreover, the name of John's friend Marcus suggests his devotion to that god of war, Mars. And, make what you will of the role of the Orthodox church as a bank lit ablaze, in the underworld.This is better than I thought it'd be, ""John Wick"" already being quite the famous movie that I thought I already had a fair assumption of a relatively unsophisticated shoot-'em-up, although it is that, too, to an extent. It's good to know what so many recent stylized brawling, gun pornos are cribbing these days. ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017), ""Hotel Artemis"" (2018), ""Polar"" (2019), ""Ava"" (2020), ""Nobody"" ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" (both 2021) are some of the claimed copycats in the wake of writer Derek Kolstad and directors Chad Staheiski and David Leitch's franchise. Not that ""John Wick"" owns a patent on any of this; indeed, it was released around the same time as twin film ""The Equalizer"" (2014), and the plot is reminiscent of ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), but some of the imitations are extremely blatant. The latter two released recently in 2021, one of which was also written by Kolstad, especially so. No secret is made of action-movie trends, particularly from the East--Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan--that inspired it, or Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns, or the root of all that in Akira Kurosawa samurai films. Most interesting methinks (maybe because some of my fondest memories of college involve classes on both subjects), though, in addition to the ancient-to-classical mythology, is the other significant genre this emulates, noir.It's not just the dark neon-noir look, although (some fairly standard color grading aside--lots of blue and a bit of orange and teal when its sunny--the usual) the commitment here is appreciated, especially that disco-slash-bathhouse, first, for being a disco and a bathhouse, and, second, for keeping the music and rave strobe lights going during a blood bath. Some of it has a comic-book or graphic-novel appearance, too, including those subtitles. But, it's also impressive how compatible are the mythology and noir, both fitting the trajectory of an oppressive, fated tragedy and the return of past demons. Both are otherworldly. We also get some of the more specific conventions or tropes of the genre. There's a bit of a femme fatale, who, indeed, complicates matters for John later on. The wake up calls, both land line and cellular. Plenty of drinking and smoking to go with the violence, of course. And, there's the soul-cleansing rain--seen both at the funeral and in the climactic showdown, as well as the tattoo-showing-off shower.Of course, one may just enjoy ""John Wick"" for the spectacular, well-shot fight choreography--and in some great locations. Besides the disco and the Continental, I also like those windows in Wick's home and the general suburban-to-urban dichotomy of the descent to the underworld. Keanu Reeves is in peak form, as well. Another case here of oft imitated but seldom equaled.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

He would probably be like John Wick, the eponymous former assassin of co-directors Chad Stahelski and the uncredited David Leitch's refreshing action movie, which puts coherency back into set-pieces and polishes its simplistic premise with buckets of style. There's a key scene in the middle of the movie where Wick sledge-hammers his way through the concrete floor of his basement to reveal a hoard of buried weapons. He is literally digging up his past, and is symbolic of the films refusal to have its protagonist brood over heavy themes and its willingness to simply let him get down to business.That business, unfortunately for a gang of Russian mobsters, is of a highly skilled assassin. Mourning the recent death of the woman he left his life of crime behind for, John Wick receives a puppy, who his wife arranged to be sent to him upon her death, At a gas station, the cocky Iosef (Alfie Allen) - the son of a mob boss - spots Wick's '69 Mustang, and when Wick refuses to sell, Iosef and his cronies break into his house, kill his dog, and leave him battered and bloodied. Iosef's father Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) finds out and begins to contemplate the inevitable - Wick's warpath of revenge and the death of his son. Taking residence at a hotel that caters for men of his ilk, Wick finds himself waste-deep in the life he thought he had left behind.There's a lot of joy to be had with the boldness of John Wick. Operatic, overblown and featuring a scene of Viggo muttering a tale of the boogeyman to himself in a room lit by a roaring fireplace, it transcends its straight-to-DVD plot with some outlandish and truly thrilling set-pieces. Free of shaky-cam and rapid editing, Wick shoots, stabs and strangles his way through an endless Russian hoard, and allows a flowing camera to capture his ass-kickery. Reeves is at his best when he says little, and he's virtually silent here, delivering a performance of endearing sullenness. It is by no means a great film - it's hampered by genre conventions and a wafer- thin plot - but you certainly get what you came in for.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Going in, I thought this was going to be another average, forgetful, one-time film just like most modern movies are, but boy, was I wrong. This movie restored my hope in action movies and broke the monotony that film industry has become for the last 3 - 4 years. I haven't watched a recent movie more than one time for the last three years at least, I watched John Wick 3 times on the other hand which really says something. The thing is that, now days, movies have become business, they have become overabundant and unmemorable, as soon as the movie is released hype dies away and the movie is forgotten, but John Wick finally did something different that reminded of good old times of early 2000's. This movie will be remembered like Collateral and other modern classics. The action is perfect, not to mention, the thing I loved the most is that the world John Wick created, the underworld/syndicate of John Wick is just so intriguing and interesting. Makes you want more, and it definitely made me want a sequel or a prequel. Keanu Reeves did an amazing job depicting the character. The background characters in this movie were also very well written in my opinion and I just love the fact about how revered John Wick is in the movie. The soundtrack is also really good. The movie itself may not be a masterpiece of the decade, but it is a great action flick with a lot of work and thought put into it. It's a hope for the movie industry. 9/10 because this really made me happy and filled me with hope. I rather watch 20 minutes of John Wick than watch another typical Marvel or a superhero brainwashing. Thank you, John Wick for restoring my hope in movies.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, I like him as an actor but he has a very narrow range in the roles he can accept. Either he plays the big, dumb doofus or he plays the loner of few words in those movies he can truly shine. And this has been shown time and time again. His dramatic roles? They tend to come off flat and stale. His attempts at accents? They tend to be terrible in every sense. But movies like ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", the first Matrix movie or this one and you can see what he's really capable of.John Wick is the story of a hit man who's left that life behind. He wanted out but things force him back into it and he does not go happily. He's described as a man of focus, commitment and singular will. He never fails a job. He never gives up. And he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil. He's that much of a badass. We catch glimpses of another world where assassins get contracts, where there's hotels and services that cater to these people and where everything is paid for using gold coins. It truly gives the feeling that this is a fully fleshed out universe with history, a code of conduct and it's something happening just under our noses without us knowing.The movie itself is a work of art. Whereas in a lot of action movies there's a lot of shaky cam work and quick cuts to hide the lack of skill of the actor, this one goes the opposite way and shows everything. There are long shots of John Wick doing his thing. There's fight choreography that is just beautiful to behold in it's brutality and execution. Keanu trained for this and it shows.When you get down to it, it's a revenge flick but one the likes of which you probably have never seen before. It's Keanu at his best and with luck he will continue to make movies like this in the future.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's almost a throw back to 80s and before fight flicks in this way.A simple revenge theme drives the film, and it suits Keanu's brooding persona well. The movie gets some decent acting chops from Alfie Allen and the late Michael Nyqvist, and a sly Willem Defoe, in fleshing out otherwise simply drawn and thinly written characters. Watch out also for a key character from 'The Wire' in a quietly scene stealing turn, whenever they're on screen.If you're looking for docu drama, and high realism, then take a pass. if you put the brain on 'get this' mode though for an old school pop corn fight flick, John Wick is definitely an entertaining few hours.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But John Wick from 2014 is one of my personal favorite action films of all time. It is bad-ass fast paced action revenge movie about a new kick-ass action hero one man army type. Directed was by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who both did well job done. The story, the action, the gun blaze action is all in here. Explosions heavy automatic weapons who are used well.The only thing I did not like are the characters not all, but some of the characters I did not like in here and I did not care for. One of the reasons is why I have enjoy the sequel much more it was more creative and passed than the original John Wick. The was made for 20 million budget in 2014 and made 40 million in the US. Keanu Reeves, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo, Willem Dafoe and Michael Nyqvist R.I.P. did a good job playing their characters.A retired assassin seeks vengeance against a mobster's son and his cronies for stealing his car and killing his puppy, a final gift from his deceased wife.This is a revenge film about retired professional lethal assassin who retired years ago with honor for his wife. He made impossible job for Russian Gangster to get out. His wife died by a disease after the funeral John received a present a beautiful puppy from his wife. When sadistic young Russian thugs senselessly attack John Wick and kill his puppy and the last hope of redemption. John bury his puppy and armed him self like an one man army as Schwarzenegger Commando and goes after bad guys like a pure bad-ass he is. He kills all hit-mans who try to take him out until he get's the mobster son.One of the best bad-ass action films of all time since 2014 the same time come out The Equalizer with Denzel Washington and that movie sucked I hated it. It was major disappointment John Wick proved it was no major disappointment but it was major improvement or lack of actions today. This movie was old school action with no shaky cam. So creativity in which in the movie is seen The Continental for members of the city's underworld. It is frequented by many hit-men and notorious murderers who live by code and rules in this hotel, if they break those rules, they die on horrible way and they are revoked. That is what I mean we see a world with assassins members who live in The Continental Hotel.Keanu Reeves become new kick-ass action hero on his own mission of vengeance. I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan I love this movie to death, I love Keanu's performance and also Keanu does not want the movie become a spin off or series. This movie should have three movies so that trilogy will end well. I support Keanu Reeves so much from The Matrix movies, Speed, Constantine, Street Kings and John Wick both of the films I love those movies to death.Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins was great villain as lethal assassin who was hired by Viggo Tarasov to kill John Wick that is one of the reasons why I love this film to death. The fight between Ms. Perkins and John Wick is bad-ass I love it. I love Ms. Perkins to death I love, love, love and admire Adrianne Palicki so much.John Leguizamo had a little role in the movie but I like him and Willem Dafoe plays a lot of characters villains such a Green Goblin / Norman Osborn in Spider-Man and John Geiger in Speed 2: Cruise Control. Most memorable to me is Sgt. Elias in Platoon (1986) who plays a good guy and in this movie he plays Marcus a retired assassin and a friend of John Wick who saves John Wicks life.I love the beautiful songs played in the movie Killing Strangers by Marilyn Manson feat Tyler Bates, In My Mind - M86 ft. Susie Q, Think by Kaleida, Who You Talkin' to Man? by Ciscandra Nostalghia it has beautiful songs in the movie I love. The movie has tons of action , multiple explosions and tons of bullets fired. The film wouldn't be an action movie without some action there is plenty of it. You see a lot of car chases and cars flying over cliff stunt-man is crazy driven a car in the movie.John Wick is about entertaining action about a world of assassins who lives by the rules of The Continental is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect. John Wick has the potential to be the next great action franchise. This is my personal favorite action film I would defiantly put between The Terminator and the Rambo movies. The original John Wick movie is a creative action revenge movie that goes beyond the limits. I wish we would get action movies like this more. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc in my collection.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

A seriously injured guy tumbles out. He starts watching a video of him with a woman.That takes us to the beginning in cut scenes. The guy was celebrating his anniversary with the woman who is ill. That night she collapses and dies in the hospital. The guy is devastated. Later he gets a delivery. It's a puppy. The woman arranged it to be sent to him once she dies, so he doesn't have to mourn alone.Next morning he goes for a drive in his classic Mustang with the puppy. At a gas station some Russian offers to buy the car. The guy refuses. The Russian doesn't take it too well. At night a bunch of masked guys break into the guy's house, kill the puppy, beat him up and steal the car. They take the car to a shop where the owner is outraged at the stupidity of the Russian. He known who the car belongs to. Then he gets a call from the Russian's father who's the big mobster. The shop owner tells him the son just stole John Wick's car.Now we learn from the mobster about John. He was the baddest unstoppable killing machine around till he retired when he met his wife. So he knows what's coming. His son doesn't get it and thinks he can do something about it. He sends an army to visit John at night. John dispatches them all and calls a specialized cleaning crew afterward. Now John unearths his gear, puts on a nice suit and checks into the Continental hotel--a safe house for hit men. There everyone thinks that John is back in business. He clarifies that it's just personal. The mobster puts a bounty on his head and that means that all the bad guys in town will go after him, including some at the safe house--which goes against the rules.John now goes after the son and eventually after the mobster father and later we return to the beginning.The trailer promised exhilarating action and the movie delivers. It's old-fashioned pistol action and athletic fisticuffs. If the title Bullet for the Head weren't taken it could have made an apt title for this movie as well, as John isn't just happy to empty a clip into some bad guy but has to finish things off by blowing their skulls open. It's R-rated action as it should be. When bloody action if filmed for PG-13 standards you end up with duds like the Taken sequels. It also has some original car action, not so much chases but cars used for shootouts. Cool stuff. Perhaps it goes a bit overboard in manipulating your emotions. It's not enough that the wife dies and that he's heart-broken, but they've got to kill the puppy and steal the cool car. But it was expected as dogs always end up dead in Hollywood movies. But while he's alive, the dog character and actor really do a solid job. The whole Russians as bad guys is getting a bit tired. Is it that hard to do something original in Hollywood?What is particularly interesting is the whole underground hit men culture. The safehouse/hotel, the rules, the cleaning crew and so on. Reeves is always likable even when all he does is shoot at people. But this movie has another thing going for it and that is Michael Nyqvist who is incapable of not giving a spectacular performance. You can just tell he gets a kick out of every role he plays. Looking forward to part 2.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

All in all, I would recommend this movie if you are still with sega-mega drive but if you have ever played a game called counter-strike, then you might consider this movie boring.

He makes other men shudder at the mere mention of his name and can kill people with anything he can get his hands on... and most times, just his hands. After some Russian thugs steal his car and kill the puppy given to him from his deceased wife, he takes it upon himself to return to the ""business"" he retired from and seek vengeance on those that wronged him and forced him back into what he wanted to get away from. That's it. Nothing more.The problem with the modern audience today is that they've been conditioned to accept gender identity politics and hugely massive character story arcs, to be told that they are terrible people for enjoying movies like John Wick and because it's an action movie that you aren't allowed to enjoy it. That's not saying character development and a deep-thinking story are a bad thing, but sometimes you just want to sit down with a snack and a drink and watch a movie that does nothing more than keep you entertained for two hours while you forget all the bad stuff in the world that is happening around you that you simply cannot change.It is nice to have a character that the enemy actually fears, even if they will do everything in their power to stop said character. It might be hard to imagine a single person able to do everything that Wick does, but you also believe Bruce Wayne can be Batman when he has no super powers, just trained very, very well. Action scenes are choreographed well and there is very minimal use of CG (I could tell a few scenes in the second movie). Any CG used in the movie is mainly to support the practical effects, not overtake it. You won't get people flying and laser blasts from eyes, everything has weight to it and everything bleeds. Though I do wonder about the validity of the repeated kidney punches after Wick takes some knife work to his abdomen, but I'll chalk that up to the adrenaline rushes.John Wick is an action movie, nothing more. It doesn't need deep, philosophical messages that question our very existence, who we are and where we're going, and it doesn't need extremely emotional characters that cry at the drop of a hat for no reason. They stole his car, killed his dog and forced him out of retirement of a life he no longer wanted. If the only thing you get out of this movie is the lack of social commentary and ""representation"", then you've completely missed the point of what the movie is supposed to be.Watch John Wick for what it is, an action movie. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Stahelski, Leitch & Kolstad not only made a very appealing action flick, but a great emotional story, that packs a big punch, that makes you truly care for Keanu Reeves' character.Keanu Reeves shines bright in this film, not only because he is the lead, or because of his stellar acting, but the fact he takes part in almost all of his action scenes! He steals every single scene he's in, and you can tell he had a blast doing it. As for the rest of the main supportive cast in Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe & Alfie Allen go, there prodigious acting went a long way, considering there come abouts was pretty random, and out of the wood works. I did appreciate the new story they bring along to flesh out everyone's character.The screenplay by Derek Kolstad was deep and intriguing, and essentially the leading hand behind everything. The dialogue he brings to the table is profoundly enjoyable.The action was shot, and executed super well! The hand to hand combat was unique and flowy, while the gun fights were so precise and energetic. The only real issue I had with the action, it seemed to be just a touch over done with plot armor, so it took away from the dramatic effect a little bit. Stahelski & Leitch did a good job of showing vulnerabilities throughout the action, to show that Reeves is just a man like everyone else, so it definitely helps the plot armor.The cinematography by Johnathan Sela is dull and quiet for the most part, but it works so well with the tone and mood. I wish the effects were done a little better, but that is just a little nitpick because it was tolerable nonetheless.Overall, this film is a ton of fun, backed up with some great action, and solid acting all around.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's necessary to contextualize this review by saying that my first viewing was marked by a feeling of alienation from the film. I didn't enter into the proposed dynamic, because I saw it from the wrong prism. John Wick should be seen as an action movie, which seeks to entertain with spectacular sequences and not looking for complex or even realistic plots, within a real world to the extent possible within the action genre.Well, now that I understand its mission, I think it's a very entertaining and fun film, with its own marked style that clearly differentiates it from other films within the same genre. A storyline that finds its foundation in something sentimental strong enough to wake a sleeping animal is what sets off an unprecedented massacre, courtesy of a relentless and unstoppable killer. There's a good dose of humor, always derived from the action itself, which is greatly appreciated to balance out the carnage a bit. Lastly, the overall performance of the cast falls with catlike cushioning within a simple, yet very dynamic script.I still think it's not a masterpiece or anything like that, but at least my opinion has changed, supported by a more open disposition to the cascade of bullets and blood that John Wick provides.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Performances are also great from everyone involved. I also adore the subtle lore of the underground assassin community. It's not in your face and half of the film isn't just exposition. The lore is presented in an organic way and it has some mystique to it, which is hard to find.

Finds some ounce of hope when all of sudden the son of Russian crime boss takes all that away from him and now he's seeks revenge. In many ways John Wick returns to that old formula of the 80s that made action film so popular. You have an absolute badass protagonist nicely choreographed fight, the sequences and intense high level action sequences. Everything from the music to the casting like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe are all great decisions. Keanu's always been man of such charisma and personality as a whole. Him as John captures that Stoic killer. The build up around John doesn't come off as simple fluff. Who he even while your never really given much on that outside the villain monologues. The way he presents himself with such seriousness from that he walks to the moment he does start killing it lives to the hype. The facts that everyone in that line of work seem to know him. The crime boss himself knows who John is in Mango's fears, and respect him regardless of his position The shootouts are amazing swift precision and foot movements mixed with the hand to hand combat leading to some brutal blows. It's not all played in a matter of being so of over the top that it takes you out of it. It captured that belief of a trained killer without having to going to far. It's not like he's invulnerable he gets cut and stabbed and tossed around. It makes the film more investing when you have that uncertainty that the lead might not make it out situation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have only seen the first John Wick movie and I´ve heard it only gets better from here or so you would hope so. I think John Wick is an influential action movie in the modern era. It started to challenge the terrible action in the 00´s and demanded more from what we expected a good action flick to do. It dared to stay in the action, dared to not cut all the time, dared to actually have a choreography and for that you have to be grateful of this movie. Is it perfect? Not at all, it´s a pretty cookie cutter movie, but what it set in the sea for the future of action is great and overall, you have a fun concept movie that no doubt will entertain you.After being attacked in his own home and having his life taken from him the hitman John Wick comes out of retirement to seek revenge.What this movie does best is it´s action. The different set pieces and execution is so thrilling and brutal. It reminds me of the old Hong Kong cinema with guns now. The idea of ""gun-fu"" comes to mind here. The primarily way of killing is these one-shot, one kill mentality that is so satisfying to see. Top that with an incredible choreography and you have a just stunning action movie. This movie doesn't cut all the time or has a lot of shaking camera, to hide the troubles' of shooting action, but dares to stay with the characters and not move. I think you can cut in an action scene; I think you can use a less stable camera to have effective action sequences, but this movie showed us in a modern setting the satisfaction of having these still cameras and long takes to have the most satisfying action sequences. Having a movie challenge a new norm is always incredible. Coming of just watching Kick-Ass (2010) that did not have the greatest action but from a director that also is going to produce incredible action later in his carrier, really makes you appreciate a just good action sequence.I have heard some critique about John Wick in terms of the movie going on longer than it needed to. Not really the runtime, but that John Wick the character is hyped so much up to be this unstoppable killing machine that it´s insane he gets' some stormtrooper aim and get´s overpowered a lot. The movie explains it away with him being rusty, but I also like the explanation that not all hitmen are specialized in everything. I see Wick as a close combat fighter and whenever he misses his target in the middle of the movie, they are always moving and further away, we see his more up close and personal with knifes and guns and having a character showing a different skill, Marcus, makes me think there is some merit to it, this theory is a bit botched later in the movie though but I still like to think there is some truth to it, maybe later movies are going to prove me wrong.The other aspect this movie does great is establishing lore without over explaining it. The continental and the hitman order is not overexplained and have a million lines dedicated to it, you just have to pick up context clues and build the rest of the world up yourself. The relationships and characters are all so well written because they have so much story to them without actually showing any, you can easily imagen how these people see John Wick, the hitman order, how the villain is, what happened in the past. It´s all greatly set up subtext that isn´t affecting the story in the best way possible, not wasting your time with too much chit chat and just going for a pure action experience.Sadly, the acting isn´t the best here, it can sometimes feel like too much of a cliché action movie in the best and worst way possible. The dialogue is cringe at times and there is not really any actor pulling off their characters a 100% This really hurts the overall experience in my opinion. Top that with some really over the top scenes and effects and you have a movie trying too hard at times. Keep it low key and you got it, trying to overdramatize and you have a bit of a weaker movie.I actually liked the score and soundtrack, even though it could be a bit on the nose and cliché at times. Overall, it works for the movie but just fades into some background noise and generic action flick music.This story is very cookie cutter and that helps it and hurts it. The movie can feel like it´s a bit too many empty calories since it´s nothing more than a simple revenge plot, a few fun interactions in between the next action set piece. The story and characters aren´t really that important, same with the overall relationships and characteristics of the characters, which weakens the impact of the movie to me. I just needed a bit more to really make it hit home.But overall, the impact this movie had on the action genre is great since it challenged the generic weak action slock that was dominating the 00´s. An era where you didn't have to try in terms of action, since no one really seemed to care too much. Now people expected a bit more from their action movies, they expected to go back to an era of stunts and practical care, where some sense of reality is actually a part of the movie. Sets have to be built, choreographies have to be learned and cameras have to be stable and dare to stay with the action. This is only a great thing this movie did!John Wick is a movie I really like but will never find amazing. I think it´s impact, action and overall concept is phenomenal, but everything else lessens the impact and make the movie a bit too generic. While it´s special in so many other ways, it falls into some classic action movie traps, that lessens the impact it was supposed to have.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Since then in order to get ready for the sequel, I re watched this and was generally surprised. This film has a feel of an old school 80-90's action flick using wide shots instead of shaky cam for the action and I love it, every action scene works to its advantage and showed how capable these directors are. Keanu Reeves is in my opinion an underrated actor that should get more respect, and I'm glad that he got a lot of praise for this film cause he deserves it. I don't want to shortchange the rest of the cast because they are also really good including Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Alfie Allen, Michael Nyquist, Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe and etc. Palicki and Nyquist are the biggest surprises to me especially since I wasn't a big fan of either of them, but they both surprised me in the end.In Conclusion, John Wick is of the best revenge films that I've seen in a while, this film and its sequel should be lessons to producers of Hollywood in how to make an action film and how they should make them from now on.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I asked him what it's all about. He simply said that it's about a ex-bad ass coming out of his retirement to kill other bad asses. Of course I wasn't that interested because this kind of plot has been done to death. Over the time I heard a lot about this movie and decided to watch it, and boy, this is truly one of the best action movies of the year.Keanu Reaves has done most of the stunts himself which has given the movie its realism. No action scene in the movie looks artificial, even the gun shooting scenes had a certain realism to it as you can see them reloading their guns at proper intervals.All in all this is an entertaining movie and specially a treat for the lovers of this genre and fans of Keanu Reeves. Don't expect many twists or shocking moments from the story as it is quite simple, but it doesn't matter because even if they have kept the plot simple, they have executed it to perfection.In the movie, there is scene where a character says, ""John Wick is man of focus, commitment and sheer will.""

I just remained asking ""where is the d**n story?""What you get presented with in this movie is a - up until the end still - flat character, who is taking revenge for the loss of his dog shortly after the death of his wife, who also gifted him the dog. So this John is described as a professional with amazing focus and at the same time with great inner rage, why he ends up going for his revenge no matter the consequences. But the movie doesn't succeed in delivering this believable character combining both these extremes. He sometimes is forgiving and other times scrupulous. It doesn't add up... It rather gave me the impression, that he is ""nice"" to people, so they can come again later and make the movie longer. But so is it on the other side with the ""bad"" guys, too. Why are they sometimes ""nice""? I couldn't understand.If you though look from the prospective of the storytelling, it makes sense. It delivers more movie-time! There are a couple of scenes, where it became very obvious, that whatever was going on was for the single reason of prolonging the (rather non-existent) story.What remains most prominent of all this watching time is seeing many head-shots of faces, you can't really make out enough to have some kind of emotional response, other than the excitement of the fighting itself.I liked the music though. It's fitting to the excitement of this one man offense.I hope with this you can better decide for yourself, if it's worth your time and money.","38 out of 81 found this helpful.

As many reviewers have said before at first glance the title John Wick for a film seemed ridiculous, therefore whenever the movie trailer came out as an advertisement on youtube i would straight away skip it. I did watch the trailer once and thought it was terrible, to me it made no sense at all. However one day i decided to watch it clearly because i had nothing else to watch or do at that time, and so my review begins. The last good and by good i mean really good action film i saw was Lone survivor but for me that a different category not really action. John Wick on the other hand is pure 100% action, no Expendables type of action no Fast and Furious type of action not even James Bond type of action, THIS is something else. First of all it clearly shows how well Keanu Reeves trained for this film i don't know if it was Kravmaga or something else but it was incredible well done and looked very realistic. Second of all the story is just very cool, i like the fact of how the hotel runs with important rules etc.. and Russian mafia i mean that makes it cool too. And just to finish the thriller part plays well in the story and how the actors act. Great movie for anyone who loves and knows how to appreciate a good action films.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

There are inconsistencies in his ability and it does stretch credibility that he can take severe beatings that then have no affect or even markings on him, but this is more of a cartoonish action movie than one you watch for realism.

It feels so original and fresh that you instantly get into all the fast actions sequences and the story (unlike most in it's genre) is quite great and easy to follow.Whilst John Wick isn't quite perfect, it adds all the ingredients for it to be the best action movie ever made. It almost pulls off the impossible, but a few touch ups here and there would have made this film one for the ages.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A really over the top action movie, enjoyed almost every bit of it. The adrenaline kept pumping as the movie progressed. Loved how the director managed to convey the emotions so seamlessly. A f...... Bad... Movie . Please fill the dots ( it was a positive response). The main character is kinda like the superhero that we all wanna see in a Hollywood movie. Even though at certain points i lost my concentration, the majority of the movie didn't loose my attention, some action scenes was 'no blink' challenge, if at all u blinked you loose all the action.
The direction was on point. I definitely have to praise the guy in bringing about emotions in such an intense action packed film and also in that restricted duration.
The cast, well only one guy needs to be appreciated and you know who that is.
The story, well there isn't much of a story. That might be a negative of the movie. The premise of super short.
Overall its a good movie","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

John Wick is a mostly well paced action film with many really awesome and intense action sequences that actually really surprised me. This film i feel just revived the action genre, well for me it did. It was so fun to watch while at the same time getting increasingly more interesting the more twists the film took. One thing i also loved was that once the action begins, it doesn't really take many breaks, it just keeps going with fight after fight and not one bit of action felt forced, it all made sense in terms of the plot. Lets talk about the plot, at first this movie seems like your average action film about someone who gets something taken from him and seeks revenge. But that quickly unfolds to reveal more and more secrets about who John Wick is and who the people he is hunting are. The movie felt like to me a perfect mix between 'Taken' and 'Hostel' making for a surprisingly awesome action film. In terms of the performances, i felt that everyone in this film portrayed their characters really well, in a way that felt pretty believable. But the most importantly, this felt like a real comeback to the action genre for Keanu Reeves, he was incredible in this movie, right from the beginning you are really backing his character and are cheering him on right to the end. I believe he can really take over from Liam Neeson and be the new face of badass action if only this film got the attention it deserved. The only issue i felt stood out was that the third act of the film although was still very entertaining and intense felt a little more rushed than the rest of the film. But other than that this film was a very pleasant surprise and restored my faith in the action genre. I love the world they set up in this film and cant wait for the sequel or any other films they decide to set within this world. - 8.1","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I hadn't expected much and after the first death I wasn't sure that I was going to like it at all.Keanu has never been an actor that I've ever regarded that highly. He always seems to be playing a permanently stoned teenager, which doesn't really translate to being an action hero and it's good that he doesn't say much here, because I think that's when he gives his best performances.However he was surprisingly good and the action fighter guy thing suited him. Other than Ted 'Theodore' Logan I think that this is probably his best role.I don't know why, but I also appreciated Michael Nyqvist in his role, he seemed quite effortless.And Ian McShane's cameo was enjoyable too, an interesting character that I hope reappears in the next two films.The dog was very cute as well, so the bad guys deserved everything they got.I liked the fight sequences and how the film was all put together. There was obviously some thought put in to the editing and story boarding in the first place and I liked the music that was appropriately used too. It worked really well to accompany a fairly rock and roll film.I also liked that it wasn't very long. It utilised a simple revenge storyline, that didn't need hours to explain and without it getting bogged down in complicated twists and turns and too much of the ""Whose side are they on"" idea.Overall a fun action film with an ease that so many others lack.666.77/1000.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ordinary, full of cliche, lack of aesthetic and far from a solid story.
Do we have to suppose that being heartbroken and agonised (film tells sources of these emotional accumulation in 2-3 minutes) is an enough motivation to kill numbers of men?

It had a generic story, good action, and Russians! ....for the like third time this year!! -It stars Keanu Reeves, who does a pretty good job actually! Everyone else is good, but Keanu is the best.-The tone is pretty generic and visually dark. The pace is good.-The music is pretty good too. Best action score of the war so far.-So one of the things I really liked was the action. Keanu doesn't completely overpower his enemies like Denzel, but at the same time he's a complete boss who gets the COD award for most headshots. Except when he needs to shoot then in the stomach to save time so he can shoot them in the head.-it's rated R for violence and it has some moderate language with it. It's not too bad and a lot of it is in subtitles though.-So John Wick is pretty good. It's a solid action movie and it's awesome. I will say it's worth seeing!

"7","/10","An excellent action film with involuntary humor and incredibly choreographed fight scenes help to coin a new (big) franchise of the genre","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5996769/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","15 August 2020","Amid different representatives in action cinema such as the franchises Mission Impossible and Jason Bourne, a new example of extreme quality appears in this field of productions. Action films in the style of ""one-man army"" have not had much space lately, and when they appear they are not always very interesting. It is a formula that does not seem to be as attractive as it was a few years ago. But sometimes it still proves that it has the capacity to surprise. John Wick is now in theaters and gives the genre another good breath, even though it doesn't have anything very innovative to present. With Taken (Unrelenting Search), in which Liam Neeson embodies his father ""with specific skills"" in the hunt for his kidnapped daughter, the subgenre had already resurfaced. But with Keanu Reeves' John Wick, cinema has gained a new icon.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) was once one of the most feared killers in New York City, working in partnership with the Russian mafia. One day, he decides to retire, and in this period he has to deal with the sad death of his wife. The victim of a serious illness, she was already predicting her own death, and gave her husband a dog to care for in her grieving period. However, a few days after the funeral, the dog is killed by thieves who steal his car. John Wick sets out to seek revenge on these men he already knew very well, and who stole the last symbol of the woman he loved.John Wick is a film fully aware of the many clichés of revenge stories and retired killers that it recycles. The film marks the debut of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch as directors after work as background directors and stunt coordinators - although Leitch is not credited in the film. Both, however, had already worked with Reeves as a stuntman in the The Matrix trilogy. Stahelski not only repeats the character's name but also reproduces the most varied commonplaces of the genre - in the hope that, in the repetition, this cinema and this mythical hero of his will come to life in John Wick.The script does not offer anything original, being a very simple argument to trigger the subsequent action scenes. What stands out is the construction of the character: John's fame thanks to his past achievements guarantees him a legendary status among all murderers and mobsters. His nickname of Baba Yaga, the boogeyman, may seem cliché, but it is quoted in a striking dialogue between the mafia boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), and his son Iosef (Alfie Allen) and shows how a seemingly calm man it can be so terrible.The simple and direct script does not diminish the superb execution and the excellent action scenes that are presented during the work. It is interesting to observe the escape that the script makes from the cliché scenario, of justifying revenge for the death of the wife, but doing so, in a redundant way, for the murder of an animal given by the deceased woman. This attribution of the human to something inhuman seems to be purposeful from the beginning, since, intelligently, it is the basis of all the satire contained in the narrative. After all, who sees as humanly or humanly as possible everything the prodigious characters of action cinema are capable of doing? In John Wick, Wick's dehumanization by his opponents and admirers is such that it blinds him in appearance. All there is is the myth, beautiful choreographies of struggle and yes, a lot of blood and even boldness, but nothing nearly as scary or intimidating as to justify the manifests of dread that we see on screen through Reeves' physique, totally opposite to the characteristic of the productions to which it refers.In addition, the work is extremely effective in creating its own universe. John Wick is not an isolated product. There are other people in the business, like Marcus (Willem Dafoe) and Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki). This underworld has its own currency and also a chain of hotels that provide specific services, managed by Winston (Ian McShane), in which it is forbidden to carry out missions. At a time when the film industry focuses on the creation of franchises, the unpretentious way that the film uses to sediment reality itself is admirable. Unlike other blockbusters, here the expansion of the plot is organic, so we want to know more details about its operation. However, more interested in the choreography of his man-to-man struggle with lightning in the background, and in his many shootings, John Wick is unable to see the implications of the things he recycles. He flirts with satire, treating this world of violence as a simulacrum (the hotel, the coins, the big cars), but ends up alienating it. The premise of this feature that satirizes the stereotype of the great killer of American cinema, which, alone, can handle armies (save Rambo and company), evokes this confusion between instinct, reason and emotion.The newcomers' approach to action scenes comes from their admiration for anime and martial arts films. Hong Kong's use of fighting choreographies and Hong Kong action cinema techniques were also influential in the production. Noteworthy is the tribute that John Wick pays for works such as The Killer by John Woo, Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samouraï by Jean-Pierre Melville, Point Blank by John Boorman and the spaghetti subgenre of the classic western films. David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, who bet on open plans and a more continuous edition during the action. The frantic camera movements and quick cuts that accompany fights - a technique widely used in order to give dynamism to the scenes while facilitating the filming of the action itself - give way to precise, calm filming. The action scenes represent one of the highlights of the film, maintaining a frantic and engaging pace and efficiently exploring the protagonist's skills. And it is impossible not to emphasize the stark contrast between the speed and objectivity that John demonstrates when he takes action and the almost apathetic way in which he first appears. It is as if the return to his old life gave him the gas he had lost after the tragedies he went through.Overall, the filmed action is extremely well elaborated and choreographed, with emphasis on the shooting sequence in the nightclub, the hand-to-hand fight in a room at the Continental hotel, the scene in which Wick coldly eliminates several Russian mafia gangsters in his automotive chase scene at the end of the plot. In addition, the Joel J. Richard and Tyler Bates soundtrack also has its good moments, effective in certain scenes of tension and knowing how to enjoy ambient songs - such as the contrasting cadenced and somewhat psychedelic theme during the sequence of an unrestrained fight by Wick in a nightclub.It is true, yes, that the actor demonstrates confidence, arrogance and uses catch phrases - in a performance, by the way, much more expressive than is customary for him - and the contrast between Reeves' appearance and his presence on camera only contributes to the creating even more hilarious situations. Thanks to this reinforced by the varied reactions of other characters to the killer, ranging from mystification, fear and exaggerated kindness, to passivity - especially the latter, which can be interpreted as a criticism of social inertia in the face of violence, when even an authority of the law prefers not interfere with Wick's actions. Michael Nyqvist also deserves due attention for his participation, as well as Willem Dafoe, and even Ian McShane in a simpler role. However, the spotlight is once again targeting Keanu Reeves, who naturally incorporates John Wick's dark and restrained personality.John Wick is not very different from today's cinema, with its fetish of violence that is extreme, but that does not leave marks, a normalized violence (""The neighbors are complaining about the noise, Mr. John Wick""). The film is not only exciting, but entertaining. The involvement of the plot and the absurd situations in which John is placed - as well as in all situations of the film that revolve around the fame that the character has among the murderers in the underworld - generates hilarious moments. Involuntary humor, however, natural, that captivates the viewer to embark more naturally on John Wick's vendetta and watch the hundreds of deaths that follow from then on. It is an excellent action film, with incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Still, its compelling storyline and solid cast performances help to coin a new (big) franchise of the genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's also stylish, high energy, and generally just a fun popcorn movie.""John Wick"" is a retired hitman who gets brought back into the life by a personal attack (no spoilers here, but if you're squeamish about animal cruelty, be warned). Okay, we've heard this story dozens of times.What's different is the world in which this takes place. There's a secret criminal underground that seems to have their hands in everything, and there's a specific code and honor among thieves. Actually, come to think of it, we never really meet anyone who isn't involved or in the know somehow, so it's implied that this society is very widespread and possibly runs everything. This film actually seems to have more in common with the ""Wanted"" comic book than the ""Wanted"" movie did.Part of the style and identification with the near superhuman Keanu Reeves as Wick is that he isn't a perfect action hero. He gets hurt. A lot. Unlike Neo, he's not invincible. He's simply very well trained and determined, which makes the combat sequences more interesting because, even though you know the outcome, there's always this little part in the back of your mind that wonders if he'll come out in one piece, making them gritty and...semi-realistic. Let's be honest, a lot of the action moves are very theatrical and wouldn't have much practical value in the real world.Given the implications for how big this criminal underworld probably is, it seems to have been set up to be a franchise from the start. From background characters like Ian McShane's Winston (who keeps referring to Wick as ""Jonathan"" even though the name is John; different spelling means it isn't a shortened version of his name) to Lance Reddick's hotel manager (who I would swear there is more going on with this character and hopefully gets explored later), there's a lot of ground to explore. It's not a smart or challenging film, but it is fun and not a bad way to spend a couple hours if you like action movies.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sadly, five years later his wife dies and he is overcome with grief. Anticipating the impact her death will have upon him, his wife makes one last secret arraignment and has a little puppy sent to him a few days after her funeral as a parting gift. Realizing the love behind the gift he immediately becomes attached it. However, one morning while walking down the stairs of his home he is hit on the head by a thug named ""Iosef Tarasov"" (Alfie Allen) and before losing consciousness watches as it is killed in front of him. Afterward, Iosef and two other hoodlums then steal his mint '69 Mustang and leave. That afternoon these same thugs take it to a body shop to sell but the owner recognizes who it belongs to and refuses to have anything to do with them. As it turns out, Iosef is the son of a Russian mob boss by the name of ""Viggo Tarasov"" (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes terribly upset at Iosef for what he has done and desperately attempts to make amends with John. Unfortunately, John refuses to talk and this results in Viggo sending a dozen men to kill him at his home. But John is waiting for them and none of them come back alive. And now it's his turn. At any rate, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed this particular movie and it kept me entertained from start to finish. I especially liked the performance of Keanu Reeves who essentially owned the role and provided a dominating presence throughout. In short, I thought this was a really good film and I have rated it accordingly.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that and this, his most recent action film, is definitely worth a watch for the visuals alone.John Wick (Reeves) is a retired assassin and hired gun, who has recently gone through an immense loss and is just getting back to his feet. Enter the son of a Russian mobster, young enough that he doesn't recognize this dark legend of the underworld. After an insult gone too far, John Wick once again feels the blood boiling within him and the rest of the film is pretty much nothing else but his one man war against the Russian mafia. And you know what? I don't really need anything else from the story. These kinds of revenge action films work because of their style and because of their characters. Sure, it's nice if the story has some surprising twists, but they don't really need it.In this case the movie definitely has style, bucket loads of it. The fight scenes are phenomenally well-shot, well-choreographed and well-executed. Especially the first few. The film also manages to build nice mythos around its world. Like the gold coins these assassins use to pay for everything, or the whole code of conduct they all seem to operate under. Wick is a legend in the underworld and it's great to see him casually nodding to other killers and having them lift their hats in return. Small things like that really deepen the world considerably and make it interesting to follow.Unfortunately, where the film falters a bit is the cast of characters. None of them are bad and most of them are played by talented actors, but they are pretty much text book as far as the writing goes. Stereotypical, failing to surprise and mainly there to move the plot from one action scene to another. Plus, while the actors are not bad by any means, none of them are what you would call A-list, with the exception of Reeves, and even he's a bit debatable nowadays. Well, okay, there's Willem Dafoe, but he's in a minor role.All in all John Wick is definitely worth a watch for all fans of action, especially if you're into the martial arts and gun-fu subgenres.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film editing maintains a tight and kinetic pace, seamlessly blending intense fight choreography with a straightforward narrative. While the music sets the mood for the relentless action, it may not be a standout element. The film's strength lies in its unapologetic dedication to well-executed action sequences and world-building within the criminal underworld. However, the weakness lies in a somewhat predictable plot that, while serviceable, doesn't add much depth to the genre. The cinematography captures the neon-soaked, atmospheric landscapes of a gritty underworld, providing a visually striking backdrop for John Wick's relentless pursuit. With a 6/10 rating, ""John Wick"" delivers on the promise of action-packed entertainment, even if it doesn't quite transcend the conventions of the genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thats where you are going through a course using a rifle, handgun, and shotgun. People are comparing it to Taken with Liam Nesson. I think it is a better movie then Taken. There is good acting not only from Keanu but also Alfie Allen (Theon from Game of Thrones), Michael Nyqvist, and Willem Dafoe.

If you're into shooting, killing or ""one man against the rest of the world"" then this is for you.

The plot is so weak, I think you hardly can call it a plot. It's rather a ""cause and effect"" thing. You did me harm, so I'm gonna do you harm too. That's it.What I liked the most about the movie was it's cinematography and style and that actually kept me watching until the end.

Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick's very emotional response to his wife's death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with ""no emotional nonsense"" is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an ""ordinary"" guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn't go into some silly ""oh should I really pull the trigger"" trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guyseventually that is.The plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pi--ed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.Keanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick's former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.Then of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it  so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.One thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pi--ed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or ""obligatory"" scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is ""the bad guys will pay"" all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pi--ed off.Needless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

You will remember that name! Ever since The Matrix left the theaters, people have been wondering if Keanu Reeves would make his return to the action world. After Man of Tai Chi came out last year people were wondering if the man in the black jacket was truly back, well I just came from seeing John Wick and to steal a line from the movie, ""ya, I'm thinking' he's back!"" You want the story, I'll spin it for you quick. It's been said that you don't mess with a man's car or his dog, well apparently, nobody told that to a young group of Russian mobsters who do so to the grief stricken John Wick. What the mobsters don't know is that although poor John might look like a scruffy nobody, he's actually a badass ex-assassin and his retribution is BA-HA-RUTAL! This is an action movie! like a REAL action movie! Not like those modern soldier/spy action movies. This is a straight up high octane muscle busting John Woo style shoot-em-up action movie! My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE kind of movie! It looks like Keanu is a little miffed that he wasn't called to be part of The Expendables team and in retaliation he made a badass movie of his own! The film is directed by stunt choreographers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski who, believe it or not, used to be stand-ins for Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving on The Matrix. Those two really know what they're doing because the cinematography in John Wick is clear, well shot and beautifully pieced together and the action is fluid, quick, incredibly violent but undeniably stylish and over the top which really makes it a lot of fun to watch. Plus, it exists in this interesting world of hit men and secret clubs and unspoken code that really pulls you in and makes you want to see more of what's REALLY going on behind the scenes. This is helped a lot by the movie's incredible cast which includes Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick and the mayhem guy from the Allstate commercials. It's the most fun I've had watching a ""one man one way"" movie in a good long while and if you're a fan of movies like Equilibrium or Hard Boiled or really any John Woo film at all, you'll love this! Have a dude's night with the guys you used to watched Jet Li, Steven Segal and Chow Yun-Fat movies with and SEE THIS MOVIE!

We have seen many action films in the past years but John Wick delivers and standouts due to its level of non-stop action and the way the action is being brought upon us. There have been plenty of action films with characters such as John Wick- highly secretive hit- man/detectives that play it cool, but in this film we see Keanu Reeves really play the part perfectly.Like most films, especially like he Equalizer- another 2014 action film, this film has a great set up and it builds the suspension, but as the film gets past half way, it really does become a great entertaining ride. Like many, the action is a serious tone and it works well. The sequel will be very anticipated, and we all hope it delivers. Keep a steady eye out for it. We all know it will come upon us quickly.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

John Wick is your basic shoot em up that doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what makes it average. You know what you're getting from the start and you get a lot of it.There are some interesting characters (Marcus, Ms. Perkins) but for the most part you know what's going to happen to everyone, except maybe John Wick. You can sit through it but the stylized violence starts to repeat itself over and over and by the end you kind of lose interest.","48 out of 107 found this helpful.

And whoever isn't terrified doesn't mean that they're better, it just means that they don't know JOHN WICK.It definitely isn't the first character of it's kind, but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they are supposed to be. Let's just say that John Wick kicks a** and he is pretty awesome at that.I can't think of anyone else to be John Wick other than Keanu Reeves, the guy's living the character on screen. The hand to hand combat, usage of knives and guns, the action, it all seems poetic at times. The thing I loved the most is that there wasn't too much noise, no Boom Boom, just the Bang Bang, exactly what you'd expect from a hit-man.The cinematography, dialogues, background score, direction, action, everything was just what a movie like this needs. It ticked all the right boxes for me and I think every action movie fan would lap this one up.It is a great action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout it's course. So, everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen, or to quote it better, say hitting just the right spots, go treat yourself to this movie. You'd be glad.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

What if you cut everything that the movie didn't need - the love interest, the convoluted plot, and the moralizing? What's left is a pure action movie without anything it doesn't need. They knew people liked choreographed action sequences and they filled the movie with plenty of them. In subtle ways, it makes advances in the genre. For example, notice how characters react when they hear the name - ""John Wick."" They're instantly terrified. The one thing that I wanted that the film didn't give me was something truly original. Unlike The Matrix or Inception which really changed action movies, this movie doesn't.

Even if i swallow the fact that Mr. Wick is doing impossible things during the entire film, the story about an ex hit-man that goes back in business for revenge is so thin, that it could have been told in 10 minutes instead of two hours. All the movie shows is a thousand ways how to kill someone, nothing else basically. Although nicely filmed, it's a big pointless yawn in the end. Keanu Reeves does his acting job much much better in the Matrix, and The action parts there are much more enjoyable. Waste your time on something with brains behind it.

"9","/10","""John Wick"" takes all the clichés of this kind of story and turns them into gold","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3669116/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","23 March 2017","In theory, ""John Wick"" shouldn't work. It's ""Taken"" with Keanu Reeves. It's the ""let's create a middle-aged action hero with unrivaled skills whose first name starts with J"" formula. And yet, director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad take the very best of that formula and elevate it into art – undoubtedly one of the best American-made pure action movies of the 21st century.Keanu Reeves fits so effortlessly into this story as John Wick, a former hit-man who has just lost his wife to an illness. After having a random encounter with the son of a crime lord he once worked for, the young man decides to target Wick and attacks him in his home. More significantly, he commits one particular crime that pushes Wick over the emotional brink and back into the criminally underbelly from which he thought he'd walked away forever. The emotional plot device that launches this story out of canon might seem a little cheap, but it works powerfully well. In a way, Kolstad knows that we know the ""retired hero steps back into the ring"" trope so well, that he manipulates it to his advantage. We get behind our new anti-hero in a heartbeat. The cherry on that sundae comes in a one- word line of dialogue from crime lord Vigo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) when learns just who his son (Alfie Allen) has messed with: ""Oh.""The body of the film is R-rated bloody mayhem that combines martial arts with a shoot 'em up style, which results in a surprisingly satisfying combination punctuated by a plethora of kill shots to the head, a phrase I never thought I'd use in a movie review. The sound effects and spraying blood dust echo video game sequences; in fact, there's a scene in which Wick assaults a safe house that's cut with a guy in the safe house playing a first-person shooter game. It's a nice, well-executed and majorly self-aware juxtaposition.Stahelski also brings a graphic novel aesthetic to the film. There's a lot of careful shot composition and a dark color palette with different colored hues. The way he stitches together two scenes -- one of Vigo lecturing his son about his terrible mistake and the other of Wick going into his basement to dig up the weapons he's buried – has a distinct comic book vibe.Reeves has the perfect amount of quiet, determined menace to bring the part to life, but ""John Wick"" also drew some impressive talent in other venerated actors between Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane. They lend so much legitimacy to the criminal fantasy world of ""The Hotel.""If all that weren't enough, the script does circle around some ideas about whether a person can change. As much forward thrust as the opening scenes give this film, Kolstad doesn't settle with it. It digs a little deeper into what really motivated John to get back in the business and proposes it might have been inevitable.""John Wick"" is a successful combination of style and storytelling, and it really elevates the very basic genre-level appeal of this type of action movie. It's unusual for a movie to be one of the last ones to the party (this party being all the films about middle-aged assassins seeking revenge) and be the one to make the biggest impression. That's the sign of a great action movie.~Steven CThanks for reading. Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I do tend to skim over pocket-knife fighting scenes but I hardly think that affected my viewing experience. Nothing overly symbolic stood out for me in this movie other than the significant use of blue tones; I did like how in one scene red tones were heavily contrasted with it as it kept things a little more visually interesting. There was alot of hand-to-hand contact action but it wasn't shot as closely as usual so it seemed a little bulky at times.

Very soon, those that have wronged him learn very fast that they have made a grave mistake.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a retired hit-man living the simple life with his puppy Daisy that was given to him to cope with the loss of his wife Helen (Bridget Moynihan) who passed away following a terminal illness. John Wick is left for dead following an encounter with a group of Russian mobsters led by the arrogant and selfish Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) who also rob him of his prized vintage 1969 Ford Mustang and brutally kill Daisy. Swearing vengeance, John Wick digs out his arsenal of weapons to leave no stone unturned in New York City to track down Iosef who is also the son of the feared Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). It goes without saying that the bullets fly fast and anyone who stands in the way of John Wick are quickly dispatched. Former allies and enemies are also revisited to help or hinder John Wick's quest for revenge including Aurelio (John Leguizamo), Marcus (Willem Dafoe), Winston (Ian McShane), Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), and Harry (Clarke Peters).Keanu Reeves has always been a likable actor and he has always been a pleasure to watch in a wide variety of memorable films such as Point Break (1991), Little Buddha (1993), Speed (1994), The Devil's Advocate (1997) and The Matrix (1999). Although some of his other films can be hit-and-miss, John Wick launches him back to the big time doing what he does best. Although Keanu Reeves was 49 years of age at the time of filming, he puts a lot of younger actors to shame doing his own stunts and embarking on a physical regime of martial arts and weapons training. Check out the clip on YouTube where Keanu Reeves brilliantly showcases his marksmanship abilities on the gun range.The supporting cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe do well in their respective roles but it is Keanu Reeves who is the main star of the movie who shines very well in the titular role.The stylish slam bang action packed entertainment does not stop from start to finish and it's good to see Keanu Reeves return for the sequel just released in 2017.Action fans should not miss this one. Fans of Keanu Reeves will definitely get a thrill out of John Wick. Sit back and enjoy the fun.9/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In particular he has a hard time to properly express emotions and that is one of the flaws in this movie as well as there are some situations where he should have shown genuine rage but he does quite a poor job in doing that.However, he does OK as a former hit-man in this Equalizer type of movie and for once it is not over a girl, well not directly anyway, but rather about a dog and a car. That does sound a bit weird but seeing as Keanu is supposed to play a cold- blooded hit-man who killed people for the smallest slight, it does feel believable that he goes on a rampage over it. Specially when you learn what that dog meant to him.But, as Keanu's lack of acting skills are apparent, it is more than enough made up by the mobster boss Michael Nyqvist. He has really intense duologue's with both his son, played by Game of Thrones star Alfie Allen, who also plays his role really well and later on a dialogue with Keanu Reeves which was well played as well.Other than that, there are some stupid Hollywood moments, such as the ending and the token strong-woman character (another hit-man in this case) who does not add much to the movie and exaggerated action scenes as well as the ""bad guy"" being too stupid to finish things off when he could. But overall I enjoyed this movie. It has a good mix of action, intensity and with some drama thrown in and a really nice supporting role played by the excellent Willem Dafoe and small, but equally excellent efforts, by John Leguizamo and Lance Reddick.Warmly recommended but don't take it too seriously.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

The more you watch of a certain genre, the more picky you get. Well at least me. Most movies are just OK. That's the sad truth. Most movies are neither horrible nor excellent.Then along comes John Wick, pretty much from the first second I just liked it. The atmosphere is great. Keany Reeves is great. It's crisp, it doesn't waste your time. Normally a movie might start real good, then dip down. Or a movie starts badly, then gets better. John Wick starts excellent, and it just doesn't let up. Every scene is good. I love animals. (I don't even eat them! :P ) And if you love animals, this movie is such a treat. Man oh man. I have been waiting for a movie like this, for I don't know how long.This movie has more head shots than the combined history of Call of Duty. OK, maybe not that many, but a crap-load for sure.It is violent. The action direction is superb. But one of the best things about it, which makes it so damn efficient, is that the build-up is so darn awesome. They do all the right things to get you to understand what kind of ultra bad-ass John Wick is. It is so expertly done, by the actors, the reactions, the direction.I've seen naysayers complain about the lack of ""originality"" or whatever in John Wick, and I'm just sick to freaking death of hearing that. If you want originality, do something else than watch movies, because originality has nothing to do with whether a movie is great or not. If the movie is well made and entertaining, it is good. And John Wick is just about as well made and entertaining as action movies get.Watch it, and if you don't like it, you're to blame, not John Wick.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The story is about a retired well known hitman whose dog is killed by some Russian gangsters and he takes the revenge of it becoz that dog was gifted by his wife to coop up with lonliness after she passed on so he takes the revenge.The one thing i like the most about the film is its style and action sequences that looks brtual , intense and realistic involving mostly gun fights .
The fighting choreography is done very well becoz it is not very chopoy like in other films it is shown in a continuous tone.Overall a great popcorn movie to watch for timepass in a free time","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a name closely associated with career defining roles and missed opportunities. He has had some of the top fan favorite roles and cultural icons over the last twenty five years. From Neo (The Matrix Trilogy), to Ted (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), John Constantine (Constantine) to Jack Traven (Speed). He has been a part of science fiction remakes (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Expiramental Animation (A Scanner Darkly) and Horror (Bram Stoker's Dracula).Mr. Reeves has shown an acting range from the dramatic, comedy and physical action. Though he has had a tremendous career his characters have tended to flat and a little unbelievable.Sure he proved in Speed that he could be an ""action star"", in The Watcher that he could be creepy and could handle lead acting duties in a franchise with The Matrices though his roles had become diminished over the last five years. Though his performances have never been bad, the expectations that surround him have always been out of reach. Then came John Wick.As of late, Mr. Reeves has begun a comeback of sorts. The phrase ""of sorts"" is used as his comeback is not finished yet. It started with Man of Tai Chi and 47 Ronin and has continued into John Wick. It has the feel of a role that is perfect for Mr. Reeves' acting abilities. John Wick is a character who is dark and brooding. The character is not put into a position where he would express happiness. He is angry, sad, and on the verge of grief throughout the film. Mr. Reeves' ability to perform choreographed action scenes is put on display here. These range from intense fighting scenes to wonderfully choreographed shootouts to elaborate set pieces that border extravagant but don't cross the line.Several times throughout the film the fight scenes are set up in a manner that allow Mr. Reeves to perform in a flawless manner. This is done by letting the camera roll. As opposed to the standard practice constant cuts during filming and letting the editors piece together a fight scene, the director of John Wick keeps the camera rolling and allows the audience to experience John Wick's physical struggle and exhaustion. These are not simple fight scenes either. In a couple of instances the actors are having to perform dozens of physical moves while the camera demands perfection. Mr. Reeves not only succeeds at this but also helps to show the believability that he is capable of in the right circumstances.One can only hope that this movie will continue to place Mr. Reeves in strong roles that he is more than capable of continuing to play. It is a definite treat to see Mr. Reeves at his best again.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It took me forever to watch it, but now I am happy to report that I have viewed the film so now I can return the copy back to my parents. It turned out to be a rather good action movie as well kind of in the same vein as the Punisher films and the film Dredd. Lots of action, a lot of bloody action that is. This film is almost non stop action as the set up of this film is very brief before it introduces us to John Wick's dark side and the insane criminal world he lives in. Granted, it seems as if this film was based on something as there were a lot of rules in this criminal world that seemed almost like we, as the viewer should already know, but I do not believe it was based on a book or graphic novel.The film starts out with John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) looking in rather rough condition and then we spend the rest of the film finding out what happened to put him in the place he is. His wife recently passed and after a very unfortunate turn of bad luck and timing he must go after some people that have wronged him. He will have to take on former allies as he wages a one man war against the head of a criminal family.Keanu Reeves does a good job as the title character and he apparently put a lot of work in training wise to play the man with special skills. The other cast members do a good job too, but the only other recognizable ones were only in the film for brief periods. I thought the film was going to be devoid of humor, but it had some moments here and there as it was funny to see how quickly people were to let John Wick off the hook as they had no urge to cross him.So all in all a good film as it was a bit of a super violent action flick...something the last Expendable film failed to be. It did not hold back on the violence, but I am a bit surprised that there was no nudity as I was sure there was going to be some in the couple of clubs that John came across. It does use computer blood, unfortunately, as it seems they must use computers for even some of the most basic special effects these days. However, my complaints are few as this one kept me entertained throughout.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Let me start by saying, nothing in this movie disappoints. The premise is ridiculous, the flick knows it's off the rails, and what makes it work is that it simply does not care what you think. The people behind the revenge picture might as well have added a disclaimer that reads: ""Sit down. Shut up. Enjoy."" And with that being said, (Holy Body Count!) was this a non-stop Funfest. (Even my Lady liked it. That's saying something.)John Wick (Reeves) starts off as a sympathetically stoic widower having a tough time dealing with the loss of his ailing wife (Moynahan). Keeping to himself, very little is given about his back-story, other than he has a sweet ass car and an adorable new puppy. At times the opening feels like they were going for the sappy levels we succumbed to in the gut wrenchingly somber intro of Up (2009). But that all comes to a screeching halt once the son of a Russian mob boss (Allen) takes an unhealthy interest in Wick's car while filling up at a gas station (Word to the wise, don't mess with another man's ride.). After breaking into his home and stealing (amongst other horrific acts) the beloved vehicle, much (MUCH) more is of Wick's past life slowly simmers to the surface and eventually leads to an all out boil-over of who this relatively quiet man truly was. And it just keeps getting better from there.This movie was drag out, blood and guts, slam-bam (add more silly terms at your leisure) from the end of Act One on and it doesn't let up until the final shot. Normally, this can be tedious and ineffective, but the world that opens up to the viewer is so well crafted that it leaves the audience clamoring for more. The supporting cast is amazing as well, dropping familiar faces into this gumbo of awesome at a steady, but not over saturated, pace. Rough, gritty, and self aware of it's coo-coo bananas plot, the filmmakers put together a production that comes with a slick polish all the while throwing everything they could at the screen without apology. I haven't seen a movie this confident in a crazy premise since Jason Statham ran amok in Crank (2006)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm an action-movie fan. I grew up in the Arnie/Sly era of the eighties and I have plenty of mindless action flicks in my DVD collection – everything from 'Commando' to the mode recent 'Shoot 'em Up' pleases me to a degree and Keanu Reeves pops up a fair times in my watchlist. However, somehow his film where he plays the titular 'John Wick' slipped past me. I've only just seen it after its sequel was released and, during that time, I've seen many a positive review saying how great it was. Therefore, by the time I got round to watching it, my hopes were high.I guess what happened is the reverse of when I watched 'Sex Tape' and the big screen adaptation of 'The Dukes of Hazzard.' Both had been absolutely slated by the critics so my expectations were suitably lowered by the time I saw them. And, weirdly enough, I actually took some small amount of entertainment in both! I'm not saying either were particularly good, but enjoyable enough if you were in the right mood. This time, my hopes were so high, I found that what I got didn't really live up to what I was expecting. I was waiting for something truly revolutionary and different from anything I'd seen before. What I got felt like just another action movie.Don't get me wrong – it's not bad. It was enjoyable enough, but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before. John Wick is a retired hit-man who's forced out of retirement when a baddie (played by 'Game of Throne's' Alfie Allen) kills his dog. Yes, that's basically the catalyst and motivation for the entire film. What follows is your average (and I deliberately use the word 'average') roller-coaster of violence and revenge. Everything you'd expect is there: gunfights are plentiful, there's at least one car chase, a betrayal and eventually Wick comes face to face with the evil head honcho. So it's all there. And it's well done. The violence (and there is violence – no PG13 here!) is believable and gritty and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch (even when he's trying to be moody and miserable he's still that long-haired 'bogus' surfer-dude we all fell in love with back in the early nineties). So, I can see how there's much going for it. I was just expecting more. And that's a shame really because my hopes were so high that, even though everything I like was – technically – there, I still came away with the feeling like it wasn't that much of a big deal. But, like I said earlier, a sequel has been made and I will definitely watch that, too.At the end of the day, this film may not have entirely clicked with me, but I'm glad that Keanu Reeves is back in a decent franchise and it puts him back in the spotlight – maybe John Wick can team up with Liam Neeson in a Wick/Taken crossover? ;o)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is one of the best action/drama films of all time! Add to this little gem an amazing story that puts you right there in front of all the tension. Incredible directing, cinematography, choreography, editing, sound and perfectly cast. Keanu Reeves was legendary for the Matrix. He is now legendary for John Wick.

Sure Keanu is cool, some times, and so is Mr Dafoe. But what about the rest? What about the story? This isn't a sci-fi or fantasy movie where Keanu seems to pick good ones.So, what is this movie? It's a 2010s version of a 1980s revenge/action movie. It gets bloody soon enough and stays that way till the end. You are not going to have much to ""think"" about. In fact the only thing I would constantly do while watching this was smiling with satisfaction for the action I was watching in a movie. What was more impressive about it, was that at no point it felt boring, as many action movies do even when they have lots of...action. Probably unnecessary warning, but, this is not for the young ones. It gets VERY violent and graphic, all the time. I rarely place a movie in my favorite list, especially if it is an action movie, but oh my this is one good solid entertainment piece!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I love a good action thriller, the Bourne franchise blew me away and set the action thriller bar far higher as a result of its originality and success. HOWEVER...............Mr.Reeves was his usual unemotional, wooden, B-Lister self; the plot line was the basic 'revenge' story used a thousand times before without one jot of its own originality. I figure the producers want the (obviously planned for) sequel to better 'part 1', it won't be hard to do.Thick gangster, even stupider gangster, muscle gangster, gangster gangster and top gangster's psycho son make an appearance - just to keep the clichés coming. Many, many guns, many, many choreographed 'fight' scenes, but not much else.The lavish budget looked to have been plowed into amazing sets, rare muscle cars and designer wear for a myriad of extras (and probably some freebies for most of the critics, or how else did it get 'good' reviews?!). I stayed as long as i could hoping things would improve, they didn't; so 1 hour 10 minutes in I had to admit it was totally pants and left the cinema feeling ripped off and cursing every teen reviewer on here. I still don't know how it ended, and I don't care. But let me guess........ Against all adversity and many lethal obstacles John Wick finally gets his revenge at great personal cost, many bloody injuries and sacrifice, but at least he avenges his dog, probably with an almost funny one liner as the cherry on top. Am I right? Go and watch anything but this, even a mindless frat movie would be more intelligent and entertaining.TO THE MANY 'POSITIVE' REVIEWS ON HERE - WHEN YOU GROW UP MAYBE YOU WILL LEARN WHAT A GOOD FILM LOOKS LIKE?","26 out of 54 found this helpful.

The movie story is nothing great, pretty basic, as is the case with most of the action movies. Keanu Reeves is fantastic though, you start feeling for him right from the start. Alfie Allen is brutal and you sort of start hating him right from his entrance.
The action is riveting, specifically the pistol action. There are a few funny moments in the movie too. Overall a good entertainer, and a must watch if you like action movies or sort of starting to watch action movies. Plus point is that its a short duration movie, approximately 100 mins, which I guess is apt for action movies with basic storyline because not many people can take action for more than 2hrs !!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He is quite talented actor, and I believe he did some really good titles. The problem he has in this film is the scenario I guess. There is not much part from ""go kill some poor fellows"". He all of sudden (obviously, there was a trigger for this) he went from a pensioner to killing spray machine... similar to the Matrix.Obviously he sometimes got wounds... otherwise it would have been a lower rate from me, no matter how fond I am to him (since the time he played Neo the chosen one in the Matrix).In a sum - my rating is a bit higher than it should, if you like action, shooting and blood - you may like it. There is a story but it is not yet developed - hope they would be better in chapter two.

They rush a lot of parts of the movie in the last 40 minutes in order to try to finish the arcs of all of the other characters. Basically the first hour Is a perfect action movie that completely refreshed the genre from poorly choreographed fights with actors who couldn't do stunts to well choreographed gun-fu and hand to hand combat with limited cuts.

Whom ever said Keanu reeves could carry and action movie alone LIED This movie has some major plot holes, along with some serious bad acting. *********************Warning spoiler******************************* It all starts with the same guys whom harass him at a gastation, breaks into he's home kick he's ass, kills he's dog and steals he's car. You never get to know how they found him, without knowing that john wicker is the guy you don't mess with. Even though he's car is apparently legendary,since what I assume is the best car chopper in town, won't touch it cause he knows who it belongs to.Another thing that struck me odd is, since when did the Russian mob do home invasion, just to steal a classic car to chop. To me that seem kind of petty for a organized crime syndicateJohn is suppose to be a professional hit man, the best of the best, cream of the crop. Yet he get he's ass kicked by a couple of thugs, wastes a lot of ammo by shooting people 5-6 times. He can't even take out 5-6 guys with a machine gun, and a 30 round clip. Not even when he has the element of surprise on he's side And the hand to hand combat is mostly bad. He got no style, no class, no elegance over it. I almost feel I'm watching American ninja all over again, were hand to hand fighting mostly consisted,of judo throws,wide punches and a few simple locking techniques.That's how bad this movie is. Every bad guy in the Russian mob seem to knows martial arts, cause 90% of them get into hand to hand fights with him. Most of the times he act like a rank amateur, instead of the super professional everyone is so scared of, that they start shaking in their pants whenever someone just mentioning he's name I really wish they'd give these types of roles to Jason Statham, he's better at playing these types of bad to he bone roles. Keanu reeves are better suited for something else, like playing stoner in Bill & Ted Best part of the entire movie, is when the scene when the head honcho of the Russian mob finds out over the phone,what he's son has done","54 out of 124 found this helpful.

All of this provides an appropriate tapestry upon which to unleash the Wick and the action does not disappoint. The body count pile up is rapid and the action balletically choreographed not missing a beat and although we know better, there is always a feel WIck is in jeopardy thereby raising the suspense.Keanu Reeves' best performance to-date (yes - including Matrix, though it is a better movie). Some excellent support characters, particularly Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki). Many of these characters are expertly used to reveal more of the rules in this universe.This is a fabulous movie, certainly a contender for all-time-best in genre.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

With 'John Wick', the protagonist ultimately condemns himself to the hell he worked so hard to escape from.Overall, this film breaks away from the shoot-em-up genre in highly experimental and refreshing ways. You have a protagonist who has made a living taking the lives of others and managed to escape that world to experience a heavenly existence for a brief time. The spectre of his past returns once this heaven (his best friend and loving wife) is taken away from him and he plunges irreversibly back to the hell that he had attempted to leave behind.What most stands out about John Wick as a character is his vulnerability. In the first sequence of the film we see him break down crying when he receives the gift of a puppy from his dead wife. Even though he's killed countless people, he's retained his humanity and needs a companion to love in order to be complete. This all gets taken away from him through an act of malice and greed which leads to the death of the gift of love from the dead. As he buries this gift of love and digs up the instruments of death he'd attempted to leave behind, he's also leaving his temporary heaven and returning to the endless hell that he's truly given his life to.The choreography, editing and set design were all superb. Unlike most action films, there were very few edits in the very long action scenes which required expertise among both the performers and the crew. This film was sorely overlooked by awards ceremonies in all three of those categories as well and rightly deserves more critical acclaim for accomplishing what seldom few action films even attempt.What else stands out is that even though this film is full of violence and death from beginning to end, very little focus is given to the gore and splatter. At times the death blow isn't even shown. This elevates what could have been another run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up to a graceful ballet where the human emotion involved takes precedent to the base acts of violence.One area that did lessen the enjoyment of this film was the use of music. Much of the score was too overt which distracted from the telling of the story rather than heighten the drama. Too many times the music was melodramatic and cheesy, even utilizing the sort of ambient sounds you'd only expect in cliched television shows.As a whole, this film was innovative, cinematic and a refreshing variation of a genre that hasn't seen this type of new approach in a long time. There are many questions about John Wick as a character that are left unanswered as well as about the underground society he's part of and that seems to permeate every aspect of the world he lives in but the imagination of the viewer does a good enough job of filling in the blanks that this aura of mystery enhances the enjoyment of the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is not better than the average low budget, low quality Steven Seagull run of the mill movie. Inverosimil script, bad direction, bad actors, bad soundtrack, bad everything.
Keanu looks like he's playing a video game from beginning to end shooting right left and centre killing dozens of guys. Even the soundtrack is more fitting of a video game.
So I'm very disappointed, I was expecting much better after all the publicity and promotion. The cinematic value of this movie is next to zero.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

This movie is about honour and keeping your word no matter what the consequences may be. It's also about honouring the memory of those who have departed. It's almost like a fantasy world that exists beneath the normal world where the criminals work with their own currency, their own kingdoms and laws. In this universe the criminal underworld live by a very strict code of rules that if you break them you will die.

Her sudden death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's father (Michael Nyqvist) -- John's former colleague -- puts a huge bounty on John's head.Confusing, weird, and slow-paced in the first 30 minutes; however, after that, the action begins. Nevertheless, it doesn't last for long, as the slow (but interesting) story telling recurs, leading to one really fun action scene. On that note, all the action scenes in the movie are beautifully choreographed. Fast forward to the end, the final fight scene was simply amazing, but I felt that it was a bit too short; It left me wanting more.After a series of unsuccessful movies after The Matrix, Keanu finally finds something to bounce back. He was perfect for this role with all the charisma and intimidation he possesses, not to mention the really solid support cast around him from William Dafoe to Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, John Leguizamo, Alfie Allen, Bridget Moynahan, and others.I found the way they displayed the translation and highlighted the key words really interesting too. The music, especially the one associated with action scenes, is perfect and goes really well with the mood the movie exhibits.Score:7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot was simpler than I hoped. Some plot hooks were set up in the middle of the movie, but many of them were resolved in an anticlimactic, straightforward way. Also, the fight scenes were too often unintelligible - just rapid-fire movements and gunshots meant to show how badass John Wick is, rather than making me understand the situation and wonder how John will get out of it. Finally, I didn't understand John Wick's motivation for his final fight, or the reference to a ""code"" that was mentioned around that time, or why a certain female character agreed to something near the end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Great care has been taken to set the tone and generally make Keanu Reeves look cool as he struts about dispatching baddies to the sound of rock music.It helps to be a fan of Reeves as an action lead. He looks the part, does the physical work brilliantly, has soulful eyes, and delivers certain lines very well like ""Do I look civilised to you?"". However, when it comes to the going through a greater range of emotions I think he has some limitations.The baddies are pretty one-note, so it is really just an exercise of watching the action unfold and appreciating the level of filmmaking skill required to create such spectacle on screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The backstory of John is mysterious and is revealed throughout the film. He's a wonderful retired guy and it is super entertaining to see his relationship with others. The antagonists are more like drones run by a leader as opposed to people. A great part of this movie is the cinematography, especially how it works in tandem with the choreography of the fight scenes. Even outside of these amazing fight scenes, the cinematography does not falter and is complemented by the beautiful lighting used in the slower dramatic scenes.

John wick clearly has a very large vendetta which is placed quite aptly as it should be. This film does something to the genre that no other shooter has ever done which is they have added a level of class sophistication high class and gentleman's guide book sort of sophistication to the entire feel and plot of the film. Ingeniously adapting the concept of the Continental to be a cornerstone of this exclusive high class feel they have recreated the genre in a way that has never been done.

John Wick is a very focused character and if you get on his bad side you will know that you've made a mistake.John Wick is very powerful, but he also isn't invincible. So it is interesting to follow him along while issues more and more dinner reservations. And overall it ends for me in a pretty satisfying way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first John Wick was and is a pleasure to watch - great action and Keanu Reeves is finally back on the top. But I must admit, that the other three movies (John Wick: Chapter 4 released these days) are - despite lots of action and a fine production - a blur of action and fighting scenes. I watched the fourth movie these days but gotta confess that I have real trouble to remember anything that happened in Chapter 2 and 3. Anyway, the first movie is a have to watch movie if you dig the genre of revenge and hitman movies (if you don't know it yet) and after that one you can decide if you still want to follow the tour de force of John Wick.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is about a retired well known hitman whose dog is killed by some Russian gangsters and he takes the revenge of it becoz that dog was gifted by his wife to coop up with lonliness after she passed on so he takes the revenge.The one thing i like the most about the film is its style and action sequences that looks brtual , intense and realistic involving mostly gun fights .

Chad Stahelski executes this story beginning with a seemingly quiet man in a seemingly quiet life, which is unforgettably perfect when it suddenly connects to its first loud and brutal fight scene. Reeves delivers a fine performance, which then leads along with acceptable character development. But once that action switch is turned on, it remains on!The shock of the first action sequence really raises our hopes for the rest of the movie, especially considering that John Wick's themes are centred around the revenge of a former assassin. Thankfully, the movie really forces through and lives up to our hopes. There's extremely violent action sequences that are stylish in combat, but the plot is actually really easy to concentrate on which makes it an easy watch.Wick's enemy is certainly a very finely constructed antagonist, as we root for Reeves' character as he fights for vengeance. The whole plot, from start to finish, is also very entertaining and watchable. But the best thing about this action-thriller is that it creates a legendary protagonist who matches perfectly with the action-thriller genre. There's frequently stylish and thrilling moments of activity.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's essentially a long concatenation of brutal homicides, all supposedly justified because some evil Russian mobster killed John's puppy and stole his 1970 Mustang. Really?It's total overkill, literally and figuratively, and I cannot recommend this blood bath to anyone who does not spend hours a day playing push-button whack on whatever the latest mass-murder apps are being sponsored and promoted by the Pentagon these days (in the hopes of recruiting newbies for their drone program). Ugh.Given the gross disproportionality of the revenge killing fest here, I'd say that the one redeeming quality of John Wick is that it is a perfect metaphor for the entire War on Terror. A handful of criminals kill 3,000 innocent people in NYC, so let's go annihilate another million or so!","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

That's it, that could be all I said and it would be enough. I mean really, this movie is so great, when it ended I was searching for something that wasn't right and I really struggled to find a scene or moment I didn't enjoy.Let's get the minuscule negatives I have with
this masterpiece out of the way. For one I didn't enjoy the last scene and thought it was forced. I also didn't really like what led to the 3rd act of the film and thought it was one of those things that had to happen to continue the movie. That's it. That's all the negative points I have to say about this movie because frankly, the rest is awesome.Keane Reeves is amazing in this movie and so is everyone else, but his role in this cannot be understated, he gave it his all and it shows. The action is at points orgasmic and has such fluidity to it I found myself jaw-dropped at points.The story is also pretty good, making us totally understand why John Wick decides to do what he does and while it's not revolutionary, it doesn't need to be because, in the end, this is an action movie with some of the greatest action I have ever ever seen, incredibly interesting characters and dynamics, superb comedy at points and that's all I wanted.Basically flawless!A","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They pull the camera back and just let Keanu blast fools apart as cleanly as possible. My only nitpick is that John Wick judo throws people way too much. I dunno, I know nothing about real gunfights but I feel like you can't spend too much time tumbling goons to the floor.Also, I thought the ending sequence was fine but not up to par to a lot of the other parts.

"8","/10","Keanu Reeves gives his best performance in years in a strong action spectacular.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7702907/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","30 December 2021","Former assassin, John Wick (Keanu Reeves), has left behind his criminal past in favor of a quiet life with his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan). When Helen dies of a terminal illness five years later, John is devastated, but his wife posthumously arranged for a beagle puppy named Daisy to be delivered to John after her death. John bonds with the dog and allows John to feel still connected to his wife. When Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the spoiled, sadistic, arrogant son of crime boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) takes a liking to John's '69 Mustang following a chance encounter at a gas station, Isoef makes an offer to buy the car which John flatly refuses. Later that night Iosef and his two thugs break into John's home killing Daisy and stealing John's car. After burying Daisy, John sets out on a path of vengeance as he chases Isoef through the criminal underworld while Viggo tries to protect Isoef by placing a contract on John.Written by direct-to-dvd action screenwriter Derek Kolstad of One in the Chamber and The Package, the foundation for John Wick began under the title Scorn with Kolstad seeking to evoke classic revenge and film noir classics with contemporary action stylings. Initially intended for a much older leading man (as popularized by Liam Neeson in the Taken films) the movie was rewritten and shown to Keanu Reeves who soon signed on. Reeves then contacted stunt specialist, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (whom Reeves had worked extensively with on The Matrix films) hoping they'd wish to direct the film. Stahelski and Leitch jumped at the chance to work on the project with Reeves and the film when released ended up doing nearly double the expected box office that was projected and became critically acclaimed with word of mouth and advanced screenings making John Wick a dark horse that launched the directing careers of Stahelski and Leitch and was hailed as Keanu Reeves big comeback.While Keanu Reeves had major successes in the 90s with endearing classics like Point Break, Speed, and of course The Matrix, Reeves had stepped away from headlining major films following the end of the then Matrix Trilogy and the so-so performance of Constantine. While there were outliers such as The Day the Earth Stood Still remake and 47 Ronin (which originated as a supporting role but became a second lead following highly publicized reshoots) most of Reeves work had been in smaller scale productions or independent films. John Wick is without a doubt the strongest performance from Keanu Reeves since his turn as Bob Arctor in A Scanner Darkly in 2007. Reeves, despite a reputation for a stilted delivery, is very well utilized with his performance one of few words and more of facial expressions and body language with the opening scenes showing Wick's grief for his lost wife that culminates in the delivery of Daisy following her death truly heart wrenching scenes that make you invested in John as a character and helps you bond with the relationship between him and Daisy. And in addition to the physical performance, Reeves is at the top of his game in the action scenes doing approximately 90% of his own stunts and coupled with the strong directorial style of Stahelski and Leitch the action flows smoothly with minimal cuts and expertly crafted and timed choreography.The movie features a fantastic supporting cast with Alfie Allen an effectively hateful villain whose Iosef Tarasov is absolutely loathsome as the entitled preening sadist who serves as the impetus for John's rampage, the late Michael Nyqvist is also really strong playing Iosef's father Viggo whose controlled carefully planning crime boss makes a formidable antagonist for John to square off against. The movie also features some great turns by Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Bridget Moynahan, and Lance Reddick who add some strong personality to their characters and add to the richness of the world developed in the film. John Wick has some of the best world building I've seen in an action film with an established order based around this mysterious hotel called The Continental that serves as a neutral haven for the high end criminal element with its own monetary system of gold coins and an established code that when broken leads to undesirable consequences.The one point of criticism you can give this movie is that it's third act feels a little disjointed with the movie having seemingly come to its destination only for an additional climax to take place. While the action is still on point and the acting is still strong, it feels like the narrative flow could've been smoothed out by tying these two climactic sequences together into one rather than winding down from one only to jump into the other.John Wick is a white knuckle ride that despite its budget being on the lower end of the spectrum gives its audiences some of the most exhilarating and thrilling sequences in modern action cinema. Reeves gives his best performance in years and effortlessly handles both the action and acting needed for this protagonist, and a supporting cast of notable character actors brings life to this elaborate world and underworld created for the movie. While the plot does hiccup a little thanks to an additional climax, the movie has enough goodwill to make it a solid addition to any action fans required viewing list.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You start off watching John Wick mourning the death of his wife and rediscovers the meaning of life when he receives a puppy. When things hit the fan, you start to understand that there is more to the protagonist and immediately enter this bloodbath massacre with this complete badass. The plot is simple and yet you clearly understand the motivation and that this is one guy who you don't want to mess with. It's painful to see what happens, but the clear motivation is enough for even us to be onboard and cheering for this awesome character to kill some baddies.Keanu doesn't get a lot of lines, but I thought he worked perfectly well here being such a tyrant with all of the stunt work and action scenes that he had done for this film. Which leads to one of the best things I can say and that is the action. Everything from the cinematography to the choreography, everything was shot in such detail, making this action flick so stylish and fun to watch. There were plenty of times where I reacted out loud just on how brutal or amazing a certain kill was. Based on the motivation of the character, watching him get his revenge is so satisfying, making this stand out from the more recent revenge flicks we have been getting. With so much memorable moments, it is hard to recall which was the most entertaining or which part of the film I had enjoyed the most. Every single moment brings in that necessary punch and not overstaying its welcome by showing too much action.What this film gets right is building its world. You enter this world of assassins and rather than having long expositions that explain what goes around there, you are given enough glimpses and hints of the lore that has you intrigued and wanting to know more. The characters are all suave and each have their own characteristics, making this revenge flick all the more interesting. Everyone from the owner Winston, to even a few assassins that John Wick interacts with has such personality to them, making them quite memorable, despite the amount of screentime they have.Even with its sequels, this film is still so fun to watch and its rewatchable. Definitely recommend this for anyone who loves action.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is this hidden, underworld of Assassins. John Wick is already a well-known name in that world, and the movie shows this with dialogues and actions of different characters. There are doctors, Body Cleaners and Hotel Managers. Such an interesting world. (A lot of potential for Spin-Off and Sequels you know)Keanu Reeves is good in the role. John Wick isn't a type of character that shows various emotions or goes through an arc(at least in this one). However he is such a badass & the movie succeeded in making the audience care for him.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Did it live up to the hype let's see.For starters this film is extremely well directed. Chad Stahleski created a extremely intriguing world that I've never seen done before in a action film. John Wick is of course the story of a man avenging his pet but there is a lot more at play. We get to see this underground world of criminals develop and it's a extremely well done.Every action scene is packed with intensity and urgency and a huge part of that is the performance given by Keanu Reeves, he is incredible. The way he Carrie's himself is unlike any performance I've seen him give and it may be his best.The rest of the cast is great as well. The villain played by Michael Nyqvist was great which is not something I usually say about action films.In terms of gripes the ending is a little weird. They add a couple of scenes that I feel were cool to watch but from a storytelling perspective the film probably could have ended a little earlier.Overall John Wick is Awesome, the film is packed with quality direction and provides us with possibly Keanu's best performance yet.9/10

Aside from the Mission: Impossible series, there hasn't been one where the action makes you extremely excited or grip the edge of your seat. Luckily, we have John Wick to show us how action is really done.John Wick is a hit-man who is in retirement but some gangsters take away everything he loves which forces him to come out of retirement and hunt them down.John Wick has a very basic plot. It's a revenge story that's been done many times and hence why its story doesn't feel very innovative but what sells this film is the ACTION! As directors this is Chad Stahelski and David Leitch's first film and they've done an exceptional job. As both of them are stuntmen it's logical for them to know a lot about action and it's evident from this film that they do. Each sequence has a stylish flair present within them and each kill is different from the other which makes this movie so entertaining to watch. The choreography and camerawork is simply perfect. There are some long takes used during the action which increases the intensity of the scene and keeps your adrenaline flowing.This film is filled with action which never ventures into boredom. This is largely due to the fantastic direction and extraordinary commitment by Keanu Reeves. After The Matrix, Keanu Reeves's career did go downhill. He needed something huge to bring him back into the Hollywood scene and John Wick did exactly that. Reeves is perfect for this role. He is the definition of awesome as he possesses this swagger that's present in each scene. His commitment to the action is praiseworthy. You can tell that he's doing most of the stunts rather than having a stuntman to do it for him. It conveys to us how much he cared about this film.Whilst the story is very predictable, the film does do a great job of showing us who John Wick is. Throughout the movie we learn how powerful this man was in the underworld before his retirement. We see how many people are associated with him and the film repeatedly shows how fearful people are towards him which portrays how unstoppable John Wick is.Overall, John Wick is one of the best action films made. The USP of this movie is its action and there is plently scattered across this movie. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job as John Wick and I praise his dedication towards the film's stunts. If you want to have an exhilarating experience for 1 hour and 40 minutes then John Wick is the film for you.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The commercials, the distribution, the target audience, are all far more the focus than the actual content of the film - all in the name of profit. This movie definitely shows Keanu Reeves inability to act at all. The plot was like water and of course very predictable. They really build up his character, then when the fight sequences begin it's like watching something that they did back in the 70's. The movie ""The Drop"" with Tom Hardy is the same movie really, however 100 times better. Tom Hardy is incredible and has just begun to shine as an actor in film - so I recommend that film over this for sure.

The cinematography and style is exceptional. The way they capture a gritty and dark style is awesome. It reminds me of Michael Mann's movies. Great storytelling and setup of the premise. I like how they slowly pull you into the story without telling you everything right away. The mystery is what keeps you watching and wanting to know more. The soundtrack is banging. I like how they got the actress from I, Robot to play John's wife - I like her. The little beagle is so cute, that was sweet how his wife posthumously gave him the dog as a final present. John's got some sick style. His house, his outfits, his car - all real nice and classy.It's kind of weird how he doesn't have an alarm system for his house. I can't believe what they did to John's dog, what scumbags. He gets two things taken from him back to back, a double whammy. I don't blame John for going beast mode. I loved the interaction between John and Jimmy (the officer). This is where you get a feeling for the movie's sense of humor. It was funny seeing the Allstate guy in the movie. He fits in oddly well. It was unexpected to see Willem Dafoe, but I definitely welcomed it - love the guy. Lance Reddick as the hotel concierge at The Continental is so good. Alfie Allen playing Tarasov's son was great - I hated his guts, god what a spoiled entitled cowardly brat.This movie has a surprisingly clever sense of humor. It's a movie that I was surprised to see didn't take itself too seriously. The dialogue is straightforward, to the point but also witty and lively. The choreography in the stunts, fights and gunplay is where the movie truly shines. They're amazing, like watching a beautiful, bloody and violent ballet. The way they integrate martial arts within the gun fights is something mesmerizing to watch. I wouldn't be surprised if they watched older Jackie Chan and John Woo movies for inspiration. There's so much storytelling and backstory that goes on just through certain interactions and introductions with characters without having a full long conversation - I thought it was brilliant how they did that. Saying less is more in this movie and I 100% agree with it. The pacing is excellent.Keanu Reeves owns it as John Wick - kills it. The guy was born to play him. What I love most about this movie is it's ability to be gritty, violent, slick and action-packed while at the same time managing to not take itself too seriously and feel fun. Awesome movie. Highly highly recommend it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

John Wick is definitely Keanu Reeve's best acting performance, up there with the Matrix franchise. Definitely one of his best works. The story (albeit a bit silly with the whole revenge dog plot) was still pretty damn entertaining. The action was top notch and one of the more realistic and gritty scenes i've ever watched. The kills were amazingly unique, the soundtrack went hard and quite a few likeable characters in it.If I had to point out some bad about this movie, I would definitely immediately point out its boring ""main"" villain. I got nothing against the actor or the character he played, nothing at all, but that final boss fight was lame as all hell. But that's about all the bad I can mention about ""John Wick"".

So begins Wick's act of supreme revenge as he uses his very specific skill set to track down and kill all of the crime syndicate.Seeing it again, I was surprised at how much time ""John Wick"" gave to establishing the character and world before unleashing him. It's probably 25 minutes or so before the action really starts, which is helpful as those 25 minutes are really the building blocks that the three films have been based on. It does go some way to establishing the world of ""John Wick"" too, with glimpses of The Continental and establishing the rules of the universe that will become more important in the sequels.Acting is not good, as you might imagine, though Reeves has somehow found a way to legitimise his one note deadpan style for Wick. The story is a basic revenge thriller but that's not really why we're here. We are here for glorious visceral expertly choreographed violence that has proved a stark contrast to the CGI heavy or edited within an inch of their lives action films that have been prevalent in the last few years. Though it's only a return really, to how films used to be made, particularly in the ""Hong Kong"" style, the fact it's been away for a while does make it feel like ""John Wick"" is special and unique.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One of Keanu Reeve's best performances mainly because he barely has any lines but when he does he sure makes them count. The action is superb and never gets dry and every act of violence seems to be justified at a certain manner.
The action is good and very slick. Keanu always at his best when he has zero dialogue and can just do fighting stuff. To call the plot thin would be an understatement. Unfortunately there's only so much Keanu killing people one after another that Can maintain my interest and by the point we're halfway through the killing.
Love the entire series, each chapter of John Wick is a masterpiece to be watched and re watched again and again! Don't miss this.
But Parents need to know that John Wick is a brutally violent, frequently bloody thriller starring Keanu Reeves as an assassin. There's a very high body count: Characters are shot, maimed, stabbed, beaten, threatened, killed with firearms at close range, blown to bits in an explosion, strangled with bare hands, and more. And especially because so much of the violence is depicted in a stylized, semi-glamorized way, it's best reserved for the oldest teens and adults. Interestingly, a streak of humor also runs through it, and fight scenes choreographed so thrillingly that it's almost like watching ballet -- albeit a gunshot-riddled, rough-and-tumble one.Concluding , It's very interesting movie in my mind i just give it 10/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Other times, I just want to shut my brain off and enjoy some cool action sequences. John Wick is an ideal movie for both. Starring Keanu Reeves in the titular role, the film is packed with unique characters, riveting storyline, beautifully choreographed fight scenes, and an intriguing world brought to life by directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch.
The movie follows former hit man John Wick as he leaves retirement after the murder of his dog. Wick must return to the world he left behind in order to track down the man responsible and get his revenge.
I loved the performances given in this film. While some of the dialogue can come off as stiff, they still make it work. Reeves' acting without words gives incredible depth to his character. The antagonists of the film, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his son, Iosef (Alfie Allen), have fantastic emotional depth and well-developed dynamic. Stahelski and Leitch's directing serves to bring out the best of each actor.
The music in the score all fits perfectly into the film's atmosphere and the lighting creates a strong sense of place in every scene. Characterization through costuming was spot-on and the pacing of the film was fantastic. There was never a dull moment.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good action movie. If you don't have a problem with a whole lot of violence, definitely check this out if you haven't already.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie instantly wicky wakey'd me up with its no-holds barred bravado tone. Kudos to Director Chad Stahelski for his masterful action orchestration of the picture. ""John Wick"" stars a sensational Keanu Reeves (yes, you heard right!) as the title character. Wick is a former Russian mafia hit-man who seeks all-out vengeance on his former boss' son for stealing his car and killing his puppy beagle. Hey, I am a beagle owner myself, so I can empathize with Wick, I would go bezerk if someone hurt my beagle. Wick is pretty much a badass one-man army in seeking his revenge as he battles an entire Russian Mafia Army! Sure, it goes over-the-top at times, but who cares? The action sequences is the paramount of the picture. Keanu Reeves has never been better, I don't know what kind of red or blue acting pills he took to prepare for this, but it worked. The always great Willem Dafoe also delivers a hit performance as a former accomplice of Wick. And Michael Nyqvist delivers a good performance as the baddie head Russian mafia honcho Viggo Tarasov. So hopefully I have Wicked you up before I go-go, and have convinced you to take a shot at ""John Wick"". ***** Excellent","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This has got to be up there with Point Break and Matrix for his best films to date. He stars as the typical action hero / anti-hero and unlike all the usual crap talk about how hard the main character is in all of Tom Cruise's films this one actually measures up. Its not stop action all the way and there isn't any stupid CGI to take over the screen or unbelievable action sequences that defy the laws of physics or gravity which is a major bonus in my book. If you want a flash to past when action hero's were tall, mean and shot lots of people then this is the movie for you.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

In fact I would go as far back as 1999's 'The Matrix', not including its silly sequels. That film showed audiences and critics alike that there was still freshness and room for expansion regarding the science fiction genre. Likewise, 'John Wick' has the same effect on the action genre. The last film truly off of the rails and full of excitement was 1988's 'Die Hard'. Yes, 'John Wick' is that awesome.John Wick is an ex-hit-man. He is overcome with grief when his wife dies from a fatal illness. Knowing that she has little time left, she leaves John a gift to remind him of her. A dog, Daisy. Within the next few days they form a close bond. Alas, it is not to be. Masked Russian gangsters break into his house, killing his dog and stealing his car. It is time for John Wick to take his revenge.If 'John Wick' sounds like the next 'Taken' film or average revenge tale, then you are mistaken. This film has style, energetic and frenetic fights as well as an actual plot. Think of it like 'Kill Bill' with Keanu Reeves replacing Uma Thurman in the title role. John Wick may not be as outrageous as the work of Quentin Tarantino. But it is far more daring and fun than the recent batch of action films from Hollywood's generic production line. This is what makes John Wick stand out from the crowd.Keanu Reeves in the starring role gives John Wick solemnity, thus lending him realism as opposed to Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills from 'Taken' who was stapled with clichés. We buy Reeves' character because he is a broken man with nothing left, as a result we can sympathise with him. Iosef the leader of the Russians who break into John Wick's house is played by an egotistical Alfie Allen, he makes the mistake of triggering John Wick's unstoppable anger. Iosef loses his cool real quick when he realises the gravity of what he has done. Enter his father, played by the sinister Michael Nyqvist, who shows little compassion and love for his son. Iosef strives to please him, leading to some very foolish decisions. Iosef does not think about the consequences of his actions, until it is too late and John Wick comes a calling. Willem Dafoe is never less than magnificent. His role makes an impression, he is John's trustworthy ally and gives him a purpose, when no one else in the world will.What is primarily involved in 'John Wick' and the centre of the audience's interest is the fight scenes. They take place in a variety of everyday locations. A house, nightclub, hotel, secret safe house and even briefly a church. Do not fear. Shaky cam is barely present. You will actually be able to tell who is punching who. This was clear in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and anything but in the 'Taken' Trilogy. The action is not a rehash of the film's previous set pieces and each one is unique and wholly original in its approach. Take for example the scene in John Wick's house. The camera is locked down with wide angles. We can take in each punch, kick, stab and bullet wound with ease. 'John Wick' makes you feel alive. The set piece in the nightclub differs in style. As John Wick runs towards Iosef, the camera sways from the left to the right. It may prove disorientating to some viewers, yet you can always establish what is going on and who the enemy is. It does not prove distracting or poorly framed. I felt reborn and could revel in each detail to my heart's content.Most action films feel obligated to make it past the two hour mark. Not 'John Wick'. All the fat is trimmed off, so that only the meat and core of the film remains intact. Therefore, you are not left waiting too long for the next set piece. I do have one minor criticism of 'John Wick'. So minor in fact, that it is barely worth mentioning. The very first scene feels redundant, when you look back on the film. However, it does not hurt the film and only the most picky audience member will take issue with it.The score by Tyler Bates and Joel L. Richard compliments John Wick's uber cool clothing and look. It is in touch with the film and increases the mood and tension to a considerable degree. Undoubtedly, without this elegant score, the film would not be half as charming as it is.The cinematography is polished and sophisticated. The action takes place within the frame. This means you can stay focused without feeling ill. You only have to look at the most recent 'Taken' outing to see how poorly this can be executed.'John Wick' is a top tier action film. Filled with layered characters, confident performances, a suave score, radiant cinematography and free flowing fist fights. This is the best film of its kind since 'Die Hard' and miles ahead of 'Taken' in every aspect. If 'John Wick' does not become a franchise, then generic action flicks be warned, I am going to take my revenge upon you.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

And increasingly a lot of films are now influenced back by video games - the plots, the characters, the framing, the cinematography. And so it is the case with John Wick.It's set in a world where everyone seems to be a gangster or an assassin, or a formal part of that world. It's all rather cold and detached. There is the flimsiest of back stories but it mostly consists of a very wooden Keanu Reeves shooting people in the face, sometimes stabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing people through sheets of glass'.The whole point of a video game is that you control the character. Even if the game consists merely of killing people, the fact that you are controlling them makes it an immersive experience.Just passively watching a wooden game character shooting people in the face, sometimes stabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing people through sheets of glass', makes for a rather pointless and tedious 101 minutes.","24 out of 52 found this helpful.

I thought Speed was awful and haven't watched point break yet. Yes he isn't the greatest actor in the world but think he plays this character how he should be played. Hardly any dialogue or emotion, the perfect Hit-man just doing what he needs to do until the job is done. I thought the action scenes were very well done with the shoot out scenes done amazingly. Yes the story isn't the best in the world and some of the acting is very over the top and unbelievable, and the ending could have been a little better, but with a film like this, sometimes it's just nice to forget all the little flaws like that and just enjoy the film for what it is. I enjoyed this film all the way through, I never found myself looking away or thinking it was over the top.

A real vengeance. John Wick is easy to follow; Wick (Reeves), having lost his wife and attended her funeral, is taking the time to mourn the one he loved. An unexpected delivery in the form of a new pet jolts him out of misery, that is until a mob of Russians break into his house, kill his dog and steal his car. They have unleashed the monster in him; he tears through New York city leaving a rather large body count in his wake. First time directors Staheski and Leitch makes John Wick an incredibly powerful film. They're known in the industry for their stunt coordination skills, so it's only right that they're at the helm. Keanu Reeves' martial arts is replaced with raw grappling and gritty kills. The action is smooth, energetic and dynamic. Reeves is ideal as the wounded hit-man, saying little and expressing emotion through his brawling. The Russian gangsters and their boss play a familiar tune. Viggo (Nyqvist) knows his son's crossed the wrong person. Humour accompanies his importance as a leader, adding value to the film's atmosphere. Topping that is the film's rich, dark blue hues in every shot, giving us a tease of NY City's underground scene. I mean, who wouldn't want to check in to a hotel where all the other hit men stay? John Wick is stylish, sophisticated and compact. A sequel is already in the works.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I have seen all of the great action movies and none of them are better than John Wick. I have seen John Wick three times, twice in IMAX and once at home and the first time I saw it I was so blown away, I had to go back a few days later to see it again. Then I waited for it to come out on DVD and watched it again and thats when I decided it was the greatest action movie of all time. This movie gives you everything you want in an action movie! The story is perfect, it grabs you and keeps you hooked the entire time. They give you an action hero to root for the whole movie. The movie does an amazing job with first getting you to see John Wick as a human so you can understand the pain he is in and then the movie builds him up to be a feared and respected legend of this underworld and when the action starts you will understand why it is the greatest action movie of all time. The gun play in this movie is by far the best I have ever seen in any movie. John Wick kills so many people it is awesome, read the trivia section to find out how many! Keanu Reeves gives the performance of his career. The directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch were stunt men their whole careers and John Wick is the first movie they have ever directed, which explains why the action is so perfect in this movie. I don't want to give any spoilers because I know as a huge movie fan that nothing is worse than finding out too many details before you see a movie. Trust me and go see John Wick right away!

IMDb ratings are almost always exactly what I would have said, but this one is SO overrated.Firstly the action. It is just Keanu shooting people in the face the whole movie. Sometimes he rolls around before shooting them in the face. Sometimes he grabs their neck then shoots them in the face. Needless to say this is really boring.Second the acting. Keanu still can't act. His face is a bit older, which makes him seem less like a goof. That is the only positive thing about the movie.I really am in shock that people think this is a cult classic or at all good. It is painful to watch. From the beginning you know EXACTLY how the movie will go down. The only thing surprising during the movie is how camp it is (corny subtitles with different fonts, bad acting, extremely overused tropes redone with no extra effort).AVOID, seriously.

No story what so ever. The writers didn't do any effort to create any intrigue or suspense. The shift from the movie's lame beginning to the action was abrupt. Keanu didn't even prepare well for the movie. His body lacked the necessary muscles for such a super strong bad ass. Yet, he was hit so many times thrown off floors and he just gets up and continues fighting like it was nothing. I gave it 4 our of 10 because the action sequences were kinda slick. Totally unrealistic though, but still cool. And even still, the action sequences are repetitive without much change as the film progresses. Long story short, this movie has no plot, no logic, no hype, abrupt transitions, and a super hero with a white pasty body.","30 out of 68 found this helpful.

Starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, the film successfully revitalises Keanu Reeves' career and brings him back into the spotlight as an action hero.In New York City, retired assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves), mourns the death of his wife Helen to a terminal illness. Shortly after, John receives a puppy as per request of Helen to help him come to terms with her passing. One night, a trio of Russian gangsters break into John's home, beat him up badly, kill the puppy, and steal his car, after John refused to sell the car to their leader Iosef (Alfie Allen) earlier that day. Now with nothing left to lose, John vows revenge on the gangsters and comes out of retirement to settle the score once and for all.With a good amount of action, drama, and some cleverly choreographed shoot-outs, John Wick does for Keanu Reeves what Taken and Harry Brown did for Liam Neeson and Michael Caine, respectively. The filmmakers do a good job showcasing why the John Wick character is so feared, yet respected within the crime underworld of New York thanks mainly to Keanu Reeves' nuanced performance as the ""one man army"" title character. Often times, I feel that Reeves' approach to his acting is very hit-and-miss, however here, it is most certainly a hit. The film's creative use of colour and lighting gives an almost anime and noir feel. There were many times where I could tell the directors must have watched several anime and kung fu films to serve as inspiration for the overall tone.I rate it 7.5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The reviews don't do it justice. And as others have said, on paper, the premise doesn't look that interesting, which might also be why I overlooked this. This is a revenge action flick, and the only thing I can think of to explain the lower reviews, is that some people just don't like revenge action movies in general.The story isn't very complex, which is typical of revenge action. Typically, I prefer a little complexity. Pure action, like Transformers and Max Max Road Fury usually isn't my thing. However, while the story is simple, there is just enough of a story to separate this movie from the two I just mentioned. Some people say the action in this movie is non stop. But I disagree. There are small breaks, just when you need them to explain the films universe, and its characters. Another thing that separates this movie from pure action films like Mad Max Road Fury, is that there is an actual clearly established goal, and you are given a very strong reason to actually care about the protagonist and his desire to accomplish it. Not to mention, an unusually strong reason to really really hate its antagonist(s).As for the acting, I was very impressed by its lead hero played by Keanu Reeves. He's stepped up his game from previous films. He can really sell the emotion of sadness this time, which was critical in this movie. If he acted the way he did in The Matrix, this whole movie would not have worked for me.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

He often gets crap over his acting skills (or lack thereof). I think hes well suited to action movies, where a lot of the time story is told through the action sequences and a bit more nuanced. It's hard to find fault with this movie, and I've seen it at least 3-4 times. All the actors supporting or main do a great job. There is a lot of action in this movie, and the movie does start out a bit slow, but then picks up very quickly. The action, gun fu and stunts are awesome, some of the best I've seen in a long time. You can tell they really practiced and tweaked the stunts a lot. There are often long action segments with a brief intermission of story, which is how I like most of my movies. The soundtrack is amazing as well, with Marilyn Manson contributing to the main theme of the movie and the composer for the movie doing a great job. I would have liked to see William Dafoe's character expanded on some more but that may come in the second movie (in flashback sequences).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Will you be dare to challenge a Russian mafia for that? Well, if it was the last gift from the most beloved one?John Wick, is one of the most discussed films in these days. Well, it's the story about a man who hunts down an entire mafia, just because his dog was killed. What if I told you, this was loosely based on a real story? Definitely, it was exaggerated to the limit for filmy purpose.John Wick is mourning his wife's death. One day he receives a surprise gift that was sent by his wife before her death. An adorable puppy. That was a great relief for him. On a gas station, some youth, named Iosef Tarasov, was attracted to John's car and asks him how much? John says, she was not for sale. At night, Iosef with his gangsters break into John's house, beat him down and take the car away. The puppy tries to stop this, get annoyed by the puppy, those guys kill it. Iosef Tarasov was called by his father Viggo Tarasov, and asks about what was happened. Iosef learns that the guy he messed up with was really dangerous. And it was obvious that he will come for him.A very stylish movie. End to end beauty in the frames will be a feast for your eyes. Keanu Reeves made his name through The Matrix. The stunt double and action coordinator of these films Chad Stahelski with David Leitch are the directors. Therefore, action is the final word for the film. Jonathan Sela did an amazing job with the camera providing stunning visuals.If you are a fan of Thrillers, do not miss this film. #KiduMovie","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

With Chad Stahelski directing the movie it couldn't have been bad choreography or action sequences as that's the background he came from and it shows in the incredible choreography and action sequences that mixes martial arts and gun fu which is a blast to watch. Derek Kolstad wrote the movie and it isn't really that original script but it works perfectly for the action genre but where his writing shines is the world he built, from the assassin network to the characters, simply amazing.The ensemble cast is my other favorite thing about the movie, having Keanu Reeves as the main character is never wrong, having Michael Nyqvist and Alfie Allen as the villains was perfect as they portrayed the villain roles perfect and Michael shined the most of the two, stunning performance. There is a lot of other interesting characters that are played by Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe isn't either wrong. Simple to say it's a fantastic cast with A list actors.This movie is personally one of my favorite action movies of all time, it has everything an action movie should have and much more. Just the fight choreography is something I could re-watch this for and mixing it with the suspenseful story helps a lot.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Of all the action movies that come out these days, there wasn't much that intrigued me enough to spend the time with this particular one. However, after some of my friends were raving about it and I saw a few YouTube videos describing why it was so great, I decided to give John Wick (2014) a chance. To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. This film was not just another action movie. In fact, it was quite exemplary in its breaking of traditional action movie tropes.The most noticeable difference this movie has compared to other action films is its camerawork. Ever since The Bourne Identity (2001) changed the action movie genre, the cameras have been quite shaky, and the action is, therefore (increasingly) hard to follow. Not so with John Wick. The smooth and steady camera shows off the incredible talent of its titular main character as he performs a highly choreographed ""dance of death,"" killing all who might confront him or impede his progress toward his vengeful goal. Surprisingly enough, because everything happens so quickly, the violence is almost toned down despite the enormous body count.Additionally, I liked the character of John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves). Not only is he calm, cool, and calculating, but the universe in which he lives shudders at the mention of his name. The whole ""infrastructure"" put in place to support Wick was just as fascinating and entertaining as the stories people would tell of his previous professional exploits. And while the premise for John Wick leaving retirement was flimsy at best, it drove home the point that you should never, ever cross this character.A revolutionary new way to do an action film, I give John Wick 4.0 stars out of 5.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Busting out his weaponry, Wick cuts a bloody swathe through countless bad guys en route to his target, always finishing with a shot to the head.The problem is that Wick is TOO much of a bad-ass. At no point did I feel like he was in real danger. Even after receiving a gash to the stomach the size of my fist and taking a severe beating, Wick makes Liam Neeson in Taken look like a pussy, escaping every situation with a flurry of fists and feet and umpteen carefully aimed rounds. It's as though he doesn't feel pain. It's hard to feel a genuine sense of excitement knowing that our hero (if a ruthless killer can be called a hero) is virtually indestructible.The action is well staged, and the level of violence is high enough to please many fans of the action genre, but I was left feeling more than a little empty. In fact, I was hoping that Wick would die at the end to finally be reunited with his wife (and his dog), but seeing as there is already a John Wick 2, the chances of that happening seemed quite low.5.5/10, rounded down for the novelty subtitles. Really, ordinary subtitles would have sufficed.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

Perhaps the perfect example of its genre. Easily a film that should have been bad but against all odds and including all tropes is an absolute delight.The cinema I saw it with cringed with every headshot and laughed at every sparsely applied line of cutting dialogue. It was a cracking, knee-slapping, riveting ballet written and directed by Max Payne.With reverence for comics, video-games, mythology, the creative team's history of action and their desire to create sequences both classic and totally fresh, John Wick is a true piece of art, an opera made of neon light, judo flips and gun-fu.When I heard about John Wick, a well shot, well choreographed, storyless action flick I thought, who cares. I already saw The Raid, fight scenes were good, Hummingbird was a pile of crap. I like gun-fu, and I love Keanu Reeves but how many strobing EDM-fuelled shootouts do I need to see?Turns out I could stand to see one more.The music fits every fight scene, providing a different tone to each one. The directors are fans of action flicks and they know what makes them tick in the mind of an audience member which is why there's about 10 smile-inducing beats a second. They're not here to get a quick buck, they want to make the right type of action-fuelled neo-noir.It's neither too generic or too outlandish, too swift or too laborious. It just totally works. Some nice beats exist, the fact that the father of the son knows he's an idiot, or two actors ripped from The Wire make an appearance, or a hitman hotel (something that is a such an simple and effective idea it's a wonder that it hasn't been done before). And Nykvist makes for a charismatic non-shouty bad guy which is refreshing.Like John Wick himself, the movie is relentless, sharp, brisk, terse, thoughtful and creative. If they made a thousand of these I would be a happy man to find out how they creatively diversified each time.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is also complete fantasy, a New York city where no one who dies has has family, no innocent people get hurt, and super-assassins stay in their own luxury hotel.The movie makes up its own rules, but it sticks to them: John Wick is destructible, he is not stronger than his enemies but merely faster, more resourceful, and more determined. His weapons run out of bullets, and do not do more damage than those of his opponents ... he just shoots them more accurately. It is not realistic - it isn't supposed to be - but the conflicts are balanced enough that his revenge feels earned.It is also stylishly shot, the small depth of field technique adds a otherworldliness, that does not distract from the entertainment but does serve I think to distance us enough from the violence that it doesn't feel sickening.But the best things about the film, what really makes it work, is the tight, focused plot, the minimal-yet-eminently-quotable dialogue, and the commitment of everyone in the cast to make their characters memorable.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"10","/10","An atypical action film that's Hollywood action cinema at its best!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4689694/?ref_=tt_urv","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46915265/?ref_=tt_urv","27 February 2019","There's a reason why John Wick works big time as an atypical action film.The film is dark, brutal and everything an extremely serious action film should be.The first 30 minutes are enough to prove this.Then we have some really unconventional action sequences that are both real and stylized at the same time. Keanu Reeves is really one of the greatest action stars, and this role is pretty much tailor-made for him.While the film might feel slow in the beginning, you can realize it later on that like any other intelligent action movie, it needed a proper setup to get us invested emotionally in the characters and action sequences that follow.John Wick turns out to be different from other killing-machine actioners in terms of its action and the universe it's set in. Every character has something to offer to the story, and the action sequences are filmed in a natural and realistic style. Honestly, I was expecting another quick-cutting action choreography like in most modern action movies (Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the quick cutting technique), but the long-take action choreography involving mostly guns won me over. This is Hollywood action cinema at its best.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So I thought why not give it a try. I've watched the Punisher....what could be worse than that. I can honestly say I've not seen anything close to this movie....John Wick. I've watched the Punisher, Taken 1, 2, & 3...and I can say....this movie beats them hands down. Brilliant acting. Little speaking. Keanu doesn't need to....he has a way with his look that speaks volumes. Lots of action. Amazing moves. Choreographer needs an award! Gets to the point of why he does what he does.....and why some people have to suffer. Matter of principal. Some people have messed with the wrong guy and a lot of people unfortunately are collateral damage because of one spoiled rotten brat. Whoever wrote the story line has a brilliant mine for detail. I wonder what the book reads like for the movie was chocked full of emotion, action, scenery, and good plot line with many little side roads to keep you wondering. This movie does what it is supposed to do....keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat not wishing to blink for concern one might miss something important. Bravo. I would watch it again withouthesitation....apparently my son is more worried about what I view than I am!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I must say, even as this flick is available really cheap these days that I thought this must be bad, that I was wrong. This is a great movie and to be honest, I liked it very much.The story itself is rather simple, you know, wife died, getting out of business, receiving a dog, getting robbed and dog got killed, it's payback time, end of story. But from the beginning until the end I enjoyed it very much, the score, the fight scene's the shoot outs, the way it was shot and edited (the way they shown the translation of Polish) everything was great, and the acting of all the thespians was way over mediocre.It never really becomes brutal or you don't see a lot of bloodshed or even say nudity it somehow doesn't matter because the action is what it's all about. A surprise it was in fact, Reeves shows that he can still carry a movie and it was so great to see all those well known names from yesteryear and nowadays working together. And for the lovers of muscle cars, it do contains a lot, the mustang, chevelle, charger and challenger are all in.

This was a turning point for Keanu Reeves, this is where middle-aged man broke every stereotype and became a legendary killer of hearts. He basically conquered the internet and all cinephiles with John Wick's performance.The plot is simple but this is exactly what it takes to introduce ruthless killing machine. You need only a slight push and a sledge of calculated revenge will go right down the track. Precise choreography of fights is absolutely amazing, you can feel the flow and all the skill set that John has developed throughout his career, but the age takes its toll, so you can see that humanizing rustiness. The gun wielding was incredibly entertaining, you could add it to the list of things you can watch forever, like fire and water.Another interesting feature is that the Russian language was spoken pretty decently without the iconic Jason Bourne random letter stuff. I mention this because it boosts Keanu Reeves' dedication to the role, even a smallest detail is approaching perfection in hands of this guy.Additional perks of the movie include an amazing soundtrack with Marilyn Manson's song ""Killing Strangers"" that immediately jumped into my playlist. Talking about a treat to your ears: voices of Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe as well as their on-screen presents are just a blessing.Overall, the movie is a keeper. I will definitely revisit it again, and recommend you to see for yourself this quality action that gives you the charge of brutality and dedication from one and only Keanu Reeves.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Sweet, stylish action flick that redefines Keanu Reeves as a visceral action hero","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3180491/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","9 February 2015","With the action genre running low on fresh, if not entirely original ideas over the past several years; this stylish action film starring Keanu Reeves as the titular character is one that comes with surprise. This movie sees Reeves reuniting with Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who served as the fight choreographers for the 'Matrix' trilogy, and redefining himself as a new hero with high-trained set of skills with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Although Reeves is no stranger to the action genre since he exploded as the visceral action hero Neo in the Matrix, this film pins the actor into a fine, polished role as a gun-totting hero facing down the guys. Calling this film is a game-changer in the genre would be saying a bit much, but it does indeed stand as one of the most entertaining films of the category. In further words, it shows the genre is still far from dead. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a former assassin devastated by the death of his wife. After days of mourning, Wick is surprised with a gift of cute little puppy to help cope with his lonesomeness. While trying to readjust to his life, Wick is visited by a group of Russian mobsters lead by Losef Tarasov (played by Alfie Allen), son of corrupt mob moss Viggo Tarasov (played by Michael Nyqvist), who brutally attack him, destroy his house, steal his Mustang, and murder his poor little puppy. In an act of revenge, Wick must rally up his former accomplices including Marcus (played by William DeFore) and chop shop owner Aurelio (played by John Leguizamo) to hunt them down.This movie provides action movie junkies with plenty of thrills and visceral action set pieces to fuel the adrenaline for most. Although the plot is rather thin and falls short of originality beyond a simple revenge story, the major driving force of the film is the dazzlingly choreographed action sequences along with the compelling character study of our tragic titular protagonist. From the opening scene, John Wick is established as a man with a grim past and faces a deep tragedy with the death of his wife from an illness that is never specified. The beginning effectively breaths humanity into the character without being overly sappy or manipulative, and the final product is a protagonist viewers can sympathize with; even when he journeys to the dark side of gunning down countless individuals. When the action begins, it is truly stunning. The first action set piece takes place in the main character's house where he fights and mows down an array of criminals in a sequence choreographed in a style of what almost resembles a poetic dance routine. And this scene is only the beginning of the enormously high body count he racks up throughout the film. While the action scenes stand out gracefully, the film's shortcoming perhaps come from the characters, mostly from the antagonist category. Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist both do their duty in the villain roles but fall victim to rather underwritten characters. Why did they try to kill John Wick, a explanation is never deeply explored (or at least not in a way that is understandable). And William DeFoe's character is given rather little to do. Overall, these come as only minor gripes and should not stand in the way to witness the alluring direction Chad Stahelski and David Leitch drive this fast-paced vehicle.John Wick is a sleek, stylish action thriller that redefines its charismatic lead actor as a visceral action hero, and at best, sprouts as a shining star in the slowly diminishing genre. This film may not shine as a game changer in the genre, it clearly sets a solid example of what meets the criteria of a good action flick.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is a strong with strong emphasis on structure, and storyline. This is a great movie, and a UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship offering too, as this movie was released internatinoally by Warner Bros. (although not the glorious narrow shield WB UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship, but post-narrow shield WB UPN/Warner Bros./WB flagship). I don't know if this ever aired on MyNetworkTV (it should, because that network is more popular), but back to the story.Everything about this movie is like ""GoodFellas"" (I reject the notion this is based on Greek mythology, being it implies that every bad thing about American society came from the Romans or Irish or Greeks, when Allied culture is purely Nordic and Yankees are Allied, yada, yada, yada, and Germanics were bad in history). It's realistic. John Wick is a former hit man who lost his wife. I think everyone knows the familiar story so I won't say it for those who saw the movie. One fatal event brings him back, as the posters do show, and in this movie we get a hard-hitting film: we see many great fight scenes, lots of gunfire and bombs to keep the action going. Strangely enough, with the exception of the Russian gangsters and some of the club scenes with the cuties, there isn't much in the way of cursing or sex. Toby Leonard Moore's performance is even more electrifying as Victor, the main arrogant gangster. This is a classic movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

So many things wrong with this...1. John Wick has serious communication issues. Basically the movie glorifies this guy who think it's okay to kill hundred while putting the public in danger because someone killed his dog and took his car.2. John Wick suppose to be a dangerous man. Well, his security system is bad. People apparently can just waltz into his house in the middle of the night unnoticed. Plus, I'm not convinced that unskilled thugs can just waltz into some ex-hit-man's house and kick his face in. Supposedly these ex-hit-man sleep lightly and carries something heavy at all times...3. Why do all the brainless thugs just walk into John Wick ""circle of violence"" with their guns drawn pointing down so they can get their face kicked in? Who does that? 4. Right, he doesn't miss anyone except when he tries to shoot at Iosef? That's a naked Iosef running around without shoes. Maybe John Wick is gay and wants some fine piece of Greyjoy for himself.5. Who the heck are these people and their stupid rules? Oh, no shooting at the continental or else we'll round you up with 4 guys all shooting at you standing in the middle. I was hoping they'd miss and shoot each other.6. John Wick never got his car back? And got a Dodge instead? John is okay with this? I'd keep on shooting until I get my freaking Mustang Boss back just to keep the story line consistent/less cramped with poo.7. The question is, ""Can Keanu Reeves sleep at night knowing how bad this movie is""? Wait, these people don't care. When you, as an audience, hold the bar so low you have only yourself to blame for bad movies.8. How is Marcus(Willam Dafoe's character) always at the right place at the right time? And how the heck would Viggo know that Marcus betrayed him when Viggo doesn't know anything most of the time? 9. Was it necessary for John Wick to take the stab from Viggo so he can break Viggo's arm and counter-stab? Wait, it is necessary. I was hoping they would both die from this stupid nonsense.This movie glorifies violence over senseless crap. The dog's live is worth more then the thugs went after John Wick. This movie is perfect for people who over simplify the world and want to resolve ""issues"" with over-the-top violence. The action will keep you mind occupied but at the cost of having to accept twisted logic.The thing is, I don't think John Wick ever wanted to retire and was hoping something like this would happen. Remember, this is the guy that doesn't really have job or hobby and likes to drive his car on some airport tarmac for fun while he feel sad for himself. Maybe that's why he let those thugs kick his face in in his own home. He needed a reason to go back to the only life he knew. I'll bet he was awkward as poo trying to live a ""normal"" life with the wife. Can you imagine how terrible it'd be trying to live with an ex-hit-man who has communication issues? Who knows, maybe the wife faked her own death so she can leave him since I don't think an ex-hit-man with communication issues can just casually breakup or divorce.What a dysfunctional piece of crap.","19 out of 42 found this helpful.

His wife had died and after a hold-up he instinctively sees a chance to snap out of his sadness and lethargy. He has been an assassin, a legendary mafia killer. Everybody knows that, even his friendly local policeman. Now he has a reason for revenge, to go back to work -- to live, to kill.John Wick's world is the world of organized crime. His vendetta will not lead him anywhere else. He's fighting against the Russian mafia organization he formerly worked for. His most important quality - repeatedly stressed by his former boss - is that he is 'a man of focus', which in a society with rampant attention-deficit disorder might well be considered a superpower. This world of crime is a rules-based order with draconic punishments for transgressions and its own currency, golden coins of a very inexactly defined value. In ""John Wick I"" the superstructure of the organized crime is represented by the hotel Continental, a gentlemen's club where everything is about honor and rules. It is a silly idea, but here it is just an unintrusive subplot giving this shoot-'em-up actioner an original and intriguing flavor.Keanu Reeves looks great, this is his most iconic role. The plot is straightforward, not too simple, not excessively complicated, the action scenes are pleasently staged and timed. It is so far from reality that it feels like a comic book adaptation, but if you can accept that, JWI offers a really good time. It doesn't go too much over the top.The three sequels do, head-on. The nearly almighty, all-knowing government of the crime world, the 'High Table', becomes the center of the Wick-story. It's not organized crime, it's totally controlled crime. Sometimes Wick's world seems to belong to the ""Matrix""-universe: Suddenly everybody turns into an assassin or passers-by completely ignore ongoing fights. Everything is about rituals, rules, Table manners. John Wick killing an endless queue of faceless thugs trying to off him gets more and more boring and ridiculous. In JW4 John Wick's main adversary is a blind super shooter, another man of focus. They are openly mocking their audience.The original ""Matrix"" and ""John Wick"" movies are great, because they walk the line between a conventional, relatable story and one that's just pretentious and nonsensical. Their sequels left the golden vagueness and embraced the most silly elements of their predecessors. Visually JW2 to JW4 are marvelous though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

At the end of the film, a menacing Russian mobster remarks that the veteran hit man John Wick looks like the John Wick of old. Reeves looks fantastic at 50 and is comfortably, securely back in action-star mode, reminiscent of Liam Neeson's recent resurgence in movies like ""Taken,"" ""The Grey"" and ""Non-Stop."" Keanu Reeves is still quintessentially Keanu, with a Zen-like calm that makes him both elusive and irresistible. His face belies the wisdom of his years, and he's smarter than he looks, but he doesn't go out of his way to prove it. John Wick is a character that allows him to be coolly confident, yet deliver an amusing, deadpan one-liner with detached precision. When the time comes, he can deliver with a graceful yet powerful physicality. John Wick (Bridget Moynahan) is forced to retire from his life as an assassin after Russian bad guys steal his prized 1969 Mustang and kill his dog, Daisy, a posthumous gift from his dying wife. Moynahan's character is barely even a person, but her loss provides Wick with a melancholy that lingers over his demeanor and every decision. ""John Wick"" is an aesthetically heightened, specifically detailed world in which Wick, his fellow assassins and other nefarious sorts inhabit their own parallel version of New York City. They have their own currency, gold coins, and frequent an upscale hotel and bar called The Continental. The courtliness of it all provides a welcome contrast to the non-stop carnage. You can check out any time you'd like, but you can never leave. John Wick is an action movie that combines the suave filmmaking of Skyfall, the sly visual humor of Die Hard, and the singular action sequences of John McClane, Jason Bourne, and John Wick. It is one of the best action movies of the decade and will be attempted to be replicated over and over again to middling success, but will always be remembered as a pinnacle of the action genre. John Wick is a world of interconnected hitmen and women who are part of an exclusive and elegant club called the Continental. It is a master show of world-building, with no exposition and trust that the audience can figure out the universe. This is rare in action and appreciated.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This better be the best movie of all time.Caution: minor spoilers.To clear one thing out: this movie is a action movie. Therefore it's focused on said thing: action.The main cause of action for John in the story - one which everything else settles around - is John coping with his late wife. She gives him a puppy. Cute. Until this point, we see John as a normal guy, sad guy, who lives in a nice house - which is hellish clean, it's a bit unsettling - and has a nice car.Then the mood shifts, after the son of a russian mobster (played by Mikael Nyqvist) steals not just the car but kills the dog and trashes his house. So John starts his revange and the story is put in the background and gets replaced by brutal action. But it's good, because it's executed perfectly - but they also manage it to make you remember the cause John fights for.In conclusion: this movie sure consists of a lot of action but it has hearth put into it and meaning behind it an let's you dive deep into the characters.So it's 10 stars for me, because it is not just thrilling but can also make you think about what you've seen. Either way, this is quiet simply THE Jihn Wick-movie for me and will be.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The sheer nerves when mentioning his name really makes the films what they are. John Wick has almost became a household name, the films aren't amazing but they give what you get once you already know what you're in for. This first film does a lot of world building, with the origin story being the stand out feature for me, the only downfall being that the soundtrack is a bit over the top, especially during the really intense sequences. Something more toned down or even nothing at all would work better for me. Overall, a brilliant introduction to a now famed character in cinema, the films may not be critically acclaimed or rated 10/10 on IMDB, but they achieve what they aim to, deliver brutal, entertaining, cinematic action.

Not only It made gutsy move in its story, It has best action scenes after Matrix/Jackie Chan movies. Yes! Jackie Chan movies!
I'm not saying that action is same as Jackie Chan movies. But it is taken in a single shot! Of course action is 1000x better than Jackie Chan movies. I don't like action scenes which involves too much Video cuts because it takes advantage of confusion instead of giving us real action (also it gives me nausea).
Well John Wick clearly broke the useless tradition of this decade and presented us with wonderful movie, with well polished story. This is a must watch!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

He loses all his things to need to protect and revenges himself on his enemies who deprive him of the dog which is sent from died beloved as a memory. Although the subject matter is dark and sad, I think that the audience loves him because his anger is intense and his quick action is bold and beautiful. Interesting point is that he is known well to people around. Everybody knows his ability to fight. He is wonderful killer. The audience can see the story from his angle, so they are able to feel as if they were really super strong. Anyone will come to like him. Another point which the audience should notice is that this film depicts the black society. To be able to watch what we basically do not experience is goodness of films.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is a very basic revenge story but the camera work and symbolism tells the story in a surprisingly well done way and I think this is some of the best acting Keanu reeves has ever done. The action is so so good and the set pieces are both visually outstanding and super interesting and expand the outside world of the universe. The film is super funny and they build up John wick in such a unique way. Finally the action is extremely realistic from the way the fighting happens, the way they use guns, the struggle and gritty realism of each action shot and even down to John wick having to reload everytime his mag would be empty.

Nowadays you see this type of thing coming out of Hollywood all the time. They have the budget, they know their audiences and good action flicks are always welcomed ... even if people pretend to want peace, love and goodwill towards their fellow man/woman ... the thirst for gladiators and blood sport lingers deep in the psyche of civilized man ... it's the way that it is. So why does it work so well in John Wick? Beats me as I've seen variations of this before. And yes they have turned this into a franchise, so now there is more John Wick 2 and 3 ... I am so glad there is. Never mess with a dog lover.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie introduces an appealing cerebral element that the director or screen writer along with a more layered antagonist making making for its own Bourne Identity (2002) character. The interplay between John Wick and his former partner is consistently developed and brings a tense evolving relational element not part of too many action thrillers. There are two lighter scenes which offer up a nice break in the action without having to sacrifice the serious dramatic tone of the movie. Entertaining, satisfying, and adding some nice new martial art touches. Worth the money to see it though.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action that Keanu Reeves does in this movie makes it so much better than when he was in the Matrix back in the early 2000's. What I also like about this movie is that his character is a little funny. Ya I know that the movie has blood and gore in it. But some of his lines are really funny small come backs. I did feel sad that his puppy had to be the first one to die in the early stages of the movie.

Everything about this film is well thought out and tight. The music is excellent, paring beautifully and fitting well with scenes. The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, the fight scenes are incredible, visceral and have a much greater sense of urgency and reality compared to other films. The story is plain but that is exactly what the films needs. It's almost ridiculous plot, if anything, adds to it's greatness. John Wick would do everything he did for something so ""minor"". The way the world is shown not told is also exceptional. It feels deep and interesting and real albeit over the top at times. This is done better than the later films which give too much exposition for the various things/factions. The way people just know who John is is wonderful to and seem scared.Everything is very well put together even down to the interestingly coloured subtitles when people speak languages other than English.Would absolutely watch again and again (and that would be near my 10th watch)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's one of the few non-superhero action movies, that wives and husbands can watch together, and completely enjoy it.While respecting the ""The Heroes Story"" timeline, John Wick mixes it up, and shows us all that all it takes to create a bad-ass Action hero and a great action movie (franchise).Shoot, kill, repeat. No senseless talking, explaining, dramatizing. John Wick does exactly what every single one of us watchers would want to do in his situation.Great movie, great fun, awesome Keanu.The only thing that could improve the movie would be Brendan Fraser.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is minimum cheese, and it's about a world that we can't really imagine exists.Yes, it's impossible, both in his actions, success and the world it's in, but that's the whole point of film, right? It's escapism, not a documentary. At least, I hope it's not a documentary, because if it is, I as never going outside again.Give it a try.

With a groundbreaking feeling on parallel to the release of another Keanu focused movie, The Matrix, action and fight sequences feel natural and steady. None of that shaky cam fake action.The movie doesn't add any unnecessary padding that doesn't feel necessary to the story. However, this sometimes plays to it's detriment when we see characters come and go that try to show complexity without the time to properly develop them and make us care.My biggest criticism would be in the antagonist's character, which seems to flip about halfway through the movie for no apparent reason, and feels wildly inconsistent in his behaviour and decision making.This movie reeked of comic book adaptation, and it's no surprise that a comic book series has been put into motion after the films release. It plays off the comic book balance of just enough origin story to grasp the protagonist's motives, but not too much as to ruin the mystery or close off possible story archs in future titles.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story was simple, a retired assassin lost his wife, and the arrogant son of a Russian gangster killed a dog, leading to a bloody path of vengeance. It seems silly but there was a bit of heart to the film as John Wick dealt with his grief and there was a tongue-in-cheek approach due to secret assassin world.The big selling point was the action. It came out when there were shake cam copycats, superhero fare, and safe PG-13. John Wick was a breath of fresh air since there was elaborate stunt work, gun fights, and a lot of violence. And the filmmakers did one important thing, they made sure they could follow the action sequences.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't think one can blame the actors to make the same facial expression throughout the entire move - I rather think that the story doesn't have characters but rather figures like in a chess game that you move from here to there and that can perform only a single type of movement.

The plot is a basic one almost bordering on ludicrous, retired hitman is wronged and seeks revenge but when the action starts, wow. Reeves is excellent as the hero, the action sequences are slick and original, the mood, lighting and soundtrack rocks. There is humour and originality in many aspects to the movie. I especially liked the hotel for Villains storyline, which I believe they may be turning into a TV series. A really good watch. I only had one real gripe. Reeves is wronged at the start of the movie by three/four Russian Mafia but then goes on a rampage where he quite easily slaughters hundreds without breaking a sweat. Surely these few hoods at the start could not take out such a seasoned assassin. Then again it is Hollywood and without it we would not have a movie so will let it slide.

"8","/10","John Wick the action and emotionally packed movie that doesn't shift away from violence","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5432862/?ref_=tt_urv","o-53907","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112805089/?ref_=tt_urv","24 January 2020","This movie is such an overwhelming film filled with so many exceptional action packed scenes that have insanely great choreography to match it. But at the same time the movie has spectacular dialog to help us understand why John Wick does what he does in this movie. Another fantastic thing in this movie is all the acting in this movie is just so perfect and acted out amazingly by every actor.
John Wick is about a legendary ex-assassin named John Wick (Keanu Reeves) who is brought back into the fold out of retirement from his violent career because some ruthless mobsters take away John's favorite car and kill the last present his wife gives him after she dies which is a puppy. But John releases the unforgiving killing machine inside himself and is out to get retribution for their actions. While at the same time the leader of the Russian mob named Virgo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) puts out a giant reward for John's head because he is trying to kill his son Losef Tarasov (Alfie Allen).
Directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch did a great job with this movie showing how they can make a really slick looking movie with superb action scenes but also create amazing dialog scenes to go with the movie. Both Stahelski and Leitch are veteran stuntman and in John Wick they really show how well they can direct a movie. Unlike Victor Armstrong who is also a veteran stuntman, he was great at being a stuntman but when it came to directing a movie it didn't go as great. Also I love how the directors are able to understand the whole action packed parts of the movie and just how wonderful they are to showing it. One of the only problems I have with the movie is the beginning and the ending to John Wick, it just seems so tacked on and could have been done better.
I would personally say that John Wick is one of Keanu Reeves best movie performances he's ever had to do, well all of the John Wick movies so far. But this is probably one of his best yet. John Wick requires so much out of Keanu Reeves from all of the stunt work he does to all of the emotional scenes. On a side note I would like to add that Keanu Reeves does almost all of his stunt work in John Wick so to get prepared for this movie he had to do a lot of extra training to get physically prepared for the movie. But I would personally say that it really paid off for Keanu Reeves to do the extra work.
In the trailer for this movie you see that some Russian mobsters kill his puppy and take his car and then he goes to seek revenge. I would say that in the movie it explains more into the reason why he goes seeking for vengeance and at first when you watch the trailer you're probably telling yourself how stupid of a reason that is to go on the bloody trail that he does in order for vengeance. But when you watch the movie from start to finish you start putting yourself into John's shoes and you are more understanding into why he does what he does.
Also when you watch the movie, you start to see how the writer (Derek kolstad) is kind of building the world that John Wick is in and how it helps set up for more John Wick sequels to be made and not seem forced on us. The writer creates this whole underground secret organisation of criminals. Unlike the movie series called The Maze Runner where at the end of the movie it just says and there's gonna be more movie. In John Wick it just builds the universe for more sequels to happen and it also shows the immense potential in the franchise.
John Wick is such a wonderful piece of work and I would recommend every action movie lover to see it. But also I believe that this movie would be great for almost anyone above the age of fifteen only because it is rated R. Also if you are a Keanu Reeves fan then I definitely believe you should see it due to his performance. But whatever you do when you see this movie don't view it for just the action. Take the whole movie all together.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

People say this movie has a good sense of humor but I missed it somehow. It's just 2 hours of total violence, shooting and killing.

I expected sheer enjoyment and that's what I got. 'John Wick' is good fun! It is more hammy than I thought it would be, not that that's a criticism. Some characters duck out surprisingly abruptly too (justice for Clarke Peters!), even when the one who should get taken out immediately somehow manages to stick around for a while.Keanu Reeves is always a pleasure to watch act. His character is a badass, that's for sure. If I'm being truthful, none of the others stood out to me too much - not in a negative way, just moreso they are all on the same level as each other behind Reeves. Willem Dafoe is the best of the rest, though.I look forward to checking out the sequels, which I'm expecting positive things from - especially with, presumably, bigger budgets.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

John Wick is about a man, a retired ex-hitman, who loses his wife. He gets a puppy as a last gift from his wife after she dies. Then his car is stolen and his dog is killed by some gangsters. Now John Wick is angry. Now John Wick wants revenge. Then the rest of the movie is filled with revenge seeking action. It's almost like one long action scene.It is a very entertaining action style. The gunfights are very stylish and innovative. His gun really feels like an extension of his arm. He is so confident with his gun. One would almost like to have a rating displayed and upgraded after every kill he makes. Like in the video game franchise Devil May Cry! The action is so smooth and stylish. I was so entertained by this movie, but I feel it has the potential to be even more stylish and entertaining, so it is good that there are sequels!Final stylish rating: B+","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keanu Reeves is at home in an action film and once again proves that he can do stunts as good as any actor out there even though he is well in his 50s. There's not much to write about John Wick because there isn't much of a narrative, but boy is it totally worth it.

However the things that set this film apart is the stylishness of the film and the incredible world it createsFirst of all, Keanu Reeves shows he still has what it takes to be a successful actor. He gives a multi layered performance as Mr Wick, and makes you fear this fictional character, and after watching the film i am thankful. One thing that adds to the film is that Reeves did that majority of his own stunts, this makes the action feel more fluid and the man even more bad-ass. After seeing Reeves in this film, i could imagine no one else in the role. The films strongest trait, is the fight sequences. Once the action starts, it never seems to stop. The fights are brilliantly choreographed and they seem realistic and brutal. The mixture of martial arts the character uses shows real skill, and adds to the realistic feel of the film and world created. John Wick proves himself capable of killing with both hands and firearm. If you're a fan of brilliant action sequences, then this is the film for you.The only criticism of the film is the plot. Although the story brilliantly creates a world of assassins, the plot itself is nothing new and has been seen before, however despite this i was left satisfied that i had not seen an action film like it.Overall, John Wick left me wanting more and is a real treat for action fans and Keanu fans. Bring on John Wick Chapter 2.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In John Wick, John sets out to revenge the men that wrecked his house, killed his dog and left him for dead or at least that is what it looked like. In Point Blank the protagonists. Carol O'Conner, John Vernon wish he was dead. Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy = Game of Thrones) also regret that John Wick didn't dieI confess I hadn't seen John Wick until now. I avoided it because I thought it was just a cheap shoot 'em up with bodies everywhere. Well it delivered that as well. That John Wick he goes beyond nine lives. The rest not so much. Anyway this turns out in the end to be a stylish neo-noir. Even some classic turns by Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane. Oh yes typical revenge flick but done with some decent dialogue, a story behind all the bodies and pulsating music. But gee the dog. What creeps.

The movie started with John Wick get out from a car while badly injured, then the screen goes black and showing him at his wife funeral. At the first 20 minutes of the movie, it's showing us about the daily life of a no one man named John Wick and how his dog killed and how his car get robbed too.
But after that 20 minutes running time, the movie started to show us about how badass he is and horrible his job world before. its turn out that John Wick was an ex-legendary hit-man that retired after his marriage. Even the car robber father who's was one of his old clients afraid of him so much and tell us how dangerous John Wick was that he killed 3 armed men just with a pencil. Then after that, the movie continues with John Wick shoots people in the face until the end of the movie.
As far as I know, John Wick is the best action movie series. This movie is just filled with pure action, there was never a dull moment happened. There is no pointless long dialogue that makes action sequence to sequence felt confusing. Every action sequence in this movie is amazingly executed, you will never have trouble to understand what happened in front of you. All you need to do is sit tight and enjoy the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie shows how cool Keanu Reeves can be, and that this movie was directed very well with a simple plot that we might have seen a bunch of times, but it works in this movie.Keanu Reeves as John Wick was fantastic; you understand where he comes from with multiple tragedies happening to him, involving his wife and his dog. Keanu Reeves was awesome in the action sequences doing great stunt work and a lot of shooting people in the face. He was simply great as an amazing assassination being dragged out of retirement and killing people for a justified reason.The action sequences are fun and cool to watch; a lot of them are in beautiful camera long takes with a lot of particularly good cinematography. The fighting style Jiu Jitsu Keanu Reeves uses in the movie was amazing to watch how skilled he was in the movements, and how much time he took to learn this style of fighting for the movie.The world building in the movie involving an assassin hotel called The Continental was remarkably interesting, and the friends that John Wick knew were interesting to watch. Also, some of the rules in this assassination world they are building were cool but also interesting on how this world runs.John Wick (2014) is a fantastic action movie that I recommend watching if you have not already. It has a simple premise we all know but the way it is executed and shown works very well, making this a fun movie to watch. This movie is also worth watching Keanu Reeves being awesome in such a cool character like John Wick.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Stunning.Ultimately, I could watch Keanu Reeves kill bad guys all day.9/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Noise complaint?Noise complaint.You know what makes John Wick revolutionary? It's not so much about the action as the presentation of it. If you notice, most of the sequences are shot with wide angle lenses, and that does two things: one, our focus lingers on the choreography, and two, these wide shots and longer spans in-between transitions and cuts make the scenes more believable and immersive.The use of practical effects, such as wire work and stunts, also contributes to the action's realism. Furthermore, sound design plays an important role in amplifying the impact of each hit and punch, making the action feel even more intense and visceral.Then you throw in a character such as Wick, who isn't like any other demented, troubled murderer but someone who has a calculated, willful mind. As he seeks vengeance for the death of his beloved dog, John Wick's character is not only unique but also relatable. His skills, backstory, and incentive combine to render him a compelling central figure for whom audiences can't help but cheer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The supporting cast, including Michael Nyqvist as the villainous Viggo Tarasov and Willem Dafoe as Wick's fellow hitman friend, adds to the film's gritty world-building.The film's cinematography and fight choreography are outstanding, with stunning visuals and brutal action sequences that make John Wick a standout entry in the action genre.

Everything about it is good. Script, cinematography, acting and music.The plot tells the story of a former assassin John Wick, nicknamed Baba Yaga. But at the very beginning of the film we see cutie Keanu and his loving wife, who soon dies of illness, leaving the main character a dog as a parting gift. And now Wick has only three things in life that are dear to him: a car, a dog and the memory of his wife. And they take everything from him except the third. So John goes for revenge...The film deals with how others treat John in a very funny way. Everyone goes to fight against him, as if it were a deliberate act of ending their lives.In the film itself, a lot of screenwriting work was done to create the lore of the secret world of killers. They have their own currency, their own hotel system and their own social package (doctors, gunsmiths, workshops, etc.)The camera work is top notch. All locations are so pretty and memorable. After the film, I spent two hours looking for where the real continental was located. The hotel looked very cool.The actors play in such a way that you believe them. I liked Keanu and William Dafoe the most. They are ideal for the roles of mysterious killers with a difficult fate.The action scenes stand out for their choreography; this is, in fact, the calling card of the film. The cartridges are running out, John is counting them and uses his own original moves during gunfights and brawls. I was also surprised by the fact that Reeves did all the stunts himself.Therefore, everyone who loves good action films, be sure to watch it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film follows a retired assassin who emerges from retirement following a devastating home invasion that results in the death of his beloved dog. Seeking vengeance, Wick hunts down those responsible, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake.Directed by Chad Stahelski (known for the John Wick series), the film features a stellar cast including Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man), John Leguizamo (Spawn), Ian McShane (Deadwood), Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones) and David Patrick Kelly (The Warriors).For fans of the action genre, John Wick is a feast for the senses. Reeves shines as the stoic yet relentless hero, while Leguizamo and McShane deliver captivating supporting performances. Dafoe's presence adds an extra layer of intrigue to the narrative. The film sets up its backstory and circumstances effectively, and the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. With well-choreographed fight scenes and impressive gore, the film keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The intense shootouts are executed with precision, making it easy to rally behind the protagonist in his quest for justice. Plus, the film boasts a memorable soundtrack that complements the adrenaline-pumping action.In conclusion, John Wick is a standout entry in the action genre, earning a solid 7.5-8/10 rating and a strong recommendation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

John Wick stars Keanu Reeves, Michael Nvqvist, and Willem Dafoe and is directed by Chad Stahelski (Who funnily enough was the Stunt Coordinator and instructing actor for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix) I enjoyed this film for the most part. There was some very good realism that you rarely see in movies, mostly in the action sequences (John actually reloads!!) They used really cool unique subtitles for the Russian dialogue. And some of the comic relief in serious situations was perfect! My issues with the film have a lot to do with the story, and characters I never was really interested in Mr. Wick or anyone else there. I found myself waiting for the next action sequence rather than enjoying the story itself. I also have had a hard time with Keanu Reeves ever since I first saw him in Hardball.That combined with my lack of excitement for most action movies today due to clichés is the reason I gave this a B (6/10). #JohnWick #KeanuReeves #Hitman #ActionMovie","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ridiculous ""shoot-em-up"" action throughout with no redeeming moments. I gave up after Reeves had slaughtered his 153rd victim with little more than a few scratches in return. One of Willem Dafoe's poorest performances and typical of Keanu's high-school acting. Even one of my favorite actresses, Bridget Moynahan drowned in the murky waters of this garbage film. The musical score sounded like it was produced by a bad garage-group of teenagers. The cinematography sucked and it took an uncommon staying-power and determination to sit through it 'til the end. This flick is a total waste of time and anyone who gives it more than a 2 has been smoking bad weed.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's like stepping into a septic tank.So let's keep it short. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, wearing a cloak of ordinariness. Some Russian miscreants insult him at a gas station. That night, they break into his house, beat hell out of him, steal his car, and kill his dog. Well! The beating, yes; the car maybe; but the dog -- NO! His response is first-order change. He knows who dunnit because he just retired from a Special Ops group and he's skilled at martial arts, the use of deadly weapons, and has a talent with macramé. None of these guys with a hidden past ever turns out to have been a busboy or a plumber. Similarly, the bad guys, as here, tend to be either Germans, Russians, or Arabs. We've never quite forgiven the Germans for World War II. Russia was balanced on the fence but now with Putin in charge, a dictator manqué, they seem to be fair game again. I'm certain that in the crepuscular recesses of Hollywood board rooms they are DYING to drag Muslims into the narratives but it wouldn't be PC now, would it? The plot? Oh, the plot. John Wick shoulders his way through a crowded night club where the Russkies hang out and shoots everyone who looks disagreeable. His gun is quick. And he's thorough. One ugly adversary gets three bullets in the abdominal cavity and one in the center of the forehead. The wounded lying on the floor, he shoots and kills more or less in passing, not really paying much attention to them. That's just the first brutal encounter. Several others follow.In between massacres there are a few minutes of metaphysical discourse. ""John, what happened? You and I were colleagues."" ""Yes, but bonds fade with time."" ""Surely some symbolic interactionism persists."" ""Well -- YES AND NO."" ""At least as the systemic level!"" ""But not as individual traits."" ""But how can you KNOW that?"" ""My epistemological intuition."" (Bang, shoots interlocutor in center of forehead, dead center on the saggital suture.) By the end, Wick has either killed or brought about the death of dozens of men and women. Willem DaFoe dies horribly, for reasons never explained. It was just time for another bloody killing, I guess.Someone else suggested that this was a perfect action movie because it had nothing much other than perfect action. And if you don't like action movies, then stay away from them. I suppose I don't like most action movies -- the Stallones, the Schwarzeneggers, the van Damms, although I have a few on DVDs if they have something going for them besides blood -- if the narrative is properly jelled (""The Bourne Identity"") or if its so silly it's amusing (""The Terminator"") -- but ""John Wick"" takes itself seriously, as if it were structured in a way that distinguishes it from one of those skin flick with just enough of a thin plot to link the sexual episodes, the genre that begins with a happily married couple, then drags in a new lover for each, then the chauffeur, then the mule, and so on. Yet, the perceptive viewer is able to discern a moral message beneath the mayhem. Leave dogs alone.Why go on? John Wick, Chapter 2, is already in theaters.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

Of course Keanu Reeves is the heart & soul of the film but we also got Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, & Lance Reddick. All very talented. But I gotta hand it to Keanu. There was actually a scene where he made me emotional. His line delivery caught me off guard. I can't say I've shed a tear for Keanu's performances before now. He did such a good job.The concept is really cool. Any sort of Assassin or Secret Agent premise is solid. John Wick is thankfully one of the many takes on the idea that didn't fall through and had solid execution as well. It really throws you off though given how John Wick throws himself back in the Assassin's Creed. Not only do you not expect it but it's unnecessarily tragic... Let's just say that next time I get on the Sims 4, I'm going to create John Wick and give him all the dogs he deserves.Really enjoyed all the fighting sequences. They're all well choreographed and believable to some extent. It also looks like Keanu a lot of the time, as if it's not just a lot of crazy motion blurring a stunt double. It actually looks like he did a lot of the fighting, which I think he did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No, it plays to its one strength and it does this very well and relentlessly. Non-stop gunfu action.The movie is a graphic display of Mr. Reeves' intense training and time spent becoming a martial arts expert and marksman. I think this feat is actually more impressive than the film itself, and videos of his training truly made me appreciate the cinematic expose far more than if I had just watched the movie.There are some standard tropes - Russian mobsters and a guild of assassins. The rest is all a gun-play fuled revenge fantasy where John Wick becomes an unstoppable juggernaught of fury murdering the ever-loving snot out of each and every Russian Mafia lacky on screen for the next 80 or 90 minutes.It is glorious mindless violence and noise.

Huge disappointment I am legitimately annoyed that I watched that, at times it was so cringe worthy, I wanted to look away.The plot is very shallow. There is little character development and the action movie clichés are off the radar. Its like a pre-teen action movie enthusiast wrote this and no one critiqued it. My favorite part was John Leguizamo's scene, but its all downhill from there.I thought maybe Keanu wrote and directed this himself since he is so adept at shooting guns in real life, and maybe he wanted to show it off. Also since you would have to be so full of yourself to even do this movie. But the firefights were boring and as you can imagine, gun handling prowess is not exactly entertaining.The thing is, straight from the beginning you can tell its bad, but you say, well maybe it will get better. There is nothing original about the badassness being displayed, it is painfully contrived. I am gonna have to draw up an action movie script myself to see if maybe being original is hard at this point just to try to justify the staleness of this movie.The whole boogeyman thing was corny, and Keanu did not do anything we haven't already seen a million times before. And how about when he was taking a shower and all you see is the Pillsbury dough-boy and you expect me to believe he is the deadliest killer alive? I would have liked to have seen a more cerebral assassin style of rampage mode movie. Do not recommend, I would recommend Wanted over this its got a better stylized action.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Its not that there's anything wrong with either Bruce or Sly, its just that they've made an unfortunate number of mediocre films in recent years in an effort to keep themselves relevant. Willis' recent ""Death Wish"" folly is an example of a film that shouldn't have been made, and yet he seems all too eager to make this rip-off of an altogether superior Bronson film. Indeed Hollywood in general has developed an industry of unintelligent, one dimensional action films, most of which are lack lustre remakes, and - through the miracle of marketing - have made them disproportionately successful. The golden era which produced Dirty Harry, Rambo: First Blood andTerminator(s) 1 and 2 appeared a distant memory in the wake of the Cranks, average Expendables sequels and the never ending stream of The Fast and the Furious films. All hope seemed lost for a decent action film which had both entertaining action sequences and some measure of intelligence applied in its creation.Enter John Wick.The film weighs an apparently simplistic revenge plot against a counter balance of ironic black humour, stylish cinematography, exceptional fight choreography and a star who approaches the eopnymous charcater as though he were performing in a serious dramatic role. Keanu Reeves' class adds credibilty an sympathy to a character that wuld have appeared predictable and dull had some action has-been been cast. He invokes the quiet, underplayed menace of Bronson in his best roles while also injecting a wry sense of locaonic wit.Overall, I diodn't expect to enjoy this move as much as I did. Previously, I've found Reeves' earlier catalogue to be a litle trying, but since the Matrix he appears to have evolved into an altogether different class of actor. He brings the method intensity of a younger De Niro to roles which other actors would consider throwaway action stereotypes, and would only play them as such. Reeve's Wick is both terrifying in his capability for violent retribution and also tragic in his isolation and grief, something which surely cannot be said for Bruce Willis' Paul Kersey rip off. So if anyone is on the fence, sit down and hit play on Netflix (UK, I can't vouch for other regions). I was expecting, as I've said numerous times, a dull and over-hyped revenge flick. What I watched might just be a modern masterpiece in this genre, both in its narrative simplicity and artistic approach, and I find it hard to fault.Watch it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The nasty guy and his friends not just stole his nice car but also killed his cute little dog. Now he is seeking for revenge. The whole story is told in the first quarter of an hour and the remaining film is focusing on the merciless seeking for revenge.Not too much surprising content: A lot of clichés, black and white characters, not even the dialogues are too bright either. Funny impressions just arise from the absurd exaggeration in violent scenes.A certain amount of dullness and murderous frenzy is very helpful to enjoy the amount of blood squirting out of heads and chests during almost the whole film.Mr. Wick knows no mercy and there's no satisfaction until the last one is dead. Unfortunately that takes incredibly long: You will inevitably get bored of it although there are some minor variations in the killing methods presented. Don't trust the average rating of this film: it's possible that the ratings are provided by some enthusiastic violence and / or car lovers and / or numb heads among those who are switching their brains off as soon as the film starts. All you disappointed viewers: Why don't you share your opinion to balance this completely inappropriate good rating for this film???","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

The film basically has 2 directors (and one is scheduled to direct Deadpool 2 so there's that), and since both come from a background of doing stunts from dozens of your favorite action movies, this film gets boiled down to its essence. They aren't going to try wowing you with a special plot; no, they're going to deliver high-octane action. And really it's quite successful. Keanu did some major training for the highly choreographed scenes and performs most of his own stunts, and the result pays off. Expect a high body count, and expect many of them to have some really cool kill shots. This film knows its goal is to entertain with cool, quick action, and that's exactly what it does. I will say, however, one of the best and worst parts comes from the beginning. The film honestly almost takes an Up approach of giving the audience all the exposition it needs in a small time without much dialogue at all. And I love that. But it-along with just a few action moments-gets heavy-handed. Like at one point Keanu is grabbing all his guns and gearing up, and the movie blares a rocking song about guns and killing and it feels a bit too obvious. I wasn't going to talk about the plot because, well, who cares for this film, but it leads to my other critique. The film gets a nice supporting role from Willem Dafoe and gives way too little screen time to John Leguizamo, but the plot gets going after a mob boss's son steals from John Wick and leaves him for dead. This son, Iosef, is annoyingly stereotypical. He's brash, arrogant, and above all else, completely inept. He fits the bill of all the stereotypes, and it just makes you wonder how long it will take John Keanu Reeves Wick to hunt him down. It's been awhile since an action film has had this much style to it. It overcomes typical shortcomings by thoroughly delivering in well-executed action scenes.

Then throw in some of the best backdrops to modern cinema, a great soundtrack and a very unique story!! All = 10/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

For all the people who haven't watched - take your time and don't rush.I was quite impressed by the cinematography of this movie and the long shots accompanied by the neon lights are one of the main highlights of this movie. After all Keanu Reeves had a great comeback thanks to John Wick. The supporting actors also did justice to their roles by acting stupendously.Last but not least this is a dark film and doesn't expect people to be empathetic in these kinds of movies and that is the beauty of films like this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Three men and a pencil, the result choreographed art!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9057145/?ref_=tt_urv","kelboy10","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43102122/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2023","The narrative of John Wick isn't one of complexity, somebody manages to piss off the man they send to kill the boogeyman, still, the final product is one of great entertainment value. (Keanu Reeves) A ex hitman is suited and booted for this type of role nailing it whilst providing many of his own stunts. I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed this fast pace action from start to finish. One of the reasons for us being able to accept the linear narrative is because it brings high quality in different departments. We the audience feel John Wicks pain and anger in the early stages at the demise of his pet beagle puppy and therefore are able to empathise with him on his journey as he exacts revenge. First of all, the man has lost his wife; so he isn't somebody you'd wanna be messing with at this point in time. Secondly the guy took out three guys in a bar with a god damn freaking pencil! The build up to this epic legendary character is phenomenal at times leaving us waiting in anticipation as to what he might be capable of. Described by the man who becomes his nemesis early on we are well prepared for what might be a rollercoaster of carnage waiting to happen.So why am I impressed with the first entry? How come I only just watched this in 2023? And will I make it to the forth instalment currently in cinemas? I'm impressed with the level of cinematography combined with outstanding choreography, emulating various fight scenes to the highest level that keep me on the edge of my seat as well as being fascinating to watch. Believe me the carnage doesn't disappoint. It's just a really well shot movie with a dark atmospheric tone alongside neon club lights creating a palette of artistic nature. It's in a New York far distant from real world but it sets a mood sticks with it...And, really works! At times it's aesthetically pleasing in the eye, visually stunning. I saw the forth film advertised and decided to find out what all the fuss is about by viewing the original first. Often the first one tends to be the elite when it comes to film franchises as it is fresh whilst bringing you into the world of these characters for the first time.When we first meet John he is grieving a loss going along minding his own business until he is provoked into selling his car 'the mustang' by a group of Russian gangsters; which he refuses of course! This sets the dark tone, conflict seems eminent perceiving trouble ahead. (Keanu Reeves) is accompanied by an exquisite array of talent in this first movie that helps convey to us the high profile of status John Wick has built up over years as we join his journey at retirement stage. Retirement isn't on the agenda for people like Mr Wick though, as he soon realises he will be back in the thick of it all! Evidently it's a lifestyle you can never run away from, a grey ghost! (Willem Dafoe) Marcus leaves us guessing at times, having just enough screen time to keep us intrigued in his character arc. (Michael Nyqvist) provides us with some dark humour as Viggo Tarasov and I can't help but feel sorry for him as he finds himself in a predicament outta his control. The part is played effortlessly well with a natural and believable charm, an old school bad guy that isn't without sympathy. (Alfie Allen) Loseef Tarasov is the naive son of Viggo acting through brute force rather than thought, the entire movie you are rooting for Wick to catch up with him so he gets his comeuppance. (Alfie Allen) does a good job in making you hate him with a rather self absorbing entitlement feel to his character. Then we have the continental owner Ian McShane or to me (love joy) playing Winston the man who makes the rules that are clearly at some point to be broken. Each character has been well thought out to provide some sort of normality around this world of chaos; just another day at the office as fights spill out of control in the background. The most prominent scene furthering this point is when a police officer knocks on John Wicks door to warn him of noise complaints, only to brush it off as another busy night or a night with few things to sort out as John would put it! Providing female fatale is (Adrianne Palicki) as Ms Perkins there to take a bounty with a price on Mr Wicks head. It's hard to pick fault with any of the cast in this movie right down to Lance Reddick as the hotel manager, everything seems to fit and work perfectly.The most exciting and enticing part of this film for me is the freshness within the dark humour around the idea that everybody appears to be calm, they have come to terms with the fact that whatever disruption goes on around them it's just another day at the office. The continental provides a memorable backdrop too knowing that it's the one place where the rules must remain intact. You can see that although the plot is fairly simple a lot of thought has gone into the characters surrounding John Wick each either helping or hindering him throughout the course he takes. Which characters does John trust? What is his relationship with them? Each aspect gets you thinking as they are revealed one by one like a game of cluedo! If like me you are experiencing John Wick for the first time in 2023, trust me see it out, I promise you won't regret it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, I know the old joke that don't worry, a vegan will tell you he is vegan. When I first watched this movie, I was still early in my journey and thus had gotten all gung ho about animal rights, clean eating, and all that jazz. Since then, the vegan food market has exploded and Barnivore is a great way to figure out if your beer or wine is vegan. Basically, I have chilled out and am not so in your face about it. But I will still stand up for veganism. Anyway, where was I?Oh yes, John Wick. When I heard the premise, I knew it was for me. I had recently adopted a couple of little dogs of my own so I was really in the whole paternal spirit for animals and the preservation of animal lives. My local vegan community was a little perplexed how to label this film. In a way, it had the universal appeal to us as a violent rage fantasy in the name of animal rights, but it also had a pretty grounded outlook on the events that lead our titular character back into a seedy and admittedly cool world. Even with my car broken down, I walked to the cinema near my house and waited for the thrill ride. I was not disappointed.If you have never seen a single John Wick meme or gotten a laugh out of it due to not seeing this blistering and violent masterpiece, you are living a sad life. Keanu goes on a killing spree because his dog got killed. Okay, but also it was due to the memory of his wife being defiled (who was most likely his only emotional link to the ""real"" world), and also due to his sweet Mustang being stolen. For any emotionally stunted male, this would send anyone into a blood lust rage. What made this even cooler is several hands from the ol' Matrix trilogy came to help out, which is why anyone that claims to love the Matrix might have a sweet fondness for this film.The world building is top notch, the fights are awesome and Keanu is believable as this retired hitman. While the sequels went bonkers due to the added budgets, the clean simplicity of this film makes it much more endearing than its sequels. Either way, watch this film for the underrated cast, the great fight scenes and the overtly cool world that makes you wish you were a part of the carnage.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He's smarter than he looks but he's in no great hurry to go out of his way to prove it to you–at least, not on screen.A character like John Wick is right because it allows him to be coolly, almost mythically confident, yet deliver an amusing, deadpan one-liner with detached precision.

The story is about a retired assassin who exacts revenge from thugs who have stolen his car and killed his dog. We witness a basic revenge story, but with sensational fight scenes. The movie is so engaging that it doesn't need elaborate set pieces from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise and larger-than-life action sequences from the Transformers franchise. The fight scenes are one-take shots so the actor and the stuntmen have practiced the moves like a dance number. It's very obvious that Lionsgate unlocks another cash cow franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","New Action Classic!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4878937/?ref_=tt_urv","mitchell5954","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42936359/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2019","John Wick is easily the best action film since Skyfall. I might even like this more than Skyfall actually. This is better than any of the Expendables films, even Expendables 2. John Wick is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes all-out with it. This film doesn't try to be something it isn't or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience. This film is really what the film Machete should've been. Machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films, but it really wasn't. It tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing. This film knows what it is and it is really refreshing. Keanu Reeves brings his A-game, as does all the side cast. The action is great and well-choreographed. The villain is badass and humorous at the same time.The character, John Wick, is definitely a badass you don't want to screw with. He doesn't talk much and he doesn't need to. He lets his actions speak for him and he's merciless. He doesn't screw around at all. He reminds be a lot of Liam Neeson in Taken. This film has a very similar feel to Taken. For example, I like how it's basically John Wick verses everybody for the most part. Dafoe helps him out a bit but it's mainly John by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was Liam Neeson by himself wiping-out a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation. There is no pointless love-interest, goofy sidekick, or stupid comic relief characters put it. It's just John Wick by himself which is how it should be. However I like this film more than Taken for a couple reasons that I'll get to.What's particularly cool about Wick is just the amount of build-up and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain. What I like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly John himself. Everyone in this film respects John Wick and/or fears him which makes all the more badass. This shows that Keanu Reeves is great if given the right role. Many people trash him but I never found him a bad actor.Another thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters. William Dafoe has a smaller role as John's old friend and fellow Hitman. Dafoe is always awesome in any role he's in. You can put him in a lame Goblin costume straight from the set of Power Rangers and he'll come out awesome. The rest of the cast is equally memorable. The side characters don't get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presence.The villain, Viggo, is okay. I like that him and Wick know each other, have worked together before, and that Viggo has a respect for John and is even quite scared of him. The way he describes John in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out he's back I find quite funny and awesome at the same time. He could've just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for Wick, but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him. This is the reason I like this film more than Taken. In Taken the side characters weren't very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case here.The action is great as I said earlier. The fights are well-choreographed and there is hardly any shaky-cam. It's R-rated so they go all-out and it gets bloody. The film looks great and has an atmosphere to it. The length is just right for the film this is. If it was any longer it would've felt padded-out as some action film of late have.Overall, John Wick is a new modern action classic. It is definitely worth checking-out if you're into action films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nevertheless there is little I have to complain about this film.NOW SPOILERS AHEAD! I think it simply a near perfect film about how a oddly relatable super assassin who is just grieving the loss of his wife and just wants to be left alone and have some semblance of peace in his life but some punks who think they are just the coolest guys ever come in and break into his home kill his dog and foolishly because they are typical foolish thugs leave the man alive... from the beginning of the film up to that point you are 120% on John Wick's side as he effortlessly just dispatches men like they are ants with the mob boss running scared doing everything he can think of to keep the legendary Baba Yaga from slaughtering him and his entire family and his entire syndicate even attempting to hire a man that could have possibly picked off John Wick but ultimately betrays his own mob boss client in favor of John at the cost of his life. I really don't have much bad to say about this film other than it is admittingly silly and over the top but that is also what makes it so charming and fantastic and the film even is aware that it is silly but yet it's entertaining from beginning to the very end.

However, a run in with gangster's son Iosef (Alfie Allen) results in his home being invaded, and his pet being brutally murdered. This sets the fire raging in John's heart again, and before long, he returns to the streets to enact brutal revenge. However, Iosef's father is Viggo (Michael Nvquist), a Russian mob boss and his former employer.It's remarkable that, while far better actors have descended into a DVD bargain bin hellhole from which there seems no return, Keanu Reeves would still appear to have the star power to headline a Hollywood action film. He could be comfortably settled into that world quite nicely now, but here he is in this fairly well received action film. Quite hard to fathom why, really, when what we have is a fairly standard, join the dots piece of work, with unexciting action scenes that are too sped up and hyper kinetic to make any impact.While Reeves broods, and does the action hero typeset that he's so suited to, singer Lily Allen's brother Alfie appears as the despicable young villain, and the likes of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo are drafted in as support. Its appeal seemingly lies in its simplicity, with what seems to be a deliberately straightforward, uncomplicated plot that takes you from A to B pretty easily. It does this pretty competently, but rather than be an admirably simple bit of fun, it's just a piecemeal, ineffective affair that washes over you like rain. **","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

This was amazing. Well choreographed fight scenes. Gun battles so fantastic that the film even pokes fun at itself with a video game scene with gun battles.I knew nothing about this film, other than it existed. So I was hit hard by the first 10-15 minutes. I'm not putting spoilers in an almost 10 year movie, but I was not expecting that at all.In all fairness, if that had happened to me, I would have reacted exactly the same way. Sort of. I'm not a retired hitman, but metaphorically. Revenge is sometimes appropriate. And in this situation, I applaud it.I found interesting that our main character, Mr. Wick, has an honor code that he practices. I know this sounds silly, but, he only kills who he has to, even if that means ""Anonymous Henchman number 6"". I found the scene with Francis touching, to be honest,Another silly thing I enjoyed was how John seems to be a well respected member of the community, with the most interesting interactions with people you would not expect.I am looking forward to watching the sequels, because, well, I think pretty much the entire city of New York was wiped out in the bloodbath.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

ACTIONThe set up has John Wick (Keanu Reeves) in the middle of the night pulls up at a gas station with his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang is being observed by Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and he offers to buy it from him. And as soon as Wick refuses, Iosef and his goons decide to wait for him at his place of residence beat before taking his Mustang from him, including shoot and kill his beagle. And by the time, Iosef brings the mustang to his dad's garage to get it refurnished, we then find out more about the character he took the car from. As soon as Iosef's father- a Russian gangster, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) found out Aurelio (John Leguizamo) smacked and refused service to Iosef, he informed him by phone that it was John Wick's car that his son had brought to the shop. And it was at that point, Victor hung up and demanded to see his son. And as soon as he sees him, we know more about the character of John Wick, who had just lost his wife a few days ago and is still in the grieving process, with the only thing she had left with him was the beagle. Without Iosef knowing about Wick's past history as a professional assassin who used to work for his dad, that the reason why he did not work fro him anymore was because he wanted to settle down and have a family. And now Wick has his eyes set on executing Viggo's only son, which this set up is nothing more but a backdrop to showcase Wick doing his thing which is to take out as many people Viggo can send over to him, including a bounty on his head. And as the movie continues the world of assassins created by the movie is a hotel where professional hit mans hang out, introducing us to the owner, Winston (Ian McShane) and his receptionist, Charon (Lance Reddick) with William DaFoe starring as another former hit man Marcus. Out of the four John Wick movies I had seen thus far, the first one is still my favorite, even though the others had more action sequences, this one had a mystique that a mythical tone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For the most part, there's a hero who spits into the soup of the bad guys. But John Wick is not like that. He was basically a bad man, meanwhile married and on the right track. But his wife dies, and he gets caught up in it. Only his wife's last gift, a puppy, pulls Wick back into reality. However, members of a Russian criminal association are upset by all this, and John Wick has to take revenge for the lost hope.
This basic concept is simply brilliant. John Wick specifically sucks on clichés. The leader of the criminal organization, Viggo Tarasov, is a true mafia leader, respectable, and no one dares to contradict him. Michael Nyqvist's play helps with that. Every single movement is dignified and absolutely convincing. In contrast, his son Josef is an unfortunate little dick.who lives in the shadow of his father, without whom he cannot even breathe. The casting is completely understandable as to why Alfie Allen was given the role. Specifically, this role Theon Greyjoy is only small. Not only is it not so much mentally ill, but it still brings a correct shaping. Willem Dafoe as Marcus the big old assassin is fantastic. Dafoe's role is very small, but still very important. Ian McShane, as the owner of the Continental Hotel, works here like a real boss who connects the criminals and no one commands him. It has its own rules and acts accordingly. Yet the loosest supporting character, Charlie, is the cleaner, who specifically summons Pulp Fiction's problem solver, Winston Wolf. He is an equally loose yet powerful figure.
And Keanu Reeves proves that he can still act as an action hero after the Matrix. The motivation of his character is completely understandable. After all, the dog has a symbolic meaning. It symbolizes attachment and humanity. The film also excels in the technical field. The film cut is tight and well scheduled. The parallel cuts are simply brilliant. The cinematography work is also very nice. Its brilliance goes well with the dark mood of the film. Both the bar scenes and the street fighting photography are very strong.
The screenplay for the film (Derek Kolstad) is very super written. It feels like the screenwriter is at home in the world of action movies. There's a mystique to Wick's character that makes it clear why he's such a good assassin. This film is reforming the world of action movies. Instead of blank visuals, we get a determined, motivated protagonist who makes the entire film himself. The main evil is a loose yet ominous figure. The action scenes are hectic and it's good to watch these scenes. A pleasant fun action dump that nails all the way in front of the screen. An unmissable creation. His sequels are sure to carry on Mr. Wick's revenge campaign and complete revenge.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So now, here's an action movie starring Keanu Reeves that's shot like a music video. I am overwhelmed by the accumulated dumbness. Imagine PAYBACK with Mel Gibson, only without the wit, guts, human suffering, and wisdom. And Mel's been replaced by Tab Hunter, Frankie Avalon, or someone like that. Imagine THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, only without the romance, elegance, tension, and simmering sexual heat. There's no Mira Sorvino here, and Chow Yun Fat has been replaced by Beavis and Butthead.All through this movie, there are moments that are laugh out loud stupid, where the film makers clearly expect the viewers to fall into a worshipful stupor and start jacking their bones. Wow, look how fast that car is going! Man, that is a sharp looking car! I am getting so hot now, just looking at that car! And the music is so LOUD, man. LOUD MUSIC MAKES ME SO HOT! And now guys are getting killed! Man, I love to see guys getting killed. LOUD MUSIC CARS GUITARS GUNSHOTS OH MY GOD I'm COMING RIGHT NOW!!!! And of course, Our Hero must look ""cool"" at all times. He can't just take his guns out of the closet. No, he has to take a SLEDGE HAMMER and SMASH the floor to dig out his old guns! So cool!!! And when the bad guys are coming, he has to put on a sharp, three-piece suit, with cuff links, so he can fist fight and pistol his way around. I mean, a ripped t-shirt and jeans might be better, yes? To move fast and have quick reflexes? But no, it's so much COOLER to watch him put on a suit and tie. With all that going on, take some time to notice the sadness on the faces of all these veteran actors. There's that old black guy from THE WIRE -- he looks almost grateful to be getting killed after five minutes. There's Willem Defoe -- he still hasn't forgiven himself for making all those Spider Man movies. Oh, but it's not just aging has-beens who are being humiliated here. Who's that good looking young chap running through the crowded disco in a towel? Can it be . . . can it be . . . it's Alfie ""THEON GREJOY"" Allen. Did you see him running through the crowd, looking like a goofball? No? Let's slow it down! How many minutes of Alfie running in a towel do we need to see? But it's okay, he's got tons of music blasting away. And it's LOUD!I really wanted Keanu to ask Alfie, ""did you pay the IRON PRICE for that car you stole?"" And then Alfie's last words could have been, ""what is dead may never die!""","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Believe it or not, a lot of thought has gone into the construction of this tale of atonement; everything from setting up value, leaving key details ambiguous, and a very astute script; one which absolutely adds weight to the esteem of the titular character. ""John Wick"" is not your average shoot-em-up, and it's no surprise that the series has continued success.Direction of ""John Wick"" has wisely been kept in the capable hands of Chad Stahelski, and its future may very well hinge on it. Producers sticking their crooked noses into development of Hollywood material is nothing new, but in the case of this series, Basil Iwanyk and his peers either know better or do so discretely. Derek Kolstad was already a successful screenwriter before this film, and his talent is notable. In the script: when a policeman comes knocking on Wick's door and notices commotion, your typical, horrible, Hollywood screenwriter would have had the man get involved immediately. A decent writer, instead, would have had the officer simply offer help. Kolstad goes beyond any typical thinking and has the policeman recognize Wick and immediately bow out! The absolute brilliance of this take cannot be understated, as writing this simple moment cements in the viewer the depth of respect Wick has achieved in his profession. Similarly, when Aurelio, at the car shop, notices something is wrong, he doesn't reveal the details of the issue to Iosef Tarasov; any average writer would be itching to splurge all the minutiae to the audience immediately. Kolstad, instead, withholds information, enriching his characters and deepening the value of the screenplay.A host of colorful characters, sudden twists and turns in the story and all the trappings of flawless Hollywood combine to make ""John Wick"" an American action classic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""John Wick"" is a top tier action revenge flick worthy the likes of ""Point Blank."" Keanu plays a grieving recently widowed husband who then suffers a group of punks breaking into his home, stealing his '69 Mustang, and killing his dog. What the punks don't know is that Keanu is a retired hitman for the Russian mob who now has nothing left to live for except revenge. To complicate matters, one of the punks happens to be the irresponsible son of the head of the Russian mob who Keanu once worked for, pitting the two former allies against one another. Keanu then roars and rampages and gets bloody satisfaction, leaving a ridiculous number of bodies in his wake. Directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (uncredited due to DGA issues), who both worked with Keanu doing stunk work on The Matrix films, made a knockout directing debut. The action is terrific, both the hand-to-hand martial arts and the shootouts, not appearing as fantastical as The Matrix and a bit more down to earth and physical, but are still jaw droppingly impressive in their choreography. Written by a first time screenwriter, Derek Kolstad, he's crafted a lean, efficient, no nonsense script. The story is straight out of the old school Walter Hill style of stripped down storytelling. The filmmakers even had the wisdom to cast a few Hill film alumni in this picture, David Patrick Kelly (""The Warriors"" ""48 Hrs."" ""Last Man Standing"" in a memorable small role as a clean-up/body disposal service guy), Willem Dafoe (""Streets of Fire"" ""Dead For a Dollar""), and Ian McShane (""Deadwood""). The film even has Hill's usual nameless-urban-city type of setting. Top off a tight script and terrific action with an amazing supporting cast of character actors who, besides the aforementioned Hill actors, includes John Leguizamo (as a chop shop owner who does a great job of subtly building up for the audience how dangerous a man John Wick is), Kevin Nash (of WWF/WCW fame), and Clarke Peters (""The Wire""), it's impossible not to love this film! You also get some bigger names like Michael Nyqvist as the Russian mob boss, Dean Winters as his consigliere, the under appreciated Adrianne Palicki as a former colleague of Wick's and now rival hitwoman, and you even have Bridget Moynahan as Wick's wife for all 8 seconds of her screen time. Overall, this is probably the best action film to come out of Hollywood in years and hopefully moves action films aways from the overblown Michael Bay and Wachowski Brothers bombastic style of action. Focusing on the action film basics of stunt work and simply letting the camera capture the action has given us the most badass action flick you'll have seen in year. BONUS FILM SUGGESTION: If you want to see another contemporary back-to-basics style of action flick that seriously delivers the goods, check out the Indonesia action flick ""The Raid: Redemption.""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We're introduced to a very interesting hit-man type of underworld and a what feels like a throwback to the 80's style of action films minus all the unnecessarily large explosions and awkwardly placed sex scenes. Some very impressive action scenes, decent comedy, a good plot, fitting soundtrack and a very appreciated backstory made for a great ride. Beyond that, it's hard to find negative things about this film, the only bad thing I can really say is the villain(s) felt very generic and boring, very forgettable.

The story IS basic, though I have to say that the love story is more compelling than the entirety of the ""Twilight"" series in the span of 2 minutes and 10 seconds. The subsequent 3 minutes and 5 seconds pounds it home even more and only the hardest of hearts isn't at least made misty eyed.From there, it is a story of revenge and the mystery of John Wick is revealed. It's obviously meant to be an over the top spectacle, but that is where it EXCELLS.The SPECTACLE.The cinematography is second to none. This should be in EVERY Master's class on cinematography. The use of colors, grading, bokeh, framing, etc. Is just ON POINT. It doesn't matter who you are, this is a MUST SEE. Even skittish YouTube reactors who have seen this may get turned off by the violence, but they all say that it is one of the most beautiful movies they have ever seen.

When a gangster breaks into his home, kills his dog and steals his car, he is forced to return to active duty and begins his revenge.To begin with, the plot of the film, which had everything to be great, did not please me as it should, until it starts potentially well, but then it gets lost, unfortunately. Besides, the script is very predictable and basically everything that happens next is boring and loses a lot of logic (does that mean John was a famous and skilled killer who was also part of a mafia? Oh, man ...However, the most impressive thing is the violence of the film, which some found for free, and I even agree with that a little. There came a time when it was very tiring throughout the film. Unfortunately, the film apparently chose to leverage that point.On the other hand, the film is not entirely ignored, the fighting choreographies are very good, to say the least, and are merely watchable today, but not enough to make up for what should have been the film's strong point: the story .Well, I don't know if I'm going to check the other two sequences, because it probably must be more of the same: a skilled killer with cold-blooded killing and blood spurting everywhere ...I regret the laziness of writing this text, but it is my first analysis of a film.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Chad Stahelski and team break free from the now overused shaky cam to hide mediocre acting and push their stars and stunt team to give us some of the best action sequences in film since The Matrix. But to take this movie even further into brilliance, Stahelski prefers to show and not tell the audience about the world in which John Wick lives. As a result, everything is mysterious, leaving viewers intrigued, questioning, and wholly immersed in this assassin-filled world. The unusual gold coin currency, the legend and fear of John Wick, the enigmatic Continental hotel that forbids any assassin ""work"" on the premises, and much more sweeten a typical action revenge story into a cinematic treasure.Overall : The mastery of stunt choreography and world-building make John Wick the new standard of action films.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love Rambo and Die Hard, I love Mission: Impossible and James Bond, I love the raid and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. In general, I know what a good action movie is.But Josh Wick puts an end to all of the above in terms of action, drive, setting scenes and the universe in which we are invited to immerse ourselves.The world of hired killers and criminals, where orders are sent by SMS to individual performers or to all who are in the asset. A kind of freelancing with a well-oiled pay system, cover and a brotherhood that cannot be transferred.In general, the universe is great.Visual, my respect. What kind of picture is there, well, for an action movie it's even too much, in my opinion.The plot of course yes, simple as a stick, but the characters are one more beautiful than the other. It's really interesting to see new characters emerge. They are all silent and straightforward, but at the same time, because of their appearance, habits, weapons and style, you yourself think out who he is and build a legend around each fighter.In general, if you like action movies and for some reason you haven't seen John Wick yet, run and watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For action movies fans, Keanu Reeves fans, this is another movie to be seen.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a typical guy takes his revenge movie. It can be easily summarized as ""Keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes"" but the thing is you actually can see it is really Keanu who is doing it. Instead of shaky cameras and dozens of superfast cuts, you can see kick-ass long takes which are amazingly choreographed. Since this is their first film, the director duo has a few problems with storytelling but I am glad that they made me realize how much I miss watching an action movie and actually see what's going on.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In memory of herself, she left a farewell gift - a dog named Daisy. By chance, the character of Keanu Reeves has to say goodbye to everything he had and return to his former life.Acting is not the best but not terrible. Not everywhere the actors managed to play quite convincingly, but in general this does not ruin the overall picture much. Camera movement deserves praise. The cameramen managed to convey all the dynamics of combat scenes, the noir atmosphere is preserved in each frame.Editing is also at the high level, branded subtitles fit well into the picture and do not distract from viewing. Sound specialists did their job quite well: cars and shots sound cool and pleasant. Separately, I would like to note the soundtrack. Electronic music fits perfectly into fighting scenes and the main theme reflects the atmosphere and mood of the film.The world in which the events of the film take place is very attractive with its thoughtfulness. Each character has its own lore, which is not properly revealed, but outlines the contours and nature of all the characters with whom John interacts. Secondary characters do not stand out with special charisma, but they do not feel empty eitherAs a result, we can say that ""John Wick"" is a simple, sometimes clichéd, but good action movie that is pleasant to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A lot of people talk about it as if the action excuses the story, as if it is a 'guilty pleasure' or only good because of its above-average - phenomenal, I'd say - fight sequences, but that's actually not the case here. This isn't simply about a man who kills some people because they kill his dog. No, it is much deeper than that, with a tangible connection to the characters and solid reasoning behind everything they do, and just because the story is simple doesn't make it any less compelling or well-crafted. The film is truly fun, somewhat self-aware but also serious enough to be properly impactful, and wholly engaging. You'll be smiling throughout, at both the breathless action and the effortless craftsmanship of narrative. Keanu Reaves and Michael Nyqvist are both fantastic in the piece, two sides of the same coin, and the way that the latter is used to build this ominous legend around the former is almost genius. The flick also offers glimpses into an interesting and fully formed world but never lets that detract from its beating heart, either. I truly believe this is a near masterpiece, a marvel of modern cinema that distils its story to its most basic of elements and is all the more effective because of it. One of my favourite action films of all time. 9/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately I wasn't really taken with this one. It's not a bad movie, but I didn't find anything especially interesting or convincing about it. When I say convincing I don't mean that I was expecting realism. But I spent most of the time very aware that I was watching a movie that hit the expected beats of an action film, instead of being immersed in it's unique world. The performances and dialogue felt stilted, like the actors weren't really embodying fully fleshed out people but playing to whatever archetype the movie needed them to be. And the soundtrack kind of annoyed me. At times it felt cheap and a little corny. Even with these criticisms, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, just nothing mind-blowing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Why didn't they just shoot him when they captured him? Why use a plastic bag?All they did was basically remake Taken, which at least was a bit more realistic and seem to have more purpose.Then the acting was pretty horrendous.

John is a sort of super (perhaps even super-human) hit man for the Russian Mob. But he's retired. He found love; he got married; everything was great; he left the life. But his wife got sick and then died, and as her parting gift to the devastated John, she arranges for him to be sent a puppy after she died. The puppy comforts him in his grief. Until ... One day he has an encounter with the son of the Russian mob boss he used to work for. They don't know each other. The guy falls in love with John's car, and later breaks into John's house, beats John up, kills John's puppy and steals John's car. It was the killing of the puppy - the last link with his beloved wife - that pushed John over the top. He's back, and he's out for revenge: bloody, merciless and remorseless revenge against anybody and everybody even remotely involved with this heinous act.That's it, more or less. The movie then goes through a whole series of bloody gunfights and fistfights and martial arts sequences as John (Keanu Reeves) single-handedly wreaks havoc on the Russian Mob in New York City. The fight scenes go on and on and on. They seem never-ending. It was a very one-dimensional part for Reeves (but, then again, most of the characters in this were one dimensional.) The point of the movie wasn't to tell a story or to give us meaningful moments and characters. They were all pretty one dimensional, working with a plot that was straightforward and largely predictable. This is obviously all leading up to the climactic confrontation. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely sure who John's final confrontation was going to be with until the son was killed with almost a half hour left to go. Clearly it wasn't him. So it goes on and on and on for a while longer.Personally, I found the last half hour quite tedious viewing. If you really like this kind of genre - violent and bloody action with little or no story - then this is a movie you've got to watch. I have to admit that this just really wasn't my style, even though I can appreciate a man wanting to take revenge for the killing of his puppy!

The tempo along with the captivating photography works like a drug. The choice and use of color in this movie was probably what immersed me in it the most.There is this heartbreaking scene at the beginning that was hard for me to watch. As opposed to a horror flick, it was very real and traumatic. Tears welled up in my eyes.I only advise you to watch this one if you are aware of and thus not vulnerable to this problem of desensitization.I could have rated this higher and said the same thing but I feel that film makers (directors, writers and producers are all included) abuse their expertise and initiatives too much to boost the influence they have over their audience, selfishly denying any responsibility they should be having for others by opting to exploit their vulnerabilities such as the need to have good time, as there is little free time, or the need for instant gratification.As delicious and harmful as a snack dipped in all the wrong things for a healthy body.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Blood is everywhere, bursting out of heads, eyes, torsos etc. The storyline is non-existent, there are no academy award winning performances, the dialog is minimal and primal and very little sex since the hero is too busy trying to stay alive.

From the get-go, John Wick is portrayed as the quintessential badass, a character so steeped in legend that he's practically invincible. There's no character development; he starts off as an unstoppable force and remains so throughout. He's a 'Mary Sue'; everyone fears him because, well, he's John Wick-the man who once killed three guys with a pencil.The film doesn't shy away from deploying an arsenal of worn-out tropes. E.g. The obligatory action scenes set in a nightclub or strip joint, where the camera never fails to capture a sultry walk-by from a female character. Then there's the classic scene where the main villain captures John but, despite fearing him immensely and having every reason to kill him swiftly, opts instead to knock him out so he can have a lengthy conversation, then WALKING AWAY, giving John the perfect setup for his escape. It's as if the screenplay was ticking off boxes from a list of action movie must-haves.And I have to do a special shout out for the 'Fridging' trope, where the protagonist's wife conveniently dies so our hero can have a motive. This is executed with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, particularly in a scene that feels ripped straight from the 'video of a dead wife' meme playbook, where we see Wick watching an old video of his wife who, in a moment brimming with clichéd sentimentality, giggles and playfully chides, ""Oh, are you filming us?"". I don't know how anyone can watch this with a straight face.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a prominent vegan activist I would like to sue this movie and everyone included. I eat a plant based vegan diet and have for 12 years.

Why has John Wick become such a social rave? I'll tell you why- because John Wick is cool and shoots guys good! No but seriously what is it about this film?! There is nothing ""good"" about it. The only thing it has going for it is it's action and quite frankly the action is boring- point and shoot.The premise of this film can be surmised in a sentence. Mans wife dies, but leaves him a dog, bad guys kill dog, man kills bad guy. Okay so that was a run on sentence but you get the point. The whole plot revolves around the first 5 minutes of the film!!!There is absolutely no emotional attachment to john wicks wife, nor his dog. Simply because no time was spent developing those relationships.The hour and a half of shooting is not driven by a compelling plot device, it is simply driven by action. Action driving action.Correction: bad action driving bad action.Mindless filmmaking.Also did a 3 year old monkey color grade this film? Tis not pleasing to the eye at all. It all feels so fake.Why oh why is this flick so popular?Oh yes. Because Keanu Reeves is a Bad-A! Do you know what that stands for? BAD ACTOR!I've seen worse.

I started to take screen shots/captures of examples of what I believed was mistakes, but I ended up capture so many fighting scenes I initially thought were errors before I realized that they weren't.Where Jason Bourne redefined and raised the bar for how fighting should look in movies, John Wick destroys it. I thought, or hoped, that we were passed the time when actors are waiting to get hit or shot. There are so many scenes where John Wick are fighting against, for instance, three opponents and while John Wick is fighting against one of them the two others are standing and waiting until he's done fighting the first. They are standing in line, so to speak. The movies are riddled with stupid fighting scenes I expect to watch in an old action movie from the 80's.What am I missing?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He walks around with no alarm system in a house with glass walls. His enemies do not use infrared cameras or sniper rifles. His enemies are fools who blunder into Wick. With fight after fight Wick is not rushed and is only captured briefly at the end. Wick has mostly one on one fights over and over.It is nonsense. There is almost no story.

It is awful. For anything to get a 9 or 10 it means it has to be better than most of the films ever made across many years. I think this film deserves to be in a list of the worst films ever.The Equalizer films with Denzel are a similar premise, i.e. Someone does wrong, hero takes vengeance in action packed scenes. However the Equalizer films are this genre done exceptionally well. John Wick is lazy film making, lazy script writing, lazy acting and the only real reason I could see anyone making it is to insult the audiences intelligence. Awful.

One of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. I didn't really expect much from Keanu Reeves, to familiar with his minimalistic vocabulary, but after The Matrix you really hope for another sudden flash of geniality, don't you? This wasn't one of them.Storyline: Sucks. Straight forward from initial offense until final revenge. Could have ended several times before that, but that would have made the movie 25 minutes instead of 100. Which perhaps wouldn't be that bad... Some details are also completely lacking all sense of logic which is terribly annoying, but convenient for Mr Wick. Action: Without any variation what so ever. Running and shooting at everyone with a red or cerise shirt under his jacket, being lucky that even when there's 20 opponents all of them wait for one another to try his luck killing Mr Wick. That makes it one clean kill after the other. Some exploding cars, a small fire, but otherwise just gunshots from close distance. Hundreds of them.John Wick: For the first 20 minutes I nearly thought it could be a decent action movie. A heartbroken man that doesn't seem so heartbroken. More chronically depressed. He stays in that mode the rest of the film, and there's actually nothing cool about Mr Wick. No style or surprising skills. Just walking around shooting at everything, hardly speaking.Music: Terrible and annoying. Rap, metal or whatever, that doesn't fit at all. End: Unbelievably uncool and unrealistic. The ending climax/revenge is also totally without excitement or ""goal""-feeling. Just passes by.PUNCHLINE: Don't waste your time on this movie. See something else. Even grab a movie you just saw that you liked. My girlfriend was actually getting rather depressed and annoyed after half the movie, and stayed in that mode for the rest of it (apart from a few laughs out of frustration from how unrealistic or uncool some scenes actually where). She didn't even mention how it ended but immediately left the sofa and started brushing her teeth in anger. Now, three days later she's forgiven me for dragging the movie into our home, as I promised her it would leave us with the trash bag, and that she could choose the next 10 movies we'll see together. That's pretty much all you need to know.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I decided to give it a try because I heard so many people talking about this film as if it were on the same level as The Matrix, and they could not have been more wrong.First off, there is virtually no plot or character development. None. People say this is an action movie...I say it's just a killing spree. There's no heart. There's no connection to the characters. There's not even any tension. It's the same shooting scene repeated over and over again until the very end. It's unnecessarily gory and yet horribly boring simultaneously.Secondly, the amount of inconsistencies in this film make it a joke. I guess sometimes you can shoot people from two feet away and their head blows up, but other times there's no blood at all and the mark magically disappears in the next shot. Who knew? Also how does Wick go from taking down 12+ guys in hand to hand combat in one scene, but at the end of the movie it's like he can't even remember how to throw a punch? It makes no sense. The one character that gets all the credit: John Wick's poor stomach. That thing was punched, stabbed, bloodied, broken, and somehow it healed itself at the start of every new scene. Miraculous.I found myself pausing this movie multiple times to go do other things and then begrudgingly coming back to make myself finish it just because I paid for the rental. That's how bored I was with this film. Here's the synopsis: shoot people in your home, shoot people in a club, shoot people in a hotel, shoot people in the street, shoot people in a warehouse, shoot people in the rain. That's it. I just saved you four bucks. You're welcome. Now go watch Stallone in First Blood if you want to see a true action movie.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

The action is fantastic throughout most of the film, the gunplay is some of the best in modern cinema, and the unique elements of the film make for a combination of intrigue and strange humor that make the fairly short movie a joy to watch. If you're asking me if John Wick is a good quality movie, the answer is more of a ""meh, not really... but it's not bad."" The acting is almost non-existent (seemingly by design to fit Keanu Reeves' style), the plot is about as generic as they come, and the ending is laughable.

I hoped that this would be the needle in the haystack of the newest additions to the Expendables, Die Hard, and Transformers franchises. I was expecting intense, fast-paced choreography, an intimidating villain, relatable motive, and stakes that actually felt like they held some weight to them. By the end of the film, my disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.There's very little about this film that impressed me at all. Keanu did a fine job, but I was expecting a bit more, considering everyone regards him as a God now. The choreography was almost impressive, but I found that it was insanely slow, unexciting, and pales in comparison to something like the Raid. I was never bored. The dog was cute.Part of what makes some of my favorite action films so special is that the audience is always on the edge of their seat, because at any moment, any of the on-screen characters could succumb to the lingering tension that's constantly in the air and actually die.Stakes are one of the most essential aspects in an action film, yet this one lacks any. Because of the lack of tension, the action scenes suffer immensely. Not only are we constantly told that John Wick is invincible and can't be stopped, but we're shown this as well. We never see a hint of injury to him until the end of the second act, and even then, it feels completely unnatural and forced.John Wick has next-to-nothing going for it in its story, which consists of three important plot-points: the villain, his wife, and his former buddy, Marcus. I'll go down the line and see how much each doesn't workThe villain is a hilarious cliché that never feels intimidating in the slightest. From the moment we see our antagonist, we pretty much know exactly how the plot's going to play out all the way to the unsatisfying finale.His wife's role had lots of potential to be an impactful and emotional beat in the film to be a reminder of why John is doing what he's doing, but she feels less like an organic character and purely like words on a script to get the story going where it needs to go. To give the audience a grip of how much she means to John, we are given exactly one montage and one video shown on a cellphone.His friend, Marcus, has both problems mentioned above. Not only is his story extremely predictable, but you could hardly call him a character. You really couldn't care less whether he were to live or die. He is given a couple moments to shine in what is supposed to be tense, but comes off extremely goofy and laughable.I might look like a goof nitpicking the story in an action movie, but when the action scenes don't work for me at all, what more am I left with?There are a couple technical complaints such as ugly cinematography and bland music choices but nothing nearly as bad as everything else aforementioned.I wanted to love this. I really did.
When's the last time we've had a great action trilogy? I want it so bad, but this disappointing entry makes me a lot less excited to watch the sequels.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The writers seemed to be in a video game state of mind as they went through the sequences. I waited to see the hook or revelation in the middle of this where nothing was done by mistake. Instead, it seems everything was random and coincidental which makes no sense. The bad guys just happen to encounter a well know retired assassin? I wish they would have a do over and have some depth and storyline added to this visual flop.

A local moronic tough guy, and his cohorts, break into a guy's house and steal his car and kill his puppy. The guy gathers up all of his weapons and goes out to public venues and slaughters people for revenge. How often have we heard this story? Of course in real life the venues are shopping malls, schools or clubs and the perpetrator is usually portrayed as a troubled, loner. John Wick in this movie is a hero who killed a bunch of bad guys with precise placement of bullets. Of course in real life the bullets are sprayed helter-skelter, by a sideways held gun, and often kill innocent bystanders or children. The fact that bullets, when they miss the intended target, don't dissipate into thin air seems to be lost to many people. There are innocent people slaughtered daily due to perceived social slights and minor insults resolved with gun violence and this movie glorifies widespread killing. Obviously I found this movie disturbing. I can see a movie like this and be disturbed by the message but others, maybe of marginal mental capacities, ingest the message as righteous behavior. A recent local road rage incident was in the news where a high school graduate was shot in the head over lane merging jockeying.

Stallone was just the kind of guy to go to war with the Russian mob and win as Keanu Reeves does here.John Wick is a retired hit-man and walked away from the life of crime because of the love of a good woman. The good woman dies, but has a dog sent to Reeves as a remembrance. Actually I can sort of understand that. I recently acquired a cat from someone who was close to me and died unexpectedly. If I had Keanu's killing skills I might do what he does.But definitely this was a role that cried for Rambo as Keanu plows through the Russian mob. The son of the mob leader tries to rip off Keanu's car and beats him up in the process and kills the dog. That last remembrance of his wife puts him over the edge and then look out Russians.I did find it hard to wrap my mind around the concept of an organized crime safe house where Reeves takes up residence while he does his thing. An interesting part is played by Adrianne Palicki as a female hit woman who wants to show up the men in the profession by taking down the guy who was number one. Ditto for Willem Dafoe playing an old associate of Reeves in the murder business.Keanu's fans will enjoy this, action fans who like lots of blood and gore in their cinema will like it. Still Stallone would have pulled this off better.","15 out of 70 found this helpful.

But like in 47 Ronin, Keanu disappoints in a story rehashed a million times over and seeks only to tarnish further a reputation soaked in the odour of box-office poison.This is basically a revenge flick for the common movie-goer. the common movie-goer nowadays being a 12 y.o, snapback wearing, Nike sporting thug amazed by the explosions upon screen rather than immersing storytelling. Being a fan of the revenge genre, I long to see a movie that can strike conflicting emotions in me, alas this is not one of them.Keanu again plays the blank, emotionless face that we shall forever recognise as Keanu and not the character he is supposed to be playing. The supporting cast is poor, as is the storytelling and camera-work in general. There is no saving grace to be found here, but I've awarded it two stars extra for decent production values.In the end, I was glad to leave the theatre which it was shown, as were others as suggested by their sighs of disappointment. If you came to watch Keanu, watch. But if you came to be immersed in a world that tenders your soul, you'd be better off sticking to something else.","43 out of 255 found this helpful.

I have seen better revenge flicks than this one. Just to name a few: Charles Bronson's Death Wish(5 films in all), Death Sentence, Oldboy, Hard Boiled(John Woo), Leon: The Professional, Mission Impossible Part 1, Kickboxer, I Saw The Devil, The Fugitive, A Grande Arte(a.k.a. Exposure), Virtuosity, Rambo Trilogy, Die-hard Trilogy, Alien Quadrilogy, Tremors(Kevin Bacon), Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy: A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad And The Ugly. Revenge is a common plot devise in most action-thrillers. In this film an ex-hit-man called John Wick(Keanu Reeves) vows vengeance upon the man who murders the puppy which was bequeathed to him by his late wife. John will not rest until he kills him. This man is the son of Viggo Tarasov(Michael Nyqvist), head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York and John's former employer. Viggo immediately puts a bounty on John's head and hopes that he will be killed before he ever manages to get close to his son. He also employs Marcus(Willem Dafoe), member of the old guard of assassins to kill John Wick for a fee of two million dollars. The action scenes in the film are pretty standard. I rather liked the scenes in The Equalizer than this film. Antoine Fuqua is much better action director than Chad Stahelski. I personally feel that John Woo would have been a better first choice director. Other candidates would be Luc Besson, Michael Mann, David Fincher, John Mctiernan, James Cameron. The late George P. Cosmatos was an awesome action film director as well will films like Rambo 2, Cobra, Of Unknown Origin, Leviathan, Shadow Conspiracy and Tombstone. The casting is okay, but not as effective as to linger in one's memories. This is not a film I'd watch twice in my life. Maybe the plot itself was too predictable and shallow, the acting feeling-less and the background score not that effective.The only good actor in the film is by far Michael Nyqvist who plays Viggo. His acting is a notch above that of Keanu Reeves. John Leguizamo, a great favorite of mine has a very small part in the film. He does well with the meager lines he has to say in the film. The most wasted actor in the film is Willem Dafoe. He fails to make an impact upon the film, and his character development was poor.I have seen many good Keanu Reeves films: Speed, The Matrix Trilogy, Johnny Mnemonic, Little Buddha (1993 - a must see film). This film will be among the ones which I would not care to see again.","6 out of 24 found this helpful.

I know he has a reputation as a bad actor, but at least he never tries anything he cannot handle.Reeves is John Wick, a super-assassin living in what I gather (or hope) is a parallel world. Wick ""retired"" to live with his wife but she died and left him a puppy as a goodbye gift.The premise of the ""retired professional' is one of the stalest in the movie world, such as the killer with a heart and we get both in this movie. Wick gets out of retirement to avenge the killing of his dog and the theft of his car. Obviously, it is no regular villain who angered him, but the reckless son of a Russian mega-mobster.Moving from his designer villa to the city of New York, Wick gets to stay in a luxury hotel called the Continental, where criminals must refrain from ""conducting business"" or else being ""excommunicated"" from the great criminal brotherhood.Wick's criminal pals are sympathetic about Wick's loss and also scared of him, because of his fierce reputation. Knowing that ""honor among thieves"" and criminal luxury world are bulls**t, helps rooting for Wick's revenge. It also helps that the villains are Russian mobsters and everybody knows the world can do without them.As in every action movie, one also knows that the hero is next to indestructible and that some preposterous fighting scenes will pave the way to a car chase sequence (or vice-versa). As long as you keep your expectations low, Wick will deliver. Reeves is predictably laconic and the world his character inhabits is suitably menacing and dark, a sort of lawless Gotham city.PS I did not see this threadbare plot as an opening for sequels, there being very little original material to carve out more stories, but unfortunately it happened... and it just went downhill.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Story line is very very simple, acting mediocre, but fully action paced to the hilt. Our hero, kills at least 84 bad guys, including the 'Big Boss' and effectively takes out the whole Russian Mafia: All because the Big Boss' son kills his dog and steals his car. Our hero makes Superman, Batman and Spider-Man look like kindergarten babes as he wisks through more than 80 thugs and trained killers and underworld henchmen like a 300km/hr tornado. The movie starts off with our hero collapsing (you think he dies) due to a mortal stomach wound, then it flashes back to fill in the intervening events, and ends with our hero rising like a Phoenix out of the ashes, as good as new (almost) for what could only be a the first step towards a future sequel. After beating and killing over 80 trained and ruthless mobsters, our hero is given a very good hiding by a female assassin, just hours after he was patched up from a previous almost fatal beating and stabbing. and a day or two later, the only way he can disarm and beat a much older (and nowhere near as fit or capable as our hero) Crime Boss is to let the crime boss stab him in the pre-existing stomach wound so he could take the knife off him and stab/kill him; perhaps this is where our hero's batteries were running low.Though not all is far fetched fantasy because this is one of a very few movies where the hero's gun runs out of bullets as any normal gun would, and we do see him reloading a few times. Apart from the miraculous recoveries (more than once) of our hero, the movie does have some somber or comical scenes to break up the voluminous killings, like when our hero goes to a classy hotel (akin to a sanctuary or demilitarized zone, where only assassins, hit men and criminals are allowed entry, to gather, stay and unwind or just take a breather from their hectic routine), with very stringent rules where any transgression carries an immediate death sentence: as ones greedy guest discovers.

I thought it was going to be another stupid action flick. Boy, was I wrong!Here is my review: JOHN WICK was a wonderful, lighthearted romp for my hour and a half on the couch. I loved the cute puppy scenes, the 1969 Mustang, and the stylish suits Mr. Wick wore on the elegant sets. What a total surprise that Keanu could mug, joke, and sing so well. He mostly danced with men from the Russian Ballet Troupe, and the choreography was first rate! His performance could easily rival Fred Astaire and shows the world Mr. Reeve can do so much more than his previous ""dead as a stick"" acting skills.It was mostly a man's musical. Three women had minor roles. His deceased wife was glimpsed in brief flashbacks. There was a girl tending bar who had a few lines of dialogue. And lastly there was Adrianne Palicki, who had only one short pas de deux and chanson duet with John Wick.Mr. Reeve's best song was ""I'm Thinking I'm Back."" This was easily the most grammy winning piece in the entire musical.And don't get me started on the snappy dialogue. I mean it! I was clutching my sides with laughter at all the witty repartee among the actors. The script writers could certainly teach Woody Allen a thing or two. I would have given this movie 10 stars, but I gave it only 3 for ending way too soon. It should have gone on much, much longer. The final dance number on the docks near the helicopter pad was pure romance and reminiscent of Gene Kelly in the pouring rain.With all the mindless American action movies featuring nonstop ultraviolence, it was refreshing to see the film makers treat us with an upbeat musical comedy. Afterwards I felt like Audrey Hepburn and started singing ""I Could Have Danced All Night"".","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

Either downplay the violence and highlight the loss/retribution, or go all in and make it nice and grisly like the much overlooked The Raid (which by the way managed to combine both).Plus, Michael Nyqkvist is pouring himself gleefully into the mold of Peter Stormare and all other heavily type-casted villains who can't learn convincing accents.

Yes, this is his motivation to turn the rest of the movie into a gore fest. We'll also encounter an underworld of hired assassins that not only have code of conduct and well established hideouts, but also their own currency resembling a gold coin. It's net worth remains ambiguous since for one coin you might enter a club but also dispose of a body by a professional service.The biggest question mark i had about John Wick is what made Keanu Reeves play in this movie. Was it the fading fame, his agents talking him into it or complementary fitness lessons that came with the role.Funny enough, roughly at the same time with John Wick release a similar trashy movie came out, with an underdog fighting the Russian mafia, namely The Equalizer with Denzel Washington.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Literally had a friend saying to me: ""I'm so jealous of you that you still get to watch them unspoiled yet, wish I could forget them and rediscover them."". With praise like that you expect some life-altering audiovisual experience that you'll carry with you for the rest of your life. In the time it took me to get around watching the film I finally started to notice the similar excessive praise around the internet. So I was looking forward to it.So then I watched it. Yikes. What a sobering disappointment. Also yawn. Actually got bored halfway through the movie. Went to go do something else for 20 minutes just to get a break and watched the second half with another tab open to distract me from the boredom.How are people impressed with this? I would have thought this was cool if I saw it in the early 2000s. When a bunch of action flicks in the same vein were coming out and it was a fresh new thing. And only because back then I was still an immature teenager.Now however, I found it generic, uninspired, immature, repetitive and ultimately boring. It ticked of every cliché from' the big book of action movie clichés'. I wont even bother to list them, you'll know 'em when you see 'em.It's got the obligatory brain dead Hollywood morals written by toddlers. They killed his dog, well, wasn't even really his dog since he got it for about a day or 2. And stole his car. Surely this is substantial cause - nay! Scratch that - it's simply straight up justice for him to go kill about a hundred people in retaliation. Right? Hurrah for the noble hero. Who's incidentally a hitman by the way, clear beacon of moral justice. But who cares right? It's just Russian henchmen that he kills, they're not really people. They can't possibly have families and friends. Or taken on a security gig just to make ends meet.But let's move on because the above feels like trying to deep sea dive in a puddle.'The' reason these films get praised is apparently the tight choreography. There's choreography all right: John Wick has an aimbot and a wallhack installed. Plus also some kind off rear view mirror cheat that makes him able to sense people sneaking up from behind. Sometimes a lucky henchman can actually get the drop on Johnny boy but that's okay: the henchmen are all playing on storm trooper difficulty. If he was a barn and presenting them his broad side he still wouldn't have to worry about getting shot.The result is a succession of action scenes where John steadily, confidently and without emotion walks through buildings as he double taps bad guys left and right mere split seconds apart.From all the praise these films were getting my expectations and hopes were that John Wick was maybe going to be a new type of action film, one that tries to portray action in a realistic fashion.Nope it's just more of the same tiresome cringe. Hero guy with gun kills all the bad guys with guns. Pew Pew. This is basically a modern stylized version of what Rambo (coincidentally another John) did in the eighties. Like then it impressed teenagers and immature manchildren but made everybody else roll their eyes in cringe.I'm removing the sequels off of my watch list after this.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't think I hyped it too much but it just seemed like a good action movie and The letdown is hands down the story. But not bad writing, it's more how they presented it in the movie. Strange way on how they did it and it is very clear they just tried to jam it in as fast as they could so they could do brainless action all the way. Keanu Reeves acting , there's nothing wrong with it. I loved that part but everything else with the movie was just a snore.

It was cool the first time but now you see it all the time in TV shows and movies and even video games and yes I think I am not alone when I say; Just stop. Just stop. This movie is enjoyable yes.

Good things with the movie: + Keanu Reeves+ Willem Dafoe + The fighting scenes (with guns)The Bad: And the last one 'reason for this movie' it's painfully obvious this movie was made to do a brainless action movie because that is what it became when they just tossed away the story for action. Sure it is very done well (the gun scenes) but I want some real story and some story I can think about after seeing this but nope.

I had to keep adjusting the sound all the way through the film - down for action sequences and up for dialogue. It was exhausting! I gave up watching in the end, I just couldn't be bothered. Altogether most disappointing.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In that review I complained about encountering the same old clichés over and over again in action movies. Clichés that you will find in John Wick: a mysterious protagonist who has lost his wife in unknown circumstances to the viewer, the bad guys who always happen to be Russians and/or speak with a funny accent, and obviously, the protagonist being capable of taking on an army of killers as if they were Playmobile figurines. No need to say, that even though he finds himself in the most stressful situations, he's always calm enough to use sarcasm when he speaks, have perfect hair after every battle, and even have a few ladies fall in love in the process. And all the troubles and the hundreds of killings (yes Keanu Reeves kills more people in an hour that in the Matrix trilogy) over a stolen car and the killing of a puppy! I jest! Anyway, enough with my own dose of sarcasm. There's only three words to describe this stereotypical action-packed-I-have-seen-it-all-before-movie: boring, boring, boring. But I guess that since it still manages a surprisingly high 7.3 rating, my opinion is only shared by a few. So watch it at your own peril, and whether you like it or not, tell me if anything I say here is untrue!","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

After about 45 minutes I watched the rest of the movie waiting to see something change because I honestly couldn't believe it could be this bad.
The whole point is that a bunch of gangsters kill John Wick's puppy, the puppy left by his beloved wife after her death from cancer. The rest of the movie is John Wick killing tens of people taking revenge. That's it. There is nothing new, no noble cause, just revenge. Apparently we are to accept that it is ""ok"" to kill tens of people (be it gangsters) for the puppy's death.
There is nothing new here; you've seen retired hit-men revenge their wives, revenge their kids, revenge their friends, even depicted as heroes trying to save the world from the evil of their previous lives. Apparently this movie has something new to say by revenging a very cute and lovable puppy.
Many contradicting scenes and inconsistent characters too. Ending is not believable or even satisfying. Disappointment after disappointment for more than an hour.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

John starts the film as a beat up and depressed ""white privilege."" Like it says, he is coming out of retirement. As a retiree, he is sitting pretty. He had a home decorator come in and his house looks like a womans home. He has those decorative pillows from Pier 1 and some Candles. He lost his wife/gf. So he's depressed. Clearly he misses his woman. He gets a puppy to cheer himself up. John doesn't really understand dogs. He feeds the dog a bowl of cereal. Then he gets knocked out by a bunch of thugs (in the dark in his house) and they off his dog. He is a damn fool for not locking his doors considering he is an assassin. Alarm system? Strangely, his fighting skills disappear during this time. Also it is clear he is not a light sleeper. Out for revenge, John Wick digs up his old suitcase of assassin guns. He broke his oath of weapon chastity. Obviously he should of known his career would never be over when people hate his guts. Considering his weapons, he has a variety of sizes. He usually likes the big black ones. I've also seen him put an extender on the handheld. He doesn't like the fully automatic because he wants to move it himself. He oils them up and cocks them for good measuring. I can tell he's a pro after I watched the Matrix. Then he goes and kicks ass for a 1 minute fight seen. After that he goes to that Hotel from the second movie. I got bored with the repetitive rhetoric and couldn't watch the rest.

However, if you're looking for a compelling story or standout acting performances, you won't find them here. This film relies heavily on its action sequences, leaving little room for meaningful character development or narrative depth.The plot, or lack thereof, is virtually non-existent. It serves merely as a thin thread to connect one action set-piece to another. The audience is thrown into a world where violence is the only currency, and John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves, is the relentless assassin caught in an endless cycle of revenge. Unfortunately, the film fails to explore its characters' motivations or provide any substantial backstory, resulting in a rather shallow and unengaging experience.While Keanu Reeves is known for his dedication to physical performances, the acting in ""John Wick"" falls flat. The dialogue is minimal, and the characters are one-dimensional, leaving the talented cast with little to work with. Despite the lack of depth, Reeves brings a certain charisma to his portrayal of John Wick, showcasing his proficiency in action sequences, but it's not enough to salvage the overall mediocrity.Unrealistic scenarios abound throughout the film, stretching the boundaries of believability. John Wick's ability to withstand countless injuries and triumph over seemingly insurmountable odds pushes the limits of what can be considered plausible, even within the realm of action films. While some viewers may find this aspect thrilling and exhilarating, others might find it difficult to suspend their disbelief, longing for a touch of realism to anchor the frenetic action.In the end, ""John Wick"" is an average movie that caters primarily to fans of mindless action and gunfire. If you're seeking a thought-provoking plot or standout performances, you'll be disappointed. However, if you're in the mood for relentless action with little substance, this film might provide the mindless entertainment you're looking for.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

VERY not good!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167104/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","21 January 2015","Another day, another review. In the case of John Wick, there's a really short version: Don't bother.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a recently bereaved man whose wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan) kindly, inexplicably, managed to replace herself with a perfectly timed puppy so that John won't be lonely. He also owns a car. Shortly after burying his wife, John takes his dog and fills up his car at the gas station where he attracts the attention of thug Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen, recently seen in Plastic). Iosef wants the car, John doesn't want to sell it, Iosef resolves the issue that night by rearranging John's face, killing the dog and stealing the car. Needless to say, John is a little narked and phones up Iosef's dad, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) to complain. The thing is, John Wick is a retired hit-man and all-round killing machine.John Wick could have been resolved painlessly in five minutes: ""Your son killed my dog and now I want to kill him. If you don't let me, I'll kill everybody you employ, everybody you know and every inanimate object you own."" ""Okay, he'll be home in half an hour. Come on over""No such luck.It starts slowly, stutters and plummets thereafter.John Wick is the type of film that gives credibility to the opinion that Keanu Reeves stinks on the big screen. It isn't right (sometimes), it isn't fair but in this instance it is fairly accurate. In reality, Reeves is the second best thing (after the dog) in this tedious, ham-fisted mess that attempts to be a thriller, but I suspect there is more to it than that. He isn't awful, he just doesn't appear to be trying. He gives every impression of gritting his teeth, and taking the money before he wanders back into the safe obscurity of the horizon. He looks bored and I suspect he's fulfilling a favour and hoping he escapes in tact.John Wick is the directorial debut of both Chad Stahelski (stunt coordinator and Reeves' double on Constantine, The Matrix films, The Replacements, Point Break) and an uncredited David Leitch, who happened to be a stuntman on Constantine and Matrix Revolutions. Either this is one hell of a favour or Keanu Reeves lost big time on the between-the-scenes poker marathons.As we found with The Interview and This is the End, having two directors doesn't mean the film is going to be twice as good. John Wick is proof again that if one director can't make it work, a second director only serves to shoulder the blame. Stahelski and Leitch have hired a goon to 'write' this mess and have then proceeded to direct it in the same manner i.e. in block capitals and armed with wax crayons.Scattered throughout John Wick are subtitles that float across the screen (no bad thing) with random words picked out in block capitals to give the impression of the speakers SHOUTING random WORDS whenever they feel LIKE it (VERY bad THING indeed!). I'm just going to gloss over the needlessly capitalized words sprinkled through them.The performances in John Wick are frequently, painfully wooden and from a cast that also either owed favours (Willem Dafoe) or were cheap (the rest). It plods, lines are repeated and the costume design clearly consisted of shopping; EVERYONE is wearing brand new clothes! John Wick contains some fine action sequences in which Keanu Reeves swings a variety of weapons with maximum effect, but when there is complete reliance on blood spatter and gunfire and a complete oversight when it comes to script, direction, performance, logic and reason, no matter how good your star is, your film is in serious trouble.To refer to my original statement, there is a slightly longer short version: Don't waste your time, money or breath watching, thinking or talking about John Wick.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

We do not know why. Johnnie baby lives in a fine, modern apartment/condo. How does he pay for it? Your guess.Then, he receives a puppy and a note from his dead ex?. Puppies always matter to us morons. Sniffle, sniffle, cry, show us how deep you are. Puke. However, the dog cannot sleep on the bed. Why not? Who cares and who knows?8 minutes in, we know this is a slop show. He lets the beagle out for a crap in an apparently unfenced yard. Beagles will never come back. Dumb.By 10 minutes in, you know this is a garbage movie, but, well worth paying big bucks to watchnot. If a movie needs a cute dog, the studio knows that the movie sucks.Of course, John drives a macho carhow else would we know he was some sort of stud?Then, of course, we experience an encounter with a foreign jerkyadda, yadda. And then, lots of burning rubber from his macho-mobile.I stopped watching at 13 minutes. This is truly a movie for idiots. If you paid to watch it, too bad. I did, based on a recommendation.

But while The Transporter laughs at them, the action scenes are both fun and great, and each new cliché introduced only serves to reinforce the joke, John Wick transports you to this state of mind where you're already guessing what's going to happen afterwards but you are hoping that it really really does not, mixed with a fascination at realizing that yes, it actually happens. I cannot understand how it can anything like the scores it has. The script is terribly bad.

Is it that people's expectations are so low these days? Maybe it's because the film is reminiscent of The Matrix and because it features refreshing old-school action choreography. Sure, it seems like with the character of John Wick, Keanu Reeves is back to his glory days of Speed (1994) and The Matrix (1999). But this alone doesn't make for a good film. John Wick is an often enjoyable action movie, but there's nothing original about it. Gone are the days of bright upbeat action movies like Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987) and Under Siege (1992). Yes, those days seem so far away now. Today we have to watch dark, depressing and truly violent action movies like John Wick and The Equalizer. If you want to see action in an upbeat movie now you have to watch a special-effects summer blockbuster. But, to be fair, John Wick does contain some humor, the cinematography by Jonathan Sela is impressive, some of the action scenes are truly entertaining, and that movie poster of Keanu with a gun sure does look cool. In fact, sometimes the film reminds one of the glory days of action movies. Reeves is confident in the leading role. Michael Nyqvist seems to be enjoying himself as Viggo Tarasov, the film's main antagonist. In addition, most of the supporting cast are good, though there isn't a single character that I found interesting. Director and stunt veteran Chad Stahelski refuses to embrace the post-Bourne Identity (2002) trend of shaky-cam action. That's commendable but the action choreography is still unremarkable even if it is competent. John Wick can kill people without problems. If the character had been infused with more style, however, and provided with more of a personality the film would have been more enjoyable. Derek Kolstad's traditional and predictable screenplay also drags the film down. When Wick goes on his vengeful killing spree he begins with the pawns and works his way up to the head of the crime syndicate. So, even though John Wick is mostly a competent action movie, there's nothing in it that can elevate it to the status of a classic. I don't recommend it, but if you're in the mood to see an action movie you may like it.","5 out of 27 found this helpful.

First half hour was enjoyable. It felt like a 70s grind house action thriller. Then came the video game carnage. Scene after scene of underworld minions getting shot in the face at point blank range. I'm sorry. I walked out at the hour mark. I realize I missed a cool car chase at the end - and that sucks. But I'm just tired of it. Tired, tired, tired. Tired of gun violence in movies, man. It's not just morally objectionable, it's just not exciting, it's just boring. So depressing to see Keanu involved in this kind of project. What really pisses me off too is when critics give lousy ratings to Tyler Perry movies which have nothing but positive messages and then lavish praise on this movie which is nothing but casual throw-away gun violence from beginning to end. Oh yes, but it's so stylish. Yeah right.","4 out of 24 found this helpful.

The story line is very shallow. It's like there are no police authorities. The law simply doesn't exist. Just when you think this movie cannot get any more violent and absurd, it simply proofs you differently.The one star i gave goes only to the camera with and lightning department.

About some Russian who kill his dog and now he really flips out and starts shooting a lot of people. Would have been better if they gave it some kind of crazy twist like Kill Bill then it might have been in the running. I guess that is the producers fault for lacking a bit of insight to see that a whole bunch of killing can become a bit mundane if there is not a good enough twist added to the movie. In short if I could have my time back I would most definitely not even have bothered wasting it on this movie.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

From the documentaries that I have seen, from what I have read, any person working for any secretive organization, CIA, organized crime, whatever, ..that is at least not an idiot, especially people who are the most dangerous & are therefore generally regarded as the most hated/feared, i.e., assassins, they do not allow themselves to have/be directly connected to any material object; automobiles, boats, homes, whatever. In the real world, if you get the license plate # off of a car that belongs to such a person & run it you're basically going to find information that tells you nothing about who that person is. Usually, ..it's registered to a dummy company that exists on tax records & is, maybe, on file with another company, maybe a delivery service. And if you could dig & find out you'd find that while that other company is a different company, at least on paper, it's really just a front for the same person.It is common for these companies to have a physical address in the same country where the person in question lives. But, if you were to go to that physical address you'd find that it's a warehouse or a small 'hole-in-the-Earth' office in a building that's been abandoned for 15 years. It's common for these physical addresses to be located on some open-air loading dock that is so 'out-in-the-middle-of-no-where' that nobody in their right mind ever goes out that way. Or on a closed loading dock, where you have to have ID to even be on the property & perhaps more than that. In such locations, buildings can sit abandoned for decades. So long as the company that is registered at that physical address has its rent, taxes, whatever, paid, consistently, on time, how much in bad shape the building is does not matter. At all.And, often, these companies are not registered, such as for tax reasons, in a part of the world where the person in question lives. The person in question might live in North America... Somewhere. With that physical address, somewhere, in North America. But, the registration of that company, for those tax reasons, might be in Antarctica. Or Brazil. Or somewhere in Europe. Or the Cayman Islands.So, when John Wick was in the gas station, at the beginning of the movie & the Russian psychopath chats him up, did that guy put a tracer in/on his vehicle to find him later to steal the car? Or did he get the vin/plate #, run it & track him him down that way?¿ Regardless of how they did it, the fact that they were able to find him so easily implies how little thought went into, at least, that part of the script. Especially since John Wick is a guy with no security, whatsoever, on the home that he lives in... Seriously, how about a motion sensor security system to sound an alarm any time anything larger than a medium-size dog comes on the property! If John Wick is a person who is so good at what he does, then, the bad guys shouldn't have been able to find him. At all. And if John Wick is not that good, then, the title character would never have lived long enough to see even the beginning of this movie; because, he would have been taken down long before the story in the movie got started.And then there's the car that John Wick has immediately before going into the hotel. It's gone & replaced by a different car when he leaves, with no explanation for what happened to the previous vehicle. And there is the scene near the end when John Wick stabs himself with a knife, as it is in the other guys hand, evidently, just to get the knife away from the guy. Dumb. And then there's the scene right at the end where he stumbles into the dog pound, to get medical supplies, & staples himself back together (Really dumb!), inevitably bleeding DNA all over the damned place! As if someone wouldn't show up for work in the morning, see the mess, call the cops... To say nothing of the SUV at the beginning and at the end of the movie! (I gag just thinking about how much of a person's DNA would be all over the inside of any of the vehicles that the title character was in throughout this film!)Off the top of my head, I can't think of a shoot'em-up action flick that does not do this; but, in order to enjoy a shoot'em-up action flick that is written this poorly you need to suspend your support for/belief in reality. You need to not care that the movie sucks. And I think that's extremely stupid!I prefer reality.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

What makes it truly ridiculous, however, is its portrayal of Russians and Russian mafia.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind Russians portrayed as bad guys, it's just one of many action movie clichés that I easily accept. The ridiculous part is, this movie actually tries to focus on Russians while knowing NOTHING about them.First, let's take John Wick, who is supposed to be a badass hit-man. The mafia calls him Baba Yaga. This fact alone is so hilarious it would send a Russian roll on the floor laughing, because it sounds about as good as calling a badass hit-man ""the Wicked Witch of the East"". Baga Yaga is a folk character mostly known through fairy- tales, she's an old witch who is portrayed as wise, scary and occasionally villainous, but quite often helpful (and she's mostly known from fairy-tales where she's practically never a big villain). ""Baba"" isn't really a part of the name, it simply means ""old hag"". That's right, a badass hit-man called ""old hag"" and a female name. I assume at some point there was an idea to find a word similar to Boogeyman and use it as a nickname for John. There indeed is a Slavic ""boogeyman"" called Babay which they perhaps confused with Baba Yaga. Boy, how many laughs this confusion produced.Naturally, not a single character in the movie can speak Russian at all. Plus almost nobody has a real Russian name. I understand that Americans tend to struggle very hard with Russian surnames, but first names? There are no Russians named Iosef, let alone Viggo! The mafia boss looks about as realistic as Boris in Snatch, but Boris was purposefully over-the-top, while John Wick is presented to us like a serious movie.And there's the hilarious scene in club sauna where Russian mafia guys actually sing Kalinka-Malinka. It's about as stupid as American criminals getting reading Dr Seuss aloud together. In real life there's a whole genre of criminal songs called Blatnyak and in many ways it fulfills the same function as some types of rap; it's songs sung by criminals (or people pretending to be them), for criminals and about criminals. This is something that Russian mafia could actually sing. Not goddamn Russian 19th century songs that were common on Soviet TV!And I could accept all that, even though it's crazy to see this silliness in 2014, if not for one thing: somehow this movie pretends that it actually is ABOUT Russians. Russians are everywhere, they talk about their thoughts, customs, motivations, et cetera et cetera, while NONE OF THIS has ANYTHING to do with real Russians. This reminds me of a historical museum scene in the movie called ""Idiocracy"" in which future people got so stupid they think that Charlie Chaplin fought with Nazis and dinosaurs that shot lasers. That's how far this movie is from reality, and for the life of me I simply can't understand WHY the authors of this movie tried to talk about things that they literally know nothing about.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

On my first viewing, I loved the film. The scenes at the start which kick-start the plot were so unexpected and shocking that I immediately wanted John Wick to go out and kill many, many people.
The film was not plot heavy, but it wasn't really about the plot, it was about the action scenes, and the action scenes were beautiful. The styling of the action scenes, were it pulls away and creates a dynamic movement, that's elegant and precise, and isn't cut to shit, so you can actually see what's going on, was amazing to me at the time. The nightclub scene alone is one of the most incredible pieces of action cinema that I had scene. The action styling was perfect, it didn't reduce impact and cut away for a PG-13 rating, and the way in which it dimmed the sounds of the violence and turned up the music made it seem almost like a dance. and the world building, I was fascinated by this world, the golden coins and the hotel and all of the little intricacies laced into the movies were incredible. In short, I loved this film first time around.
Then I watched Park Chan Wook's Oldboy.
Oldboy is a masterpiece.
Watch it.
On my second viewing of John Wick I was viciously let down. 
After the first fifteen minutes in which the events that kick-start the plot take place, the plot ends. That's it. After that john wick kills people, for an hour and a half. Even the world building that enchanted me so much the first time around fell flat, on a second viewing it just seemed rushed, and only existed so that john could kill somebody else, it was a means to an end, and that showed. 
John Wick, people could argue, isn't about the plot, it's about creating a clean stylish action flick, with stylized, yet unflinching and realistic violence. But to those people I say: have you watched Oldboy. Everything that makes the violence in john wick so good, came from Oldboy, the dulling of the impact, not clear and precise, but thick and realistic, comes from Oldboy. The long action takes, the gorgeous action choreography, all from Oldboy. 
The other thing that Oldboy has that John Wick doesn't, is plot. Now, the clean stylish action flick is fine by me, but if it's as unoriginal as john wick, and everything in it has been done many times better, in a movie that didn't sacrifice plot for violence, and delivered masterfully on both, just don't bother, watch Oldboy. It has a plot, and fight scenes cooler than the ones in John Wick, where enemies don't feel the need to come one at a time so John can pick them off.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Need to ignore story, and even common sense while watching this movie.
Each and every bad guy, looking super sophisticated, forgets that he is holding a gun and not a piece of metal to come so close to the hero before pulling the trigger.
The friend of hero, reaches the rooftop of the building opposite to the room of the hero, points the sniper and waits. He shoots inches beside the hero to only alert him off approaching enemy. He could have called him up or shot the enemy if he is so concerned. But no, it's an action movie and it is not supposed to be logical, right?
The villian gives up the EXACT address where his son is hiding and patiently waits, having few drinks at his home, till the hero reaches there and kills his son. He then becomes angry, captures the hero, and leaves him with couple of idiots who tries killing him with a plastic bag. Seriously?
Each and every scene seems to to desperately made to look nonsensical.
Such scenes, which the movie is full of, spoils the pleasure of the action scenes and the curiosity that is initially created.
I'm so much confused how such good a rating it is attracting.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The action sequences flow beautifully in their cartoonish brutality, but the film falls short in the execution of the script. A story this silly should not take itself so seriously, if only they had more fun with the ludicrous plot and dialogue. I mean, you've got the mayhem guy from the Allstate insurance commercials playing a bad-guy executive secretary, surely that's good for a joke somewhere?

It's not that I have anything against bloodshed in film, provided it serves a purpose. But there's really nothing of substance here to grab onto, leaving us with scene after scene of revenge-murder chic that plays more like a video game than a film. Never has cold blooded murder looked so cool.John Wick is nicely shot and opens on a dreary and mysterious note, one that I wish the film would have sustained with a better story and better character development. Without the fundamentals we might as well be pressing buttons. Jump, Wick. Dive, Wick. Shoot, Wick.If I try and step back and critique it purely as action entertainment - the film is lacking in interesting choreography or chase sequences. Basically Wick happens upon completely unbelievable scenarios over and over again, pulls a gun out and shoots. No matter how many times the filmmakers put him into uncompromising positions, I never feel like he's in any danger. The routine gets boring after the first half hour and eventually the autopilot sets in.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

And, yeah. There's lots of action. But honestly - that's all there is. There isn't much in the way of character. I never figured out why the Willem Dafoe character acted the way he did. There's no humor to speak of. I didn't find the action sequences to be very creative, and I actually found them to be repetitive. For example there was one plot element where a lot of people are waiting for Wick to come and they are all checking in with each other by radio... and then exactly the same thing happens later on. There's lots and lots and lots of action but it's amazing how soporific it all got. And I mean it literally put me to sleep. I was pay-per-viewing it and I literally dozed off. More than once. It had been a long day at work, I admit. But if it had had any hook to hold my attention, I would have stayed awake. But it didn't. Well, there is this comic-book assassin subculture stuff with an economy based on special gold coins, but nobody past the fourth grade could believe in it.So I was honestly pretty disappointed. And I'm not someone who can't enjoy a good action film. Take ""Salt"", for example, which was also non-stop action, but which I found way more interesting and with more plot twists and stuff. There aren't really any plot twists in this movie. It was just entirely first-person-shooter for an hour and a half. Now, if someone says, ""But that's exactly the kind of movie I like! You're just biased against first-person-shooter non-stop hitting and pulling the trigger movies!"" I guess I don't have a good retort. But there it is.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Nothing much to see here: just the usual Hollywood anti-Russian propaganda. A man's dog gets killed...and who's the baddies? The Russians, of course. This just shows me that since 1962 up to now we haven't moved forward one bit - a lot of movies are still filled with anti-Russian propaganda, but the directors never contemplate about the dark side of imperialist states like the USA and Britain. They are probably going to make a movie sometime about how the USA and Britain have never lost a war and how they are always doing everything perfect and never lost a single soldier in a battle. Go and watch this if you want to be tormented by the usual egoistic protagonist who takes out a whole bunch of Russians. A lot of people argued that the fight scenes are brilliantly done, but that doesn't compensate for the egoism and downright propaganda of the story. Lighting visuals are quite good and here and there you will find some suspenseful moments, but don't get too excited: suspenseful moments that have the potential to be constructed into psychological masterpieces are merely watered down and consumed by the apparent ""heroism"" of the protagonist.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And my reasoning for a low score has everything to do with the subject matter of the anti-hero, the obvious mkultra programing that has been incorporated into the sound design and the message of the theme song which is played more than 3 times through depictions of murder. The lyrics whale, ""we don't kill the ones we love."" Then suggest's we kill strangers. The extremely violent well choreographed scenes of gun play look like a masterful ballet of bullets and blood. Which made me really wanted to like this movie and I commend the filmmakers for their skill set.

But as a whole, classic
film depended on good story, acting, and directing. Most importantly, if the acting leg didn't stand the whole table would topple.This is not the case today where anyone with influence or money can produce film.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
This story is on par with swill like ""The Punisher,"" and so many ""stories"" about men gone crazy. Here's what you need:1. Fast Cars (think the film ""Fast and Furious""
2. Wealth (why is it every one of these goons has seemingly limitless resources?)
3. Lost love of some kind (this was barely fleshed out here)
4. Conflict (this too is both weak and convoluted)
5. Bad acting (yep, but they still get paid mucho)Equally important ... the film starts in the middle of ""I DON'T KNOW!"" and then jumps like a flea into a kill-fest.What??? Did the writers and director (s) ever actually study under gifted mentors? How can anyone call this
story anything other than pus out of a vending machine.FULL Disclosure: The seeming hypocrisy here on my part here is that I thought the film ""Blade"" was fantastic. But
that's largely because it's very much off center and skates the razor's edge. In addition, having a lead
BLACK MALE doing the justice was way, way outside the white picket fence.ACTING:
I loved the films ""The Matrix"" and ""The Terminator,"" each for diverse reasons. One reason in is that both leads
(Reeves and Arnold) have either very few lines or they are brief. Neither of the mentioned actors can act. Let me
reword that, most contemporary actors cannot act (well).The acting here is passable, but is nonetheless useless in the context of a futile story.TEMPO:
Bounces around like a ball of flubberCINEMATOGRAPHY:
DarkDIRECTING / WRITING:
After looking over the resumes here I see one of the problems: this was co-directed by two guys (one a kick boxer)
where it happens to be their first rodeo. The writer (only one) has a shallow resume with little but emptiness.Is it a good film? No. It's horrible.Should you watch this once? Yes, if you're between the ages of 14 - 25, and your idea of knowledge is Google.Rating: 3 (for the cute puppy)","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Couching Tiger Hidden Dragon was good because it had exceptional action and it was all new and refreshing. But just your standard action flick, we've all seen it all before. There's really no story line.

Even Arnold's movies had good plots (Total Recall), made sense (Terminator), or were lighthearted swashbuckling action, like True Lies. Instead this was a comedy scene after scene, I couldn't believe it, I thought may be it's supposed to be a parody of the 80's and 90's movies:1. It starts out nice, but then, he drives around the airport like it's supposed to be a challenge driving fast in wide-open spaces.2. He got no alarm or any safety on his house, and gets ambushed like a complete amateur by guys wearing hard soled shoes. His excuse was that he was rusty, but only a day later, he is not rusty any more, but, without any practice he kills 12 people, which brings me to: 3. This rusty guy has an aim-bot in his brain and hand, and kills everyone with head-shot despite incredible speeds at which action must be moving when a dozen people attack you at the same time.4. Everyone in New York knows him, everyone is afraid of him, even cops, people at ""hotel"", garage owners, and Russian mafia, but only the son doesn't know him. In the end, I was expecting the mafia guy to contact corrupt army general, who sends drones to attack, but when the radar recognizes John Wick, the computer sets and locks the autopilot to fly back home.5. When he attacks the son, and the Vigo, his aim goes bad due to signal jamming.6. This war machine foolishly leaves curtains open so any two-bit sniper can take him out from 100 meters....7. He lets the woman sneak up to him (again while sleeping) without, again, setting some kind of personal alarm 8. Bad guys shoot him 3 times in the club, instead of unloading 20-30 bullets in the guy that just killed half the club. He shrugs 3 shots easily. Carries no armor.9. He is in wide open space, only 2 guys manage to hit him, when someone is about to shoot from behind, he ""feels"" the aim and turns and instantly shoots the bad guy.10. He does all this for a dog, but before the film is over, and the bones haven't even decomposed, he find another dog like he has already forgotten about the old one....that's how much he loved him.This is only what I can remember right now, I'm sure there is more. This movie, full of fantasy scenes, strange motivations, inconsistent characters, and old plots (vigo and his bad son ), strange assassin operation (I bet they tried to get Morgan Freeman to play the black guy at the reception desk), etc, doesn't deserve anything but criticism, or these idiots will continue to put out movies like this.

We've seen a lot of one against army or gang movies, but this one is just too much. I don't get how some people can compare it to Taken. Keanu Reeves is the same like in any other movie: same face, same gestures, same talk. Although there is something attractive to Keanu when it comes to action movies, he is just mediocre actor. The movie is also dark and camera is shaky so it is hard to see who fights where and who shoots. I didn't see much blood or gore either. On the contrary it seems like many shots were toned down. The movie is very inconsistent. In some places there's a lot of blood when person is shot; in others there is no blood at all. The conversations between Russian gang is very stupid and childish.

This movie does NOTHING to add to the genre.Plain, predictable, boring, and worst of all it seems that it even took ideas from other movies, such as ""Collateral"" or ""Wanted"". It even went all ""direct to VHS"" with scenes that left you thinking things like ""the guy you want dead the most happens to be right in front of you, you spent half the movie trying to kill that guy, and then for no apparent reason you just don't do it, just to try to kill him again once he is safety away from you...just WHY?"", or the classic ""bad foreign guys talking English when they are alone""...all the things that make us laugh when watching B-movies. Problem? The lead role is friggin Mr. Keanu Reeves! I mean, Keanu, my man, what's wrong with you? Did you already spent all that Matrix money? And you did some good stuff before and after so tell us, why did you find the need of making this movie? How could this topical typical unwanted and definitely not needed movie help your career? Man, I even liked Devil's advocate but this? This is murder man.So Mr. Reeves, I sincerely hope whatever financial problems you might be in, whatever favor you needed to do, whatever contractual requirements you had to fulfill, are now over and you can go back to do proper movies.As for whoever wants to watch this...just don't waste your time.Finally, if you want to ask why I did not give it the lowest mark the answer is that I like the golden coins thing.

I really like Keanu and some of his movies are really cool and interesting but this one is like an almost complete nonsense for me. Just killings and killings of bad guys because John Wick is sad and there is nothing left for him in this world. Maybe in the killers world they are like that, I don't know. I liked Taken with Liam Neeson better. It had a more credible story. In John Wick, most of the other actors didn't perform well...the son of the big boss is playing as unsustainable as he did in Game of Thrones. I guess, Keanu had to drag all this movie by himself and he wasn't that convincing all the time. Although, there are some scenes where I liked his acting and the fight scenes were pretty realistic, without too much fancy moves and visual effects. I don't want to criticize the work and effort put into this movies. Is just that this movie it's not for me 100% :)","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

Even though the movie did have some holding pros that could make this entertaining, but I can't say it was very good. The story is about a retired assassin, his wife died, and when he is starting to get order in his life, everything breaks up. Throughout the film he isn't doing anything special, except kill people, and vengeance, and more vengeance. The action sequences was filmed good, I have to admit. Epic camera-angles and great light set-up that could make things even more epic. But then the action itself. It isn't anything special, except that he is killing in different ways. I wished that they could have more gun fights or more battles with martial arts, that would be much cooler. The script and the dialogues were weak, it was very little plot, and I wished they could put more story, to make things more interesting, not just action and explosions all the time! John Wick as a character was the only thing that made the plot more interesting. His lose of his wife was showed greatly, and how he travels through his emotional journey. Keanu Reeves himself was on the middle. Sometimes he did some great acting, and sometimes he just looked very fake and plastic. The villain just came randomly, and it could be better if the presentation of him took some time and made it more mysterious, the villain could also be more menacing or have some better character development. The big pro of the film was surprisingly good pictures and scenography, and I can safely say that New York did look very good in here. The music and the John Wick theme was decent, but very easily rememberable and catchy. But well, besides good pictures, some John Wick development and ok music, this wasn't such a good movie. Could have been done much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan of action thrillers and Keanu Reeves hasn't been my favourite actor either. The selection of movies was pretty limited at the theatres, so decided to give John Wick a chance.Have to confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed it much more than expected. In particular Keanu Reeves as John Wick was very good. In the past the only roles that he ever looked comfortable and appropriate in were the characters who looked somewhat bewildered about what was going on. The first Matrix film in particular played to his strengths whereas the follow ups didn't convince as he was supposed to be a stronger character. There is no doubt that he pulls this off in John Wick, so will not be quite as snooty about Keanu in the future! The film itself is quite stylish and somewhat similar to Sin City in terms of style. Personally I found the on screen comments quite annoying, but the film is reasonably written in terms of screenplay. If you are a fan of action thrillers and/or Keanu Reeves I'm quite sure you'll really enjoy this movie.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

He's wooden, doesn't really act and is probably being paid by words spoken, because he has no more than 30 lines throughout entire movie, each about 3 words long.And he delivers them as if he's heavily drunk or woken up from coma.Rest of the movie is full of extremely bad Russian language that sounds nothing like one, cringy scenes of gangsters singing lullaby songs casually (what the hell) and John Wick being called ""Baba Yaga"" which is - again - extreme session of cringe, because Baba Yaga stands for typical fairy tale witch, ALWAYS a very old woman with crooked teeth and big nose. In no stretch of imagination could it be middle-aged male assassin. How can't be in - LA that has 6 million ethnic Russians - even a single person found, who can actually correct the director and train actors a bit better, I'm not sure. It's the biggest mystery of 21th century.And then, there's action. Where each and every enemy, instead of shooting their guns, tries to get into John Wick's melee range, gets thrown around by one and same Judo (or whatever) throw, disarmed and shot into head. Repeat 100+ times. Rare moments where baddies actually don't go wrestling and try to shoot, John Wick gets shot, and producers understood that, so most of the time, enemies prefer the throw and shot.Rest is odd mysticism, like gold coins that seem to have universal value per token, and can pay for corpse removal, many nights and a hotel or a single drink all the same. In other words, stupid.All of this applies to whole trilogy, really, save for cringy Russian stuff that's somewhat toned down in sequels.So the main question about whole thing is ""why?"". It's mildly entertaining, but I really didn't see anything to justify fandom and cult following.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Legendary assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) retired from his violent career after marrying the love of his life. Her sudden death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's father (Michael Nyqvist), John's former colleague, puts a huge bounty on John's head.I loved this film. It has a simple premise that gives viewers what they want, including stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero. Keanu Reeves is a skilled killer with fighting skills, assassination skills, and problem-solving abilities. The franchise is known for its action sequences, which are expertly choreographed, easy to follow, and fun. It combines humor with visually stunning cinematography. And the film's mythology of a criminal underworld with rituals and rules is a unique and interesting feature. But most of all, I loved how the action is synced to good music.I highly recommend this film to action fans and anyone looking for something different from the usual fare. It is purpose-built for genre-loving midnight-screening cine maniacs. I give this film 5 stars for being an amazing film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dissapointed at the ending. 0/10.I recently had the misfortune of watching a film that can only be described as an utter disaster. From start to finish, ""The Unwatchable"" left me in disbelief, not because of its captivating storyline or stellar performances, but because of its complete and utter lack of merit. It's hard to believe that anyone thought this film was a good idea, let alone greenlit its production.The plot is a convoluted mess, seemingly cobbled together from every tired cliche in the book. It's a sad attempt at originality that comes off as a desperate grab bag of uninspired ideas. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly unrelatable, leaving me with zero emotional investment in their fates.The direction and editing are amateurish at best. The camera work is shaky and erratic, making it impossible to discern what's happening during action sequences. It's as if the director was trying to induce motion sickness in the audience. The film's pacing is glacial, with long, drawn-out scenes that serve no purpose other than to test the viewer's patience.The performances are equally lackluster. The actors deliver their lines with all the enthusiasm of cardboard cutouts, and it's painfully obvious that they're just going through the motions. Even A-list talent couldn't salvage this trainwreck.To make matters worse, the special effects are laughably bad. The CGI is so poorly executed that it feels like a relic from the early 2000s. It's as if the filmmakers had never seen a modern blockbuster and had no concept of what contemporary standards entail.In summary, ""The Unwatchable"" is a cringe-inducing exercise in cinematic incompetence. It's a film that defies explanation, as I can't fathom how anyone involved in its production thought it was a good idea. Save your time and money; you'd be better off watching paint dry or staring at a blank wall.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can see both sides and personally thought the movie was rather poor, but it did have some things to appreciate about it.
Let's break it down:
(On a scale of one-ten stars)Story/script/plot: one star. Really the story was just a conduit to carry all the action sequences. If you came to watch a film that has any plot or something to stimulate the mind or emotions...look elsewhere.Casting/ acting: Four stars. Nothing absolutely awful but no remarkable performances. Just overall a flat, lifeless story and script that left little room for acting to have any impact or power. Actors, again, function as huminod forms for the action sequences to operate in.Cinematography/ set/ lighting: Ten stars.
Here's were the film really avoids being a total flop in my opinion. The cinematography was excellent in every way. Much creative use of color motifs and dramatic lighting.
Very interesting use of specific color hues in key scenes that coincide with the tone of the story. Fantastic luxurious sets. Great chic wardrobe selections- almost like The Matrix meets Wall Street. The climactic fight sequence in the rain was a visual masterpiece.Soundtrack: One star. Here's one part of the movie that really cheapend any artistic value it had going for it. The music was just so hokey. It felt like it was obnoxiously loud and overbearing intentionally in attempt to leverage the excitement the movie was lacking.
Just banal and tasteless.Action/ coreography: Six stars. Okay. So this movie calls it's action ""gun Fu."" The coreography and action was just ok. Yes, it used longer sequences without changing shots and had some very intricate coreography.
But there was never any suspense built up or context to support all the action- which makes it feel less intense.
It all came off as an extended dance routine with lots of headshots.
The fancy gunwork and martial arts would carry greater weight if undergirded by some moticum of a story line or performed by a character that you actually cared about.
Without the subcontext the movie ends up subjecting the audience to watching an extended sparring match. Hollow visuals.Conclusions:Imagine the final fight sequence from the first Matrix where Trinity and Neo shoot up the security gate in the lobby while rescuing Morpheus...now take that scene and try to make that one scene stretch for a feature length movie.
What you get is John Wick.It did have the sense of a comic book in film format: the framing choices, the lighting selections and the (goofy) colored/stylized subtitles all we're direct stylistic transplant from comic book style.I'm sure 15 year old boys would love this movie. It almost feels like it was made by some 15 year old boys with their daddy's budget.In short, John Wick is a beatifully filmed extended fight coreography performed by humanoid forms with some obnoxious music pumping too loudly.
John Wick is all about the visual aesthetics. To that extent, it excells.You may love it. You may hate it.I don't regret watching it but wouldn't recommend it as a great film to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Given, he does have the moves of an operator gained from training and practice. I can only imagine that the Director/editor must have meddled with his moves, because they're awkward.

There are just three possibilities: 1 - Waste of Time, 5 - Entertaining, but leaves you unsatisfied 10; - Superb!John Wick is a perfect 5. Keanu Reeves is delivering a fine performance I am not really a fan of him, so fine means he is not annoying but entertaining. The reasons to watch this movies are:Much well paced shoot out action mixed with enjoyable martial arts. It almost feels like a music video when the actions scenes start to roll. You'll hear thick drum and bass club music. Fast cuts, painful stunts and muscle-car-show-off. The story is almost a no brainer, which is for some days perfectly okay. Usually I have my brains switched on generally. So following flaws spoiled this fast cooked action fast food soup:The story and development of characters is static and very predictable. What the movie also lacks is a real terrifying evil antagonist. Look, on one hand we have Keanu who really is bad ass. On the evil side we have Michael Nyqvist a mafia boss. But I don't believe him. I was wondering where is the real mafia boss not his writer.After all the movie is a box office success. If I would have paid a cinema ticket I would have regret the waste of money. Now on Amazon Prime its OK.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film has a covert aura that wants to make you feel good about seeing hundred bad guys shot in an aesthetic manner. I realized I was enjoying how the lead character was shooting people skilfully and with style. There is no artistic aspiration or audacious in-depth exploration of the drama of life. In 'Kill Bill' maybe there was an attempt of that. In John Wick it is just a guy that uses his guns like a ninja his swords.From the cinematographic viewpoint, however, this is a film well done.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Utterly absurd, no matter how good the guy is supposed to be. There are so many tired tropes and cliches in John Wick. Letting main characters get away because they need to keep the plot going (plot armour). Even the heavy rock music is cliched, with the distorted blues riffs, like cheesy metal. Not good.

Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a character seen so many times before - a retired hitman. There are plenty of films where a retired hitman/mercenary/special agent/detective/superhero comes out of retirement for one last job/revenge. John Wick does nothing to stand out from the crowd. The action scenes are well choreographed. But the plot is predictable and derivative. And John Wick is too brilliant, too superhuman, that there is no tension to the action scenes. Apart from some decent choreography and a fantastic albeit utterly wasted cast, there is nothing to really recommend this film. Better off watching the Bourne films which did this story much better.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The whole thing is already a mess but they still felt comfortable enough to leave plot holes laying around in plain sight , this was just mockery .

Needless to say, the entire plot is adequately summed up in the trailer and if you like movies that set out to entertain in a simple way, the comic book logic and emphasis on stunts and action here will be right up your alley. From my viewpoint, I hesitate to say Reeves carries this movie to a certain extent, but I don't want to take too much away from the rest of the cast, though some like Palicki aren't given much of a chance to demonstrate their full range of talents or have a strong impact on the proceedings for lack of time on screen. Nyqvist gives an interesting performance but is fighting against a particularly weak script even by action movie standards, and his Russian Mob Boss character often comes off as somewhat of an imbecile, even if there are deliberate attempts at humor peppered in.Overall, Reeves is appealing and inherently sympathetic with a sombre low-key performance sort of reminiscent of what he did in 'The Watcher'. Notably his physical work with regards to the action is commendable, but in my opinion it is a shame it was not applied to a movie with a slightly stronger script and direction, when compared with a movie that strives for similar goals like 'The Equalizer' which lacked those deficiencies and made for a more well- rounded and engaging viewing experience. Worth watching, could of been better, so ** out of ****","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

What follows is some of the most vivaciously pulsating action entertainment Hollywood has, perhaps, ever produced allowing Reeves to announce to the world ""Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back"" in one of the most downright fun blockbusters for an age (until it isn't...which we'll get to).I think the major key to it's success that often goes unappreciated is that it's downright funny. To offer a strange comparison: it feels very much like the humour of David Lynch. There is a beautifully strange straight-faced ethereality to the world it builds and the interactions of those within it that almost lend it the air of being dreamlike fantasy. The character of John Wick is talked about as if a Grimm tale monster whom sparks fear into the heart of the toughest souls of the underworld, causing enemies and society (police officers etc.) to, in a comical show of participating obedience, placidly comply with Wick instead of incurring violent action from him. The 'world within the world' of the underground society of assassins is so fantastically surreal that you can't help but laugh along when Wick enters the Hilton for Hitmen. Much like with a David Lynch piece it's the way it is delivered that becomes incessantly hilarious; the characters are treating the surreal world seriously, nothing they say is outwardly funny in itself, but because of the deadpan delivery the dreamlike foreign incertitude it induces can't help but make you laugh. And everyone plays along. Every single performance understands their task in this surrealist embodiment of American action.Michael Nyqvist is absurdly entertaining as Vigo whom at first is introduced as an all intimidating villain but is immediately reduced to a babbling buffoon once the threat of John Wick is made apparent to him. Alfie Allen really dominated this era at playing that smarmy wrong-un that you just couldn't wait to see the heroes slap about a bit and again he plays it perfectly here. Lance Reddick, Ian McShane, Willem Defoe; all involved just seriously understand the tone and delivery required for this piece to work. Because in it's foundations it is of course an action revenge film, with a suitably nasty inciting incident involving the murder of a puppy (a perfect way to get the audience to back John's mission to slaughter all involved), and to avoid being bogged down in violent revenge misery it needed to retain a tone of sportive enjoyment which is exceeds at for the first hour of it's runtime.During this hour we see incredibly well choreographed balletic violence vibrantly soaked under the neon lights of the Red Circle nightclub and Wick's home. It blends the awkward realistic grappling and sparring of street fights with the incredibly gymnastic efficiency of the Hong Kong martial art movies that no doubt inspired it, mixing fists and bullets in equal measure. All of this plays out in wide shots for which the camera remains a non-participant (no Taken-esque shaky cam here) with Reeves himself performing the majority of his stunts allowing the weight of realism to form an ionic bond with the weightless athleticism and create an experience that throws you out of your chair, let alone putting you at the edge of said seat. It also expertly weaves the musical sounds of artists such as Le Castle Vania and Kaleida to almost scientifically pair your heart-rate with the unfolding ramped up action.Unfortunately it is unable to keep this electrifying atmosphere and pace. There reaches a point in the narrative where not only does both John and antagonist, Vigo's, motives seem to have strayed from their paths but so too has the colour and vivacity been drained from it's world. The neon soaked nightscapes of New York City are replaced with the biting cold winter daylight. The once bouncing electronic musical cues have turned into overbearing rock guitar pieces. And the action feels less like a balletic dance and more like an example of militaristic efficiency. The world and it's narrative become more cold. The once superficial revenge drama now rears its head and makes the experience more uncomfortable than what was once lively fun.Ultimately it's a flawed but promising first step into creating that all too rare thing in modern cinema: an original and exciting new franchise wholly of it's own making with no backlogs of material to research. A complete 21st century invention and a hope that originality is not dead.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A sleak, fun ride at the expense of a detailed plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4162053/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieManChuck","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80046415/?ref_=tt_urv","12 May 2018","2.5/4This is a very Good Friday night flick. You're home from work, and it's time to watch a movie. You don't want it to make you think, you just want good acting, lighting, direction, and cinematics, and no expenses on the plot. For that kind of night, this is a spectacular choice.First off, it's not at all that the plot is half-baked. There was no waste of paper writing this script. In John Wick, the plot comes in a half-portion. It is very simple and straightforward in an intriguing way. An oppressed ex-assassin is coping with the shame of his past-actions and the recent death of his wife. The last thing his wife gives him is a puppy. When the foolish son of his old crime-boss breaks into his house, kills the puppy, and takes off in Wick's Mustang...""Well I think I'm back!!""On another note, the actors really fit into their roles. Keanu Reeves, who is a veteran in stylized action sub-genre, really rocks Wick in much the same fashion he did Neo in The Matrix (1999). This time though, he takes on a much more cold, The-Man-In-Black type persona... a man of few words. The action sequences are quick, flashy, and all produce the same end result. It can get a tad monotonous after a while, but in the end it conveys John Wick as a character more. It shows that a broken man who has everything taken from him will have the most incentive to get to what he wants. Alfie Allen, although his character is never able to be presented in a likable, preforms his immature young adult criminal. Another very sublime detail that you might not pick up on is that the mob is very talky, profane, and excersises little patience, yet Wick is a thinker. John Wick is a character you can truly root for in his conquest to avenge his anguish.Cinematography proves another segway to the movie's stunning fluidity. Toward the beginning, Sela exaggerates very dark shades of black, and airy shades of white, giving the movie a very docile and harmless feel. As the plot unravels, you see the development of heavy greys kick in, and as the action sequences commence, neon and black become the dominant themes. It makes for a very tidy feature with slick fight sequences.Another item not usually found in this particular genre... a good balance of everything, from an editing standpoint right down to the acting. I was pleasantly suprised that John Wick had the delivery that it's predecessors seldom did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That would make Norwegians feel targeted and their reputation stained. Or imagine all villains were portrayed as South Africans. That would be absolutely awful. Why is it ok for the public to accept when Hollywood villainizes Russians? This is not good at all and people of all nations should stand up against that!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
