That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more.","136 out of 171 found this helpful.

"","","Overall, Iron Man 3 will divide many avid comic book fans, but is still a fun, exciting, and damn entertaining conclusion to the trilogy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2949057/?ref_=tt_urv","hasserbond","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50180847/?ref_=tt_urv","25 January 2014","Heres the story; playboy billionaire industrialist engineer Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is recovering from his battle in New York against aliens with the help of the Avengers, Marvels cannon of action-prone and muscle bound heroes. He's previously rebuilt his body after being held captive by Middle eastern extremists, in the process created a metal, enemy pulverizing suit, equipped with flying jets and energy blasters of course, defeated his crazy competitor, a vengeful, bird loving Russian, and now an alien race. Bottom line: the man's had his fair share of ass-kicking. This understandably, is beginning to effect him. He's having anxiety attacks and the fact that a supposed terrorist labeled the Mandarin is targeting civilians, and maybe even some friends of Mr. Stark, isn't helping. Sure enough as the story progresses, his pals, president, prodigy, love, and life are on the line. With out giving away many of the films twists and turns, Tony ends up somewhat back where he started and must find the tools to save his fate before time runs out and you know the story. Or do you...? The good: Iron Man 3's action sequences dazzle with ""Marvel-ous"" (sorry couldn't help myself) visual effects, but the real show stealer is the films extremely clever, frequently hilarious, and awesomely self aware humor. Shane Black peppers the script with so much chewable wit and varying, unexpected twists that you can't help yourself from having a great time amidst the violent chaos, even though some may find the jokes distracting. I beg to differ. RDJ owns the role and steals the show as Iron Man once more. Per usual, he adds in his perfect mixture of narcissistic snakiness with evolving dramatic struggles, but never takes it all to seriously. Not only does he do well, but the entire cast all are fairly strong and add their fair share of laughs, deliciously evil or humorously likable moments, and seem to be having a good time as well. The story is thick but presented in a well paced and orchestrated fashion and it strings together the explosions in a clean juxtaposition (oxymoron?) with it's reveals and character developments. The special effects are top notch and immerse the audience into the fast paced action sequences, and they also carry the torch on from The Amazing Spiderman in which the SFX are a slight notch more realistic and crisper than previous Marvel outings of the past 3 years. And now for the direction, while Shane Black doesn't completely steal the show visually, he sure as hell puts his personal stamp on the film, and I welcome it. He has taken the previous material and blended it with his different style and humor and created what I believe to be a more unique and quirkier superhero flick that delivers much of what it promises, but surprises as well in areas you wouldn't expect. Many die hard comic fans will be angered or even infuriated by the liberties Black takes with the source material, but again as a non-comic book reader, you won't hear any complaining from me. I love his ambition and some of the daring choices he makes along the journey. In conclusion I think that he has tied an equal parts goofy but still satisfying bow on the explosive trilogy, and has made me excited for more Marvel outings to come. As a side note, go into it with an open mind, stay after the credits, you won't be disappointed!","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

For me and the audience, it was just as good as it was first presented in Iron Man 1. It keeps you entertained along the movie, some good laughs here and there, cool tech, Decent action sequences, etc. You can't really hate the character, his quirks and gadgets regardless of the plot.The trailer and the first part of the movie sets you in a dark atmosphere not seen and experienced in the 2 previous installments. You know that very soon things will get serious and bad for our main characters, the downfall is imminent. But then as the movie progresses, one keeps expecting some real trouble; a ruthless, merciless and powerful villain to reign over the story...And it happens of course, (without revealing anything), it just that is really nothing special, really. The plot ends being flat and its just as rewarding as Iron Man 2 plot. Positive aspects: -New tech and gadgets: It is shown and comes across the story in unpredictable moments and ways. Really fun -I liked the soundtrack, it gave the movie more depth and feeling. I think it was better than previous installments, only it got repetitive at the end of the movie -A+ visuals and effects -Bad ass Suits and actionsNegative: -A lot of the plot aspects are left behind mid film. Some of them are poorly handled and explained and are just thrown or taken out of nowhere to keep up the pace of the film -villain does not delivers 100%: A superhero movie is not only about the main hero, the villain is just as important.Comic reader or not, it will be fun film. Just don't expect anything big that will leave you talking and thinking about the matter for a couple of weeks. When you walk out of theater you will be pleased for sure, the movie is worth it after all. It just that its not what many expected and it will just leave you with a big: ""Thats it?","163 out of 326 found this helpful.

And sure enough, I felt a little disappointed when I was done. And then I sat down to think about it. And the more I thought, the more I realized what a good movie I had just watched. I think what put me of at first was the lack of Iron Man, as in the suit. This movie is more about the character of Tony Stark dealing with his personal issues, and I think that was the right call. His character and his relationsship with Pepper is expanded on in a natural way, and his struggles feel realistic and like a logical progression for him as a character. The movie suffers a bit from a few unnecessary characters and scenes in the middle of the movie, and there are some other pacing issues, but for the most part, the movie is well-structured. It also has a villain with a pretty cool design, even if he is rather bland and boring as a character. The action is well made and has a decent amount of tension as well. This is definietly a step-up from Iron Man 2, and while it's not as good as Iron Man 1, it's definietly a fun time that I don't regret watching.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?","139 out of 280 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A risk-taking third solo outing for 'Iron Man' with plenty of payoff","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2913948/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","30 November 2013","How will Marvel's universe ever be the same after ""The Avengers""? There's bound to be a vocal percentage of viewers who walk out of ""Iron Man 3"" thinking, ""why didn't he just call his superfriends in the end?"" It's a good question, one that Drew Pearce and Shane Black's script doesn't ignore, but never satisfyingly answers. Yet that doesn't seem to matter. The bigger question that Marvel has addressed is whether it could effectively narrow the scope of its universe again after ""The Avengers"" blew it open‚Äîand the answer is yes.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) hasn't been the same since his near-death experience in a intergalactic wormhole at the end of ""The Avengers."" In fact, the words ""New York"" have become a trigger for his newly discovered anxiety attacks. He has spent his funk by building an inordinate amount of Iron Man suits, and specifically a remotely operated suit that he can summon through a biological tracking system. When a terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) emerges, hacking U.S. airwaves to spread fear and causing thermal explosions, Tony calls him out on his cowardice, a move he immediately regrets.As the script continues to introduce all the players in this third iron-clad outing, from Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian‚Äîa think tank manager Tony spurned 13 years ago‚Äîto Don Cheadle's Col. Rhodes who has a new gig as the stars-and-stripes-studded presidential bodyguard Iron Patriot, the film appears as a sloppy mess likely to meet the same fate as ""Iron Man 2."" Only when Tony begins to pursue the mystery of the terrorist bombings do all these seemingly disparate pieces begin to come together into what's actually a rather clever story.Story structure aside, the script does boast plenty of Stark quips in case you worried the directorial turnover from Jon Favreau to Shane Black would alter the tone of the franchise. Not even close. If anything, the ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" director pushes the boundaries of political correctness with some of the dialogue, especially in the scenes in which Tony finds himself teamed up with a 12-year-old boy.""Iron Man 3"" digs deeper into the psychology of Tony Stark, at least more than you'd expect from a blockbuster. Rather than open with an action sequence to get the ball rolling, we get a flashback to when Stark met Pearce's Killian as well as a genetic engineer named Maya played by Rebecca Hall. Things don't really begin to pick up until Tony has his mansion blown into the ocean.Not unlike ""Iron Man 2,"" the film's action is largely reserved for the grand finale. Still, the amount of special effects shots is probably tripled, and the action sequences when they do come were written to be as unique and memorable as possible, with a skydiving sequence taking the cake. ""Iron Man 3"" hits big whenever it makes the effort to do so, proving again how Marvel Studios holds a quality entertainment standard rivaled by few.The ""Iron Man"" films (and this is partly fault of the comic) lack truly excellent villains. This film sets up Tony Stark's greatest nemesis in the Mandarin, but complicates it in a way you'll never see coming considering how studios and writers have flocked toward villains in the mold of Heath Ledger's Joker from ""The Dark Knight.""The movie gambles in that way and in other ways not all audiences will recognize. Take the boy for example. If the film failed on the whole, it would forever be remembered as ""the 'Iron Man' movie with Tony Stark and that kid."" That's dangerous territory. If ""Spider-Man 3"" had worked, everyone wouldn't refer to it as ""the one with emo Peter Parker.""Nothing gambles more than the script, which spends a lot of time setting up the premise for what it hopes will be an effective payoff. So much of the film seems anecdotal until you see how the pieces fit. Even then, there's no guarantee the audiences will be compelled by the completed puzzle, but ""Iron Man 3"" goes bold enough to surprise in a good way.The humor definitely misfires at times and the sense of danger doesn't pervade the film from start to finish, but considering how must third installments have sputtered (""Spider-Man 3,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand""), it's testament to a number of quality components at work behind the scenes, not excluding ""The Avengers,"" which clearly reenergized Iron Man as a solo character. Without it, no way ""Iron Man 3"" opens with nearly $175 million after the critical disappointment toward the second.Few actors have truly created and owned a character like Downey Jr. and Tony Stark. Without him, Iron Man is just a second-class superhero in Marvel's canon. He single-handedly launched Phase One of Marvel Studios' plan and gave audiences a multi-dimensional hero with both despicable and lovable qualities. If he powers down the suit after ""The Avengers 2,"" it'll be the end of an era.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","46 out of 69 found this helpful.

Perhaps one problem was that it was too much Disney and insufficient Marvel.The thing I was conscious of at many points throughout the movie, was that in ridiculously violent fights between unarmored and unprotected simple flesh and blood humans... no one gets hurt. In Road Runner cartoons, when the anvil flattens the Coyote, it's quite funny due to its ludicrous overstatement. But the real parts of a movie involving humans -- which are intended to be believable -- really need to remain believable... or it's asking too much from a mature audience.As a Science Fiction lover, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of immersion into a new idea. I loved the first IronMan, and have watched it many times. So I will gleefully imbue a robotic suit with any levels of strength and power the story may require. That's fine. Bring it on. Thrill me. But I know the limitations of an unaided human body. We all have one. And what I saw far too much of, against human flesh, was a level of coyote-flattening violence that was utter nonsense.Despite the fact that I have no doubt IronMan will break US domestic box office records, as it already has overseas, I think that ""Oblivion"" was the far better movie so far this summer./Steve.

It is not a bad movie but it certainly is not what you'd expect after The Avengers. Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. He delivers his lines as witty as he can but at one moment the jokes become one too many. The movie derails from what it should be and becomes a comedy. And not in the good way. Most of the jokes are out of place in moments which should be dramatic and thus the scenes cannot be taken seriously.Ben Kingsley is great but the weak script doesn't do any good to the main villain. And a superhero movie needs a good villain which Iron Man 3 hasn't.Don Cheadle's character is mismanaged and doesn't contribute to the plot or the movie in any way.One of the good things in Iron Man 3 is Tony and Pepper's relationship which is handled really well and the chemistry between the actors reflects on the screen.The ending is forced in a way but after all the film ends on a high note. It certainly could have been better but given as it is Iron Man 3 is a good continuation to the story of Tony Stark that leaves you with wanting more and we all know at some point Robert Downey we put on the suit again and maybe we'll get a movie on the level of the original.","51 out of 89 found this helpful.

There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.The plot consists of a terrorist called the Mandarin threatening America's safety and teaching its president and people a lesson. After his friend Happy Hogan is put into a coma thanks to one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony vows to strike back. But after an attack from his enemy leaves him homeless and weaponless, Tony must find a way to stop his foe's plans while reevaluating his troubled existence. Downey Jr. hits the ball park once again with his Stark character showing his usual playful charm, but also his vulnerability at times. The events that took place in The Avengers take a heavy toll on the character and RDJ plays it quite professionally. Other characters were sort of a bore to me with Pearce's Killian as an exception. The plot once again fails to make sense, making it more comparable with the second rather than the first. Overall the film entertains and the visuals combined with the leading man's appeal make for an enjoyable time, however when it comes to the story it doesn't come close to Marvel movies like the first Iron Man and The Avengers.Rating 8/10","17 out of 28 found this helpful.

"","","Wonderful!

Meaning that to try and follow Avengers with bigger wild action would have been futile. So, they went in a unique, deeper and more powerful direction. Sure there are stunning action sequences but everything is in context of a greater theme and the entire story. They absolutely played this one just right. They let The Avengers sit on its own and didn't do anything but feed off the momentum and actions of that film. Everything here is focused on Tony Stark and his immediate universe. Avengers 2 is the last thing on anyone's mind watching this and, as much as I loved Avengers, that's a good thing. Everything needs to kind of re-set and take a breath. This movie is NOT concerned with being connected to anything larger or having Nick Fury come in and solve or oversee anything. The events in The Avengers are addressed but only felt as to their effect on Tony's psyche. This movie is about Tony Stark's journey after we've seen him last. It really does perfectly explore his character and develops him deeper than we have seen since the first act of the very first film. It really is the perfect way to go and everything is exceptionally well done.","46 out of 94 found this helpful.

But this movie makes all the others (yes.. including Avengers) look like a child's play. He upgrades the suit till Mark 42 which is like the coolest armour ever. His A.I, Jarvis also gets updated to a level that it can control the suits without any involvement of a man inside the armour. So, when it comes to the visual effects and action you get more than what you asked for.Now, coming to the story, it could have been better, especially with the Mandarin story. The twist was so lame. It seemed like they wrapped up the story too quickly and without any clear reason, tony stark simply throws his whole Iron Man life away. I know it has to end but it could have been handled better.Now, the cast. Robert Downey Jr is, as always charming and witty. His one liners have always impressed me and you could expect some of the best ones in this movie. Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce are okay. Ben Kingsley has a little role but he managed to throw a little humor in the story.Overall, this is a good movie and I will recommend this to every one. It will provide a few good laughs and some mind blowing action scenes.","33 out of 66 found this helpful.

The last two Iron Man mostly studies the human complexity of Tony Stark which already makes a pretty compelling film even if it leaves the action as its extra pleasure. In this Iron Man, it is more into the large explosions which is totally right for its source material. In this film, you will find one of the best action sequences of the superhero movie milieu. The plot gets a little messy at times and the morality beneath it is quite obvious, but without a doubt, the film is excessively fun. It's not the best of the franchise but it's still one of its great films.It's bigger and louder compared to the last two. It tells a larger plot and deals with trickier villains for Tony Stark to play around. We can still root for their world's innovations and characters. The parts that are suppose to be deep are however sometimes contrived and obvious. But the film is thankful to have something to cover up some of its flaws, example is scattering the entire film with humor, and of course, explosions. It's all naturally fun mostly thanks to the cast. Robert Downey Jr. is still brilliant as Tony Stark and he explores more of the character. His backup are also as charming. For the villains, Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce take a little camp and they seem to enjoy it, but Pearce brings it to the table in the end.Shane Black takes the director's chair this time. He is known for Lethal Weapon and the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. He gives a brand new direction to the series. Unlike what the promotional posters and trailers have shown to us, the film is still not that dark toned but it has more serious threats. Black knows how to balance the serious and comedic moments. The first half though takes the roots of the original by showing Stark's imperfectness. The rest is simply an easy redemption. It's a clever move for a sequel that is suppose to be bigger than its predecessor. The action is thrilling as it is suppose to be. One of the film's memorable action is the scene(briefly shown in trailer) when Iron Man is trying to save a bunch of falling passengers from a plane. It is a sequence that is simply electrifying. This comment might sound like a hyperbole, but whatever, it is unobjectionably breathtaking. Then there's more at the climax where you'll get a taste of glorious explosions.Iron Man 3 tricks the audience for a deeper theme. That certain theme was solved way too easily in the end and the film rather focused on staying to the natural tone of the Avengers universe and that's fine. Besides, we're already done of seeing superheroes fall and being defeated throughout the film until the climax. The whole point is that great heroes become better heroes thanks to their weaknesses. The most noticeable thing you would spot here is when Iron Man's armor is keep crashing and falling apart and Tony's anxiety caused by what he did in The Avengers. It's comical but it's an interesting speculation. Many would still say the original is the best because it is indeed better in plot and character development, but for those who are seeking for better action will definitely love this as well. It is just way too fun. Iron Man 3 may not be the most compelling in subject but it's already a compelling experience you'll get in an action blockbuster.","181 out of 339 found this helpful.

In many respects its like watching Star Wars: Episodes 1-3 or The Hobbit. It's dressed in a pretty package but there is no heart or longevity in the gift. The fact that the series may wrap up with this film leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, much like the disappointing The Dark Knight Rises.

Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1. Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and I'll skim through them quickly. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movies head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly) is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man,and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie has; where are the rest of the guys? Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun bad guy. But this all changes with a plot twist that totally makes you do a face palm. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and is hard to take seriously. There are other plot holes that I'll avoid talking about due to spoilers and length, but there are a few more. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave off that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but still was awesome in his own way.Now, with that all being said the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, and between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the face palm moment). While the action makes up for possibly the best parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie.","18 out of 27 found this helpful.

The sequel three years ago looked somewhat worse, but last summer in The Avengers, Downey Jr showed that he is still the most beloved superhero.In Iron Man 3, a well-aimed joke still manages to break the intense heat emitted from the various scenes. Thanks to director and screenwriter Shane Black, who has previously worked with Downey Jr in the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, there is a neat balance between action and humor, just like Iron Man from 2008. Although Black uses this technique way too often in the first half hour of the movie, making it look like the Lethal Weapon series, the sheer fun stays and more importantly it does not interfere with the primary plot.However, action is key throughout the movie. Now a topical issue, a series of bombings startle the American people (Boston is not one of the affected towns in the movie). The attacks are claimed by a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Surprisingly enough, he has not been portrayed as a Chinese but rather a Bin Laden-type of guy naturally characterized by the beard.The Mandarin has been brought forward as a strong villain who simply wishes to teach the people of the United States a lesson. I am not really a fan of the comics, so purely looking at the Mandarin on the screen I can say that Ben Kingsley has done extremely well in his portrayal. After some tragic events (I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you), Iron Man literally invites the Mandarin to his residence in Malibu: the game is on.Noticeably, Gwyneth Paltrow who plays the lovely Pepper Potts has more action scenes than in the two previous movies together. I do like that. It brings more drama to the big screens and it also emphasizes the developing chemistry between Tony in person or suited-up and Pepper. Added to this triangle are new characters who make Iron Man 3 still original and suspenseful apart from the main storyline. This is not a dark brooding movie at all.In the end though, of course, everything and everyone is related in some way or another, but Iron Man 3 has got enough surprises and twists up its sleeve to make us forget about the classic Iron Man we once knew and the hero that he has become. The actors have performed beyond my expectations, especially the Mandarin who instantly gave me the creeps. The movie regularly refers to The Avengers, but even if you haven't seen that one you won't miss out on anything.Iron Man 3 is up until now the best movie from Marvel Studios. Surprising twists, humorous sneers and bombastic action scenes: Tony Stark's beating heart is back.","36 out of 74 found this helpful.

This time around, there's no distracting Avengers subplot and the main focus goes to the main character instead. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is at his best and fits his role perfectly as the arrogant, smart-ass Tony Stark by delivering sharp witty dialogue that make the film downright hilarious. Great round of applause for the people who's responsible for thinking up the various ways Tony can put on the suits in the film, well done!However, the film crossed the borderline of science fiction and science fantasy. There are things in the film that's simply could not happen in reality under any circumstances, which some movie-goers might find it hard to accept. As a person who knows the cartoon and comics, the direction the film took for the characters and the ""Extremis"" story arc is questionable. Some Marvel fans/purists will find it unacceptable, but for casual movie-goers, the plot is great and it's really a personal story about the titular hero. Iron Man 3 showed that it's not just a superhero film, but a smart comedy film as well. So, in the end, does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit? Well, you damn well know what the answer is after finish watching this film.","93 out of 169 found this helpful.

Seriously screwed the pooch on that. This was a Tony Stark story, not an Iron Man Story It appears that Tony must have got some shield training because now the rich guy that only knows how to blast people and tackle people acts more like a cross between Macguyver and Hawkeye then Iron Man.They screw up several major plot points from the first two movies such as why Tony has a superconductor in his chest to begin with and the weapon systems war-machine uses.Finally, Where the hell is Nick Fury. Iron man does not need to have Nick Fury in his movies. Except when that movie basically deals with domestic terrorism on a massive front. If you see this movie you will see a part specifically where iron man calls out a major bad guy in the press and says bring it on I will be here. In the marvel universe there is no way in hell something that public would not have shield all over it.

But, at the same time, it delivers something that is not the original ""Iron Man""‚Äîit's got more than the original and so much less. First the more‚Äîthe film has more stunts, more CGI, more action and more explosions than ever before in the series. If that is what you're looking for, then you'll no doubt be satisfied. As far as less goes, the film has much less in the way of plot, characters and, especially, fun. Now I am not saying it's a bad film‚Äîbut by this third film in the series (and the fourth appearance by Robert Downey Jr. as the lead) the formula is a bit faded. Good¬Ö.but faded.By this installment, like his comic book character, Tony is a serious screwball. He rarely sleeps and has significant problems with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. And, at times, he seems more machine than man. Not surprisingly, his personal life is a mess. At the same time, two threats are looming‚Äîone by a brilliant but morally suspect inventor (Guy Pearce) and another from a lunatic seemingly modeled after Osama Bin-Laden (Ben Kingsley). While the Pearce plot is much more important to the film, I really liked what they did with Kingsley, as this was an injection of humor‚Äîand the film needed all it could get. In fact, Kingsley's character and performance is my favorite thing about the movie. Now the cute is isn't bad, either, but he did seem a bit like a clich√©. The bottom line is that Tony needs to come, once again, to the aid of the world and in the process there are fifty bazillion stunts, explosions, MANY situations in which he could not possibly survive (yet he does¬Öwhich makes little sense) and a lot of 3-D. Now the 3-D portion bothered me, as it really wasn't necessary for the film and didn't enhance or detract from my viewing at all. If I had the choice, I'd probably see the normal version simply because it's cheaper.Oh, and by the way, where are the great AC/DC tunes? Instead, the soundtrack is okay but features songs by Dwight Yoakim. I am sure Yoakim is a nice guy¬Öbut he's not AC/DC. So, in summary, I wanted more humor, less explosions, more plot and more AC/DC. If we can't have that, perhaps this should be the last film in the series‚Äîand the end does hint that that COULD be the case¬Ö.maybe.","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

That's you.""Since Shane Black has signed to do Iron Man 3 I have been so excited for this picture, and i was already excited enough for Marvel phase 2 after the Avengers. Teaming up once again in his second outing with his Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang lead, and it does not disappoint. A typical Super hero story, The international terrorist The Mandarin arrives on the scene and causes mayhem across the world, and may have help from some scientist acquaintances from Tony's past. For me Iron man's greatest strength is the casting of Robert Downey Jr. He encapsulates the character so well, the charisma,the humor, the ego so well. If this is to be his last appearance in a stand alone Iron Man. I for one can not think of anyone around at the moment who could take over the role,especially in the inevitable reboot of the franchise. Getting back to this film the cast of iron man has always been top notch with great support characters played by Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and i could go on. This sequel hasn't gone down the usual route of recent sequels. Not going darker but keeping fun, not going bigger and louder (don't get me wrong there are some big action set pieces) but stripping Tony of the suit for large parts and focusing on the character. There is decent action to be seen, with the destruction of Tony Stark's home, for me being some of the best 5 minutes of intense action i have seen for quite some time. Also Iron man keeps it's good humor and puts in a decent amount of laughs. The ending of the movie is where i find some problems, as it quite predictable and never built any sense of dread, that the bad guys could win. The bad guys in this film The Mandarin, Aldrich Killian and there Extremis Super soldiers. Which are a major improvement on previous Iron man villains. Seem very intimidating and imposing, but the motivation for there crimes seems a little fuzzy.A good film by Shane Black in his first foray in to comic book/action, and if it is Downey Jr's last. It's not a bad way to bow out.","70 out of 125 found this helpful.

At the time of its release, this midway twist proved to be quite polarising, with many critics and fans revelling in the clever direction of the story, whilst others despaired at a Hollywood mishandling of an iconic character. Either way, Iron Man 3 will have you talking about it by the end.And so you should; because, even setting aside the divisive twist, this is a hugely entertaining comic book movie infused with a wonderful sense of humour, a breakneck pace and some truly spectacular action sequences.The story revolves around Tony Stark/Iron Man facing a new threat known as The Mandarin whilst juggling his relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and keeping Guy Pearce's creepy scientist at bay. It seems like there is a lot going on but by keeping the focus squarely on Tony, director Shane Black is able to keep the narrative from becoming incoherent, and more importantly, retain its sense of fun. Downey Jr. is completely at home in the role of Tony Stark. He throws out one liners and insults with such ease yet achieves a sense of vulnerability not yet seen in the character. It is his most assured performance as Tony and one can only hope that he doesn't stop here. But it is not just Downey Jr. on form here, as Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, and most notably Ben Kingsley deliver fantastic performancesWith the success of Avengers Assemble, and the decision to make this movie the first of Marvel's 'Phase Two', it would be understandable if Black was feeling any pressure, but it certainly doesn't come across on the screen. It may have been tempting to try and better Avengers Assemble by going bigger, flashier and louder; but wisely, Black chooses to rein in the more ridiculous aspects of comic book movies, and delivers a film which is more concerned about the man inside the suit, not just the suit itself. That is not to say there is not a lot of action; there is and it is eye popping, but in between the explosions and stunts, we get a chance to spend time with Tony and see what makes the snarky billionaire tick. The fact that it proves to be just as exciting and interesting as the segments with the suit is a testament to both Black's script and Downey Jr.'s performance. A bold and surprising take on one of the most popular movie characters since Jack Sparrow. Filled with exciting action, hilarious one liners and one or two unexpected plot turns, Iron Man 3 will have you grinning throughout its 2 hour runtime.","20 out of 31 found this helpful.

There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) assumes the attempts broadcasting through television.

Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.""Iron Man 3"" is a disappointing adventure with a silly and forgettable story. The good cast and the top-notch CGI are unable to save this movie and are wasted in a poor screenplay.

You may have seen reviews negatively discarding this movie. It's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it.Showing from my score I loved it, it takes more of a different turn than the first two with the story which is about Tony and developing him as a character.First of all, the writing great (what do expect from Shane Black). The witty dialogue and one liners had me gut busting with laughter. Even the twist that I'd hate to spoil is pretty funny to even be considered a comedy. Most of this is due to Robert Downey Jr. turning in another performance as Tony Stark, the likable a**hole. The supporting cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, who is a good villain but just no Loki or Joker level.The action is well directed too, showing Tony can kick a** with or without a suit. There small shootouts and fistfights along with your big budget stuff you expect from Marvel include a very tense attack on Air Force One. The CGI is great too.People have been constantly been nitpicking at this movie, relax, it's not every movie where it is required to analyze every part of the plot and story. It's just a bit popcorn munching, summer blockbuster fun. Not f****ing Citizen Kane.","20 out of 31 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Kicks Off With a Suitable Entry.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2858611/?ref_=tt_urv","slicedbread117","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26777495/?ref_=tt_urv","26 August 2013","In 2008, Iron Man ushered in a new era of superhero movies that would push the genre to unbelievable success over the next 5 years. Iron Man 2, although not as strong as the first, proved itself a worthy sequel on the road to The Avengers. Now with The Avengers all assembled, Iron Man 3 kicks off Marvel's second stage of their cinematic universe with a solid, but not amazing film, much like Iron Man 2 was to Iron Man 1.The first thing you notice in this movie is that it's moving in a different direction than the previous Iron Man films, and this is largely due to a new director at the helm. While Jon Favreau was in the chair for the first two movies, and continues is role as Happy Hogan, Shane Black was chosen to direct the third entry in the beloved Iron Man series. The movie takes a less grounded tone, and while many viewers will enjoy the direction that Black as taken the series, it's safe to say that a majority of the hardcore comic book reading audience will fail to enjoy the movie in the same way.Let's get the negatives out of the way. The number one problem with this movie, and the reason it could turn hardcore fans off, is the plot, or more specifically, the number of plot holes. There are a few of them, and they hit the film pretty hard. First off, while this is a stand alone Iron Man movie, the cloud of the Avengers was hanging over the movie's head the entire film. The main villain, The Mandarin (who I'll talk more about shortly), is a terrorist who is severely threatening America's national security. You'd think that maybe Captain America might be able to help out with this crisis because, I don't know, he has America in his name! And we know he exists in the same world as Iron Man, and his job is to protect the stars and stripes right? My point is that although this is an Iron Man movie, now that the Avengers has been released, I fear that all of the stand alone movies could suffer from the same question that this movie presents; where are the rest of the guys? Second, is the villain. When Ben Kingsley was announced to play Iron Man's greatest foe, I was pumped. The trailers looked awesome and in the first half of the movie, The Mandarin is a scary and fun antagonist. But this all changes with a plot twist that completely leaves your face buried in your hands. Following this twist, the movie just isn't the same, and it's hard to take seriously. There are other minor issues such as pacing inconsistencies, but nothing else deprives the film like the aforementioned twist. Besides the plot, the only other complaints I have is that there simply was not enough action from Iron Man himself and when there was, it was fast and minimal. Iron Man never gave that super bad ass vibe that he did in the first movie, but luckily was entertaining enough to prevent the entire film from nosediving. With that all being said, the movie had many positives going for it. The action was exciting and fun and the CG effects added to the action very nicely. Tony Stark deals with his inner demons following the events of The Avengers, and this is an interesting part of the film, one that forces Tony to change his character and have you rooting for him to ovecome. The comedy in Iron Man 3 is plentiful, almost too plentiful, but between the high-octane action and the comedic relief, there is never a dull moment (excluding the horrible twist). While the action is without a doubt the finest parts of the movie, it would be nothing without the actors behind those sequences. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows us that he is arguably the most entertaining actor to ever play a superhero on the big screen. Simply put, he steals the show once again. Whether he's cracking a joke, kicking major butt, or battling with his inner demons, Downey Jr. is a treat to watch. And surrounding him is a wonderful cast of supporting characters such as Iron Patriot (Don Cheadle), Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) to name a few. The acting is one of the best parts of the movie. To conclude, Iron Man 3 might not live up to Iron Man 1, but how many sequels do? Yes there are some huge plot holes but the seamless blend of entertaining action and comedy plus the fantastic acting save the movie from being a train wreck. Iron Man 3 is a solid and respectable entry in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe and it is currently the 4th highest grossing movie of ALL-TIME. Casual superhero movie fans will probably enjoy more than others, but even for the hardcore, Iron Man 3 delivers an entertaining movie that I wouldn't skip out on.7/10","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

It (for better or worse) began the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" that climaxed with The Avengers. This is the first marvel movie to be released after The Avengers, and in many ways it proves that the series is still going strong, however, it is far from perfect.ACTING: 8/10The acting from the main cast members is great. Robert Downey Jr. continues to be the perfect Iron Man, I just can't imagine a better suited actor. His comedic timing is perfect, and he allows Tony Stark to be lovable while being a total jerk. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle don't get a ton of screen time, however, they are wonderful when they do. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall are all fantastic and underused. The rest of the cast is perfectly adequate, however, there seems to be a theme of casting great talents and completely under using them.WRITING: 3/10This is the biggest failure of the movie. The comedy works well (partially thanks to Robert Downey Jr.) and the action scenes are good, however the plot hidden behind the popcorn fun is plain awful. I have never really liked movies that deal with ""super soldiers"" and ""protecting the president,"" and this movie deals with both badly. The technology written into the series continues to become more and more ridiculous. And the twist is both easy to predict and manages to reduce the main villains role to nothing. Finally, the scene after the credits is a bit of a let down as it gives no hint towards the direction of the series. DESIGN: 6/10The design is just as good as previous films in the series, which is to say that it fits somewhere between satisfactory and slightly above average. The tech looks great despite its lack of plausibility, and the wardrobe and sets fit the overall tone of the movie. EFFECTS: 10/10The CGI is near perfect in this film, and there is a ton of it. There are scenes where Iron Man's suit magnetically attaches to Tony in separate pieces and it looks totally convincing. The explosions and impossible technology looks great too. MUSIC: 4/10The soundtrack in this movie is awful. Hans Zimmer has inspired many with his booming and electronic score for Inception and the Batman franchise. This concept has been replicated a hundred times since those movies, and in lesser hands it is nothing but a loud mess. This is the case with Iron Man 3. The score is loud and booming, and completely forgettable, dull and repetitive.VERDICT:This movie is mindless, unimpressive, forgettable, action packed... and thoroughly enjoyable. It is a great summer blockbuster popcorn movie that will leave your mind as soon as you leave the theater. That being said, if you liked The Avengers and Iron Man 2, you will likely enjoy this movie as well. Overall, I give it a 6.2/10","309 out of 631 found this helpful.

Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****","21 out of 33 found this helpful.

The 3- D is OK, but it's the type where not much seems to change (except you only seeing 40% of the usual photons you would). The score is typical of such films; as for the acting, Ben Kingsley is a great actor (as far as his role allows him to be), and the rest just about manage to keep up. I was mentally comparing Mandarin to Bane in that I expected him to be a great presence on screen, and a menacing, worthy opponent to Tony Stark. However, I was sorely disappointed. The main villain in the film has such a typical, immature backstory that I could have written a better one in my sleep. Literally. I can type with my eyes shut.RDJ does not disappoint, but once again, his full talent feels restrained in this one. The storyline is rambling and incoherent, and ultimately dissatisfactory.The movie itself is full of tropes and typical scenarios; the humour is not as genuine or natural as in the previous installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job on The Avengers 2.All in all, you're only likely to enjoy this motion picture if you thought The Avengers was a good movie. And if you're the type that can say ""The Avengers (the Marvel one) was a good movie!"" without being sarcastic, well, you'll like Iron Man 3 just fine.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Ben's performance radiate such a power that hopefully the audience remember his role. Even that the twist got ""huh?"" feelings but it definitely not made the role worse. Its just tell how smart the story is. I like that the villains are not one-dimensional the characters. Overall the cast is perfect as usually in Iron Man movies. Gwyneth Paltrow showed more than the skin. She did good job and the script offered more than scream and the hero saves in every scenes. She actually acted and was equal with Downey Jr and others. Example The Amazing Spider-Man crew should take advice that how can write good role for female. Don Cheadle's performance was smooth and perfect partner to Tony Stark. I would see him War Machine solo film.The special effects looked cool, realistic and the crew doesn't went to over-the-top. Only the final battle needed more imagination. But still the movie is smart and effects are better than in Man of Steel movie. Marvel Studio films are like one big movie. That' why we have to look these movies with a bigger scales. The first Iron Man saved Downey Jr career and he has taken recently many different roles. I think that this was his final Iron Man solo movie to him.Iron Man 3 is the perfect ending to the Iron Man trilogy. One of the best Marvel movies so far. Hollywood bosses should think more than twice that do they want continue with the character or bring new the characters to the big screens.

The name itself evokes power, strength, patriarchal dominance and confidence. So why do the events of Iron Man 3 lack so much of the prowess and subtlety of its predecessors? Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) journey throughout the Iron Man franchise has taken its ups and downs, but none worse than the final chapter in this twisted metal of a franchise.Set after the events of the critically acclaimed blockbuster ""The Avengers"", Iron Man 3 takes the audience on a journey of pseudo redemption and self discovery. Take away everything that was given to you in Iron Man 1 and 2: all of the sleek sexy locations, the gadgets and tech of Stark Industries and what you have left is a bleak, boring Marvel wasteland.The performances by Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) are to be expected and their chemistry works well, what remains are characters that drop off into the background and annoying scenes of awkward dialogue forced with a strange undertone of the Christmas Season. Yes Christmas. I am not sure why the theme of Christmas was so prevalent throughout the film, even to a point where Stark uses Christmas decorations as grenades! Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) plays a stock standard, rich evil genius convincingly and Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the super villain The Mandarin ends up to be disappointing. Most deflating are the characters played by Don Cheadel (War Machine/James Rhodes) and Rebecca Hall (Maya Hansen), serving only to push the movie forward into obscurity.The redeeming features of this film lie in brief moments of comedic relief and some scenes of impressive computer generated imagery. Incorporated into the story is Stark's post New York stress, a direct result of the events that transpired in The Avengers film. This motif of acceptance and how Stark dealt with these events was very interesting, but were ultimately forgotten by the end credits. Skimming over hot topics of suicide bombings and the American involvement in the Middle East, Stark's humour and wit diffuse any chance of a meaningful message. With a rather annoying twist near the last act, the film shows its true colours. Suffering from the same writing woes as Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, all the plot holes and character arch's are tied up in the closing minutes of the film. Directed by renowned screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) Iron Man 3 finishes this lackluster trilogy with a Stark attempt at trying something new.","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

They really dive into his mental health in this movie, especially after the events of the first avengers. IT makes the situation more believable as there are real life repercussions of these incredibly epic wars that they have. It also makes him relatable to the viewers as we watch him change from being an egotistical idiot into someone that can easily be pointed out as good, although he does still make some major mistakes in the movie. The plot is great as well, with plenty of great turns and individual character arcs here and there. Its fast paced without disrupting the flow of the movie or being confusing. The villain was probably the weakest point in the film for me. To start he is very intimidating then a big twist happens and the character turns comedic, which works and did get a few laughs from me but felt...idk...a bit silly. Once the real villain is shown, a physical challenge is revealed for tony. His motivations area bit foggy, but I let it slide, he wants power, that's pretty much it. The action though, it exceeds all previous mcu movies, maybe even the avengers...arguably. The final showdown is so awesome, there is an excellent use of characters abilities and moves that they have available. Overall a really good movie.8/10.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

IGNORE the haters!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2797612/?ref_=tt_urv","DoubleCshinobi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35558159/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2013","I'm gonna be honest; I'm not a big fan of Marvel. I thought this was gonna be another action-devoured, hero-glorifying crap that Marvel usually does with many of their hero characters in movie sequels.However, when I found out Shane Black was directing this one, who by the way is a veteran filmmaker in the action genre (known for screen writing Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, etc.), I decided to give this one a chance.I must say that I was SO not disappointed! This movie beginning to end was exciting and engaging, with great pacing and everything a decent superhero story needs to keep smart audiences interested. Allow me to elaborate: Without any real spoilers, in this story, the machine-industrial billionaire Tony Stark is constantly faced with anxiety and mental distress as the result of his relentless work and constant political/terrorism-based issues that pose a threat to him and his girl (who we all know by now is who he cherishes the most). You can see the great character development as the plot continues to unfold how his arrogance and childish attitude in the past has affected others. Now, those sins have come back to haunt him, and he must deal with more than just The Mandarin. Away from home, with a nearly shattered Iron Man suit, and no signs of his wife, Tony must struggle against his own fears, uncover the mistakes of his past, and redeem his actions in order to be at rest again.A lot of times, directors of sequels face the issue of either copying the same style from the previous installment or trying something new. People would complain either way, but hear me out, do NOT listen to all these haters. Personally, I LOVED this new style of Iron Man. I totally digged the intense atmosphere and the beautifully epic music score by Brian Tyler, who is always one of my all-time favorite soundtrack composers.Acting is more or less the same level from the previous two. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role as the infamous Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley made a very dark, menacing Mandarin. Even Guy Pearce does a great job, as I could not recognize him at first glance.Cinematography and CG animations are on point, though some may argue it gets weak sometimes when it comes to the bad guys. Being an amateur filmmaker and editor myself, I can only imagine how many hours it must have taken to render scene where all the Iron Men arrive (no, if you saw the trailer already, that wasn't a REAL spoiler).So why are people hating this movie? It's simply different. We live in a world where the type of entertain Hollywood markets is not the same as the substance the original comics or works of literature may illustrate. However, even among those who haven't read the comics, the top two complaints I hear are: 1. There's too much action and nothing really new about the story. 2. Iron Man is not wearing the Iron Man suit enough.Are you kidding? The amount of action for this ACTION film was rational, and it kept the pacing better than the previous installments, not leaving much time in between for audiences to breath (which I guess can be considered a good or bad thing). Sure, it's not completely original story-wise, but since when has any superhero movie aside from Nolan's Dark Knight demand for ingeniously creative depth? And why would you want to see Stark constantly rely on the suit!? That would make him like every other of the crap movies Marvel came out with - superheroes that are perfect and always rely on their powers/abilities to solve everything.There's even a moral theme to this movie on how even the smallest mistakes/wrongdoings can create the biggest impact on one's life. In fact, as a human race, we naturally ""create our own monsters."" The very first scene of this movie established this theme and it was well-played out in supporting the villain's intentions and background.Movies that give me the worst impressions on Marvel include Captain America, Spider Man, Fantastic Four, etc. In those movies, the hero(es) always seem so perfect and good at heart, being misunderstood and mistreated but eventually recognized thanks to their new superpowers. Hollywood has murdered that clich√© concept. I'm sick of it.But thanks to this movie, Iron Man has shown that there's more to him than just being a hotshot billionaire who wears an powerful robot suit to battle. With a variety of creative action and intense scenes, he utilizes his mind, his integrity, and his struggles against internal anxiety. A man that makes mistakes, takes the pain he feels from the results of those mistakes and uses them to strengthen himself and defeat adversity. A character that shows vulnerability and relatable weaknesses in spite of their powers, how much wealth they possess, or how talented they are. A character that changes himself not to just ""save the world"" but to save the things in life that are truly important - love, happiness, people, moral wisdom, etc. THAT is what I call a true hero.Just avoid the haters and avoid having too much hype. As long as you don't go in with super high Oscar-winning expectations and treat it as a typical family movie, you will definitely enjoy it as a thrilling ride with a brilliant, yet simple plot. Till this day, Iron Man is still my favorite Marvel hero.","26 out of 43 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Most underrated MCU film?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5771672/?ref_=tt_urv","TheCasualReviewer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur76111216/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2020","SYNOPSIS:
After the incident at New York, Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) I struggling with extreme anxiety. While trying to cope with that, there's been a string of random and strange explosions going on around America and so he sets out to discover the source.REVIEW:
This film is so underrated among the the MCU films. I know a lot of people who actually dislike this film a lot. I like this film a lot due to us seeing a very human side of Tony Stark that you can really sympathize with. I know that sounds strange being that he is one of the actual humans of The Avengers, but he has a much larger than life persona. We do have Elon Musk, but Stark seems even crazier than that. Where before he would act out of selfishness due to wanting the spotlight on him, you see him act out of selfishness due to mental stress and because he's tired. I see this as a point to sympathize cause we know what he went through in The Avengers and the anxiety attacks he has at the beginning of the film. At that point we go, ""oh so we can relate with him in some way."" Many of us could even empathize with certain things. Shane Black did a really good job with spreading the conflict all the way through the film and giving it more of an investigative feel.THE TWIST:
If you know my reviews, you know there are certain times where I have to dedicate one section to something specific in a film. I think the twist in the film is incredibly important, because I believe this is ultimately what makes or breaks the film for a lot of people. I thought it was great. Ben Kingsley was phenomenal and with this twist threw me for a loop. I understood certain people who were bad, but when that twist happened, it flipped everything and to me it excelled the film to a level it might not have gone to if they didn't have this twist.In the end, I can understand certain comic book heads who might've disliked the twist so I understand that. However, with the emotional aspect this film had, what it did for the Tony Stark character, how we got a bit more of Happy (Jon Favreau) and you can never have too much Favreau, then Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian with a fantastic performance, this film had so much going for it and for me that makes this the most underrated film of the MCU. 7.8/10.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It keeps you on edge the whole time. Nevertheless, it has some deep insights and is concentrated more on the people and relationships than the others. It relies on epic fighting scenes that will keep your heart bumping and you will get goose bumps. More importantly, it is not the massiveness of the scenes themselves that makes them epic, but it is the choreography of the fighting. On the other hand, it deepens on the relationship of Tony and Pepper, which has escalated steadily throughout the series + the Avengers. Here it is elaborated on and expanded. Great!I gave it a 10/10 because it has everything a superhero movie has to have. Also, Tony finally meets an opponent that is very very strong. And yes, Vanko was strongish, too, but not to the extend where we felt threatened. Lets not even discuss Obi.Overall, great movie, probably best in the series, great acting, watch it.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Delivers Depth Of Emotion And Tremendous Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2785027/?ref_=tt_urv","AfterBuzz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4572124/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2013","Yeah, he can still fly!!!!!! There's no doubt, IM3 is one of the better action/adventure movies in recent memory and certainly one of the better number three films in a franchise. This movie picks up from Avengers and shifts gears in such a great way. Its depth of emotion and character combined with tremendous fun means this could very well be the best solo character comic book movie ever produced. Yes, I know that's saying a lot these days in an era where hero films are all over the place and especially when multiple sequels often struggle. That's exactly why it's worth the effort to write this review. People need to know that they need not be afraid of the number three because this movie is superb in every way and tops even the original Iron Man. The finale here may be the best action scene of the year and the story points that lead to it are handled exquisitely. I'm so glad Marvel learned from the last two films in that regard. The ending battles in both Iron Man movies should have been longer. Here, the whole third act is intense and completely compelling without crossing in to video game action type territory.Overall, I simply adored everything about this movie. I did enjoy the original Iron Man a ton because it was refreshing and new. What's amazing is that they managed to almost re-invent the character here and deliver something fresh again. I honestly wasn't expecting that to be the case. I would have been happy with more of the same but this is actually better. Kudos to everyone who made this film for pulling that off.","37 out of 77 found this helpful.

I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the ""twist"", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it's the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we're living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it's media manipulation. It doesn't over-do it; and the actor's revelation is just splendid. I can see why it'd p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.This would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end. What is an otherwise highly entertaining and smashingly-though-darkly absurd climactic battle on a bunch of naval ships, which is that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) decides to blow up his remaining suits. It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it's *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it's not a question of if but how much).And yet, aside from this, it's a fun summer movie that takes some real chances ‚Äì Ben Kingsley, nuff said ‚Äì and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian, doesn't stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we'll get to in a moment).","21 out of 34 found this helpful.

Smart, action packed, and brilliantly acted, Iron Man was the best Marvel Comics movie yet. But the follow up two years later was something of a disappointment. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, and it certainly had its moments, but it simply didn't capture the awesomeness of its predecessor. Now the third installment has remedied most of its flaws, delivering summer entertainment that's fully satisfying, if not quite equal to the first film.Iron Man 3 is not the kind of movie to waste much time on set up. From the get go it's clear that all is not well for Tony. He's got his suits and the woman he loves, his company is on stable footing, but there's a shadow looming over him. Because there's a new enemy striking at America from the shadows. A terrorist mastermind who can attack anywhere, anytime leaving no trace but broken bodies and smoldering wreckage. When challenged, he will stretch Tony to his very limits, taking everything that Iron Man can throw at him. And his name is Mandarin.This is what every fanboy has been waiting for. As great a villain as Obadiah Stane was, the first movie still left one question in the back of my mind; what about the Mandarin? Where is Iron Man's oldest and deadliest foe? This question became more pressing as Tony battled B-list villains like Whiplash and Justin Hammer during the second film. Well now the arch nemesis is here, along with AIM founder Aldrich Killian and a small army of super powered enforcers. And when we finally meet him, he's the absolute last thing you would expect. Purists will no doubt complain about how far the Mandarin has been taken from his source material, but I've got to say that the version they've come up with here is simply brilliant.The rest of the plot line is also excellent by summer blockbuster standards. Though it draws on key points from the recent Extremis, Haunted, and World's Most Wanted story arcs, the story here is completely new and rarely predicable, even to those who are well read in the comics. The villains' scheme is truly masterful, and there are some excellent twists and suitably shocking revelations towards the end.And of course there's plenty of action, and it rocks. By now we've seen that Tony can take on nearly anything in his armor, which is why the movie does the smart thing and forces him to go without for an extended period of time. With only bits and pieces of his tech to help him, the tension is greater and Tony has to rely more on his wit and skill than massive firepower. Of course there are some awesome action scenes when he is suited up, particularly the mid air rescue sequence. And the best has been saved for last in a massive free-for-all involving Tony, Rhodes, Pepper, and more than a dozen sets of armor against the Mandarin's forces.This is a very fun movie. Robert Downy junior is as awesome as ever, and he's been given a lot to work with. That's not to say that Iron Man 3 is perfect. I never really bought the whole panic attack thing, and I'm not sure the movie needed a pint sized sidekick, though I admit he did produce some good comic relief. And it just didn't feel quite as slick or as evenly paced as the original. But it comes very close, and it's definitely one of the better movies you'll see this summer.","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

So it shouldn't come as a surprise that it doesn't live up to those lofty expectations, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing. Let me clarify straight away, IM3 is not a bad movie, it's still enjoyable and has patches of genuine awesomeness, but when judged within the recent Marvel canon, it sadly sits at the lower end of the scale. On board for the first time is writer-director Shane Black, and although he largely fails to improve on the last Iron Man outing, he certainly makes some daring choices. For starters the story goes much, much darker. This franchise has never shied away from tackling tough content - alcoholism, manufacturing weapons for war, daddy issues - but the PTSD-centric plot here is the most serious yet, occasionally to its own detriment. There's plenty of well-timed (and at times hilariously inappropriate) humour sprinkled throughout, but there's still a feeling that Marvel's trademark light touch is completely missing from Black's effort. He doesn't go full Nolan, but the tone is definitely in a different, and for me unwanted, ballpark to the original Iron Man.Being a superhero flick there are of course many action sequences and swathes of CGI coolness, both largely pulled off with aplomb despite a flawed employment of 3D. An opening scene featuring Tony fiddling around with a new suit has some startling subpar visual effects, however this is thankfully a standalone mistake in the CGI department with the remainder of the film boasting top notch computer trickery. The picture's first real set piece, the destruction of Tony's Malibu pad, is decent without being great, but by the time we've had a vertiginous attack on Air Force One and reached the climactic showdown boasting dozens of varying Iron Man suits, Black finally nails it. Also nailing it, Robert Downey Jr embodies the conflicted, haunted genius with such confident and charismatic ease he has now reached a point where he simply is Tony Stark. Alongside him in what is her biggest role in the series, Gwyenth Paltrow clearly relishes the opportunity to not only sink her teeth into a meatier Pepper arc, but to also get among the action - stealing the single most awesome moment in the movie in the process. Don Cheadle is solid as Stark's besty Col Rhodes, aka Iron Patriot, in an underwritten part, whilst Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce are on usual fine form as, respectively, the mysterious terrorist Mandarin and the megalomaniac scientist Aldrich Killian. Although it must be said that I found the Mandarin's character twist utterly stupid.This trilogy closer is a good movie, but by Marvel's standards, also not good enough.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's great. It has everything funny parts, action, i mean lots of action, it has even a 'time to cry' parts, by that i mean the ending fireworks. Whose idea was that, blow away all the Iron Mans. The writers did a great work, except the ending, the fireworks using Iron Man, aw come on. Robert did a great job. Nothing is missing. It continues Avengers, which is great. Little number of mistakes, goofs and bloopers unlike Avengers. Tony's car is same Audi R8 but in Iron Man style it's awesome. Shane Black did a quite a good job. As the rest of the team congratulations on a great work. And of course it would be better if you put Obama in Iron Man suit except president Ellis. I'm just joking. The movie is great now we wait for more Marvel movies.","18 out of 29 found this helpful.

I have never been to a preview of this type of film where it got no applause at the end. The Star Trek preview did, The Thor preview did. The 1st 2 Iron Man movies did, as well as the Avengers movie...just not IM3. The was a bit of applause about 3 minutes before the end on behalf of a minor but beloved character...and the after-credit tag got some laughter. RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle & Paul Bettany were, as always, deft with the material given to them. The guest actors were fine. Major KUDOS to young Ty Simpkins...I know they can't really bring his character back, but I loved him and Stark together. (This is the edit: I think the kid and RDJ had a real chemistry together. This does not mean I necessarily approved of some of the ""just to prove a plot point"" aspects of the dialog or some of the illogics of the plot that happened during their scenes together.)I think Shane Black was a poor choice for director (and writer). I never got the feeling that he embraced that he was directing (and writing) Iron Man. It felt (ESPECIALLY the end credits) that he wanted to be directing his favorite cop show & this is what he could get. Some changes to the characters were made at the end which were both awful & rushed through.Am I glad I saw it on the big screen...sure. Am I glad I saw it as part of the marathon (and, btw, bravo to AMC Theatres for the way they organized and handled the marathon)...absolutely. But, if it were to be included in an upcoming marathon, I would probably go out to dinner during it.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I don't think people understand how difficult living with anxiety attacks is. I think Robert Downey Jr. portrayed that well in the film. Also, I loved the villains.

However, I don't want to make it look as if the only thing that is wrong with this movie is how it mishandles that character - hell no. This movie is bad, no doubt. But the reason why it's bad has nothing to do with the way this movie mishandles that particular character. My main gripe about this movie is the script. The script is awful by all accounts. I understand that not every comic book movie can have a well-written script that is on the level of Nolan's Batman films, but I at least expect something tolerable. This? This is JUN–ö! A big, stinky, poorly put together JUN–ö. The characters are inept caricatures with no personalities. The story is basically Incredibles meets Lethal Weapon, but only it's not as fun or entertaining as those movies. It must really suck if you as a screenwriter can't make your own movie and you have to steal ideas from lame cartoon that was made decade ago. But besides terrible screenplay - make no mistake - the movie has the most incompetent direction imaginable. Even with a bad script you can make decent movie if you are capable filmmaker. Unfortunately, whatever credentials Shane Black had in the past, it doesn't matter here. Here, his awful direction is unbearable. The tone is flimsy, the character interaction is lame, the story structure is poorly connected. If you had told me that this movie was directed by a crippled dog with a brain tumor, I would believe you. But, what is also terrible, is that Robert Downey Jr. doesn't care anymore. His acting is mediocre at very best. There is no emotional impact from his acting. It feels very superficial and forced. And now, imagine, that besides all those glaring problems, you also have the twist with the main villain - The Mandarin. The Mandarin twist in this movie is the equivalent to this: imagine if you had big pile of cr–∞p, and then on top of that pile of cr–∞p someone would had poured a bucket of p—ñss. That's basically the definition of Mandarin's twist in this movie. All in all, if you want a good Iron Man vs. Mandarin story, that is fun, entertaining, smart, and action-packed, go get trade paperbacks of Enter The Mandarin, Dragon Seed Saga, Hands of the Mandarin, Revenge of the Mandarin, and The Future. Those stories are what this movie should've been.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

If this movie is any indication, I think we are off to a very good start. All things considered, this may be the best film in the Iron Man franchise to date. The story arc keeps getting better, especially when Tony Stark takes off with Nolan-esque emotions and of course, with the rather infamous twist that I happened to like. The CGI is the best of the series and that is evident in the action-packed scenes involving all the suits. I guess it's true that better technology means better effects.Shane Black, known for his extraordinary writing skills, directs the third installment in the Iron Man franchise. Several months after the events of The Avengers, Stark has not been himself as he suffers from post traumatic disorder. But he must get into gear quick as a terrorist organization known as 'The Mandarin"" begins to create havoc in the world.As always with the Iron Man films, the acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on as Tony Stark. Despite his depression at times, he manages to keep the clever wit that we all love. Gwyneth Paltrow has some shining moments as Pepper. Ben Kingsley makes a very fine addition to the cast as the Mandarin, and of course having talents like Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall helps as well. We also might have to keep an eye out on Ty Simpkins, the young boy that Stark grows pretty close to. He may be a star one day.Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed, character-driven film and it continues the success of above-average superhero films. Scores of people bash on the twist, but I think it was excellent and it added some light-heartiness to the movie. I liked the addition of a voice-over because it seems to have added more feeling to the movie. The CGI is excellent and those flying suits were a great achievement. Now with Iron Man 3 behind us, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Marvel installment. I rate this movie 9/10.","20 out of 33 found this helpful.

The movie explodes in a fast pace of action and adrenaline, and there never really is a dull moment throughout the entire movie.It was really nice to see the Tony Stark character evolving away from the stereotypical cocky playboy type that he was in the first two movies. Sure, that trait is still there, but it is more toned down now and giving way for a whole new aspect of the character. And Robert Downey Jr. does embrace this change quite well and bring is nicely to life on the screen. And these panic attacks that Stark were having were really a great touch to the character, given the aftermath of what happened in ""The Avengers"". Thumbs up for this path of developing the Stark character.The story in ""Iron Man 3"" is about a terrorist known only as The Mandarin who has an agenda against the Unites States of America, and when Stark openly challenges the terrorist before all the media, Stark finds himself in over his head as his world is literally brought down. Past opportunities have come back and are more potent and dangerous now, threatening to obliterate Stark and Iron Man all together.Storywise, the ""Iron Man 3"" is just as exciting as the first two movies. And the effects were off the charts, as they were in the previous movies as well. Everything here is really done so nicely, and I personally loved the variation of details and design we got to see on all the various versions of the Iron Man suits.The cast, as usual, did a great job, and Robert Downey Jr. did carry the movie once again.However, I didn't really care much for the villain and the powers that he had. I just had a hard time wrapping my head around how one would be able to superheat one's body to melt metal and cause no harm to the flesh of their own body. By altering the DNA codes apparently, as it was put in the movie. Sure, it looked cool and had some nice effects, but it was just a little bit too far fetched to buy into. And honestly, when Aldrich Killian (played by Guy Pearce) breathed fire, I was ready to get up and turn off the movie - it was just too much. Luckily I didn't, otherwise I would have missed out on one amazing action movie.""Iron Man 3"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy action and/or superhero movies. Lots of actions, great acting, good character development, cool special effects and witty humor from Stark.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.'Iron Man 3' one of a most anticipated movie of the year. I still don't understand this movie and 'Avenvegers' are connected or separate stream stories because Tony behaves like there's one like he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Anyway this movie was a bit more dramatised than stunts, it tells his earlier time mistake which creates a deadly enemy for the present. I always wondered such a good actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, appearances in earlier two movies were so wasted. At least she gets some improvise role here, maybe we can expect more from her in the next movie in the series I guess.I totally loved the Ben Kingley's cameo though I easily guessed the twist on his role. More or less this movie's success made 'Iron Man' trilogy to one of a fine trilogy ever. A good movie to watch once, especially if you ever liked 'Iron Man' duology or any other sci-fi- action movies.8/10","21 out of 35 found this helpful.

Shane Black has a good reputation as an action director, that knows how to intercut action into a story, and stretch that PG-13 rating for good measures, so I was excited to see what he can do in the MCU. Having worked with Robert Downey Jr. before, they seemed to work together just as good, if not, better than RDJ & Jon Favreau. With such a great understanding of the MCU, and the help from a fantastic creative team, Shane Black and the crew lead this film to be one of the better films of the MCU.Iron Man 3 sets itself as a good stand-alone film, but doesn't really compliment the saga all that well, besides following the events of The Avengers, and the crisp character development we get from our three leads in RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle. Shane Black set up some nice tones throughout the film that worked well off eachother. On the down side, there was a little too much going on, and the way scenes were set, was a little strange, and underdeveloped.At this point, RDJ trademarked the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man. The best thing that Shane Black does with this film, is not so much make it an Iron Man film, but more of a Tony Stark film. The way his character is fleshed out, yet grounded, is just a breath of fresh air, giving Tony some vulnerabilities, while he still kept up with his wit, charm, humor, and swag. For someone who isn't huge on Pepper Potts, I really didn't mind her here. She gets a little more important with every appearance, which is something I'm not too fond of, but she served her purpose well this time around. Thank God, Don Cheadle is much more likable this time around! Although his character development was on the plus side, with some fun character moments, War Machine/Iron Patriot went just a little underdeveloped; I would've like just a touch more of him. I love Jon Favreau, everytime he strikes a scene, but he was sadly used soley was a plot device, not getting too much of his character, other than the first act of the film. Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener was just utterly annoying. Shane Black tried to utilize him as a good plot device to drive RDJ's character, but Simpkins came off as clueless, with a real mediocre performance. Guy Pearce tries his best here, and you can tell he was having fun, but due to his character being severely underdeveloped and unoriginal, he was just a corny villain, with okay abilities, and a breakaway crew. If Shane Black and Drew Pearce didn't spend so much time on his character doing pointless stuff, he could've been a decent villain that could pose a real threat. Now this guy named Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, was THE BIGGEST controversial aspect of the MCU, never mind of the film. I personally didn't mind the drastic change all that much, because it fit well with the narrative, but he was super corny and majorly underutilized.The screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce struggled in some areas, and succeeded in others. The biggest problem they had was writting some of these characters. If they just put a little more in a few of them, this film would've been great, especially with the jokes being the most cohesive and funniest yet, thanks to Shane Black's style.I really enjoyed the action this time around, not only because of how well it was balanced, but because of the high stakes. All of the effects looked great, continuously taking a step up from film to film.Overall, I can totally understand why some people may not like this film, and that's perfectly fine, but due to the sharp character development, fun story, and great laughs, Iron Man 3 is definitely one to check out.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But alas, I was also extremely let down when I did. And while Iron Man 3 was not all the way terrible, mostly due to Robert Downey Jr.'s usual stellar performance, it certainly wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination! This installment tries to match the humor and heart that made the original such a standout success, but fails miserably with lame jokes (that come way to frequently), and ""touching"" moments that just come off as halfhearted and insincere a midst the never ending barrage of pointless, over the top action scenes (yes, even for the genre).The antagonist(s) of the film were a major disappointment. Trying not to ruin anything, it seems as though the films creators tried to invent a ""new"" superpower for audiences that are becoming more and more inundated with superhero mythology, and while their goal was a commendable one, their execution was sorely lacking. These ""new"" powers, which served as more eye candy than anything, just make absolutely no rational sense whatsoever(again, yes, even for the genre), and in the end, destroyed the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which keeps us engaged in a story. But, in my opinion, the ultimate failure of the film was the ""plot"", which comes completely unraveled, and devolves into an utter mess by the end of the film. While I have to begrudgingly admit that I did enjoy one of the more original aspects of the story, which again, I won't go into detail about as to not spoil anything for those still wanting to see it, in the end it just wasn't near enough to save what promised to be such a great film. The trailer for Iron Man 3 did indeed seem to promise a rise from the ashes which was the franchise's disappointing second installment, but once again it just served as yet another example of a Hollywood that's become more obsessed with marketing than making quality films. And while it's not at all surprising, I for one loath the fact that this, at best, mediocre film made the money that it did, as it will only serve to reaffirm the consensus in Hollywood that things like storytelling don't hold a candle next the sheer visceral experience of huge explosions and corny ""one liners"", especially when they're filmed in 3D!","141 out of 286 found this helpful.

In this one, Stark even picks up a funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is one problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits.

"6","/10","An Improvement Over the Previous Entry","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2788172/?ref_=tt_urv","jatzel09","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5913335/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2013","Film-wise, 2008 will be remembered as the year of The Dark Knight. The movie that made critics and audiences alike go wild. But about two months before the Caped Crusader swept the Box Office, came the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man. A movie that also got good reaction from critics and made over 500 million at the Box Office. The movie had humor, a good villain and a charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr. who was great at being a less than heroic super hero. The movie also planted the seed for the Avengers and Tony Stark had a cameo in Hulk just a month later. But then the sequel. That was a really big miss. Trying too hard with the humor and failing while also spending too much time trying to set up the Avengers. It was a big disappointment after an enjoyable first movie. However this was all forgiven and forgotten after 2012 saw a very entertaining Avengers adaptation. Now comes Iron Man 3. While 2008 was the year that Downey Jr. became mainstream again with Tropic Thunder and Iron Man, he had been lead in some good smaller films like Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang directed by Shane Black whom he is now reunited with as Black takers over directing duties from Jon Favreau. The former director is Executive Producer this time but stays on camera as Happy Hogan.The movie tries to do more with the character. Something that had not been done in the previous two. This time we see Stark struggling with anxiety which was a great touch. The talent of Downey Jr. is remarkable as he goes from light-hearted wit-master to serious in a matter of seconds and it does not come off as one bit phony. Quite the contrary it seems very genuine. Below all the humor is a real person with real problems. While that was a nice exploration of the character, other things in the movie were not as well done. There was waste of talented actors, the action scenes while providing us with some good visuals, were not as good as the first Iron Man, the plot was not as compelling outside of Tony Stark and there were some shocking deviations from the source material. Not just artistic license but major deviations. The pacing of the movie was also shockingly slow considering that something was always happening. Every scene had something and still, the two hours felt like two hours.All in all, this was a great improvement over the previous entry but that is not saying much. The exploring of the character was nice and this is an Iron Man movie. Not a set up, but an Iron Man movie. My disappointment is with the waste of other actors, the action and some script decisions but it's an inoffensive movie. The audience seems to be liking it but if you are expecting to go to the theater and cheer, clap and laugh hysterically like last year with the Avengers, you will be surprised. Perhaps pleasantly if you like characterization, perhaps unpleasantly if you don't like change.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

"","","The worst and least faithful in the saga! 7,25","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2789220/?ref_=tt_urv","manusanchez90","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur42345868/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2013","I am a great fan of comics, specially of those about superheroes. Ironman is not my favourite because my favourite are Spider-Man, Batman, Superman and Daredevil, but I love Ironman and its comics anyway. He is one of my favorite in the Avengers. I read lots of comics from Ironman series. Both ""Ironman"" and ""Ironman 2"" are fantastic, like the comic-books, but this one is a bit disappointing. It is not bad at all, but not at the height of the original comicbooks. I think it is the worst in the Avengers whole saga and the least faithful. The other movies from the Avengers are, more or less, of the same quality of their respectiveI comics. The pace is excellent. I was not bored at all. The lenght is almost perfect. The director did a very good job in directing the movie. He combined good action with lots of humour and good locations, like Miami and L.A. He has known how to deal with Hollywood's stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, etc.The action scenes are great. It uses a lot of CGI but in a justified way (many shoots, explosions, punches and so on). The scenes in which Stark's house is destroyed is spectacular.The cast is amazing and the performances, too. I love how Robert Downey Jr.portrays Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as Pepper Potts or Stark's girlfriend. Guy Pearce (another fantastic actor with an excellent career) plays the part of the main villain in a very good way. Ben Kingsley is very good as the Mandarin (the problem is that this Mandarin has different roles and personalities than in the comicbooks, which is the most disappointing thing in the whole Avengers' saga). Rebecca Hall does a decent job, as well. I must not forget Don Cheadle as James Rhodes and War Machine (Stark's best friend and another superhero). The main error in this movie is a twist in which we Ironman's fans find out that the Mandarin has different roles and personality than in the comic-books. I will not explain here what I exactly mean. I understand that one or more comics of Ironman have been published since the sixties and to addapt all that into several movies is not easy and makes us modify things, but not the essence.Another important defect is that Ironman appears for just a little time as Ironman itself. I like Tony a lot, but I like Ironman in his armor even more... Some jokes may be a little repetitive, but they are nearly all very funny. Also, I missed some darkness. We cannot say that this movie is similar to ""Batman: the dark knight rises"". This is nor good neither bad, it is just that they are two different superheroes (personally, I prefer Batman, its comics and its trilogy, but love both of them). The best things in the movie are the things already explained: length, pace, the visual part, scenography, performances, cast, Guy Pearce, Roberto Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, the pace, the armors, the characters, etc. In conclusion, the real fans of Ironman will be a little disappointed, specially for what they did with the Mandarin, but I cannot say the movie is bad, simply it is not a that good adaptation. 7,25.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

After the ""Battle of New York"" in The Avengers(2012), Tony finds himself experiencing the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, while a new villain, the Mandarin (played by Sir Ben Kingsley) terrorizes the entire United States with mysterious explosions. Tony gets pulled into all this as his own life is threatened by the Mandarin, and embarks upon a journey that makes him realize his true priorities.Review: Marvel Studios brings to us another humour-packed, superhero action movie, this time directed by Shane Black, where the audiences get to experience another adventure of inarguably the most admired hero in the MCU.The movie is set 6 months after the battle of New York in The Avengers, and Tony has pretty much adapted to the changes that have taken place in his life, or at least he thinks he has. He has been affected by the events of The Avengers much more than he has realized. He has taken to his ""hobby"" of designing and building his Iron Man suits of armour pretty seriously, so much so that his relationship with his love interest Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained by the amount of time he spends in his workshop tinkering with his machines. To add to his troubles, a terrorist who calls himself the Mandarin has scared the entire US by mysterious explosions all across the nation, leaving no traces or clues behind for the intelligence agencies. Tony gets unwillingly pulled into this series of events full of twists and turns as things get ""personal"" between the Mandarin and himself. During his pursuit of the Mandarin, Tony realizes what his heart actually holds dearest and what his priorities are.Robert Downey Jr proves yet again why he is regarded as the ""face"" of Marvel's Cinematic Universe franchise. With his witty one-liners, his sarcasm and his fluency with even some of the very technical terminology, it's almost impossible to find any flaws in his portrayal of the egoistic yet likable industrialist-cum-inventor. His timing and dialogue-delivery have been excellent as always.Gwyneth Paltrow plays the beautiful Pepper Potts for the fourth time and she gives us no reason whatsoever to question the choice of the studios in casting her for the role five years ago. From managing the Stark Industries to standing by Tony's side as he struggles with the changes taking place around him and villains that threaten their lives, she is a complete package.Don Cheadle plays Col. James Rhodes/Iron Patriot (the re-branding of the previously called War Machine), while Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan. Both these actors have done justice to their respective roles by supporting the storyline.We also see a few new characters like Maya Hansen (Tony's ex-girlfriend) played by Rebecca Hall, Aldrich Killian ‚Äì a forgotten face from Tony's past played by Guy Pearce, and the new villain - the Mandarin played by the brilliant Sir Ben Kingsley. While they all have been great in their respective roles, we would have liked to see a talented actor like Rebecca Hall as a more significant character in the movie.The storyline has been a tad different from the earlier Iron Man movies, with lots of twists and turns, and much more emphasis on Tony Stark's out-of-the-armour character. The movie has just a bit too much humour in it which at some points takes the mood of an action movie away, but it is more than made up for by the exciting climax of the movie. A refreshing change was to see Tony team up with the kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), an innovative move by the writers and the director which certainly paid off by keeping the audiences engaged when the movie would have strayed off from its theme uninterestingly.The background score is one of the best aspects as it remains in your mind hours after you have left the cinema. There are no complaints with the special effects department, which you would expect from a Marvel movie.The movie opens with Tony voicing the words ""We create our own demons..."" and the story progresses as not just another superhero adventure, but with the larger theme ‚Äì how each one of us can fight the demons that reside within ourselves and become what we really want to be.In a nutshell, a great watch for superhero-movie fans and a treat for the followers of the MCU.","13 out of 20 found this helpful.

We extend our imagination beyond our limits. And when any movie offers a visual treat showing some of the best science fiction stuff, we just love to enjoy watching it. Isn't it? Iron Man 3 offers just the same. After Avengers thrilled our eyes, Iron Man 3 gives us a fabulous treat by taking the Iron man technology to the next level. Frankly, Iron man 2 didn't offer much of the variety in terms of entertainment. It felt like just continuation of Iron Man 1. But Iron Man 3 takes the suit to the next level and gives a completely different entertainment factor. Movie starts with glimpses of Stark's past that would establish its connection with the main story. Main story starts with the terror threats and series of bomb explosions executed by a terrorist named 'Mandarin'. Story also introduces in parallel a scientist working on human DNA upgrading. Tony is developing new versions of his Iron Man suit. Soon circumstances project Stark as a rival of Mandarin. Movie offers many unexpected turn of events and some eye-catching visual effects as it progresses. Some of the scenes like demolition of Stark's home, Stark rescuing people from plane crash and fight of Iron men army are unforgettable. RDJ is awesome as usual. It feels like he is not acting but he is Iron man himself. Among others, Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic appearance. Though the role is short, it offers lots of shades in his characters. In all I would say, this is a must watch movie for fabulous special effects, awesomely eccentric RDJ, good story and a nice climax. Don't miss this one.","14 out of 22 found this helpful.

"","","Entertaining blockbuster with good mix of dark edge, comedy and action","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2857611/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","25 August 2013","The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy. If it sounds and looks easy then one just needs to look at the many lesser films that are just a mess of CGI and emptiness.This film sees Stark shut off and struggling with the mental fall-out of The Avengers film and at the same time a terrorist known as The Mandarin is staging attacks globally, building his threats directly at the US President. The plot here is quite a balancing act but it is one that it mostly pulls off. It needs there to be darker moments but for the comedy to still work; it needs there to be a serious ""real world consequences"" plot but for it to still work within the world of fantasy characters. It gets this balance mostly right and I found the film to have a good dark edge to it while ultimately still being funny and having an entertaining flow to it. Some inclusions don't work and the villains do feel like a bit of X-files at work, but in terms of providing action, thrills and entertainment, it does a very good job.The cast do well but of course the film is Downey Jr's and he does it well despite having more to deliver. His conflicting comedy arrogance and haunted-psyche works pretty, mostly because of his presence and delivery. Paltrow is so-so and she doesn't have many times to mix chemistry with the star. Pearce is OK but not given enough time to justify his character but Kingsley is fun in all the different ways he is asked to deliver! Hall, Cheadle, Dale, Sadler and Favreau all give good support but the latter does feel a bit unnecessary.It is still a summer blockbuster, so your sights should be set accordingly, but it is a good one in that it delivers robust entertainment across the board with a nicely dark tone complimenting effects, action sequences and comedy.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected the entire cast dazzles in their performances from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow. I still appreciated the movie and its Christmas cheer, but the MCU has far better Iron Man movies and moments to enjoy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's upon the movie staff and execs to put together a cohesive story in order to ensure the survival of that franchise. Iron Man is no different.Marvel can practically mint money right now with their various exploits. That being said, Iron Man 3 did not wow me like I wanted. Iron Man 3 had the great fortune of following up a lackluster part 2 but the misfortune of following up the first Iron Man.The story was OK. It was actually too much to it. Sometimes, in an effort to break from the herd, many movies will convolute a plot to make it better when that only makes it worse. Many comic book nemeses are born from tragedy and pain that is universally understood and then others are born from simple slights (real or not). The nemesis in this movie was from the latter type. The contrived, shallow and very uninteresting latter type. That's not enough to ruin a movie, but it is certainly enough to hamper it.There was a lot I liked and yet a lot I didn't like, but in the end there wasn't enough Iron Man.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Huffington Post I guess the people who didn't like the movie didn't understand the complexity of the plot. It was twisted and so unpredictable, that's what made it so interesting. I was so relieved to not have to sit through another formula film. In the dollar theater now and your still able to see it in 3-D. It was packed in the theater and it has been out for a long time. I was really pleasantly surprised. Considering I haven't seen the first 2 I thought I might be lost but not at all and the technology was so incredibly fun to watch. The action was not to long and drawn out and it was funny to. Must See!","19 out of 32 found this helpful.

I came into this one with high hopes. I saw this movie in cinemas back on release and remember loving it.Unfortunately, it most certainly does NOT hold up. Apart from the movie being quite funny, there are SO many plotholes and even more simply unbelievable scenes. Like yeah, it is a cinematic universe in which a fire breathing human exists, but that doesn't mean that all human lore goes out the window.I won't spoil anything but seriously, some of the stuff at the end of this film had me pulling the hair out of my head. It is laughably unrealistic in parts and wildly unbelievable. This being said, the movie is still enjoyable (as all MCU movies are) and I did like watching most of it.It's one you have to watch, but not one you want to.
6/10 - cool, but too much going on

Also Guy Pierce is great as a new villain wanting to destroy Tony Stark & we have a whole cast of great talent sprinkled throughout this mega budget action-packed comedy adventure that is just simply so much fun entertainment. Stark has to stop these new villains & find out what is happening & why? We get spectacular big action scenes & action loaded with humour & funny banter.I laughed so much at the craziness in this movie & the script also written by director Shane Black is fantastic, hey the guy can write funny dialogue & characters just watch ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""The Last Boy Scout"" dude is great at funny stuff coming from unexpected characters!!! Often henchman get the best lines!!!There's a great & humourous story here within all the shine 'n' sheen of the ""mega budget studio Blockbuster"" such as a Marvel movie & it's always entertaining with a sense of fun & one of best bits for me is the fact that the legendary William Sadler (Demon knight, Die Hard 2, The Green Mile, Sharwshank Redemption, Bill & Teds Bogus Journey, Trespass, VFW & many more) he plays President Ellis & it's so great to see this beloved character actor up there with Downey Jr in this type of big movie!!!!

First off, it's not like the comics. That's fine, it's not the comics. It takes ideas and themes from comics and makes it into something new. That's not a problem, it's just something new. If you had a problem with the spider in SpiderMan being genetically altered instead of radioactive, this is not the movie for you. The only complaint I can actually manage to form is that Tony Stark seems to have an issue with anxiety throughout most of the film and then it ends up going away because he begins tinkering around, even though he has been tinkering around the entire film. I'm not sure if it even goes away, because he seems to have no problem when faced with a real threat, only when he is out in public with no imminent danger.Graphics are amazing as always, I had some issues with the 3D being out of focus sometimes in the corner but I'm assuming it was a projector problem. Story line was easy to follow along with and I personally think well managed. It's very eventful and I can't really recall a moment that was boring. RDJ really does make the movie though and does an amazing job of keeping every scene lively and entertaining.","25 out of 44 found this helpful.

It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn, means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they are as enjoyable as this one.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.","20 out of 34 found this helpful.

And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I'm thankful for that. I was so excited after ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", but unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I'm glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn't expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another ""Black-ish"" element that is added to the mix. Though I have to admit, I'm not familiar with the characters of the comic itself, I know this movie did what it was supposed to do ... and then some! Let it entertain you!","29 out of 53 found this helpful.

The movie starts,the plot is being arranged..the characters are being introduced, and i am totally in the mood. I have the entire cinematic history of Iron man in my mind ready for reference,in case some deep connection to previous movie is implied very subtly worrying i might miss it.The movie is on, the pace is slow, i am busy justifying myself, making plausible connections. An occasional eye catching action sequence makes my palms meet in a clap. But there's some humming noise of misconnection coming from my subconscious, its been past interval and i seem to spend more time shaking it off, as the quantum of solace starts to pile on. And just like some iron man prototype suit, the movie rises, exhausting too much in bursts in short time and makes that sad projectile dive, not so far from where it launched.The movie just did not feel to be happening in marvel's world whatsoever,its so disconnected. Marvel might just feel it a little harsh the way i am putting it,but they had it coming from a fan.They had made a perfect trailer, they had the success of avengers behind them, and of course, there was this new awesomeness in iron man since avengers,a little different that the first two episodes in the franchise. With expectations rocketing skywards, the movie looked deflected from the projected path. A very important part of making a sequel is you adhere to what you declare earlier. They seem to just have forgotten, the way they built iron man's world in avengers and taken a new route altogether. Whatever connections shown to the avengers seemed more like afterthoughts.Looked Like the makers were there with some action scenes in mind(they were very good, no doubt) and the producers pressurizing them to release the movie NOW, when the iron is hot. It comes out as a skeleton with very strong bones articulated by weak joints(""storyline""). Well needless to say, it succeeded in generating some joint pains in the pro movie-goers. The usual iron mannish comedy is good and equispaced but hurtfully misfit in the end sequence. I cant convey it without spoilers.So, i hope you feel it. Some mention-able aspects are 1.the array of new Iron Man Suits 2.Pepper pots in action mode and 3.As always, some new futuristic technology and devices...Acting wise, i don't find any flaws, the actors were up to the mark. What can i say about Robert Downey. I think Shane Black's role when Downey is giving the shot, is to yell action and stay put. The very little things he does puts immense personality to the character he plays. Man i would love to see him behind the camera someday. The outcome would be truly enjoyable. Ben Kingsley is a surprise package in tho movie and has exceeded high expectations in his role. Enough said, these two have left the rest of the cast at some far away milestone.In the making department,even though considering Shane Black is only one movie old, when at stake is iron man 3, he cannot be shown mercy.It seemed like he had his hands full, and the story unknowingly leaked from his fingers.The 3D was non mention-able, so much so, i would not have noticed save for one scene. You would know which one when u see it. All in all a good action movie. Fans, i know we cant just stay put when its out. Go watch it, don't expect too much..and you may be rewarded.!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So many people bash this movie because they didn't accurately represent the Mandarin character like in the comics! The hate is absolutely ridiculous! This movie has a great script, witty dialog, breathtaking action, an amazing story and dives deep into the Tony Stark character. Ironman 3 is a very Tony Stark driven movie. It brings back some of the magic from Ironman 1. The movie shows Tony's intellect and how smart he really is. It shows that he's not just a man in the suit, but a great intelligent person. The movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and characters. The twist with the mandarin was brilliant and I didn't see it coming. Many people hate on the movie for this, but I found it very funny and clever. It was a very ballsy move by marvel, but paid off in the end. The movie also does an okay Job of blending dark themes and the humor together. I will admit not all the humor land with you, but works for 90% of the time.

Well my friends, the third was not as good as Iron Man (1), but it was up there. I feel like Iron Man 3 is at least the second best in the trilogy. As far as making the film goes,(not gonna spoil anything) look out for all the foreshadowing. You will also be hit with a little comedy. Kind of like all the Iron Man movies. There isn't much I can say about Iron Man 3. I did like the action sense of the movie. I did contain a lot of action and it did live up to it's title of being an action movie. Also like the first one. Throughout all the Iron Man films, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark was always my favorite actor. I cannot say the same for 3. Gwendolyn Paltron's Pepper Pots was mine in this one. She acted very well. Overall, Iron Man 3 was a good movie that is most definitely a movie worth watching.

I was dragged to see it, and I must say, I enjoyed it. Some are saying it's the best of the three, but it doesn't touch the first one. But it's also leagues better than the second.I'll make this review short and address my complaints and the complaints of others. This is a non-spoiler review, so I'll be as vague as possible. Many people complained about how the movie used the character of the Mandarin because it was so unlike the comics. I never read the comics so I personally don't give a damn. I liked what they did, and it was a cool plot twist.My own biggest complaint was...there was way too much comic relief. The writer(s) of this film thought of a joke for every line and just had to put it in. The amount of comic relief in the first two were perfect, they went overboard in this one. So many people die in this movie. I don't mean main characters. I mean nameless extras. So many die. It's not even funny how many people die in a PG-13 Marvel movie. In addition to one-liners every ten seconds. It was a strange, uncomfortable combination.I enjoyed the ending, not going to spoil anything, but I liked it a lot. I'd rather not add to spoilers to this review, but random extremely vague point: if you were thinking of the question ""why not sooner?"" at the very end, it's explained in the comics. Google it. The movie did a poor job of explaining it.Overall, 7/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's somewhat different from the two Iron Man films before because Shane Black replaced Jon Favreau as director. Favreau's influence on the film is evident, and he appears in his role as Happy Hogan, now Stark Industries head of security. Iron Man 3 offers just as much popcorn entertainment as Favreau's efforts. It's a more interesting film than Iron Man 2 (2010) because Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has to rely on his smarts and innovation instead of his firepower as he faces forces beyond his control. Iron Man 2 is a solid, enjoyable sequel but it was a bit of a letdown after Iron Man (2008). In Iron Man 3 the screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce takes unexpected turns for a superhero movie. Purists may be upset by the changes from the comic books, but the surprises are actually neat. The big reason why this works is because the new actors, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, James Badge Dale, Ty Simpkins and Stephanie Szostak, deliver memorable performances. Downey, Jr. is as good as ever, and he handles the humor just as well as in the terrific crime-comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). But Shane Black didn't bring only his clever comedy to Iron Man 3. He maintained the series' playful tone without neglecting Stark's struggle. He also delivered spectacular action set pieces in which Iron Man gets to put his abilities to good use, like in the dizzying action sequence involving Air Force One. Iron Man 3 is definitely the funniest Marvel film yet, but the drama involving Extremis is no less effective. The visual effects for the film were handled by 17 companies, including Scanline VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. Thanks to the excellent CGI we get to see the good-looking suits that Tony Stark has been working on. After the events of The Avengers (2012) he didn't spend all his time brooding because of his posttraumatic stress disorder. Brian Tyler contributed a good, bombastic music score for Iron Man 3. It features a memorable theme, and works well with the drama of the film too. I've seen all the Marvel films in a theater and, just like all of them, Iron Man 3 wasn't a letdown. The action, the comedy, the drama, the acting, and simply the intelligence of these films always make them enjoyable. Producer Kevin Feige was influenced by RoboCop (1987), something that makes it clear what his formula is. I definitely recommend Iron Man 3. It's a strong finish to a good trilogy.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

The movie is a success in every sense of the word. Huge box office, amazing effects, great, enthralling, clever storytelling-this film has it all! If you like the Iron Man movies, you will love this one because it is simply the best of them. Downey is so fun to watch-he can take any line and make it funny, quirky or touching as the moment merits. Paltrow is also fun-a great match for Tony. The villains are amazing to watch-the CGI fire effects, the constant surprises-all good fun.

Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like most people, I wasn't a big fan of Iron Man 2. It had its moments and some great characters, most notably Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit kicking butt and taking names. Not to mention any movie that involves Samuel L. Jackson always gets a bump in credibility with me. That man can read the phone book and make it fascinating. Oh, and did I mention Scarlett Johansson in a skin tight suit? Even that can't save a badly told story from a weak script. As a friend recently told me, a good story can make people forgive bad production value but the reverse isn't necessarily true.Thankfully, Iron Man 3 has a good story and good production value. Whereas Iron Man 2 was more wrapped up in setting the scene for The Avengers and the preceding Captain America and Thor movies, this movie is about the aftermath. How does Tony Stark live with what he's seen and done? What does a scientist do when his perception of the world has been shattered and he realizes that the world is much bigger and more deadly then he could have imagined? Can a hero even operate under that kind of environment? That's the reality that Tony Stark is living with at the beginning of the film and the theme of the whole movie.It's a powerful theme and something that's pretty common in the superhero film genre, particularly in today's world. Doing it well and in a fresh way takes a lot of planning and a good foundation. The best part about adapting a comic book character with as many years behind it as Iron Man, you have a lot to draw from. Particularly when your audience may not be as familiar with the character's history as most hardcore fans. The first film raised the profile of the character but I'm guessing that the fans of the first two films didn't go out and read all the best comics of the character. I can count myself among such fans.Still, I know enough to know what makes a good superhero film for the bigger fans. This film has a lot of those elements but doesn't require you to go out and read through every comic book to understand the context. It also refocuses the story on the main character, something sorely lacking in a film that has such a self-centred hero. In the end though, I think most people will be very happy with the latest instalment of the Iron Man franchise. It's smart, funny and has a lot to say about the world we live in. The way a great movie of this type of film genre should do things. Even better is the fact that we know that this franchise is far from over. They have Thor and Captain America 2 coming out and while the film doesn't appear to set up anything for them, it does leave you with room to do another chapter if the folks at Marvel want to.And with the success they have been having lately they most certainly will. Unlike other film trilogies, the character's story isn't entirely wrapped up but many elements which have been carried over through the three films do get a resolution of sorts.Is the 3rd time the charm for Iron Man? I was definitely charmed by it and I look forward to seeing more from the character and the Marvel Universe.For more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The 2nd movie did seem to be on full throttle whilst the e-brakes were on creating some critical friction where as the latest addition which makes this trilogy potentially even more lucrative. However Robert Downey Jr did sign up for only 3 installments and this maybe the last time we do see Tony Stark rolling solo. This being said the 48 year old superstar has said that he is hoping to play more of Tony Stark in the future. It's just a matter of time until we figure out if it will only be with the Avengers or simply on his own!Two things about this motion picture is extremely are appealing to me. An entirely new breed of nemesis with the inclusion of the Mandarin (not the fruit) is the first. The second one is having Shane Black take over the director's chair from Jon Favreau.The MandarinA bit fruity isn't it? I feel The Mandarin is more villain than Vanko and Stane thanks be to his theatrics. He is more realistic and grittier than those before. The reference and the cut scene from the Middle East will connect you with the first movie making this explosion of action feel more IRON MAN. Sir Ben Kingsley is 100% the meanest nemesis in the Marvel universe. Loki to me feels smaller in my mind standing next to the fearful Mandarins persona. There is only so much that I can talk about the Mandarin without spoiling the entire movie for the reader. Once you watch it you will realize it and those who have watched it already will simply agree.Shane BlackWhen you talk about Shane Black taking over from Jon Favreau the first question is why? Monetary decision? Creative Decision? Bottom line the change worked for the trilogy. Blacks worked with RDJ before and it's even fair to say that RDJ got a push into the stardom following KISS KISS BANG BANG. Black accepts the facts and realizes that Iron Man certainly cannot go bigger than THE AVENGERS since it's the story of Tony Stark and this man's only super power is hi mind. Hence IRON MAN 3 becomes entirely about Stark following the entire New York City incident. Black focuses on the Man and not on the Suit. He exposes Stark and brings out the sharpest gifts to the test. He tests Tony Stark's gifted mind. Bravo!Expect a combination of continuous action a gradual yet intense climax and a world of 21st first century CGI at its best. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this in 3D. I will assure you that it will be more enjoyable in 2D at this point of time in technology.Happy viewing.TITLE: IRON MAN 3 DIRECTED BY: SHANE BLACK STARRING: ROBERT DOWNEY JR, SIR BEN KINGSLEY, GWENYTH PALTROW, JON FAVREAU, DON CHEADLE & GUY PEARCE RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 130 MINUTES","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

They just constantly get in the way and never die even if they should. I know that Robert Downey Jr enjoys playing his quirky Tony Stark but this movie showcased that quirkiness way too much (i.e. the second, third and fourth Pirates make the same mistake for Johnny Depp). The story had a nice setup and the action was of course first rate, but it just to me falls flat because some of the story elements that didn't fit together. If you're going to have the main character have angst about something then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about and then allow him to work through that in the end. This movie introduces Tony's anxieties but really they don't make any sense and he doesn't really resolve them in the end. I also really didn't care for the great reveal of Ben Kingsley's character, why too cartoony and dumb. So all in all OK but not great. Hope they bring the avengers back soon and I'm personally waiting for Thor cause he and Loki are a much better team than Tony Stark and Rhodie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Stepping up from 2, but not farther than the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2844824/?ref_=tt_urv","RyanCShowers","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19043679/?ref_=tt_urv","5 August 2013","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 3Part 3 can be judged differently than the first two installments. There's a new director in town and Iron Man 3 being the first follow-up flick from Marvel after the substantial success of The Avengers. Iron Man 3 feels more like it tries sequel to The Avengers, rather than support the first two films. The tone and cinematography make you feel like you are playing a video game, not watching a movie. It's peculiar how dividing Iron Man 3 actually is. Foremost, the tone has a broad range of being the lightest film of the series to the darkest film of the series. Iron Man 3 takes some staggering risks that pay off, but could've had some more polishing to the script. It had some of the deepest emotional moments, but those are complimented by some of the fluffiest cheesy moments. Ben Kingsly is perfectly dynamic and frightening in his role, but the only thing Guy Pearce brings to his role is a pass card to get by the audience completely without them caring about his character one way or another. The film has the best action sequences and visual effects and strong character development for its hero. My favorite thing they maneuvered in Iron Man 3 is the message of the movie hitting the movie's opening and final scenes with and epic punch of Downey's narration. Rating: 5.5/10Grade: BMy next thoughts are dedicated to two men that are both geniuses gifted in their artistic expression. Joss Whedon could not receive any more respect from me for his masterwork on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. His show was humanity, love, and life conducted into 142 episodes of television. Unfortunately, my opinion of The Avengers isn't favorable to his film. The Avengers is geek-glorified trash that felt like an animated Saturday morning cartoon. All three Iron Man films far surpass The Avengers, for my money. I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Even the cinematography is reminiscent of old-time comic book panels. The story is light years from any reality we participate in. Like the best comics, it alludes to various aspects of history and reality cleverly but without yielding to the oppression of the everyday. Iron Man 3 is not entirely consistent with the rest of the franchise, however. Iron Man's various armor configurations appear to be a lot less resilient and functional than in the previous films (a bit like the difference between the creature in Alien and those of Aliens). Tony Stark is experiencing a great deal of apparently justifiable paranoia. He is also suffering from crippling anxiety attacks and nightmares. At one point, he is diagnosed by the most likable, heroic, and memorable character in the film - pre-teen Harley Keener (played by Ty Simpkins) - as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Stark is facing a shadowy, almost invisible, enemy, who is apparently hidden in plain sight. Having lost what would appear to be a decisive battle, Stark must rely on his wits, his own unreliable technology, and a series of unlikely heroes - a young boy (Simpkins), the alcoholic mother of a dead soldier, a media operator with a good internet connection - to prevail. Of course, Pepper (Paltrow), his AI Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and War Machine/Iron Patriot/Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also come in handy. The plot is extremely predictable, but it moves along and successfully relies on escapism, awe-inspiring effects, and entertainment value. With their respective talents, Paltrow, Downey and Pearce didn't even need to try. Paltrow and Pearce do, however, and really make the film worth watching. Downey never seems as fully engaged with this script as he has in previous comic book films. All the same, Iron Man 3 is a lot of fun and will appeal to those in search of the insane action, dysfunctional myopia of the main character and the tongue-in-cheek, slightly smarter-than-average dialog that characterize this franchise.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

He still managed to create a film with too many action scenes that were often excessive. The result was a disconnection between non-action scenes, leaving plot and character development to be drowned out by fight sequences that became tedious and silly to watch. All of this could have been avoided via Shane Black exercising a lot more restraint which, coincidentally, may have given said action scenes greater impact without interrupting the rest of the film.Another major offender in Iron Man 3 were the convenient escapes. Multiple times we see Tony or loved ones in danger only to have his suit fly in to save them. While I get it is Iron Man and that the suit will at times save the day, the number of times this occurred sucked away a lot of the movies tension.Finally without putting too fine a point on it as I have no desires to spoil, there were a number of divergences from what was in the comic to how the story played out in the film. It is a Hollywood film and I understand this will happen, but usually they do it for the right reasons. Here what was changed seemed to be a lesser, more confusing version of what was originally an enjoyable, logical journey. Go figure.Anyhow,its how I felt walking out of the film and still feel days later. I'm not going to go on about what good points there were as this is more a review of grounding some peoples high expectations for this film, in the hopes it may better their film experience.

Not only that but he has also earned the enmity of a mad scientist by the name of ""Aldrich Killian"" (Guy Pearce). Now, not wanting to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that there are some twists involved which deviate from the original plot and serve this movie quite well. Having said that let me also state that I am not a big fan of action movies that consist of simply action and CGI. And while this film has plenty of both there is also some good acting on the part of Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce. Additionally, there is a good story to be had here too. Be that as it may, I would like to advise those who haven't seen this movie to see ""The Avengers"" or possibly one of the other two ""Iron Man"" films before watching this one if for no other reason than to have a little bit of continuity. That's not to say that this movie can't be enjoyed on its own because it certainly can.

I had expected something different, brilliant, genius etc. from Shane Black, ""a breath of fresh air"" but instead the movie was like an unlikeable parody as said with lots of further disappointing material! Despite I didn't find the first Iron Man film perfect, masterpiece etc. at least it was cool and solid. Yes, if I have to define the first Iron Man film with two words, that would be cool and solid! The second film was found mostly disappointing including me, because the main problem of the second movie was there was no ""spark"" in the movie (no pun indeed), it was lack of spark, suspense and excitement and it was more like a comedy drama than an action packed film. However, this is much worse. Most of the film consists of comedy, a little drama and Tony Stark without his Iron Man suit! In the first half, there is almost one big action sequence and that is the best sequence of the whole movie! The sudden attack part. Then, in the second half, there are a few action scenes more, but all of those are boring or unappealing. The main villain of the movie is like a joke, a result of a work of terrible writing, it wasn't genius, it was ridiculous. Probably the producers including Shane Black wanted the movie to be like The Dark Knight Rises. More realism less fantasy. More drama less action, but Iron Man 3 fails, because it doesn't work in this universe. There are more villains in the movie and mostly they looked ridiculous that somehow reminded me Superman 3. There is one more important villain in the movie and that is dated and clich√©. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think that if there are many villains in this movie, then the movie is going to be an action feast. No! Also, if you expect a bad-ass villain, I am sorry. In this movie, Tony Stark develops a new technology related to his armor and there are some twists about that. What a terrible, uninspiring idea! There are some moments that kill the spirit or the philosophy of Iron Man, there are some far fetched or exaggerating moments near the end related to Pepper Potts etc. etc. As for Mandarin, Kingsley's performance was amazing, what an actor! As for Jon Favreau, I think he is better as a director than ""funny moments"" tool as an actor. The movie is not funny, it tries to be funny in contrast with the first movie. The first movie was natural like spontaneous, the second and the third one just pushed too far. The first half of the film was pretty boring and uninspiring like the second half of Iron Man 2? Focusing on Bruce Wayne more rather than his alter ego Batman could work, I hate that either, but in this movie, it becomes the fatal mistake! Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie, it has not comic book feel at all, the cinematography is more like a flat comedy movie except for the visual effects and don't expect Tony Stark fighting as Iron Man throughout the movie! He rarely wears his costume, mostly he runs around as Tony Stark like a detective! The climax of the film was like The A-Team (2010) with some uninspiring action scenes. By the way, the misleading trailer is just another story! Ohh, Tony Stark in the hospital, Ohh, wait, lots of action, this time it looks like a darker film etc. etc. Also there is a big, real big plot hole near the end of the film (if you saw the movie, you know what I mean) In addition, the movie tries to be politic rather than entertaining or fanciful which is beyond terrible! And this is just a guess, the young boy could be The Iron Man of the future like ""Young Indiana Jones"" when Tony Stark gets old, ""quits the job"" or dies. It was just a sense from me.","47 out of 90 found this helpful.

I felt there were a lot of plot holes. Now I do think its worth stating that all super hero movies have plot holes but this one more than most. In this movie it seemed like they focused on one thing he can do with suit ( make it come to him) he did this about 10 times in the movie. This focus made the other ""powers"" of the suit fade into the back. Another point I feel the need to share is they didn't go into the antidote enough and all the sudden he breaths fire!!!??? Was just crazy and out of no where I think a lot of explaining is needed for the antidote. To sum up this movie had plenty of plot holes, too many bad guys to care, didn't make sense and didn't explain enough but was entertaining to watch I think a solid 6 is a generous.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also liked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for those suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew, technical team, designers and directors are making the movie great.

"9","/10","One of the Best Marvel Films and a Perfect Start to Phase II","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2918485/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","7 December 2013","There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

After all, wouldn't the individual character films feel a bit... small after that? IM3 attempts to use that to its advantage by making it smaller on purpose. It's a character study with a bit of spectacle slapped on, and I do mean ""bit"". While the third act does follow the standard ""Stuff go boom!"" formula, the first two thirds of the film keeps the action rather conventional (with one notable exception). To make this work you need an actor who can hold the audience's attention. Thankfully IM3 has the ultimate ace in the hole in Robert Downey Jr. But even his unmatched charisma can merely Spackle over the film's many flaws. The story is weak, the stakes feel small and it just never builds any momentum. There are a lot of things to like here. The aforementioned RDJ, some sharp dialog, a scene stealing turn by Ben Kingsley and a jaw-dropping twist. Unfortunately the sum of IM3 is less than its parts.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Iron Man 3 is great conclusion to the trilogy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2787700/?ref_=tt_urv","whoa17","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22201823/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2013","In 2008 we were greeted with one of the best comic book movies which is Iron Man, then in 2010 a sequel happened and it kinda felt of a mixed bag. So is the latest installment in the Iron Man franchise able to live up to the awesomeness of the original or will it be the worst film among the three? Read on below.Story: The story is a continuation of 'Marvel's The Avengers' and I must say that the story for this movie is probably the smartest story that Marvel has ever told. The ideas and plot points were completely fleshed out and the story was told in a way that can get you entertained while thinking at the same time. This movie didn't have the need to add any more aspect to make the story better, the plot points was just perfect and was explained well, and also it also just stick in telling one story.Acting: The performances of the actors here is very authentic, it felt like you are just watching something that is in front of you. It was nice to see some more action from RDJ's Tony Stark without wearing the suit and the same thing goes with Don Cheadle's James Rhodes. I also liked the performance of James Badge Dale, Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, Dale played a very menacing 'right hand' and both Pearce and Kingsley played their role excellently. Despite my praise for the performances of the actors, I also have my gripe with the development of the characters, some of them felt like they was just there for the sake of being present in the movie and I also think that some characters even got over-hyped. This is where this latest installment failed in, the development of characters because some of the characters felt really rushed and sometimes inappropriate. It was also nice seeing Jon Favreau back as Happy Hogan, good thing their is no bad ties in there and I felt really glad that I didn't get irritated by the kid (Ty Simpkins) in here, though his performance was not great, it wasn't bad either.Action/Violence: This is an action-packed film, plain and simple but even though it has straight action, I don't think it was all that violent. In my opinion this installment has more action scenes than its predecessors and also each action scene was executed well, it kept the film at brisk pace and more importantly it was an aspect in the film that made it a whole lot entertaining.Visual FX: Hands down, the best effects I've ever seen in an Iron Man film. It looks very natural and authentic and you can clearly see that a lot of work and effort has been put in this movie to be visually stunning. What I liked with the effects in this film is the usage of both CGI and practical effects, I mean practical effects is still the best way to go but when someone is falling you probably might want to add some CGI in it (I know senseless rant).Music: I didn't bother much with the music but all I can say is that it helped the scenes to be much more meaningful and it added some depth into it. I miss hearing AC/DC in this film though.Cinematography: This movie also delivers on being the best shot Iron Man movie (well, for me though) and with a little help from a CGI it was good overall.Direction: One of the best aspects in this film is having Shane Black working behind the camera. I am a huge fan of all his films and seeing him take on this character was very exciting. It is not hard to tell that this is indeed a Shane Black film because, one, despite the seriousness of it in every trailer, the humor is very present in this movie and is probably the funniest Marvel film to date. Two, the buddy-cop formula is also present, you can sense this chemistry within the partnership of Tony Stark and James Rhodes. And lastly, three, the dramatic depth, even though this was a humorous movie, there is some depth in the dramatic scenes as it felt very moving and you will cheer up for the leads.Overall: I will say that 'Iron Man 3' is not better than the original Iron Man but it is definitely on par with that and definitely surpassing its predecessor. To top it with great performances from the leads and villains, the amazing visual effects, and the very entertaining action scenes and smart lines, this movie makes it the perfect conclusion of the Iron Man trilogy. I am positive that this is surely one of Marvel's best efforts and I give this a 4/5.","37 out of 74 found this helpful.

There was all that but not to the degree some would have wanted.I do feel like the bad guys the Mandarin and Aldrich Killian just didn't seem like 'real bad guys' or guys that you would expect to stand toe to toe with Iron Man in the finale.Though what stands out is Robert Downey Jr's acting.

"6","/10","An old review from 2013 on one MCU movie I've never really loved","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5658963/?ref_=tt_urv","Jeremy_Urquhart","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26226712/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2020","I'm not a huge comic book kind of guy, yet I still love a well-made comic book movie as much as the next person. Nolan's Batman trilogy is a great one- his film's have a few minor flaws but ultimately all three of them are gripping and entertaining. The first Iron Man was surprisingly good. It's been a while since I watched the Spiderman movies, but I remember enjoying them for the most part. Seeing The Avengers last year was one of the most fun trips to the movies I've ever had.So it was disappointing for me to come out of Iron Man 3 feeling letdown. Had I hyped myself up for it too much? Yes and no- I thought the trailer was great, and it got me pretty excited. Early reviews were extremely positive, and my expectations were heightened further. Then the movie was released to the general public, and I noticed a number of negative to mediocre user reviews on IMDB. I didn't read any of them in detail, and for the most part just assumed that they were nit-picky reviews from die-hard fans of the comics disappointed about some minor detail that wasn't a concern to me- (""oh, his suit doesn't look quite right."" I myself couldn't care less.) And it really sucks, but I'm going to have to side with these less positive reviews because I felt incredibly underwhelmed by this film, and I'll try my best to explain why without revealing any major spoilers, as I'm aware this film is only just coming out now.Iron Man 3 is completely inconsistent in its tone and style. While this is probably the Iron Man film with the most attempts at humour, it is also the ""darkest"" Iron Man film yet (other people's words, not mine). I don't actually think the movie really succeeds in being darker and grittier but I can tell that the film-maker's probably wanted to make something a little edgier, but then kind of destroyed the chance of that happening by throwing in a near constant stream of goofy jokes. There's a few too many in this movie, and they don't all work.Mind you, there were some moments I laughed- but there were other times I sat there shaking my head because a number of the jokes felt so forced and out of place. There's no proper dramatic moments in the film because most of it's just too damn goofy. There's no tension, no nail-biting moments. Our main protagonist seems aware that he's in a goofy comedy action film, and therefore he knows that he's never in any real danger. I wasn't a fan of Iron Man 2, but at least he was vulnerable for a good portion of that movie, and in that case at least a little compelling. Here, he loses a lot- this was heavily implied, almost shown by the trailer- yet it never really seems to hurt his progress. He shrugs off devastating circumstances because he knows he's fine. He knows Disney and Marvel will never properly harm one of their biggest and most popular money-making characters.I get it. I understand nothing too tragic will ever affect Iron Man himself, but I wish the character didn't also know this. We need a believable character we can root for, who not only goes through tough times but is affected by them. And yes, the events of The Avengers are brought up, and Tony Stark keeps telling us that he's traumatised by what happened, but you never really FEEL his fear, you're just told about it. Ultimately he still has no qualms about using his suit, and his physical strength is never weakened. Hell, he's still real cocky too, telling The Mandarin his home address so the antagonist will bring the fight to Tony's doorstep- hardly the actions of a ""defeated"" and ""traumatised"" man.And yes, I know I'm complaining about the goofy tone in this movie, and yes, I know The Avengers, which I already mentioned I was a big fan of, was also quite goofy. But it was a consistent sort of goofiness- the humour was so purely ""Joss Whedon-ey"" and it just flowed and pretty much every joke worked. The humour in Iron Man 3 is, like a Will Ferrell comedy, quite hit and miss, and feels more out of place considering Iron Man 3 is ""supposed"" to be a grittier and more intense Iron Man film.I've always thought that one of the key factors in making a protagonist easy to root for (I accidentally nearly wrote ""root-worthy"" there) is by forcing them to face an absolutely despicable villain. You don't even need a particularly compelling protagonist if you have an absolutely vile antagonist- just look at the 2010 Japanese film 13 Assassins, a sort of modern re-telling of Seven Samurai, which shows the main villain using a captive family (children included) as target practice in order to improve his archery skills. He is a villain so unlikeable that the final showdown between him and his army vs the titular thirteen assassins becomes extremely compelling, as we as the audience want him dead- badly.The villain department in Iron Man 3 is very disappointing. Ben Kingsley is wasted as The Mandarin, a bizarre character who we never really get to see face Iron Man in the way we'd like to see- a character and an actor so under-utilised it hurts. Kingsley's voice is also absolutely absurd- was it meant to be menacing or something? It's even sillier than Bane's from The Dark Knight Rises.The main antagonist of the film really has no clear motive. Yes, he wants to rule the world and get rich and have power and stuff, but why does he have such a grudge against Iron Man? We are given a reason, but I thought it was a pretty weak one.Also: the already infamous twist is dumb. I didn't like it. That's all I'll say.Iron Man 3 has a great cast, but they're not very well utilised. Don Cheadle is in about one scene in the film's first hour, and after that becomes a boringly standard black sidekick for Tony Stark. Gwenyth Paltrow yells at Tony a lot and becomes a damsel in distress when the plot requires her to be. Guy Pearce is... okay. Nothing about his performance really stood out- Sorry Guy, this one's probably not gonna get you on the Hollywood A-list either. Keep trying.I'm a bit mixed on Robert Downey Jr. He's good, he's fairly entertaining, and even while not all his jokes work he delivers them to the best of his ability, and to his credit he makes most of them at least decent. But the man's been playing this character in all his movies lately, and it's kind of getting annoying. His acting range isn't really stretched too far in this film either, because Tony Stark really doesn't act like that much of a changed man, even if he keeps telling the film's other characters (and the audience) that he is. So Downey Jr's good, but I'd like to see the actor pick a few more diverse roles in his future (does anyone remember him in Natural Born Killers? He was amazing in that movie- my favourite aspect of that film by far).Then there's the minor plot holes and inconsistencies- every big budget Hollywood action film nowadays seems to have them- not even the very good The Dark Knight Rises and the excellent The Avengers from last year were free of them. Things like Tony putting an Iron Man suit on Pepper at one point to save her from danger, and then telling a disappointed Rhodes later in the film that he can't wear one because they're only modeled to fit Tony. Then there's the un-justified fact that Tony's armour is far weaker in this film than it was in the previous Iron Man films and The Avengers- it falls apart like rusted scrap metal on a number of locations. To mention too many more inconsistencies and questionable details would start to spoil things, but trust me, they're there, and they're bothersome.Then there's the stupid kid character who spends a few scenes with Tony Stark, played by a terrible child actor. If he becomes ""Iron Man Junior"" at some point in a future Marvel film I'll likely lose my cool or something. And there's the awful and unnecessary 3D I unfortunately saw the film in. No, you don't have to see the film 3D, and again no, you shouldn't. It makes a fairly dark and murky film even murkier and darker, and while some things ""pop"" out a little, ultimately it just makes most of the scenes look kind of fuzzy. Detail is largely lost, colours are made bland, and it makes it look like most of the scenes are poorly lit. 3D can work from time to time, but seriously, it has to stop being shoe-horned into movies where it's not needed. I saw Oblivion earlier this week- it wasn't in 3D and it was absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning colour palette, fantastic detail, and damn near breath taking scenery that still ""popped"" even without the 3D effect. Even if you disagree with my thoughts of this film, I'm sure you'll be able to at least understand my little rant on 3D there.Well, there's the negatives, at least most of them. This review's going to be rather unbalanced because I'm not about to spend another 1500 words talking about the good stuff, even though there was stuff that worked. The action was pretty good- unfortunately there wasn't much of it, and none of it was on the same scale that the final battle in The Avengers was, but the ""plane rescue"" sequence looked great, and the climax on the oil rig at night was quite good- or at least it would've been if lousy 3D effects hadn't been there to make the whole thing kind of hard to see. Robert Downey Jr was good, even if his acting is becoming a little stale, and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the and a sizeable amount of the humour does work- it just doesn't quite always gel with the ""darker and edgier"" story this movie was supposed to be telling.Just go in with moderate expectations- this is probably not going to be your next favourite superhero film- but with the right mindset and controlled expectations, it could at least be an enjoyable trip to the movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jon Favereau, who directed the last two films, has been replaced with Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon one and two, as well as director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Immediately the audience can identify this due to a darker tone and a different style of humor. The humor is very funny yet kind of seems out of place. It's like if there is a build up of exciting or dramatic moments, ending with surprisingly funny situation. One place I believe Iron Man 3 succeeds over the other two films is the supporting characters. To be honest, the supporting cast of the last two films never really had too much impact, it was mostly Tony Stark's show. In this movie I was able to see that Pepper was more influential than ever, being the cause of most of the actions Tony takes, Rodey now is much more of a help to Tony and has a completely different role to play. As this is a new chapter in the franchise expect to see to new characters either helping or hurting Tony Stark, most important, of course, is Guy Pierce's Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. I don't want to tell of Killian's importance to the film, however Ben Kingsley in the film is a different story. Well let's just say based on the material he is given, Kingsley does a very good job. Now for the plot. Overall the plot is decent Tony Stark is dealing with post-dramatic stress due to the events from The Avengers, he discovers new technology such as the one seen in the trailer where he can manipulate different pieces of the suit individually and send them where he wants, he cannot stop dealing tweaking his suits due to paranoia. This creates a challenge for him along with his new threats. However the plots are also where most of the movie's problems exist. There are some directions they take that you will ignore, or will simply infuriate you. I, personally, was infuriated by some that I feel did not need to happen. The ending to the film is kind of strange, it kind of seemed like one of those endings that say ""we may or may not make another sequel"". However on the bright side, after two films of disappointing end fights, we finally have fight that is satisfying and doesn't last about five minutes (we're looking at you Iron Man 2).Overall, the movie has a lot of potential, solid performances, solid characters with a plot that sort of bogs the film down. The movie is very enjoyable yet not as good as it could have been. In my opinion, it was still not as good as Iron Man, yet better than Iron Man 2.My final score: 7/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Despite the animosity of many fans, they overlook the gems that make this one really outshine the previous installments. Tony Stark must face himself, his fears, his doubts, and his own anxieties. Troubled with PTSD from the New York incident, he reminisces about duping a quiet, brilliant man and turning him into a desperate, psychotic killer. Stark must deal with this in his present state, which is straining his relationship with Pepper Potts. To deal with his problems, he tinkers with his suits, and hides from reality. Reality hits hard when the Mandarin strikes. A terrorist, the madman is responsible for various bombings in the world. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. Rhodes, now the Iron Patriot, seeks the Mandarin while Tony Stark starts on his own trail that leads him to Killian - who has a unique tie to the Mandarin. This leads to a lot of adventure, excitement, and emotions. Many people have griped that this was the same plot as ""The Incredibles,"" but plot devices are often borrowed from other sources. What really makes the plot work, though, is that not everything appears to be what it seems. Another plot strength is we see a more human Tony Stark whose liabilities cause more problems than his strength. He does have to work through the problems of the unintended consequences of previous actions. The one plot weakness was the use of a boy, Harley. Ty Simpkins does play him well, but it seemed unnecessary and a device used to grab kids into the picture. There are a couple of other plot holes and devices that are hackneyed, but the movie still works for a couple of other reasons. One is Robert Downey, Jr. Face it, Tony Stark was the one he was meant to play. He does it well. In this one, he shows some true acting by taking it to another level where Tony Stark has to face himself and reconcile his narcissism and grandiose ego juxtaposed by his PTSD. We also have good performances from Gwenyth Paltrow, Jon Favareau and the villain. Another strength is the direction that takes the plot evenly, and producing a good story with real characters that are not overplayed by the special effects. Iron Man 3 is definitely a good movie, and a rare oddity where the third in a trilogy is the best of the bunch.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

Now Marvel has a new test for Phase Two, starting with Iron Man 3, with new blood being brought in the form writer/director Shane Black, who manages to import his comedy style to the comic book genre.It has been months since the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions. The result is he makes a suit that he can control with his mind. As this is going on, America is suffering from a new wave of attacks from a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), using explosives that seemingly have no traceable parts, forcing the American government to rebrand War Machine to The Iron Patriot. Even worst Stark past comes back to haunt him as a man he stubbed in 1999, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) creates a revolutionary bio-tech technology that could be the next leap for humanity, healing people with ease. But a side effect is it turns people into living weapons. When The Mandarin forces attack Stark's home, Stark is only left with one damaged prototype suit with little power and he has to use all his knowledge and skill to find out what The Mandarin and Killian are up as they attack Stark's loved ones as well as face up to his past.Iron Man 3 does feel very much like a Shane Black film, having his trademark style of dialogue and humour and uses a Christmas setting. It is to the point that Iron Man 3 becomes more a Black film then a Marvel film and a little bit like the Batman Returns of Marvel film with its focus on Stark and his resourcefulness and the villains and less about Stark in his suits. Stark does keep his trademark wit and intelligence and Downey does make the role his own, like he's done in the previous films. But the other characters also get a fair share of the comedy.Iron Man 3 is Black's second film as director and he shows a great confidence behind the camera. He keeps the Marvel look and style, while still managing to make a film that is completely his own film and proves he can handle the special effects and action set pieces. Some of the fist fights and close quarter action were edited a too quickly, but that is made up for by the variety of action, particularly the final battle with the multiple Iron Man suits. Iron Man has very different threat to what he has had in the past, biologically altered super-heated people which have strength and the ability to melt metal: it is certainly different to men in iron suits and there are more menacing because of it. It also serves as a way to expand the type of sci-fi the Iron Man series can explore. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts also has a few moments where she gets to be a badass. On the action front, Iron Man 3 is the best in the series so far.The trailers for Iron Man 3 made it out to be a very serious, darker affair, to the point that I personally nicknamed it ""The Iron Man Rises"". But it was a bait and switch and Iron Man 3 is a very humorous film throughout, having plenty of witty lines and well timed visual jokes. Black does a fine job at balancing out the comedy with the darker and serious scenes and elements, skills that Black developed since his early writing days, which makes for a fun blockbuster experience.The biggest controversy that Iron Man 3 has to offer is the portrayal of Iron Man's arch nemesis The Mandarin. Of course he was not going to be the ""Fu Manchu"" stereotype that he was in the comics and international politics (as well as film markets) have changed, so changes had to be made: but Black's does take it to extremes as he puts his own spin on the character. Some may call it a clever postmodern twist, subverting conventions about villains and their portrayal in Hollywood film, others will call it a betrayal of one of Marvels most famous villains.Because of the change in world politics since Iron Man was first created and the theme about the War of Terror was used in the first film Iron Man. The War of Terror theme has been brought back, The Mandarin acting like an Osama bin Laden like figure but Black and Marvel look at the hypocrisy of terrorist leaders who hides behind their 'ideals' whilst living in comfort and how they would use anything to try to morally justify their actions.Iron Man 3 is a fine additional the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a solid follow up The Avengers. It is stronger then the previous entry in the Iron Man series which was too reliant on comedy and very character heavy. Shane Black does bring a fresh approach for the series and once again, Marvel Studios has begun the Summer blockbuster for 2013 on the right track.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","39 out of 80 found this helpful.

But I was looking more forward to this one (Maybe meaning I was more let down by it) after the pure awesomeness that was ""The Avengers."" All of the action aside, ""The Avengers"" really was Robert Downey Jnrs show. The jokiness he's brought to all of the ""Iron man"" movies so far is the reason so many love them. Although in number 2, the action seemed to take a back seat to make way for way to many gags. Far from what most in the audience wanted. This time around though they've got the balance right. There's plenty of action and the movies sense of humour is firmly intact. So whys it still so so-so? Here, I personally think the story is a bit of a mess. SPOILERS AHEAD!! (One's that you've probably already heard about) The way its rounding things off as if its the last movie make no sense. They've already set up the ""Marvel cinematic universe"" so that it can go on forever. Why pretend they're finishing up now? And from what I've heard, the way the chief villain has been handled, is a disaster. Even if your only going by what you expected from the trailer, and your not a comic book junky, I think most will be disappointed with the bizarre twist that works its way round the Mandarin character, and the other one played by Guy Pierce. Then there's that ""Iron Patriot"" thing. Wasn't he ""War machine"" in the last movie. Why change that? Characters in the movie even say ""War machine was cooler."" Despite promise, the whole thing has a ""rush job"" feel to it.

Tony Stark fighting bad guys in his hi-tech suit, right? Well IM3 has very, very little of that and plenty of super hero 'down-time', as can be expected in such genre pieces where the screenplay doesn't know how to deal with the fact that the central character can't be in hero mode throughout.From having recently dealt with an alien invasion in 'The Avengers', Tony Stark is in comparatively dreadful form as an Iron Man whose gadgets repeatedly malfunction, and are more like aluminum foil than iron, based on how easily some of the bad guys manage to damage and destroy them.IM3 is reasonably entertaining though, with some very enjoyable and witty lines delivered from time to time but unfortunately that's about its best feature. A convoluted plot with little to no true Iron Man action make it seem like a bad franchise offering, rather than a full- blown, in house Marvel monster. You'll find it easier following a John Le Carr√© story than this, probably.","48 out of 93 found this helpful.

I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent.","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

Before the question is answered lets see whats THREE all about.Shane Black the screenwriter behind Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout and director for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang along with RDJ then, once again proves his mettle along with the actor for incorporating his antics allover in the film. RDJ excels himself in the role because there's no one else. Damn he has to renew his contract with Marvel.As we have seen until now it seems that MCU is going thru the Marvel Comics Civil War comic series but i have no interest in divulging the details as the plot for the Phase 2 seems to be going very well now as the first movie for this phase has been delivered in aces. It seems that marvel is choosing its directors for this phase cleverly.damn you warner/DC GL was not supposed to suck.The story as it has been doing rounds is yes very much listed from the EXTREMIS story line and adapted cleverly but not completely. For the cast part the one person we have to commend is Sir Ben Kingsley, but please don't compare his part with Heath ledger in dark knight. Sir Ben is definitely excellent with the way mandarin had to be projected and it was a very clever choice in casting.God knows whats with the negative hype surrounding Gwyneth Paltrow guess it has to be for the marketing of the movie. Any way the rest of the cast have done their parts well and Rebecca hall is the weak link though her Maya Hansen was the strong link character in comics line.As far as Guy Pearce is concerned, damn he will always be the gem in whatever role is given to him . Other than some few twists and bloopers the movie has been delivered in aces.PS: Don't watch the movie in 3D instead watch it on IMAX screens as i am typing this review with a head ache. any way its up to you.By the the question i asked in the beginning there's no iconic dialogue instead the statement from the second movie once gain lingers in this one.I have successfully privatized world peace. But did he make the statement including / excluding himself. we all thought IM 2 answered that but in fact its in this part we understand the statement.Anyway watch the movie on IMAX instead of 3D.

The action was great, the back story was even better and it had a solid plot and story. It's great, it was great. Then Iron Man 2 came along, and all I could say about that was ""eh"". Everything that the first film did went above and beyond, unlike the second. This is a film in between. What it does well, it does really well, other things are merely passable. Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark. No contest, this man cannot do wrong with this role at all. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle did good for the roles that they had. Ben Kingsley is the highlight of the film, I won't tell you why, but when I think of Iron Man 3 I think of Ben Kingsley. Now, one of the biggest flaws of the film is that while it does have some huge plot twists, (These are really good ones too) one in particular, hilarious when it happened, crashed and burned, when you see it you will know why. It failed. However, it doesn't sacrifice the good in the film. If you saw the Avengers... you probably already saw this one, but if you're a skeptic when it comes to this series, give it a try, it will be worth your while.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Iron Man 3 like much of the glorified suit of armour in the movie is a clanking hollow shell lacking any real body or substance. It sorely suffers from the titanic box office juggernaut Marvel's The Avengers proved to be and evoked overwhelming feelings of underwhelming disappointment and disenchantment upon its culmination. Damaged by a nonsensical antagonist swerve and a superhero over-utilizing his new remote play feature amidst inexcusable plot holes, aimless disjointed sub-plots, far-fetched role reversals and a sense of going through the motions, this Iron Man installment is nothing short of filler, used as a catalyst to fuel the next phase in the ongoing Avengers (revenue) machine.Iron Man 3 is a superhero movie sequel co-wrote and directed by Shane Black centered on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man; the third installment in the Iron Man film series and the seventh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Set some time after the events of The Avengers, Iron Man 3 picks up with the supercilious genius industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man who is reeling from the alien invasion of New York, which is causing him to suffer prolonged insomnia and anxiety/panic attacks. Unable to curb his restlessness and anxiety he has taken to his workshop where he has built a legion of Iron Man suits, at the same time detaching himself from the outside world consequently creating tension with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Concurrently, the Mandarin, a relentless and merciless terrorist orchestrates a string of bombings that leave behind no distinguishable evidence. Stark stirs from his seclusion and issues a televised threat directly to the Mandarin when his world begins to be torn apart at the seams and those closest to him become embroiled, ultimately leading to him going on a good old fashioned revenge mission with one objective in mind; to take down the Mandarin.Robert Downey Jr. reprising his role as the brash billionaire playboy industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is at his sardonic best, however, much of the dialogue Downey Jr. professes throughout the film seems on the verge of stand-up comedy rather than the empowering words of a man-made superhero. Also reprising her role as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow, her performance though solid is plagued with an implausible narrative for her character, and the camaraderie between her and Downey Jr. seems forced at times. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of credulous Tony Slattery otherwise known as the Mandarin is good for what it is, and Don Cheadle as the Iron Patriot formerly the War Machine got lost in the narrative somewhat but nevertheless provided a satisfactory performance for the parts and dialogue he was given. On a more positive note, Guy Pearce provided a stellar performance as the unstable scientist Aldrich Killian, a rivaling industrialist to Tony Stark with an underlying resentment for his fledging genius counterpart. Nonetheless, despite a couple of passable performances, notably those of Downey Jr. and Pearce, Iron Man 3 was sorely lacking character portrayals worthy of the audience's time investment.Shane Black takes over the helm of the Iron Man film series from Jon Favreau after his lackluster Iron Man 2 and teams up with Robert Downey Jr. who he last worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. In hindsight perhaps Iron Man 3 could have been renamed to suit its premise more; Remote Control Iron Man, maybe Pepper Man, possibly even Avengers Hangover, these would all suffice, but How a Rich Man Copes with Seeing Aliens seems to fit best. Too much of Tony Stark's vulnerability was exposed in this movie which diminished the character we have all warmed to, the exuberant larger-than-life billionaire playboy/superhero. By divulging Stark's susceptibility to the strains of life to the extent it has in Iron Man 3 it makes it a lot easier to understand if he were to finally hang up his proverbial boots for good; not a good thing for a superhero film series with unfinished business. In addition to this, there is an underlying disconnect from the outset much like Stark with his beloved iron suit(s) in a significant proportion of this movie, by opting for the sympathy vote it is apparent Black has alienated viewers such as myself who want to see a superhero at the height of their powers overcome evil. By the end the very thing that ties Tony Stark to Iron Man is away with the wind, which is ironically where big-budget filmmaking intelligence went when this movie was produced. Here's hoping the remaining parts of the Avengers machine have not depreciated like its iron core has evidently done.Even the post-credits sequence connected to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe seemed needless and afforded nothing to entice in terms of reasons to be eager to want to watch the forthcoming Avengers movie or the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. However, ironically the ending cameo encapsulated the essence of the entire Iron Man 3 movie, a psychiatric evaluation of a perturbed superhero.On the contrary, Iron Man 3 is not a categorical disaster; it packed in enough explosive action and vivacious backdrops into a lengthy 2 hour 15 minute running time to at least be aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. Although when you look behind the niceties there is not much to write home about.Nevertheless, Iron Man 3 is a frantic overblown popcorn flick that lacks any real conviction and can be only described as a damp squib. Like all superhero movies, the superhero is only as good as it's adversary, and in this case the adversary was not worthy. As a stand-alone franchise it's clearly demonstrable that it is suffering, as part of an even bigger picture, Iron Man's appeal is draining with only 5% power and the odds of it reaching maximum altitude again are slim to none.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The ship should be docked by its original captain","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2792890/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2013","Early on in Iron Man 3's lengthy, long-awaited production, director Shane Black stated he wanted to make a film that wasn't superficial or self-serious, but rather, more fun and lighthearted. I would've went with serious; Iron Man 3 is, to say the least, a disappointing conclusion to a franchise that showed amazingly potent promise with its awe-inspiring debut just five years ago. This is a been-there-done-that affair that does exactly what I praised its original film for not doing; serving as a special effects compilation and incorporating much more humor than necessary.Perhaps that was the foreseeable effect of having Black take the director's chair over Jon Favreau, who manned the ship on the first two productions. Black, whose fame stemmed from the 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, throws way too many cutesy witticisms in his writing, treating the third installment of the Iron Man franchise as the byproduct of a self-referential film treading the likes of Seven Psychopaths. Not only does putting this side-by-side with the original two films, which weren't as dark or as heavy as Nolan's Batman franchise but still rather serious, seem a tad out of place, but the series feels like it's more concerned with nudging and winking at the audience than wrapping things up cleanly.We are thrown back in the futuristic world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), only this time, we start in 1999 at a New Year's Eve party where scientist Aldrich Killian tries to bring up thoughts and ideas about expanding his company to an cold, uninterested Stark. He is quickly-shifted out of Stark's mindset, never to be seen again any time soon.Fast-forward to the present and we see Stark's battle with the aliens in New York (events from The Avengers) have made him jittery and a frequent victim to panic attacks. Just in time, too, since the elusive terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is threatening America's safety and Killian (Guy Peace) returns to exact revenge on Stark for his narcissism and arrogance. On top of this, he must ensure the safety of his long-suffering Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and continue emphasizing that he will protect the citizens of the United States from uncertain danger.There is far less going on in the third installment of this series than there was in the second film; whether or this is good or bad, you can be the judge. Black doesn't play it safe, but he sometimes only slightly opens doors before closing them abruptly, a little bit like what Iron Man 2 did in the face of the government wanting Stark to hand over all his technology to the Defense Department. The ignored idea that we could've got a lot out of is when Stark's pal Rhodey (reprised by Don Cheadle) tries to convince him to refrain from instigating or provoking Mandarin in anyway and saying leave it to the government. That is when Iron Man's role in social order and political uprising should come into play but sadly never does.I, too, can't help but feel that if you were a fan at all of the original Iron Man comic books that if part two let you down part three will considerably let you down. Mandarin is drastically shortchanged as a villain, not given too much backstory and only given certain times to chime and spit villainous clich√©s. Killian, as well, although the film sort of explains why in a twist ending that I find a tad more disingenuous. Clearly, he is played as some sort of Osama Bin-Laden-esque terrorist, but we know far too little about his motivations and plans. He is evil and wants to take over, case closed.Another subplot features Ty Simpkins as a young boy named Harley, who connects with Stark on a personal level in certain points in the film. Harley is a well-meaning kid, kind of irritating, but genial and relatively harmless, and often the victim of Stark's narcissism as are many of his close friends. Harley isn't a bad character, but he's an unneeded addition to the story. His story offers little-to-no payoff and, in the end, plays as sort of a little piece that tries too hard to tug at the heartstrings.It's honest to say that the Iron Man series has gotten a tad bit worse since its start in 2008 with a very promising film that I consider one of Marvel's strongest films to date. Its sequel, while crowded with subplots and characters, still found a way to get its energy and heart in the right place and at least tie things up marginally well by the end of the film. The third film features yet another wonderful performance by Downey Jr., a briskly-paced narrative, and interesting little minor inclusions along the way, but gets too caught up in the sense of its own whimsy and personal delight with its humor. At this point, the fans deserve an ""Iron Man 4"" just for the sole-purpose of optimism that it will be better, more efficient than the two sequels we got.NOTE: My video review of Iron Man 3, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqz0INZADww Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, and Rebecca Hall.

""I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, and occasionally save the world,"" yeah, way cooler than Steve Jobs. The appearance of the Oracle brand in Iron Man 3 is perhaps Ellison making a donation to become part of the super alpha male club, because the guys who buy Oracle servers are not going to be swayed by this film.The story starts off in the post The Avengers world, with Tony Stark having retreated to his workshop to create a plethora of suits.But all is not well in the world, there have been mysterious explosions which have a unique signature to them.The back story belongs to a science conference in 1999 when Stark ignored the entreaties of a partially disabled scientist Aldrich Killian(Guy pierce) to work with him and ended up creating a monster.While he was at it he also had a one night stand with an ace scientist Maya Henson (Rebecca Hall) and left her in the lurch.His life with his girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained. He is going through a superhero midlife crisis, and a ""what else is there to achieve, now that I am the CEO of Starks Corp. and his permanent girlfriend"" emptiness in hers.Meanwhile the evil Aldrich meets Pepper and makes a presentation, taking her inside the hologram of human brain that will make the consultants at Bain and Co. sweat,trust me its sleek.But Pepper is not impressed, it sounds like evil science to her.With this final rebuff all bets are off and Peppers bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) gets hurt in another mysterious blast.This snaps Stark back to his superhero mode and he calls for war with the new threat to humankind, Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an Asian looking anarchist, who by now is making global broadcasts about his intention to teach the world painful lessons. Aldrich has also harnessed a technology that can regenerate damaged human tissue and has cured himself.He is looking to commercialize his invention.The rest of the film continues to carry on the special effects feast with the Iron Man slugging it out with the evil Mandarin and Aldrich.Hell hath no fury like a scientist scorned.The director charms us in the middle act in a Spielberg kind of way by introducing the all American blond kid who helps Stark when he is down and out and gets a payback which will earn him a fortune on Ebay one day.After the definitive cinematic death of Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Hollywood seems to be taking a break from terrorists with long beards, in the recent Olympus has Fallen, Hollywood looks to North Korea for pure evil.Tragically real life seems to follow suit in Boston where at least outwardly the killers were white Caucasian men.Maybe next time around we will have a secret society of Russian oligarchs facing off with the Marvel crew.While the novelty of the suit has worn off despite several reboots, Robert Downey Jr. is superb, this is still one of the most inspired casting calls in Hollywood Superhero history.Gwyneth Paltrow has just been named the most beautiful woman in the world by People magazine, much to the chagrin of feminists who hate her blond slender blue-eyed frame, delivers the goods as Iron Mans weak spot even though he neglects her for his workshop.She shakes off the damsel in distress image to emerge a worthy Mrs Iron Man. Guy Pierce is good as the evil Aldrich Killian but Ben Kingsley's Mandarin sets the screen on fire.His character neatly sidesteps the Fu Mancu stereotype and bears shades of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, in his worldview.The first Iron Man film was supremely thrilling in combining special effects and a really original character brought to life by Downey.The second installment instead of building on the first went sideways, though not without its spectacular moments.The third installment which sees a change in the direction department with Shane Black replacing Jon Favreau, tries to go back to basics but the plot does not have the cohesion that the Iron Man 1 had.This is far from a perfect film with more plot holes than there are chinks in the Iron Man's steel suit but a very entertaining and polished product.Its major weaknesses is the length, a full 131 minutes may be bang for the buck or a slight drag depending on whether you are a Marvel comics fanboy or a regular moviegoer. Made on a jumbo budget of USD 200 million, IM3 is worth your time and money for all the fireworks on display, nearly eclipsed by Downey and Ben Kingsley, at their sparkling best.#Iron Man 3 seems to be a test case for Hollywood in China as it goes head to head with a small budget Chinese drama.The Chinese seem to be tired of the Hollywood pyrotechnics which is good news for all of us!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Clearly Ironman found the battle in ""Avengers Assemble"" a tough outing and we have here a more nuanced super-hero narrative. But he can't simply be left to finesse his collection of metallic outfits and enjoy his live-in partner 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow with an amazingly flat stomach for a mother of two) because there are new villains on the rampage. One is uber- terrorist The Mandarin (a wonderful performance from the British Ben Kingsley), another is science entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Australian Guy Pearce who, as in ""Lawless"", exhibits real callousness), while a third is one-time Stark girlfriend Maya Hansen (another Brit in the pleasing shape of Rebecca Hall).Third time round, Jon Favreau has handed over the directorial reins - but retained his cameo acting role - to Shane Black who is also co-writer (his original profession as in the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise). Also we have the fashionable use of 3D which does not always enhance the production (often the action is too fast to really appreciate the extra dimension). So this is an entertaining, if unoriginal, romp with the requisite action leavened by wry humour.As with the previous ""Iron Man"" movies, if you sit through endless technical credits, you'll be rewarded with a short extra clip but this time we are not set up for the next segment in the franchise but have an explanation of my therapy allusion. Many franchises sag at the third offering (think ""Alien"" or ""Superman"") but ""Ironman"" is holding up well and, after this extra clip. we are reassured that ""Tony Stark will return"" which is good news.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can understand why some are outright calling this a disappointment and a failure. Big Iron Man fans will most likely hate the film for what it did to the Mandarin. I won't spoil what they did for anyone reading this who has not yet seen the film but just know that they do something with the Mandarin that will leave many Iron Man fans enraged. I get it and I'm not saying calm down. If they did something like that to Joker in 'The Dark Knight' I would hate that film. Though I did roll with the twist and still enjoyed the film immensely and in my opinion it only got better as the film continued. Iron Man 3 started off the summer movie season in the right way, just like 'The Avengers' did the year prior. I loved the first 'Iron Man' film and while I don't hate it, I thought 'Iron Man 2' was disappointing and unnecessary. As far as Iron Man himself goes he's not in the movie much except a few times in the beginning and the huge climax at the end. This film focuses more on developing Tony Stark and showing that in essence he is Iron Man, not the suit. The suit and him are one and I love that the film addresses that so thoroughly. I love that the film goes in a different direction than the other films, which is expected since Shane Black has now replaced Jon Favreau at the helm as the director. Iron Man 3 is the darkest of the Iron Man films while also have the most humor out of all of them. There was one scene with this kid that had me dying and marveling at how Tony actually said something like that. Like the first Iron Man film, Tony Stark is placed in a position where he doesn't have all his gadgets and he has to win using his intellect. Which demonstrates that the suit is not his greatest weapon, his mind is. Once again Robert Downey Junior is in the lead role and kills it as Tony Stark and I cannot imagine anyone else playing him at this point.Though some characters did not get as much development as they should have gotten, but Iron Man 3 did what it set out to do and it did it very well. Also I don't know get what some fans are saying by calling the story a mess. How is it a mess? Sure, a lot of things happen but everything plays out very well and comes to a fine conclusion, albeit the ending is rushed.I stand by that Iron Man 3 was a greatly enjoyable installment into the Post-Avengers Marvel Universe and left me very happy and satisfied. Though, my only fear is what Joss Whedon will do with 'Avengers 2' now which he himself has stated as well. Again I won't spoil what happens but know that it has to do with Tony Stark and if you've watched the film I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It has rekindled the spark of a teenager trapped in the shell of a cynical adult movie goer.In a race that began in 2008 to be crowned Hollywood's Coolest and Most Awesome Superhero Movie, the score is now 3-1 with Iron Man on a two- point lead. The screenplay, co-written between Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout) and Drew Pearce is cleverly penned and packs the right punch for an action movie. By drumming up the significance of Tony Stark's development from previous films (The Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2) without losing grip of dramatic unity as a whole; Shane Black (also the film's director) conceptualized a heroically simple, winning formula.Another satisfying aspect of Iron Man 3 (and this converts to audience payoff at the end of 130 minutes), is the sweet simple fact that narrative does not detain viewers with unnecessary exposition and scenes. The big bad guys waste no time playing mind-games for the sake of delaying a final showdown, thus one-upping other blockbusters where it counts. Ergo, no shortchanging and an effortlessly fluid plot.Things kick off with a flashback to 1999 during pre-Iron Man days, establishing Tony Stark's first meeting with future adversary ‚Äî a then crippled scientist named Aldrich Killian. Desperate for resources from Stark Industries to develop experimental virus ""Extremis"" (yet turned away so unceremoniously), sets off rising malevolence from Killian (played by the unforgettable Guy Pearce, even more loathsome here than when he was hateful Charlie Rakes in Lawless). There's also brazen, immediate threat from a grim terrorist leader (Ben Kingsley's prowess and versatility in full glory here as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery) ‚Äî bent on blowing up America at whatever cost necessary. And for what it's worth, I like the spin on Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) damsel-in-distress anticipated ‚Äî compelling touch to an otherwise archetypal character.To further inject urgency in the conflict, Tony Stark wrestles with the aftermath of New York (from The Avengers) and taunts The Mandarin on national TV, further exacerbating his wrath. A strike against Stark's mansion hatches a loosely comedic, coming-of-age with 10 year old Harley ‚Äî it is here that leading man Robert Downey Jr. ingratiates himself as one of the best personality actors in Hollywood ‚Äî incensed with moral rage at the right moments, oozing unsentimental smooth in others.I had fun spotting flashes of nostalgia in favorite superhero moments (Spiderman, Superman, Batman and even Transformers) throughout the show as well, and still can't believe they destroyed a fine looking limited edition Dora the Explorer digital watch. Nor of the fact that a highly entertaining movie just ended. What a generous, high-octane hell of a ride.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com","26 out of 55 found this helpful.

"7","/10","My Review after the 2nd viewing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2882019/?ref_=tt_urv","Ge-off07","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6394895/?ref_=tt_urv","6 October 2013","I wanted to review this film, but I felt I needed to wait until I saw the film a second time to pass final judgment. My score of 7 stands, but for different reasons than the first time watching.Firstly, I was one of the people who were massively disappointed by the way Mandarin was handled. This was my main reason for waiting until a second viewing to review. But even before that letdown, I just felt like the film wasn't fitting in with the other Iron Man films.After my second viewing, I focused some of my points. When it comes to The Mandarin, I accept the value of a good surprise in a film, which that was. I also understand that many people didn't know what a main villain the Mandarin was in the comics, so I can see how many saw this as a cool twist.The second sitting also helped me articulate the main thing that makes this sequel not totally line up with the others for me. Basically, it's Shane Black. Shane Black is an awesome action writer, no doubt about it, and I love so many of the films he has written. That being said, so many of his themes from other movies are reused here and it makes it feel like more of a Shane Black action film than an Iron man film. Also, I kind of have a resentment toward having a little kid help the hero (it has been done way better in other movies, IMO). The young actor was good, I just feel that his part was a little...Shortround-y.The action in this movie is great, all the actors put in good performances (especially 2013's go-to summer movie supporting actor James Badge Dale, this guy needs a lead role!) The plot , like I said has a huge twist. However, the ""going back to where it all started"" plot device is a bit tired, especially in a third movie. The story veered awfully close to Spider-Man 3 territory here. If one or two more coincidences from the past had been shoved in, it would have been really hard to buy. While it was a stretch, I am able to buy it this case, but just barely. The problem with reaching back and altering the past in a film is that you risk tainting the original story. The core Iron Man story did not get tainted here, but I'd be lying if I said the ""revelations"" in this film didn't make the past mythology murky for me. Aldrich Killian, briefly, was not a fully satisfying villain for me. I thought that Guy Pearce was great but since I wasn't really on board with the ""enemy from the past"" plot, I found him the least entertaining villain so far. Ben Kingsley, like the Mandarin or not, is hilarious.The ending of Iron man 3 is very fitting, especially if it is the last time we see RDJ in a solo Iron man film. I think the 'arc' of Tony Stark's character is really dealt with well in the movie and the ending was very satisfying to me, even if the journey was a bit hard to swallow. Overall, I give it a c+. Easily my least favorite in the series and the only one that I feel I have any actual complaints about. Marvel's Track record is still pretty darn good in my book. Looking forward to seeing Iron man again in Age Of Ultron!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The film almost rushes through as a joy ride, covering almost each and every aspect of Iron Man franchise- plot, emotions, brilliance in technical aspects, action, visual effects and most importantly the humorous Tony Stark.. The movie has its share of moments when you are just at the edge of street and are at times admiring the brilliance of a genius Stark possesses. What does come of as a surprise is that if you are aware of comic books, you would be knowing the looks of Mandarin, which might come out a little indigestible. Having said that it does not take away the credit that should be given to Shane Black for his effort. He has pulled off a great plot and would make you fall in love with RDJ all over again. The performances are great, Guy pearce is great in fact post Memento, to me he has looked pretty substantial NOW(That's a long time) Paltrow is impressive, whereas Sir kingsley seems a little too wasted for the movie, though he still creates an impact. It kills me to see such a class actor wasted. RDJ, let's not even discuss him, HE IS A CLASS APART.

The complexity, depth, heart and action were even more off the charts than the first film. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are raving about Iron Man 3. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one, developed in movie two and built upon it masterfully. We get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer mixed with an anxiety ridden celebrity who is having trouble living that celebrity life after the events of Iron Man 2 and Avengers. His playboy ways are over but everything else in his life makes little sense to him now. I love that they haven't forgotten where the character has been. It's what makes Marvel really sing and why they have an edge that most other movies don't have or care to cultivate. They also upped the action but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film than the last and I'm one that enjoyed Iron Man 2. Anyone wondering why Tony didn't just call his new Avenger/SHIELD buddies that's answered in the film. Also, there's going to be a LOT of talk about certain plot twists but I hope people see it before certain twists are on the Net. Anyway, everything fits together wonderfully and in a moving and exciting fashion.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What I said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 3. Notice anything about that last sentence? Not many films with the number three are called great. Iron Man 3 will certainly work towards changing that from here on out. It's a great film with or without a number.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

I thought ""Wow! Did they really need to, though?"" Well, when The Avengers came out as the first Marvel film distributed by Disney, I was blown away! I thought, ""Wow! I can't wait to see what they do with Iron Man 3 next year."" Fast forward to May 3, 2013. I'm in a sold out show of Iron Man 3, and I'm giddier than a nerd at Comic-con. (Compliment, because I consider myself a nerd too. So no offense meant fellow nerds.) What's the first thing I hear when the movie starts?A voice over narration by Tony Stark himself. Then something amazing happens. As the opening credits roll, I hear Eiffel 65's ""I'm Blue (Da Ba Dee).""
I have to cover my mouth to keep from cheering. Then it's awesome action scene after awesome action scene. I leave the theater so excited I can't sleep that night. And yes, I did see the scene after the credits, because, to misquote a famous Lord of the Rings character ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits."" (Tell that to half my theater though.) The basic plot of the film is this. Tony Stark needs to figure out how to balance out his life as Iron Man, and spending time with Pepper, while defeating the new menace called The Mandarin. I think Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely brilliant in this, but man that precocious ten year old kid whose name I forget, really stole the show. And now I hear he's signed on for 3 more Marvel movies, which he hasn't revealed yet. Awesome!

Woe to any other family friendly superhero blockbuster to ever come out as it will forever be held against the standard set by Avengers. Woe to Iron Man 3, which not only stacks up badly against Marvel's prior superhero film but falls victim to sequel degeneration.Our story takes place after the events of The Avengers and Tony Stark is having anxiety attacks after his near death experience in New York city fighting off an alien invasion. At the same time, he is trying to be a good boyfriend to Pepper Potts in order to ""protect the one he loves"". But in comes an old rival Alderich Killian who either wants to seduce Pepper with his snakelike suaveness or just loves acting like the bad guy he is. Meanwhile, the terrorist leader ""The Mandarin"" has launched a slew of attacks around the world in order to teach America ""a lesson"". Quite a heavy start to the movie. Until, that is, one particular Mandarin attack hits close to home, putting previous Iron Man director Jon Freveau into a coma (hence perhaps why Shane Black took his job). Tony is furious and in his ego fueled anger does the stupidest thing in all superhero history: he gives his address on public television! As expected, villains attack his house and kidnap his girlfriend. So much for wanting to ""protect the one he loves"". Tony is forced to go into hiding and fight back, without the help of his high tech armor, against genetically enhanced foes with melting magma powers.Here is the only genius move this film makes: letting Tony Stark kick ass without his high tech armor. The hero known as iron man is not bound by thus it of armor, but he is the man inside. Tony Stark is iron man and no one else can be him. With only his wits, ingenious mind and resourcefulness, Tony proves himself a true hero. However, these moments are handled less like character development and more like another ""tony is awesome""sequence. Stark still has the same jerk ass attitude from previous films, still has his planet sized ego; it seems that all that has happened to him since he first chose to become Iron Man had not changed him at all.What did change was all the elements taken from the original comic books. The human bombs from Matt Fraction's Invincible iron man series have been haphazardly combined with Warren Ellis' Extremis concept. The end result is not the ""next stage of augmented human evolution"" as per the comics but quite literally ""melter people"". Yes there is an iron man villain called The Melter whose powers is to melt things. Not sticking to the source material is fine, but blatantly poking fun and insulting the source material is a totally different matter. Case in point: the mandarin.Simply put, the mandarin is meant to be Iron Man's dark opposite: mysticism against might, Supernatural against science. If Tony Stark were Batman, the Mandarin is his Joker. But Shane Black and pals took that character to the crap pile. Instead of being the analogy for the nature of modern terrorism as promotional material for the film claimed, the Mandarin is revealed as a complete joke. First, they ripoff the ""big reveal"" from Batman Begin's Ras Al Ghul. Then, like some kid's lousy April Fools prank they spit on the very character of the Mandarin turning him from the Monarch of Mayhem into the dysfunctional love child of Austin Powers and Mr Bean.With all its special effects flair and big budget action pieces, Iron Man 3 cannot decide whether to take its subject matter seriously or not. Just as they are going into some good politics or philosophy, we cut to another comedy act for cheap laughs courtesy of Robert Downey jr. His acting is great, everyone's is. But the way it is handled breaks the tone of the movie. You have a film with unlimited potential for surfacing some serious political and philosophical subject matter. You have a film that could show a flawed character coming full circle with his heroes' journey. You have a film.......that does nothing of that sort and is perfectly content with being a comedy ridden summer blockbuster complete with an irritating kid sidekick for Iron Man.Lesson: If you want to tackle serious subject matter, make a serious film and take the villain seriously. Iron Man 3 reeks of unoriginality, drawing many elements from The Dark Knight trilogy: hero loses everything and goes into exile, hero faces an adversary who turns out to nothing but a ""front"" for a more sinister bad guy, hero is trying to be a good boyfriend but endangers his loved one, hero is forced to rely on his wits alone without fancy gadgets, hero wipes the slate clean in the end and starts anew. Familiar? Of course it is. No doubt the casual movie goer will be drawn in with spectacular fight sequences, big budget special effects and Robert Downey Jr's charisma. Oh and obviously by good ""word of mouth"" from the success of The Avengers. to No doubt Iron Man 3 will be a big hit by riding on the success of The Avengers. And at very least, it paints a successful trilogy whose first film gave birth to Marvel's cinematic universe.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've just read a series of reviews of this film. I had no idea it was so bad. I guess I'll have to un-enjoy it. Is that a word? I'm just an old guy who likes to go to movies. While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know. Kind of left me a little cold.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is every bit as good as the first but even better in my opinion.They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Well, Avengers gave this film the opportunity to move beyond what has come before and it appears there was a lot of hard work and thought that went in to making it because it's exceptional in every way. And, we are all lucky to get to see it. Iron Man 3 is exactly where and how the character should appear after the events of Avengers. I love the idea that after the Avengers Tony basically goes a bit crazy with paranoia and builds MANY new suits of armor just to be ready for anything. This really speaks to his mindset and where he is going from this point forth. It's true character development and advancement. Sometimes it's not all for the better but that's life and that's certainly what sets Marvel heroes apart from all others. The flaws and feet of clay are on display but the emotion and relatbilty are off the charts in this film. I can say the same thing about the action. There were some thrilling things that happened in the first two Iron Man films but NOTHING like we see in this movie.It's certainly on a par with Avengers. Iron Man 3 is the best solo film Marvel has made and that's high praise indeed.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

So within six years span, a fourth cranked-out (if one counts THE AVENGERS 2012, 5/10) comes on strong this year to ignite the summer powder keg. Personally I skipped IRON MAN 2 (2010) though I still possess the DVD, and the only reason why IRON MAN 3 interests me is the Chinese element, reportedly three Chinese actors are on the slate of the cast, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan and Jing Wu, but it turned out to be an utter scam, only Xueqi Wang appeared in about 3 seconds in 2 fleeting scenes with one line ""Nihao"" (""hello"" in Mandarin) and so is Ben Kingsley's ""The Mandarin"", the ostensible ringleader of the terrorists (more Al-Qaeda than mandarin). So what this new episode has offered to its devoted fanboys apart from the cookie-cutter template of the mega-Superhero action flicker? Since there are no succour from his fellow The Shields' teammates, Iron Man 3 perfunctorily opts to mass-produce the iron-clad robots to rescue the world (perish the undying human mutants), a lame and opportunist move to simplify the mess it creates and spurn any logistic plausibility (at least notify us how to kill mutants for good since they can regenerate themselves under any terms of damage), not to mention the cliffhanging twist of Pepper Potts, maybe it is all written in the next sequel. Fans will never get enough of raking and levelling, it is undeniable that the demolition of Stark's mansion is visually stunning and apocalyptic, and the esprit-de-corps of the plane-wrecking rescue is also worth the wait (thanks to the telltale trailer), but in the end, the inevitable face-off is a kill-joy, compared with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012, 8/10), IRON MAN 3 looks as feckless as a light-hearted comedy, and its success can mainly be indebted towards Mr. Downey's omnipotent appeal, a rakish fop who owns everything and is sternly faithful to his partner (although a certain degree of promiscuity is a requisite), and more alluring, he can create superheroes. Paltrow has more action sequences demanding out of her gaunt physique, and also shoulders a turnabout climax in the end, but still a trophy secretary-lover. Guy Pearce is a common-or- garden villain here (not as remotely interesting as in LAWLESS 2011, 8/10 last year), Ben Kinsley on the other hand, is the comic relief (besides Tony Stark) here, wackily inconsequential but a timely buffer from the intensified situation. Don Cheadle is ham-fisted as the other iron fighter and Rebecca Hall does evince cursory nuances for her expendable character. Among others, James Badge Dale (from SHAME 2011, 9/10 and FLIGHT 2012, 7/10) finally found his stepping- stone into mainstream showbiz, his indestructible henchman even makes his boss pale in comparison. A puff of fresher air comes from the interaction between Stark and a fatherless boy (Ty Simpkins) at a rustic Tennessee setting, with jocular ripostes and a paternal bond affectingly enriches Tony Stark's personality and one plainly wishes this part would be more to offer. However, as the turnover rate has been accelerated dramatically these years in the superhero assembly-line, IRON MAN 3 is a serviceable vehicle to appease its core audience's anticipation, and if put into a larger picture, it is not innovate enough to be a game-changer as its prototype, it is just another helluva sequel, trite but lucrative. But it will be a sad sack if Mr. Downey keeps churning out the persona into his fifties, it could be a grand farewell for the trilogy, and future cameos are warmly welcome.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

In the Avenger's Captain America said to Tony ""Take away the suit of Armor and what are you?"" I think this movie was almost created to answer that question. This film does really show what drives Tony and how even without the suit, he IS Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, you will see how all the events of the first 2 IM films and the Avengers have shaped, molded, and changed Tony, for better or for worse. Like I said, one of the best developed Characters ever...hats off to the Marvel Gang and New-comer (To Marvel films) Director/Co-writer Shane Black.2- The Score, the original music composed for the Film, was mighty, pulse-pounding, and highly thematic. I'm one of those nuts who really pays attention to what the score does for a film. Most scores do well to just accompany the film, others take it to a new level. The IM1 score had a really energetic and modern beat to it, it suited it really well. The IM2 score, really fell flat for me, it did not hearken back to the score of IM1 and although it didn't take away from the film, it certainly didn't enhance it. The score for IM3 had some resonance from IM1 but brought a whole new flare, and a lot of heart. Well done composer, Brian Tyler.3- The Hardware, yes I did emphasize how well the movie does to show who Tony is without the suit, but it once again shows just how genius he is with his suit...errr...in this film's case, suits. The suits are big nod to some of the awesome suits that have been created over decades in the comics, and their purpose in the film is well played out. I was particularly impressed at how the Mark 42 (The mostly gold suit that he wears in the film) was utilized, so many different scenarios occurred with it. Once again, well done, IM3 Team.Now, these are by no means the only things I enjoyed, but my ""Top 3 for Iron Man 3"", there are plenty of other reasons to give love to this film, but much of those are too ""spoiler-y"". So, if you haven't already seen or made plans to see Iron Man 3, go do yourself a solid and make those plans to do so and enjoy another adventure with Tony Stark, The Armored Avenger.","20 out of 43 found this helpful.

First of all the cast were great Downey Jr is a brilliant Tony Stark and I thought the film was quite amusing in places, a great film for the casual fan. Although maybe fans of the comics should give this a wide berth. When I read that the Extremis storyline was going to be the basis of the film I was excited, but this film doesn't retain the dark brooding tone that I would come to expect from such a story arc. The mandarin character gets put through the ringer as well and could be seen as a bit of a middle finger to the fans (although Kingsley is pretty funny.)

If your a devoted Iron Man fan familiar with the comics and the many cartoons he's been in you are likely to want to walk out halfway through. If your only experience with Iron man is the current Marvel movies you'll love it. The movie has excellent action, excellent special effects and Robert Downey jr is at the top of his game with his best performance yet. The advertising of this film is its main fault. The trailers promised a more serious movie and the arrival of the long anticipated nemesis of Iron Man, the Mandarin. Without giving much away it fails to meet both those things which is why I have to dock a star for the deception and for the lack of interest in pleasing the hardcore fans who after all is why these characters got popular enough to bring to the big screen. That being said this movie is a lot of fun and better than the second although still cant top the charm and perfect balance of humor and action the first movie had. There is a lot of fun to be had and aside from some small plot holes and one shockingly odd twist its one of the better marvel movies to date. Im not your movie goer whose is woed into loving a movie due to its action content or special effects as many people are, i look for character development and good story and this movie has all of that and some great action as well. I will say I felt Iron Patriot ( formerly War Machine) was yet again not given his due which is a bummer since this is the last solo Iron Man movie. Hopefully he turns up in the Avengers 2 and is given the role he deserves. Well worth the watch, skip the 3D though...not noticeable in the least bit and I have a 3D TV so I know good 3D versus bad and this qualifies as bad.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Why would they?"" After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has changed. He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to ""bring it on."" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on. Overall, little things that bothered me didn't take away from the enjoyment. I give it a B+.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Guns, robots, robot suits, self-healing people who can regrow limbs, you know, the usual stuff.The new villain to enter the world of Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is The Mandarin, a mysterious, disheveled terrorist who's supposed to bear quite the resemblance to Osama bin Laden (although bin Laden himself is referenced in the movie). The Mandarin orchestrates several attacks on the US, but, tellingly, the explosions leave no trace of actual bomb. The Mandarin terms these attacks as lessons for the American people, and as they escalate in stature a nation turns its lonely eyes to Mr. Tony Stark, who's still trying to mentally process the events of The Avengers.You might remember that in The Avengers, Iron Man temporarily sacrificed himself to save Earth by traveling through a worm hole and fighting off alien bad guys alongside Captain America, The Hulk, and Thor. For a man who up until that point was essentially a playboy who settled the occasional revenge/grievance, Stark has a lot to go through. Now he suffers from horrific insomnia (72 hours awake!) and night terrors. His place in the universe has been forever altered, and so has he psychologically. So he ensconces himself within his laboratory/basement and works on Iron Man suits to his heart's content, forty-something, actually, each one with different capabilities, each designed to defend the Earth against, well, anything.But this has made for a brooding superhero. He can't sleep, so he does what he does best - build - to the eternal chagrin of his love, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's now head of Stark Industries (well, High Up, anyway). Tony's behavior both frightens and confuses her, and now this business with The Mandarin - will Iron Man get sucked into another adventure?Here's how this movie differs from its predecessors. We no longer see only the invulnerable, cocky, risk-taking Stark. This new Tony is much more like Batman, looking for a way to escape from his demons and not even knowing what those demons are. He suffers panic attacks and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This makes for a much more evolved, shall we say, superhero. It ain't just about him anymore, or about Pepper. It's about the life, the universe, and everything. And his mortality shows, like the slip of a woman who's dressed hurriedly, and he doesn't like it one bit.I saw this movie in 3D. It's worth it, doesn't seem forced. I didn't bother with the IMAX, because I don't really need to be that immersed in a comic-book movie, but your mileage may vary. As far as I was concerned, the 3D was more than enough. Stark makes copious use of his technology, but there comes a time in the film when he has basically nothing with which to work. I'm talking no suit, no JARVIS, no Pepper, no lab, no nothing. He has to rely on his intelligence and creativity and resourcefulness - the very same traits that got him out of that cave in the first Iron Man movie. It's not an altogether pain-free experience.Don Cheadle returns as Rhodes, whom the government puts in the War Machine suit from Iron Man 2, repainted in red, white, and yes blue, sort of a nod to ol' Captain America, called Iron Patriot. Nifty, and it reminded me of the early part of the Captain America movie, in which Cap essentially has to sell out and perform as a sideshow act for the troops, to keep up morale. With a Good Guy robot on their side, the government is pleased - until...well, this is truly not a spoiler, but a resident baddie finds a way to control Rhodes' suit, and we next have a subplot regarding the abduction of the president and the true identity of The Mandarin (guess what - Stark's past is involved).Now, those who are avid followers of the comic books may well be unhappy with some changes. Deal with it. The movie is not in a different dimension from its cinematic ancestors, and that's really the correct comparison. Some minor characters may have changed a little from the comics. Does it mean the movie suffers? Of course not.There was a lot more humility than I'd come to expect from these movies, more humanity, more fear of mortality. That injection of reality, following so close behind the tragedies within The Avengers, makes this a very good genre movie. Yes, there are surprises, and yes, there are moments when your heart skips a beat, and yes, there are truly beautiful moments. But in all, this is a high-energy, hyperactive film that still manages to be philosophical and even regretful.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When Disney took over Marvel this was one movie that I knew took in some cash to get done and I was skeptical, as to me cash is not what makes good movies, it is good stories, well Iron man 3 had a good story and the supporting cast were just off the hook. The movie had a nice comic feel, and the action scenes were relentless, the writers were always leaving me speechless by the turn of events making me eager to see where the movie was going.The writers decided to keep all things on the level of science, in the Iron Man comic book series the Mandarin is his archenemy and he is portrayed to be a genius scientist and an extremely skilled martial artist. The Mandarin showcases some powers which sources are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Here in this movie the Mandarin is just a face of the true villain and there is no evidence of him having a common sense, the move had a pure scientific genius hiding behind the face of Mandarin.The movie picks up with a flash back of when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was having a New Year's Eve party, there he met scientist Maya Hansen. Maya was working on an invention called Extremis‚Äîan experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Maya wanted to work with Stark to make this drug work, but Stark rejected the offer.Years later, Stark's experiences during the alien invasion of New York were making him restless. Out of that he built several dozen Iron Man suits, all tied to work with his subconscious, this act created friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). A terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been the orchestrator of a string of bombings all done with no forensic evidence to trace the type of bomb used. When Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is badly injured in one such attack, Stark overcomes his stupor and issues a televised threat to the Mandarin.That led to Mandarin retaliating bringing down Starks home and the world thought Stark died, so Stark used his now presume state to hunt down the Mandarin and discovered that the Mandarin is not who he thought he is.This movie is clearing cash in the box office, and I believe it will cross the 1 billion mark soon, so if you have not seen this movie, I wonder what you are waiting forwww.lagsreviews.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Mandarin twist was actually pretty funny, I admit it, but he was shaping up to be a really good villain. Also, Aldrich Killian's backstory is something I just can't take seriously, which is another problem in this movie; it feels like a fan film. Not to discredit director, Shane Black, or any of the actors, I just wasn't feeling this movie. It wasn't that funny and it was a little too goofy at times. One good thing I will say about this flick is that the action (particularly the final fight) is probably the best in the Iron Man trilogy, to be honest.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you liked Iron Man 1 but 2 not so much, you'll love 3. Great acting by Downey Jr. as usual. He keeps true to the brilliant, egotistical but moral Tony Stark, now trying to cope without much success with all that happened during The Avengers (like the fact that there are aliens). Many more innovations to the Iron Man suits in this one since Stark uses that as a diversion from his troubles. Kingsley was probably underused but acted his part well, as did Paltrow and Guy Pearce. The action scenes were all non-routine, brilliant and well executed and were plenty. Jarvis kicks ass like always. The plot I felt was quite good and not run of the mill at least as far as action flicks go. There was a good amount of emotional depth to the characters and their motives as well as a nice banter between Stark and some random kid he meets and a nice bit of comedy throughout the movie along with a twist in the middle and a few nice surprises here and there. The 2 hrs just buzzed by and I would definitely end up watching this movie again. Highly entertaining and heavily recommended.","15 out of 33 found this helpful.

Stark's response is ""Sweetheart, a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner could be the name of my autobiography"". Audiences have already come to expect such witty and self-referential dialogue from the the great writer Shane Black. Who is Shane Black, you ask? Well, you may not know him but you have certainly seen a lot of his films. This man is responsible for the greatness and awesomeness of the Lethal Weapon franchise, the wise- cracking Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( which also stars Robert Downey Jr.)Iron Man 3 was marketed as a story where Tony Stark would meet an opponent that would break him physically and mentally. It all looked very dark and gloomy. I'm glad to say that the end result is far from a dark and gritty movie. It is actually the exact opposite. This film is just as funny and action packed as the previous Iron Man films. The main difference is that this film has taken completely different approach than any other Marvel movie. This film isn't just your typical superhero has to fight a new enemy and in the end he wins story. This is a detective story, where our favorite billionaire, playboy philanthropist in his battle against The Mandarin is forced to go on a full-tilt investigation, revisiting crime scenes, digging through evidence and even interviewing witnesses. More than just being a detective story, what makes it a Shane Black detective story is the connections to the classic noir. Tony Stark is experiencing his darkest and toughest days due to post-traumatic stress from the Battle of New York (although in The Avengers he was fine, wise-cracking and joking around), he loses his home, his hunt for The Mandarin takes him through all kinds of crazy reveals and plot twists. There's even great voice-over narration just in the likes of Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. You get more Tony Stark than Iron Man. Which doesn't mean that there is less action. No, you get plenty of action scenes just most of them are Tony being out of the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has now become the living embodiment of Tony Stark. When you think of Downey, the first character you associate with him Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is just so believable in this role. I can't imagine any other actor in this role, it just wouldn't be such fun. Gwyneth Paltrow finally gets some action scenes. The banter between Downey's Stark and Paltrow's Pepper isn't that funny and light-hearted as in the previous films. Their conversations are now more serious since they are in relationship. Don Cheadle doesn't get much screen time as Col. Rhodes but this is the funnest his character has ever been. Shane Black establishes this Lethal-Waponesque relationship between him and Tony. Ben Kingsley, well, without spoiling anything you have never seen him like this. Few years ago Guy Pearce has started playing villains and bad guys. Well, I can't complain about him he is great as always but I would just want to see him once in a while as the good guy, that's all.Brian Tyler's score is much more darker but also much more melodic. Finally we get Iron Man's heroic theme which is truly kick-ass and great to listen to. Iron Man 3 is not the superhero film I was expecting but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I'm glad that all those trailers, clips and TV spots didn't ruin the film. I was a lot surprised at all the stuff happening in the film. This film is also great Christmas movie. Black explains why Iron Man 3 (just as lot of his other films are set at Christmas:""It's a time of reckoning for a lot of people, when you take stock of how you got to where you are now and lonely people are lonelier at Christmas and you tend to notice things more acutely. Well, that describes the character's story in this film quite a lot. P.S.

Glad to see War Machine back, who I believe would of been great in the Avengers. Anyway, to the film. It was so so so funny, with the exact amount of action needed. The pace was like people said ""uneven"". But for me that only added to the twists and turns and unpredictability. It was also fab to see Stark without the suit (well for most of it)and I believe all the actors played there roles so very well. I was also surprised to see James Badge Dale perform such a harrowing role, so bloody well. Overall for me it is better than 2, maybe not as good as the original, but it has to be said they take on different routes and offer different experiences. 8.5/10 for me. Role on all the other steps of phase 2!","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

I am not an expert, and so cannot judge Iron Man on technical Marvel merit, but on the basis of a film about a likable character, by known brilliant actor (Downey Jr). Paltrow is watchable in this film and many people have commented that it's one of her best roles; I usually like her (especially Sliding Doors and Shakespeare in Love) and she was no less good in this than I expected. Downey Jr and his comedic timing and dry straight style - always incredible deep into character - weren't disappointing but the stars were Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley, particularly the latter. Don Cheadle also reassuringly good and the child actor Ty Simpkins was perfectly cast and not at all annoying (as many child actors are). I could listen to Paul Bettany all day so him as the voice of the suit/computer was very pleasant ;-) The CGI was obviously front and centre with all the SFX, which is expected, and for the most part it wasn't obvious (aside from where the laws of physics made it necessary) except for a few places where I got annoyed. Generally though it was seamless with real action, and some of the SFX were brilliant especially the 'running hot' bodies of the terrorist army - especially Pearce. The script was witty and clever for the most part, but a little staccato and without much depth but it did the job and for such a visual film it was sufficient. Without the SFX and the absorbing skill of the actors, this film would have faltered as it really was a visually attractive experience even on a small screen. I was gripped all the way through, which I didn't expect and was emotionally involved with some events in the film. Really did enjoy Ben Kingsley and the humour, for me, added a great deal to the film. Not much in the way of life changing or expanding experience in watching this film, but in terms of entertainment - even for a super-hero/comic book franchise - I enjoyed and gave it 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have been a huge Iron man fan since I was very young, so I have been looking forward to this film for about a year and a half. The main issue I had with this film, was It's misuse of key characters: like the Mandarin, James Rhodes, and Maya Hansen. The film instead focuses on a stupid kid sidekick, ""super pepper"" and a fire breathing Aldrich Killian. The lack of including S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers was also an ill advised decision made by the newly appointed director Shane Black who you may remember from predator or the end credits from the lethal weapon films. I would suggest seeing this movie if you have already seen: Place beyond the pines, 42, Oblivion, and Pain and gain. Which are all far better films, but If you must see Iron man 3 immediately, see it cheap. Because otherwise you will be upset for spending more then about 10 dollars on this film. Robert Downey jr. gives another strong performance as Tony Stark, and made me decide to give this movie a seven instead of five. Don't expect to see much of the main man in his metal suit though. Except during the last action scene which is very redeeming, and seems to have made most reviewers forget about the films flaws. Like I said this film is okay, but there are far better films out right now, and this one just isn't worth the ticket price. Thanks for your time, and happy movie-going.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG TO EVEN DOUBT IT. It's everything Iron Man should be: Downey Jnr. IS Tony Stark , his lightning fast wit enhancing the cocky comic character. The action was intense and, surprisingly, not just confined to Stark's alter ego. There were genuinely hilarious moments when the theatre was in stitches, and Kingsley and Pearce were epic in their roles.....AND there were a number of twists and turns that kept the movie fresh. The most interesting aspect that sets it apart from the Iron Man we've seen previously, however, is the depth that we delve into Stark's psyche, reminiscent perhaps of Bond in Skyfall.But, even in the darkest moments, it's never too far away from a one-liner.And that's what makes it enjoyable: it balances the serious with the playful, never straying too much into Dark Knight or Batman Forever(I wouldn't even dare and try to mention 1997's Douche-Man and Slobbin) territory, respectively. Black's direction is great (Downey's wit harking back to the brilliant Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), and I would hope that, if there is to be another Downey Jnr. stand-alone, that he would get the nod to direct. So, overall: great villain(-s ????), great allies, great comedy, great action, great depth, great direction and, most importantly, PERFECT Downey Jnr............oh, and Gwyenth Paltrow really DOES have the ass of a 22 year old......and a set of abs Terry Crewes would shed a tear at.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

You would think with how successful The Avengers has become, Iron Man 3 should have no problem coasting toward success. Financially, Iron Man 3 should do gangbusters ‚Äì it already has overseas ‚Äì but since Marvel has opened Pandora's box to a greater cinematic universe, the true victory will rely on whether this film can hold up on its own without the crutch of the other Avengers. The first of it's kind, no other film has ever taken on the burden of being the sequel to two separate stories. Although both Iron Man movies and The Avengers are part of the same universe, Iron Man 3 must be looked at from both angles differently. Marvel has now forced this upon all of its properties. This may work well in the comic book world, but can it feel right when it is on the big screen? With that said, director Shane Black had a huge weight on his shoulders to deliver not only a comprehensible Iron Man sequel, but also a continuation of where The Avengers left off.A lot happens in Iron Man 3, but luckily Shane Black never makes it difficult to follow. Black and co-writer Drew Pearce have developed a terrific screenplay for Tony Stark to grow as a character while also writing a shining example of how a superhero can stand up when the chips are down. For a good portion of the movie, Tony can be seen without his armor and how we see him deal with this situation makes for wonderful entry into the superhero genre. Robert Downey Jr. couldn't have been any better as Tony Stark ‚Äì it's almost as if he was born for this role. If this is the last time we see him portray this character, he certainly goes out with a bang.With a lot of the emphasis placed on Tony in this film, sadly we are not granted a lot of time with the villains to explore their motivations. Their intentions are clear to some extent, but not all their plans seem logical or thought out. Not completely understanding the villains' goals provides very little tension or immediacy for Tony to save the day. Extremis, especially, is also never explained into detail and the rules of how the treatment works on different people is vague. There is a very bizarre twist that goes off canon from the comics that will cause a huge divide among movie goers that I see as a huge downfall for potential Iron Man films. I didn't hate it, but it's not something I truly cared for.All of the performances are top notch, especially from Sir Ben Kingsley. He works The Mandarin like it was second nature. Gwyneth brings even more vivacity to Pepper that positions the character very well in the end. Rebecca Hall was unfortunately wasted as an actress and not given much to do, but Guy Pearce does a fine job bringing life to a character with little depth.The direction of the story was handled well, but one of the biggest problems I had was with the pacing. Certain moments are rushed without giving them time to marinate, especially the points where Tony's character arc changes and then again at the very end. This movie is filled to the brim with exposition and subplots, but if it had a little more time to expand certain areas while fine-tuning others Iron Man 3 could have been knocked it out of the park.Iron Man 3 is grittier and more raw on every level ‚Äì far more adult than any other Marvel Studios film to date. It could have easily obtained an R-rating if Shane Black had his way. Technically it is on par with what we have come to expect from a Marvel superhero movie. It is visually superior to a lot of the CGI creations we see today too, but the 3D is less to be desired. On many levels Iron Man 3 holds well to the Marvel cinematic style, but at the same time Black infuses his own flare which differs greatly from that of Jon Favreau in Iron Man and Iron Man 2.As a sequel to Iron Man 2, this film is solid. It vastly improves the scope of Tony Stark's impact on the world and is a great stand alone edition to the Iron Man franchise. But as a sequel to The Avengers this film fails on many levels. There are references to the team and what happened in New York, but nothing that could tie this film to the bigger picture. Not even S.H.I.E.LD. plays a role in this film and at no point are we told where anyone else is to get a sense of why they could not come to Tony's aide. You would think with all the terrorist threats, someone from The Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D. would come into play if the life of the President is in danger. Nope.For anyone who loves what Marvel is doing and goes in expecting a great Iron Man film, you'll be treated to a fantastic ride. And those hoping for another movie on scale of The Avengers may leave a bit disappointed. Iron Man 3 is a decent stand alone Iron Man movie, but in no way does it succeed as a continuation of The Avengers. Despite its flaws, Iron Man 3 is a hilariously enjoyable film that expands the character of Tony Stark very well and is filled with tons of spectacular action for anyone to enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie actually lacks continuity with the previous Marvel films featuring Robert Downey JR. as Tony Stark/Iron Man in some very big ways. Up until this film Tony has been brilliant and resourceful. And the Iron Man armor has been a powerful weapon. But in this film Tony is a guy with a big mouth who isn't all that great with the suit and his suits seem like they're made of aluminum scrap. And there are various times in the film where Tony's once amazing tech is reduced to malfunctioning junk just for cheap laughs. It also seems like the creators of Iron Man 3 forgot that Tony Stark's mini Arc Reactor powers his various Iron Man suits. The mini Arc Reactor was the driving plot point of Iron Man. It's what everyone was fighting about and it was ripped from Tony Stark's chest by Obadiah Stane and used to power Stane's Iron Monger weaponry. Later Stark recovers the mini Arc and places it back inside his chest. It's still there in Iron Man 3, yet Stark runs around looking for ways to jump start his Iron Man armor after it's damaged.There's also no explanation as to why Tony stays in Tennessee as if hes stranded and why Tony labors on repairs for his damaged armor when later we find Tony has had dozens of fully operational Iron Man suits hidden in California, that he could summon at any time. And why did Tony don his only non operational suit after daring terrorists to attack him at home in California, when he had many ready to go suits in his basement and bunker? We learned in Avengers that Tony's artificial intelligence design; 'Jarvis', also exists in the NYC Stark Tower and can manufacture suits without assistance. Yet in Iron Man 3 he only exists in the Iron Man armor after the Malibu home is destroyed. Another bit of Iron Man canon that is ignored to keep Tony stranded in Tennessee and stuck with a damaged Iron Man suit. Tony's Iron Man armor has survived direct hits from missiles, being run over by a car, SHIELD Heli-Carrier propellers, Thor's hammer and many violent crashes in previous films but in Iron Man 3 it is shattered by a collision with a semi truck and later in the climatic battle, multiple suits are ripped apart like wet tissue. Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, the creator and writer of the Lethal Weapon series. And much of this movie breaks the cannon of 2 Iron Man films and Avengers, just to morph Iron Man into a retread of Shane Black's glory days writing scenes for Rigg's and Murtagh.Shane Black became friends with Downey JR. while they worked on Black's 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'. It was Downey JR. who pulled some strings within Marvel Films to get Black his Iron Man 3 gig. Marvel did itself and it's fans a great disservice handing such control of it's Iron Man franchise over to Black who in turn used it to pay homage to himself and to his Lethal Weapon series.","36 out of 71 found this helpful.

So I wasn't.Instead, what I got what a film that sees Tony Stark laid low and spending most of the film out of his iron suit and trying to rebuild from a tool shed with the help of a young boy. It's Tony Stark's ""Rocky 3"" if you like and for that reason, I enjoyed it.There are some plot holes but they are relatively minor ones. They could easily have been explained by a couple of clunky lines of exposition which the screenwriters wisely decided not to bother with - you can fill in the blanks yourself if you like. I think the real reason for the virulent backlash to this film are the fact that it doesn't fit with the characters as previously defined in the comics.But if you don't give a hoot about ""canon"" and ""mythos"" and the ""Marvel Universe"" and all that, then you'll be fine.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The twist, hilarious. The villain, great. I liked the battles with the bads and the chemistry between all the characters. Im not putting many details, but I will say I have always liked Shane Black and his signature is ALL OVER this movie. From the Christmas theme, to the plucky kid its all there.

A faster paced instalment to the series, Shane Black effortlessly takes over the directing reigns, it has the right dose of action, humour and emotion. Even though the few surprises and twists are heavy handed- namely the The Mandarin and Pepper Potts thread Robert Downey Jr. gets to portray Tony Stark once again and develop the character a little further. Although Guy Pearce is given an unconvincing make up and hair introduction once he returns clean cut he excels and steals the show as bad guy Aldrich Killian. Rebecca Hall is form in a smaller role and Ben Kingsley is entertaining with his Captain Jack-like swagger as The Mandarin. A few of the Iron Man's series previous characters show up and never out stay their welcome.Black impressively handles the big budget spectacles and action scene sequences with precision, the special effects are outstanding. However, Stark losing his suit so often become a tad tiresome. Like its predecessor this has an interesting subtext with regards to terrorists, the Middle East and Starks relationship with the suit. There's also a novel brave closure ending, nevertheless it's a good outing with a humorous post credit sequence.Debatably Iron Man's most rounded outing for the masses.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marvel's ""Phase 2"" is off to a great start, with a movie that feels perfectly stand-alone, and which delivers character-centric, lighthearted action.The script starts off a bit rambling and all over the place, but it doesn't take very long for big action set pieces to roll in and make us cheer for Tony Stark. Not that we need a lot to cheer him: Stark is as charming and funny as ever, and he steals the show every second he's on screen.The action is loud and imaginative; the character angst is amped up and the stakes are high. This is a cool summer action superhero flick, much better than Iron Man 2. My only disappointment is the Mandarin, who starts as a very strong visual presence, but turns into something less impressive than I hoped.I'm curious to see other Phase 2 movies, now.

Some, and only some one-liners hit the mark. The action and visual effects are a dazzling treat to behold. And that's the end of it. There is nothing else in this movie that is truly good to write home about.The Bad - Where to even begin? This is one awful movie that shall take the studio a lot of soul-searching and fundamental reworking (irrespective of how much money this movie rakes in), in order to even attempt getting this great superhero franchise back on track. The direction is so shoddy that any recently passed out film school alumnus could have done a better job. The plot, characterization, story arc, and narration is simply all over the place and meanders along a confounding, restless, and disoriented path.Hardcore comic book fans and Iron Man aficionados like me will certainly spew vitriol at seeing Mandarin - one of the greatest comic book villains and one of the fiercest adversaries of Iron Man - being reduced to a mere gimmick. The character's gross misrepresentation simply cannot be overlooked. Add to this, the character of Aldrich Killian - who in reality is nothing more than a minion and a small-time foe of Iron Man - being given superiority and control over Mandarin, and any mildly interested follower of Iron Man will begin to wonder if it would have been more prudent to hire some avid comic book fans to harness this script.Even objective moviegoers without any predilections towards the comics, will be left largely dissatisfied at the total decimation of the narrative structure. This film is like a Hollywood 'Singham' or a 'Rowdy Rathore' in a superhero mold - that's how bad it is. Its nothing but a shrewd attempt to milk the cash cow and surreptitiously deliver insipid milk in a glossy packet to the unsuspecting audiences.Those who've been comparing this rancid somnolence to ""The Avenger"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - two of the greatest superhero movies ever - and those who claim that ""Iron Man 3"" amalgamates the tones of both the aforementioned films, have either been bribed handsomely by the producers or perhaps they have watched a completely different movie. This film is more analogous to such superhero stinkers like ""Batman & Robin"", ""Catwoman"", Spiderman 3"", ""Green Lantern"", and ""Superman Returns"".Quite simply, one of the worst superhero movies ever, and a real blemish on the reputation of the classic 1st installment and the vastly superior 2nd installment.","36 out of 72 found this helpful.

So why is everyone moody with this film? Have all your periods synced up or something?

Was this Marvel's attempted at a Joker? The only one complaint I had!Robert Downing Jr. was great in this. He never disappoints when it comes to Iron Man. He was funny, clever and as per normal, great with his gadgets.This film was not as good as the first and second, and it was very hard to live up to them two, stop being picky, leave that to the critics, come on guys, this was an amazing film and we are all butchering it! If the first two Iron Man's didn't exist, I see this film getting at least a 8.5 out of 10 rather than 7.9!

Probably because he Tony Stark isn't slowly dying of blood poisoning like in the second film. All the supporting cast are great. Particularly Guy Pearse and Ben Kingsley.Best points of the film;1.

This movie is fit as an opening summer film: it's big blockbuster movie with massive action scenes and really fun to see. The studio has right decisions choosing Shane Black as director instead of maintaining Jon Favreau who had destroyed second installment. He knows how to handle this franchise well without adding unnecessary scene and silly jokes like the second one. And of course there's no complaint about Robert Downey's performance as Tony Stark, he's done great as usual.Still there are some weakness in 'Iron Man 3'. Unlike the first 'Iron Man' which had offered spectacular action scenes but still realistic in storyline, this film is too cartoonish and predictable, also nothing fresh in it. I think they don't want to take any risks and making it at the safe zone like most of 'The Avengers' franchise. They try to satisfy the fans without attracting new viewers. Also the villain is under- developed, there is similarity character between Mandarin and Syndrome in Disney's Pixar: 'The Incredibles'. I suggest not to see it in IMAX 3D, it's a waste. Although the 3D is not horrible but there is nothing special in it.Afterall, 'Iron Man 3' is an amazing, thrilling and entertaining summer blockbuster movie. Most people who see it would agree about how cool this movie is. The studio undeniable creating flawless visual effects that make the action scenes look real. Marvel 'The Avengers' fans, teenager and kids are gonna love it. I'm personally quite disappointed after watching it cause there is no improvement in this third installment that I'm waiting for. 'Iron Man 3' is below the first 'Iron Man' and also not as good as 'The Avengers' or even 'Captain America' but Shane Black success to lift up this franchise into a better future after a mess in 'Iron Man 2'.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

He put it back on track (at least creatively anyway). It's not like ""Iron Man 2"" was a bad superhero movie (especially next to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") but coming off of the initial blockbuster that was ""Iron Man"", director John Favreau had much to live up to. Thus, for a lot of people ""Iron Man 2"" was a minor disappointment, of which Black has been sent in to correct. Now, does Black accomplish something profound here? Something Favreau wasn't able to do with the previous Iron Man's? Well, the answer is no, not really. Though the material is funnier, much of the visuals are explosion-centric and there is a startling amount of Gwyenth Paltrow abs, the direction isn't as different as many are claiming (which is a good thing). In the end, ""Iron Man 3"" is more of Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic sensibility, and that's basically all that matters when talking about this franchise.Synopsis: When Tony Stark/Iron Man begins suffering from panic attacks on the wake of terrorist attacks by the Bin Laden-esque evil doer, The Mandarin, he begins to reevaluate what being Iron Man actually means to his livelihood and sanity. So, while that storyline sounds dark (or Nolan-esque) ""Iron Man 3"" sadly contains a more prominent and quite generic storyline, having to do with an alternate villain. A villain who has been cleverly left out of the trailers, but after an experiment gone wrong, plans to take over the world (don't they always?).When these two story lines combine, the plot itself isn't as strong as I expected. In fact, at times it becomes a bit overcomplicated. But again, the Iron Man franchise has always been more about the performances and the snappy dialogue than the plot.Supporting Cast: Ty Simpkins (or mini-Robert Downey Jr. as I like to call him) the little boy who plays Harley Keener, steals the show for the relatively small amount of time he is on screen. Actually it is the chemistry between him and Downey Jr. during their scenes together, which are unequivocally the funniest moments of the film. As for Paltrow, who returns in her role as Pepper Potts, she is pretty blah. But not enough to be a distraction, so¬Ömoving on.Side Note: Undeniably, the most questionable aspect of ""Iron Man 3"" has to be the (dare I say) innovative way Black chooses to play out the role of The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley) whose character takes a comically unexpected, but spoiler-ridden turn half way through the movie. That said, when the villain in a superhero movie is delivering an abundance of funny lines, one could make the argument that at times the dialogue and scenarios have become a bit too Joss Whedon for their own good. And before you say it, I realize that Whedon wasn't a part of the writing team of ""Iron Man 3"". But maybe my issue with this overly comedic tone used for The Mandarin character goes back to the fundamental flaw with trying to compare the future of Disney's Marvel world with the future of DC comic films. On the wings of Christopher Nolan, DC has gone down the path of heavy drama, creating characters who are more flawed, more disturbed and more realistic. Now, Marvel seems to be going the other way with it, keeping an old fashioned sense of comic book levity, with film after film constructed on comedic foundations; i.e. ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"". Meaning, even though there is superhero action throughout, in Marvel films there are not only many comic relief characters, but also protagonists and antagonist who are quirky and quick with a funny one liner. So with that logic, the fact that ""Iron Man 3"" must be labeled as a superhero action/comedy, should not be held against it by fans of The Dark Knight franchise (like myself). In other words, from this point forward, if you are going to see a Marvel film, be expected to laugh. On the other hand, everything I've just stated may end up being toilet fodder with the upcoming release of Marvel's ""The Wolverine"".Final Thought: Don't bother waiting around to see what clip is shown after the credits of this film. Trust me. The movie is long enough and the post credits clip is definitely not worth holding in a bladder full of urine for.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Despite the science fiction, cartoon hero nature of the movie, the plots were reasonably believable and not too ridiculous. Action scenes were good, but not overdone. Moreover, characters had depth - quite rare in action movies in general and especially so in superhero movies. Dialogue was snappy and funny. Performances were first-rate.Iron Man 3 is no exception. In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous two. Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident in the first two. Plus, in the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's character we have a villain who is a match for Iron Man.On this note, Guy Pearce put in a great performance as the bad guy. Usual great, snappy, witty performance from Robert Downey Jr. Great entertainment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yes Michael Bray, look shocked with this radical concept, the general public want more than ""look she go boom!""Plot Holes? There ain't none. Yes Orci, it can be done. At last a story that is original, humor in the right places and real plot surprises. See it soon and enjoy a movie that respects its audience and does not think we are all 12 year olds.

This movie really didn't capture anything that was special from the first iron man. The gritty-comedic tone set the bar pretty high from the get go, then iron man 2 was released and it was a disappointment.Iron Man 3 however, was even worse then the second one. 6 extremely bad issues with the film:1.) Comedy If i wanted to see a comedy, i would have seen a different movie. NOT IRON MAN 3! This movie is nothing more then snippy one liners and referrals to the avengers (which are funny at first granted, but get extremely repetitive?). 2.) The suit/s. This not a spoiler so yes. In the trailer you see Gwyneth Paltrow in the suit. Firstly, what is the point of Tony stark if his butler can use the suit, let alone Rhodey who pilots his own suit. Very silly. 3.) The portrayal of the Mandarin. If you've read the comics (like me) the mandarin uses rings to control three space alien dragons and has utmost powers. (In the film this unrealistic measure has been toned down a lot)Though to the point of where one of iron man's toughest villains has been disgraced. see the movie and you will understand where i'm coming from. 4.) Plot holes. To give nothing Away, the consistency of plot holes is unbearable, and so easily pick up!5.) That Disney feel to it. This movie is like a family comedy, if you want to take your kids to a family action movie (yet there is little action in this one) take them to this one. 6.) Unnecessary characters. In this movie there is a child, okay, BUT HE IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS THAT THE MOVIE FOCUSES ON! Disney what have you done to iron man. So in reality don't see this movie unless you want to see what I'm talking about 4/10","34 out of 68 found this helpful.

"","","More CGI than quality movie...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3074996/?ref_=tt_urv","tharnax","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0483132/?ref_=tt_urv","24 August 2014","'Iron Man 3' is a classic example of what happens when you attempt to make lightning strike in the same place thrice: it doesn't quite work. There have been few casting decisions in the last 20 years of cinema as perfect as the pick of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (a.k.a Iron Man). Iron Man 3 reminds us of this miracle every time RDJ is on-screen; the billion-dollar franchise depends on him and his great skill at playing this witty, ingenuous billionaire-turned-superhero. The original 'Iron Man' film benefited from a great script that chronicled Tony Stark's transformation into his Iron Man persona. That first film was a smash hit for those 2 reasons: Great script and great lead actor. Now we must subtract the great script for both 'Iron Man 2' and 'Iron Man 3' which leaves only the great actor as a character that we really enjoy. These are mediocre stories compared with the first film, however they are enjoyable due to the action and RDJ's performances. The anticipation for this movie was also amped way up after the incredible 'Avengers' movie, which also benefited from both Downey and an amazing script. That brings us to 'Iron Man 3' which has 'Corporate Meddling' written all over it. I'm not sure exactly why, but highly anticipated blockbusters always tend to be overworked, predictable and drenched in overdone, expensive CGI effects ( Think: Spiderman 3) . Iron Man 3 is such a film with a confused script and a lot of odd ideas for location shooting. By now, Tony Stark has developed his armor in striking ways and with amazing capabilities, so much so that we have little to look forward to in a 4th movie with so many great ideas for the armor crammed into this installment. RDJ keeps us glued to Tony Stark as he carries out an investigation into the terrorist bombings of the Osama Bin Laden-ish villain 'The Mandarin'. The always great Ben Kingsley has a great time with this character and creates a few laughs along the way. Another fine actor, Guy Pierce ( Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo) is completely wasted in his two-dimensional role as mad scientist Aldrich Killian. Many of the sacrifices made by the other actors are simply to make room for Robert Downey Jr. himself. Tony Stark needs a lot of screen time, but the crammed and forced script and plot twists need a lot of screen time also! Mix it all together and it will certainly not match nor suitably follow 'The Avengers' or the original 'Iron Man'. However, there is that cool actor Robert Downey Jr. who seems to miraculously keep us coming back to watch again and again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That said, I haven't missed a single one of the films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, established with 2008's Iron Man. The time has sped by on rocket boots, and with the Phase I films all in the bag, Phase II begins where it all started, with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. (who else?) is back as Tony Stark, tinkering with new gadgets even as the events of The Avengers give him sleepless nights. His girl Friday Pepper Potts (Paltrow) has moved in with him, but Stark just won't give her the time of day even as the holidays approach. Enter the enigmatic terrorist mastermind The Mandarin (Kingsley), perpetrator of a series of vicious bomb attacks, one of which critically wounds Tony's ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Tony swears revenge, and his home is assaulted by the Mandarin's forces in return. Stranded in rural Tennessee, he enlists the help of a local kid (Ty Simpkins) to help patch his armour in anticipation of The Mandarin's next strike. Tony also discovers links to Dr Aldrich Killian and Dr Maya Hansen, developers of the Extremis virus ‚Äì a revolutionary piece of biotechnology that has turned dangerously unstable. Iron Man 3 is nothing short of a game-changer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the film, Happy Hogan doesn't work directly for Tony Stark anymore ‚Äì a bit of leaning-against-the-fourth-wall winking, seeing as how Jon Favreau has passed on the director's baton to Shane Black, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Drew Pearce. Once one of the most sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood, Black proves he's still got the mojo he displayed with his screenplays for Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout in spades. Iron Man 3 has got his stamp all over it (notice the Christmas-time setting) and yet also delivers everything we've come to expect of a big-budget superhero blockbuster at the same time. The film is tightly-plotted and expertly paced; audiences certainly won't be twiddling their thumbs waiting impatiently for the next action scene to roll around. Said action scenes are plenty inventive though ‚Äì a daring mid-air rescue which Stark compares to playing ""Barrel of Monkeys"" and a dazzlingly-choreographed finale involving Stark hopping in and out of an array of Iron Man suits mid- combat being the prime examples. Black shows that he understands how important such displays are to the type of film he's making, but never lets the story get drowned out by the din of high-octane bells and whistles. A section of viewers have taken Iron Man 2 to task for spending too much of its running time in setting up the big event, The Avengers. Iron Man 3 suffers no such problem. The focus is squarely back on Tony Stark, and by now it is impossible to imagine the character being played by anyone other than Robert Downey Jr. At this point in a franchise, the leading man is wont to display signs of weariness or that he's only doing it for the paycheck ‚Äì nope, not here. Downey Jr., armed with a new batch of one-liners and an even bigger new batch of armoured outfits, is having as much fun with the role as ever. He doesn't feel like he's hogging the spotlight though, because both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow get more to do here in their supporting parts. Col. James Rhodes' ""War Machine"" has been given an image makeover and renamed ""Iron Patriot""; the film doing a good job of showing how Rhodey is at his best fighting alongside Iron Man instead of merely playing errand boy for the US military. Pepper Potts finally gets to step out of her ""beleaguered assistant"" corner and throw some punches of her own, playing a pivotal part in the film's climactic shipping dock battle. The subplot with Ty Simpkins' character serving as Stark's kid sidekick of sorts could have come off as twee, but it doesn't eat into the meat of the proceedings and Stark's interactions with the boy are amusing and heartfelt. Also new to the series are Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall. The Mandarin, the Fu-Manchu like archenemy of Iron Man in the comics, is reimagined as an unkempt, somewhat theatrical figure of the shadows ‚Äì though there is of course more to him than that. Stalwart comic book fans might not like the way the character is ultimately handled, but it is clever enough and didn't really bother me. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a scientist who was ignored by Stark earlier in his career and doesn't take too kindly to this, re-entering the fray with slicked- back hair and a spray tan. Pearce plays the ""mousy to charismatic"" angle well, when it could well have been overly cartoonish √† la Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever. The beautiful Rebecca Hall doesn't get a lot of screen time, but is one of those actresses who plays ""hot scientist"" without a hitch. It would seem that doing anything new within the confines of the wham- bam comic book blockbuster genre would be difficult, since every new entry seems to be measured against The Avengers or The Dark Knight trilogy. It is to the credit of Shane Black and the team behind Iron Man 3 then that the film is effortlessly invigorating, assured in its tone with a good sprinkling of humour mixed in with awe-inspiring, effects- heavy action sequences and well-written character moments. There probably isn't a better way to kick off Phase II of Marvel's Cinematic Universe than with this flick.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

Iron Man 3 is less of a superhero movie and more of a psychological detective thriller, and we will see this genre-bending throughout the movies of Phase 3. T he good - RDJ is still Tony Stark, and just watching him grow the character, dealing with the events of The Battle of New York, is worth the price of admission. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to be great as Pepper Potts, and (with very few exceptions) Pepper and Tony's relationship continues to be believable.The great - I loved seeing Pepper suit up in some armor, if only for a moment, and I also like the strong female characters in the film. I believe this might be the first MCU property that passes the Bechdel Test.The problems - I don't totally buy Pepper being so angry at Tony and this bugged me. The whole ""twist"" didn't really work for me. I missed Jon Favreau's lighter take on the Iron Man universe of Iron Man and Iron Man 2. This Tony is a much less fun Tony, and while I get why (Tony is realizing it is a much less fun world he lives in), I still miss fun Tony.Summary - I enjoyed this movie, but find it one of my least favorite of the MCU. It lacked much of the charm of the first two Iron Man movies. I don't mean to pan it in any way, but it will certainly be a while before I throw this one on.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has a lot of detractors, and I can see some of their points, but ultimately I was never bored and had a good time watching it. One of the major complaints is about how they handled the character of the Mandarin, one of Iron Man's biggest villains from the comics. If I had read about it beforehand, I probably would have agreed. But watching it play out, I actually liked it and thought it was quite clever. My only real quibble is that the other villain of the movie (Guy Pearce) is underwhelming. The returning cast members Downey, Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau are all great. This is probably the best movie in the series for Paltrow, in particular. It doesn't hurt that she's very hot in this. The best scenes involve Downey and a young boy (Ty Simpkins). Fanboys might balk at some parts of this one but I think most people will find it entertaining.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The rest...First, I am not a comic book fan in general, I prefer prose and rate the first Iron Man (2008) as well within my top10 films from the last decade and loved Iron Man 2. Having seen the trailers and felt the build-up for the last several months, I went to the cinema barely able to hold in my excitement. I was bitterly disappointed.This is a strange movie in that there are many excellent elements which are unfortunately lost in a morass of sluggish pacing - I actually said to myself ""I'm bored"" at one point. The pacing issue is mainly due to the entirely unnecessary second act which feels like it's there to give the character some space and realise his potential/clear his head. Unfortunately, it actually just wastes a massive amount of time not really doing anything to forward the plot. The character of Tony Stark, while obviously deeply affected by the events of The Avengers, is completely changed with almost no sign nor hint of the character in the first film. All I can say about this is thank the celluloid gods that we have RDJ at the helm to lend his incredible charisma to the lacklustre plot. Another good point deserving of a whole paragraph to itself: GUY PEARCE! He brilliantly delivers a phenomenal performance which again, helps carry the bloated, lukewarm story and lets the viewer ignore the almost total lack of real back-story for the character. The Mandarin is the biggest disappointment I've encountered since all of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Attempting to avoid spoilers, all I can say is that it's nothing to do with Sir Ben Kingsley whose performance is probably the best in the whole movie, but the way the character is used. The technology, obviously such an enormous aspect of the film, has its role massively changed from that of a tool to almost an annoying hindrance. I recall hearing somewhere a while ago that the new director, Mr Black would take us to a darker, more emotional place with this film. I hadn't expected that the darkness would be literally having many scenes at night and emotions would be people crying. I was expecting great things that would allow us to follow Tony Stark as his Iron Man armours improve and he sorts his head and priorities out. In the case of the former, things have become more flashy for sure, but apparently at the expense of reliability and durability. For the latter, remember the more mature, healthy Tony Stark at the end of The Avengers? Sorry...I would say ""Come back Mr Favreau, all is forgiven"", but he did an amazing job and there's really not much to forgive him for, so I'll just say ""BRING BACK FAVREAU!""Go in to this film with VERY low expectations and you'll be pleased. For those among you who don't care about plot and just want flashy action and SFX, you'll be happy. This is unfortunately not a people-film and there's scarcely enough depth to fill a saucer.Not without bright points, but ultimately such a crushing disappointment.","36 out of 73 found this helpful.

"","","Finally, Iron Man versus the Mandarin","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2793170/?ref_=tt_urv","Affy_Ali","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28092653/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2013","Iron Man Three has the unique distinction of being a part of not just the Iron Man Trilogy, but also of the Marvel Universe in general and has to fit in seamlessly there, while still holding its own as a stand-alone film.Does it perform under such pressures? To a very large degree, yes.The plot follows Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) facing the consequences of his own rash actions in the past, forcing him to take on his biggest enemy yet, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). In the process, Tony goes on a self-discovery journey, makes a few friends and rekindles his spark with Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) Usually, in the third part of a trilogy, it is an obligation to break down the hero before he rises up to discover what he truly is. Keeping this in mind, the physical attacks on Tony Stark are absolutely mind-blowing but the psychological damage on him seems extremely forced and unimpressive.The Trailers showed a few scenes of the destruction of the Stark Mansion, but nothing can prepare you for the visuals that you will end up seeing. Director Shane Black manages to set up a mammoth canvas to paint a rich, vivid and absolutely smashing film.The film deftly switches between the various layers and story lines while being coherent. The action sequences are exemplary and the performances by Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) and Ty Simpkins (Harley the kid) are very good. Gweneth Paltrow has more to do in the movie as does Don Cheadle (Colonel Rhodes aka War Machine aka Iron Patriot). Jon Favreau (Happy Hogan) is also given decent screen space and performs admirably.But, while many factors have worked in its favor, the film suffers from a few flaws as well. The dialog is not as crisp or witty, the laugh out loud moments are few and far apart. Most importantly, the film creates a vicious set up that is let down by an elaborate but weak climax.Also, there remains a nagging thought that Ben Kingsley as Mandarin had the capacity to truly strike fear a la Heath Ledger as The Joker. Instead all he became was a victim of a script twist. Fans of the Comic books will know that Mandarin is the Arch-Nemesis for Iron Man and what becomes of him is extremely disappointing.Still, the film has managed to salvage itself from the debacle that was Iron Man 2 and hats off to Shane Black for creating something of such epic proportions.P.S. One would have wished that the end credits scene contained some reference to the Guardians of the Galaxy Movie or maybe even Ant Man. But its worth the wait, nonetheless.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This holds up very nicely next to the previous 2 installments, and I'd say it's probably better than ""Iron Man 2"" and about the same as the first movie. Here, Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) is haunted by the events of the Avengers and finds himself obsessing over creating and perfecting new suits. He is constantly trying to figure out new way to protect Pepper(Gwyneth Paltrow), and make the suits better and better. Then he placed in the cross hairs of a terrorist called the Mandarin(Ben Kingsley). Going any further than that would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, because there are quite a few surprises and twists, that I didn't see coming at all. Very unconventional super hero movie, which is great because it's a true breathe of fresh air. It's not your typical good guy vs. bad guy movie in a lot of ways. All the performances are great, and it really leaves you with a sense of ""how are they gonna do another one?!"" Marvel is battling a thousand when it comes to their movies and they continue that streak here. This is the first must see movie of the Summer and a great way to kick off the summer movie season. Also, stay after the credits, it's pretty awesome. less","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

They keep trying to find more creative ways for the suit to be put on, but I thought they should have just left it like they put it on in the first Iron Man. My vote for biggest disappointment of the summer thus far.

We have come to take script writers use of this term for granted as if people in real life, folks from decent homes, who are trying to work on the life long process of learning and becoming better human beings, speak this way. As if most of us would not cringe if we heard an adult male ""motivate"" a young boy to action by asking him, ""Do you want to be a pussy?"" At this point in the plot, which is not that far in, I lost immediate total interest, and respect. ""Pussy"" as we all know, is the number two derogatory term for the vulva, next to the humiliating term ""cunt"", which is just as bad as the ""n"" word, yet I bet I would not be able to spell out the ""n"" word, even though there is nothing illegal about it when not used with the intent to intimidate or humiliate. We can use the ""n"" word liberally in our film scripts, just can't spell it out discussing films. Sexism still subsumes racism.But we can spell out ""pussy"" and ""cunt"", not seeing the connection between the epidemic of violence against women as being directly related to the use of hate words to spread an under pinning of misogyny worldwide, as in domestic violence, rape, child brides, female genital mutilation, sex trade, honor killings... yeah, honor. The epidemic of American high school and college girls thinking ""hooking up"" up is liberating, when in fact it is subjugating and humiliating in the long run, sometimes not that long of a run.""Pussy"" means in our culture the female genitalia, in a derogatory, misogynistic fashion. Who can define ""yoni"" by contrast without Googling it? We never hear it.And yet Iron Man can tell a kid not to be a female genitalia, implying females are weaklings. Even if one were to glibly argue that ""pussy"" means ""pussy cat"", every one would snicker. As if felines were not ferocious fighters.I hope other parents talk to their kids about the significance of words and how it shapes our reality. That they too caught Robert Downy Junior using ""don't be a pussy"" to goad on a little boy, and insult our daughters while he was at it. Tsk tsk, Robert, and I just saw you filming in our town.

Gods and aliens exist... how do you deal with that? Well, the President(Sadler, as a passionate, protective man) feels the US needs its own hero, and repaints War Machine with Captain America's color scheme, calling it Iron Patriot(and the first person to ask why it isn't Norman Osborn in there will be slapped silly), and having it work directly for the government... and yes, it's still piloted by Rhodey(Cheadle, truly engaging the buddy dynamic), whose loyalties are thus split between his job and his long-time best friend.And Tony(Downey Jr., completely game, with the charm and snarky arrogance fully intact) has to face the love triangle between him, his obsession with tinkering with his tech, and Pepper(Paltrow again with personality, not a mere fantasy object, a strong female role, toying with the ""damsel in distress"" trope)... the one that matters most to him. He also has to deal with the anxiety he's feeling after fighting off an outer space invasion(and yes, the trailer is accurate: for much of this, he has to rely on his wits, improvising in order to make due... often the best type of story about someone who has enormous responsibility and/or skill. We again have something from his past, yet it feels original again).And from the outside, there is the threat of The Mandarin(Kingsley granting him immense charisma, leading to a presence that is felt whether he is on-screen or not; and yes, we finally have a villain who is there from the very start), who blows up and threatens targets, yet leaving no traces to follow(thus we get comments on the War on Terror, and in general this has the feel of a Tom Clancy thriller, and feels politically relevant, current... without cramming a viewpoint down your throat). Killian(Pearce, an ambitious businessman that can be hard to get a read on) emerges from relative obscurity with the Extremis virus, a substance able to regrow lost limbs, that will become integral to the plot.This is the best of the trilogy. Shane Black brings his style to it, with several elements reminiscent of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and melds them well with this universe - narration, quirk, etc. This rejuvenates the gotten-stale series(note that the overall film franchise did not need it), and clearly, that enthusiasm grips all the actors, as well, who do impeccably, several of them having to span a lot of the spectrum, and doing so flawlessly. The side characters are memorable and credible - be it Happy(Favreau, putting all his energy towards the portrayal of the now chief of security of Potts, with greatly increased paranoia for our amusement), a kid(who gives a truly believable performance)... I could go on.Somehow, this hits the gas on humor even more than they were already doing, and it is hilarious and infinitely quotable. The dialog is fresh, organic and smart. This has a ton of twists and unexpected developments, and rather than confuse matters, they add complexity to otherwise seemingly straightforward endeavors and keep you guessing. The action is huge(cemented by the epic score), exciting(and in spite of the scope, you never lose track of what's going on or become overstimulated) and effectively raises the stakes - the climax is stunning, funny and a fantastically constructed pay-off to everything that has been set up along the way.This is paced immensely well - it has you right from the opening seconds and through the two hours it runs until the ending credits start(and yes, you will want to stay after them!). The 3D is post-conversion, and it's good, not mind-blowing... if you're on a budget, you can forgo that.There is some bloody, tense violence(usually not graphic), a bit of moderate language and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone who is enjoying these(and yes, you will have to have watched the two first ones, as well as The Avengers... on the plus side, there is a lot of respect for continuity between them). 9/10","12 out of 35 found this helpful.

It does the near impossible and that's improve on the first two films. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. The entire journey and entire film is amazing but it's worth mentioning that they build on what worked in The Avengers. Tony's outward displays of bravado and wit have always hidden a deeply troubled and complex character. His demons are always under the surface. They make sure to recall the events of Avengers where this mortal hero faced impossible odds and even death in the darkest of deep space. That would rattle any person and I'm so glad they didn't gloss that over. It adds depth never before seen in these type of films. Tony was deeply affected and is deeply troubled. Now, add a twisted and truly formidable villain presence in Kingley's Mandarin and what they delivered was a movie as good as it gets. I loved the ending and how everything was handled because it can't be what anyone expected! This is without question the BEST film to finish a trilogy that's ever been made.

And we've all probably built up a certain vibe about the movie - that its taking the dark route a.l.a. DC movies. So, if it doesn't end up living up to that vibe that its built around itself, its bound to disappoint viewers, mildly or hugely. Because in this case, the dark route actually seemed like a perfect fit for the third installment.Sample this: After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark suddenly realizes that there are other supremely powerful beings in existence, that he's not alone, and that when compared with the others, he's certainly not the strongest of the bunch. So he develops post-traumatic stress, starts getting anxiety attacks, and in the process has built himself an army of suits - an Iron Legion - all because he just doesn't feel safe anymore. This causes friction between him and everyone else he knows - between him and Pepper and their romance, between him and Rhodey and their friendship, and between him and Happy affecting their bonding. Lots of room for exploration there right ??? Add to that, an emerging terrorist threat in the form of The Mandarin whose organization, The Ten Rings was alluded to in the first movie and you have an opportunity to bring things a full circle. The Mandarin being Iron Man's most prominent foe in comic book legacy only helps.But sadly, it looks like the movie doesn't care to exploit all of these to their fullest. I'm not saying it doesn't use these issues at all, Tony's vulnerabilities are played out brilliantly. Its just that they could have done so much more with this material and the trailers gave us reason after reason to expect that they have that we end up a tad bit dissatisfied or should I say even mildly frustrated. And the pacing of the movie is quite feverish which isn't a problem if the characters are involving enough. But when they keep spurting out one-liners after another with a comic intent, it gets a bit irritating. Again, I'm saying a bit and not hugely irritating.There's no reason to scoff at the movie's production values. In fact, being a Marvel movie, I shouldn't even be commenting on how amazing the visuals are, or with Black at the helm, the action is top-notch. It would simply be wasting characters in this review if details are described. But yes, the airplane crash and the subsequent fall sequence deserves mention - its the only sequence in the movie that gave me real goosebumps. I'd say that sequence makes up for some of the movie's flaws never mind the brief duration that it last's for.Downey is at the top of his game here. He plays a more mature, sensible and disturbed Stark unlike the jolly good alcoholic of the previous movies. However he does retain his sense of humor which is good in a way but not so good when done excessively. The girls get little screen time but give in their best. As for the bad guys, they're all effective and any further comments on their performance would mean spoiling a big twist in the movie.With Iron Man 3, Marvel's Phase II has begun. And while this may not be the best of starts, its certainly not a bad one by any means. A little bit of fine tuning and even sticking to the vibe the trailers projected would have made this movie a serious force to bicker or reckon with. As it is though, Iron Man 3 is a pretty decent summer flick. Just don't expect anything extraordinary out of it.I was about to give it a 7, but I'll raise the score by 0.5 for Downey's performance and for the airplane sequence.Score: 7.5 / 10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Upon exiting the theatre I heard some people complaining that the film differed from the source material and weren't very happy. That being said as someone uninfluenced by those standards I thought the film was great! Director Shane Black of the fantastic and criminally under seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang takes the helm with appreciated results. Jon Favereau fared well the first two creating a grandiose, sarcastic, sassy mouthed but fantastical universe filled with big characters people have loved spending time with. The first one is still the best in my opinion, it lost a little luster in the sequel but this follow up entry brings the franchise into it's smaller, more character driven roots which is much appreciated and changes the overall effect. The film humanizes Tony Stark played by the lovably jerky Robert Downy Jr. as he lashes out at a terrorist and suffers the consequences when he is attacked at home. Most of his equipment is destroyed and his girlfriend Pepper is nearly killed. Presumed dead by the public he moves ahead trying to solve the villains mystery and begin to rebuild his machinery so to speak. There's lots of clever quips and even emotionally resonant add ons. the humor is there for the most part but doesn't feel as funny but the action sequences are truly breathtaking. And there is finally a kick ass character arc for Pepper Potts played with a seductive ferocity by Gwyneth Paltrow. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the original material or even if it makes all that much sense but it is grade A entertainment and most of all it shows that the franchise is growing in a more adult direction a brave act in a slew of constant cinematic immaturity. 3.5/5","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Special effects were great, action scenes were good and the whole tone didn't seems so cheezee as in the second movie.Overall, Iron Man 3 is an entertaining movie which does not drag, had a great action and better story as well as writing then the lackluster 2nd part. Fun movie all around.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

More humor here, which the 2nd lacked, lots of action, better villains. Downey clearly loves playing the role and Paltrow holds up her end of the deal but is still looking silly teetering around on 6-inch heels. There's nothing really new here. Same general story line, which has become a bit boring. So if you're after some action, can't go wrong, but if you're looking for something new and fresh, go elsewhere.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes, there have been exceptions to the rule: Marvel's The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman, The Dark Knight quickly come to mind, as does the original Ironman. But in general for me, most comic book action fantasies are of the black and white variety: the good guys vs. crazed villains, plots to take over the world vs. plans to save it, the evildoer almost destroying our hero who makes a triumphant comeback, the CGI constantly overwhelming the real stunt work. Yes, the formula is set and hardly ever detours from its goal. Which brings us to the third installment of the Ironman franchise, which is more of the same one can expect from this genre, but also a rare commodity that adds some grayer tones to the story with its wry and cynical humor, its stronger character development, and a crowd- pleasing performance by its lead actor, Robert Downey, Jr. ÔøºThe formulaic plot of Ironman 3 goes like this: Our flawed and egotistical playboy Tony Stark dons the Ironman suit once again to stop world domination (and for some personal revenge, or course). With the aid of his loyal friend, Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and his trusty girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), at his side, Stark fights evil in the form of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a madman who regularly interrupts the airwaves threatening the annihilation of world order. Also on hand are a rich entrepreneur named Aldrich Killlian (well played by Guy Pearce) who must have an ulterior motive and Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, a scientist who must supply some more conflict. This leads to various action set pieces that tend to wow the audience and give that special adrenalin rush to today's movie-going audience. These action sequences vary in success due to the frenzied editing and too many close-ups that interfere with the action. (One exception is an especially thrilling segment involving an air rescue mission to save falling passengers that is beautifully staged.)ÔøºSolidly directed by Shane Black, Ironman 3 essentially remains escapist pop entertainment. But with the world a-changing, reality is beginning to add a darker tone to the mayhem on the screen. The era of lively pop extravaganza is beginning to lose some of its color. Just how far can you escape from the horrors of terrorism, death, and violence these days, with the on-going epidemic of sadism and brutality we now witness on a daily basis? With so many images of 9/11, the Boston Marathon bombing, and ransom serial shootings plaguing our consciousness, can we now be immune to the real life senselessness of killing, even if this PG rated film sanitizes the gore by showing very little bloodshed? Can we allow ourselves to be so desensitized to the carnage in the form of entertainment for an hour or two? ÔøºThe filmmakers seem to have taken too many liberties in updating the source and giving it a modern slant, profiling the enemy to be Middle Eastern. Black deliberately changes the ethnicity of the main villain from the original comic book source. (Perhaps the Chinese backers of the film objected.) This new Mandarin, much younger in the comic book version and without any superpowers in this film, has even aged to resemble Osama Ban Laden and this uncomfortable image plus the film's more serious point of view grounds the film in the real world. Granted the successful Ironman franchise has always had a realistic edge to its comic book trappings. But now reality has reared its ugly head. Explosions are a commonplace occurrence and destruction without consequence is everywhere in Ironman 3. (This film made me seriously question at what price do we pay for entertainment value nowadays.)That said, the film has some assets amid some missteps, from its fine production values and its inspired casting. Downey and Paltrow continue to have the right chemistry between them, even if the script by Drew Pearce and the director gets a bit wobbly at times. Transitions between the narrative exposition and the gung-ho warfare and gadgetry became tedious and dull. An unfortunate amount of time is spent with a cute tyke at the midway point that might appeal to the pre-teen set but slows down the film's momentum. Also, while Guy Pearce brings the perfect sense of deranged danger to his character, Kingsley makes some unusual choice with his vocal delivery which I found more off-putting than menacing. (He sometimes sounded like a high-pitched Walter Cronkite.) Ironman 3 is a well-made Hollywood blockbuster that totally engages its audience with some powerful images, strong acting, and even has a twist or two to convert any naysayers. ( The ""surprising"" twists didn't surprise me at all.) Still, I personally needed more fantasy in my escapism, a further leap from the harsh reality of our world that this film was unable to give me. In retrospect, maybe the black and white extremes of past efforts are better than the grayer shades on view. I guess today's superheroes do have it even tougher after all. GRADE: B-","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'll assume that 'part 3' (not including the Avengers) won't be people's first helping of Iron Man lore and they'll probably have a shrewd idea of what to expect from the previous episodes.However, the film-makers have decided to go in a slightly different direction with this one. I can see their point. It may have felt a bit 'samey' to have yet another villain wearing a suit of armour to battle our sarcastic hero Tony Stark, so they decided to downplay the suits of armour for the better part of the movie. Instead they focused more on 'the man' himself, utilising his deductive powers, rather than just blasting baddies with his lasers.And, to be blunt, while some people loved it, others hated it. So if you're looking for yet another superhero movies with larger than life baddies and plenty of high-tech, suit-wearing, destructive action, you may feel a little cheated. There is plenty of action (and a suitably explosive climax), but a lot of it involves more hand to hand fighting from Stark.Personally, I thought it was quite a refreshing turn for a superhero film. Tony Stark always has been and always will be, Iron Man. If I just want to see him in the suit itself, I have parts 1 and 2 to watch. Nice to see something different. Roll on part 4 (and the Avengers 2).","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Picture was perfect in its 2d release and I suppose that there won't be much upgrades in its 3d version. Gwynneth Paltrow was decent, but still wasn't as good as Downey. Ben Kingsley was perfect! His British humour made all the minutes he appears on screen to move the whole theatre into laughter! All the battle scenes were amazing and most of them made me stare on the screen and leave my pop-corn and cola for later! Having watched the two initial films a week ago I really had into my mind to see whether a third installment on the franchise was needed. Well, ""Iron Man 3"" is the best film of the trilogy and I dare to say that it was better than most of other superhero movies. I'm really looking forward for the next film with Iron Man!!!! Till then I'll watch The Avengers!!!","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

"","","Iron Man 3 truly finishes this particular trilogy on the highest quality note possible.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2787990/?ref_=tt_urv","home_run_twins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5134662/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2013","The first Iron Man was a pleasant surprise to most everyone. Iron Man 2 was a bit of a prologue to The Avengers and part of why it was good and part of why it rubbed some people the wrong way. Iron Man 3 now takes what worked from those two films and, frankly, does it better. Right now, I'm calling this one the best of the three.Why? Well, first and foremost the writing in Iron Man 3 delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 3 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. How Tony and company reacted to certain thing is what resulted in the audience going along for the ride. They did that perfectly in this sequel. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they did a great job. Just like Avengers, Iron Man 3 delivers some of the best scenes out of any action film that I've seen in years.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

"6","/10","After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping and having anxiety attacks.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2793833/?ref_=tt_urv","bravelybravesirrobin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7472798/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2013","The Iron Man series of films has a couple of key strengths that put it just ahead of other super hero movies: Robert Downey Junior, the character of Tony Stark and snarky banter. Robert Downey Junior is delightful to watch as Tony Stark quipping his way through life, cracking jokes and just generally being effortlessly cool. He's a lot more fun to be with than brooding tortured souls like Batman, Spider-Man or the Hulk.The producers of the series know this too and so in the third installment of the franchise they give the audience exactly what we want, lots of Tony Stark being glib, making jokes and being charming. Bringing in Shane Black (writer of Lethal Weapon and director of Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang which is another Robert Downey Junior quip fest) was a great decision in this vein as the man knows how to delivery good banter.But whilst the dialogue was always the best part of the previous films it wasn't the only aspect necessary to make Iron Man 1, 2 and the Avengers work. For all his glibness Tony Stark as a character has depth. He's a conflicted character using his bravado to mask real feelings of inadequacy, of losing control of his life and fear of death. This film seems aware that it has to have a character arc for Tony Stark but it forgets to have one. It starts well. In fact the set-up is great. After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping, kept awake at night by nightmares of how he nearly died stopping the alien threat and haunted in the day by hallucinations and anxiety attacks. With his best weapon, his mind, seemingly fracturing two threats emerge. One a terrorist with unclear aims but seemingly immense power named the Mandarin, and the other a mistake from his past in the form of a biomechanical virus named Extremis. In short order Tony is stripped of his home, his supporting cast and even his Iron Man armour. Now the only tool he has left to fight back with is his mind, and he may be slowly losing that too.That is a brilliant first act with just two problems.Firstly that's the start of Iron Man 1 with Tony kidnapped and forced to use his wits to escape. Spoilers, he builds a suit of armour and kicks ass. Further spoilers, that does not happen in this film. Secondly, and more importantly, all of that set up gets tossed away haphazardly in the second act. Tony gets a pep talk from a cute kid and suddenly decides, okay, no more PTSD. There isn't any pay off. It's like the film knows it has to get rid of that stuff so we can have our big fight in the third act but can't think of a satisfying way to do so, so it just drops it.The psychological set up isn't the only thing that's jettisoned either. The most glaring example of this problem is the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic in the early scenes; a terrifying and enigmatic presence that literally interrupts the film to deliver ominous warnings of doom. He's tremendously scary and the audience is eager to learn more about him. Then the second act undercuts all of that with a reveal that, whilst hilarious, leaves a gaping hole where the antagonist should be. Guy Pearce's mad scientist character Aldrich Killian suddenly has to step in and be the bad guy but he doesn't have the charisma or the personality to carry it. That's no slight on Guy Pearce by the way it's a fault with the script. We just don't get enough time with Killian to care when he suddenly becomes the big bad.The suit is another, similar, problem. At the start of the film Tony gets separated from his Iron Man armours and has to make do with a malfunctioning prototype. Now, unlike the other problematic aspects this one does build on the set-up. Tony has to use improvised weapons and his fast mouth to deal with physical threats until his armour is repaired. All of this builds up to Tony getting back in the suit and kicking righteous butt in the third act. And it does.The problem is they then proceed to do it again, and again. Tony gets suit, loses suit, gets suit. In fact the final battle is literally Tony getting into one suit after another as each breaks down or gets destroyed in turn. I know that the aim is to literalise the theme of Tony having to rebuild himself but the effect is just one big cinematic cock tease. Your film is called Iron Man, a significant part of the appeal of your film is seeing the man in the robot suit hitting things; get to the money shot people!Despite my complaints it's not a bad film by any means. I enjoyed it more than Iron Man 2 (which was a bloated overcrowded mess) and there's a lot to like. I loved the banter. I loved the multiple armour designs in the final fight. I loved the stunt with the people falling from the plane. I really, really loved Gary. It's just frustrating that there's one third of a truly great film here that gets sabotaged by its own plot twists.Flawed but enjoyable.

The fights scenes can be quite good but others can be awkward and hard to follow the final fight in particular however is really great the choreography and cinematography in the final fight is amazing to watch.

This movie was overall better than 2. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark with even more cool gadgets for his iron man suits. This movie takes place after the Avengers and there are a few flashbacks referencing it from Tony's PTSD.The villain this time is the Mandarin, a violent world-threatening terrorist, played by Ben Kinglsey. Without giving too much away, he targets Tony and makes his life miserable. I actually though the Mandarin was a weak villain though. Some people may not like what they end up doing with him either. Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle return as Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. War Machine returns and is also now called Iron Patriot. I liked both characters more in this movie than the other 2 and they have more important roles here. Pepper is in the first act, then disappears for a long time, then returns in the third act and I like what they did with her character. The movie is the darkest in tone of the trilogy, because of how Tony's world falls apart around him, but there is still a lot of funny dialogue and banter between characters, like in the other 2. A lot of this movie concerns Tony Stark only, not Iron Man. But the good thing is that Tony is not a total jerk like in the previous movie, he actually has a heart and tries to connect with people and help save the day.A few complaints I have are that the movie lags a bit in the middle, but not to a crawling pace. War Machine/Iron Patriot makes a few appearances but barely does anything. There are several plot twists in this movie, some I liked, some I didn't, like what they did with the Mandarin. The weapons that the Mandarin creates are completely unrealistic to me and seem like they belong in an entirely different movie. Also, he 3d was just OK, but not quite as good as I expected.Overall the movie works. It's a good summer film (taking place at Christmas) and mostly delivers what it promises. If you liked the second one then you'll definitely like this one.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Third, the idea used in the story line seems stolen from another movie, whose name i won't like to reveal as it may become a spoiler, maybe.

Iron Man 3 is a movie to watch to be entertained... period. I am not expert of the superhero mythology, so I cannot have an opinion on that. The plot start at some point in time after the events where the Avengers save the world in NYC. Yes, there are some development on the character of Tony Stark.. that self-centered, egocentric, and eccentric billionaire that Mr Downey Jr. has played so well on the previous three movies ( including The Avengers), he will realize even when he is Iron Man, he's still human, so the lesson that he will learn is that being in the limelight does have a cost, and sometimes that cost might affect and even make you lose the people around you. I do think this is the movie of the series that have tried ( because not all are good) to exploit the joke element the most..I let you be the judged of that. I still do think that the first movie is the best. As for the villain? well, personally I think for entertaining purposes and my personal rating, that's exactly why this one does not rate better for me , and once again, personally, the worst of the villains Iron Man has faced so far...why? simple...they never explained the reason WHY he do it, plus a big disappointed for me when Tony finally faces The Mandarin. If you enjoyed the previous two, would you be disappointed on the third? Absolutely not, but you might step out of the theather sharing one of the more repeated commentary on all movie blockbuster sagas since Star Wars : ""It was good, but the first one is still the best for me""- Enjoy.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The struggle that Tony experiences around his loss of the suit throughout most of the movie provide evidence of the actual hero being Tony and not the suit. The plot is okay but it overall isn't even addressed too often because the writing is meant to make way for the development of Tony during his final solo film. The villain is good at creating scenarios for Tony to prove himself however he is pretty surface level. I will reiterate once more that although the movie as a movie for the most part is not too great, the scenes when Tony is stuck without his suit provide more character development in a meaningful way than any other scene in any Marvel film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's the MCU, you have to expect that, so most people tend to give the Mandarin thing a wide breath.Sure, it was a disappointment, but not as big as fans make it out to be. It's the MCU, they are working in Feature Films not TV, you can't really make an epic villain out of anyone you know has to be knocked off and will never come back all in under 3 hours.So, why not warp him to fit the plot? 2) The people that want Iron Man and not Stark. From reading the bad reviews one gets the impression that people hate this because it isn't ALL IRON MAN ALL THE TIME.Stark isn't constantly suited up, and in fact, he wears it probably less than in any other movie.So the lack of CGI Iron Man action is going to garner a lot of distaste in some viewers.3) The people that like a balance between Stark and Iron Man, the story over action crowd.Not that this installment doesn't have action, but the action revolves around Stark and not Iron Man. It's good, but it's a total Stark story and one that develops his character nicely. What Iron Man 2 lacked in heart, Iron Man 3 made-up for.How are you going to like the movie? Well, that depends on who you are and how much you want to weigh one thing against the other. For Shane Black fans though, it totally works.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This story complexity enhances the overall experience for me, but it's still just a glorious action-packed comic-book romp at heart, and so it's kind of hard to take it ALL that seriously. Screenwriters Drew Pearce and Shane Black (who also directed) certainly don't do anything to discourage that attitude, either.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), depicted as unaccustomedly angst-ridden over Earth's near- miss in last summer's The Avengers, bookends the film with motormouth talk therapy about his inability to sleep and anxiety attacks. These beset him at plot-convenient points in the movie but otherwise are far from crippling when it really matters, certainly not interfering with snappy sarcastic lines at every opportunity.The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is a suitably menacing bad guy in the Evil Emperor of the Universe mold, but he's not everything he appears to be. His main attributes are the ability to take control of all TV channels in America at once (something Rupert Murdoch would pay gigabux to acquire), a combination Burning Hands and Cure Serious Wounds spell, utter ruthlessness, and a flair for hammy theatrics. Again, not to be taken seriously.In addition to his loyal and super-competent aides, the human Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the AI Jarvis (voice of Paul Bettany), Tony Stark may (or may not) be able to count on 2 figures from his past, who pitched innovative ideas at him during his devil-may-care playboy days when he was partying like it was 1999 (because it was): biological researcher Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and fellow inventor/entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They went on to succeed in their respective fields without the aid of Stark Industries, but they seem kind of taken with the idea of teaming up to save the world from malicious evildoers, since it got such good press in 2012.If you follow pro football at all, you know that there's been a lot of concern over player concussions, even despite helmets. These happen either when a fast-moving player is stopped suddenly and the brain bangs into the inside of the skull, or when a relatively stationary skull takes a hard smack and whacks into the brain. Either way, even if the hard outer shell remains intact and unscathed, the vulnerable squishy parts inside take the damage and pay the price. This fundamental fact of physical biology is utterly, utterly ignored in Iron Man 3. As are many other laws of science. As if anyone really cares.Did I mention Project Extremis? The White House plot? Iron Patriot? The many cameo appearances? The Exxon Valdez manque? The self-propelled armor elements? Harley, the cute little boy from Rose Hill, Tennessee, with the instincts of a future Tony Stark? Miss Elk Ridge? The rocket attack on not-at-all stately Stark Mansion? The chain-skydiving aerial rescue? Yeah, they managed to cram all that into the 2:11 running time, too. Man, you can see where they spent the money, and you sure get your OWN money's worth.Imax totally worth it; 3-D (conversion) not, but you get the 3-D if you go with the Imax, so there you are.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Luckily, for Iron Man 3 I have two other movies of the exact same type available, so that makes it easier. Unluckily, this is by far the worst film in the series. It doesn't mean it's very bad, just that it fails comparatively.The story is that a vicious terrorist appears to ""teach lessons"" to the American president and the US in general. All nice and beautiful, but before presenting this plot, it starts with Stark reminiscing about the past and presenting two major players. If it weren't for that, one would have kept asking oneself what is going on and kept a bit of the thrill on instead of guessing the plot from the get go.Afterwards, Iron Man gets his ass kicked. The manner is so simplistic an naive that it raises doubts about the entire franchise. Barely escaping he meets a kid that helps him out. Actually, that was the best part of the film. The kid story and their interaction was what saved this movie from being total special effects cr*p.Then the true horror is revealed with something so unlikely or believable that it made me laugh. You see, for terror and revenge, the villain has advanced the human race a few steps in its evolution and concomitantly solved any energy issues the world has ever had. Then Iron Man kicks his ass. Why?The ending was totally horrible, as a continuation of the start. Same lame voice explaining things, Stark realising he is the man and then a funny scene at the end, after the credits, which is not that funny.I have high hopes for Iron Man 4, though, as the villain can only be the biggest enemy of Starks: George R. R. Martin! Meanwhile, this film was weak.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Anyways, Iron Man 3 picks up after the events of Avengers: ""what happened in New York"", as the movie refers to that movie. I know there's a lot of every-which-way hype over this movie already but hopefully I can navigate my way through that and just give my unaffected view.But let's get down to brass tax, Iron Man 3 is an Iron Man movie, for better or worse. For me, mostly for worse because that FIRST trailer, (and none of the ones after it) promised a much edgier tone, and a finally not on-top-of-the-world Stark, giving the series a vitally necessary change of pace. I'm not saying I wanted The Dark Knight or anything, just something with more gravitas and a little less fizz. And the film dismisses the notion almost immediately. Yes, Tony does have some post-traumatic stress/sleep-deprivation stuff going on here, but it's not treated with any measure of depth or significance. Like everything else in the film, (EVERYthing, the characters, the plot, the fight scenes), it's treated as a throwaway gag, and has one of the most laughable half-baked resolutions I have ever seen for any plot arc. And lets face it, the mile-a-minute barrage of repartee-esque dialogue, and the infamous glib Stark one-liners which were so fresh and fun back when Iron Man came out... are all really tired and stale now; and that's pretty much the first half-hour of this movie.Once the film kicks into summer movie gear, it becomes an insipidly endless barrage of self-referential humor, broad slapstick, and lots (and LOTS) of noisy, flashy set pieces. And I'm not some action-hater or anything. I loved The Avengers. I just found the throw-downs in this overly bombastic, not particularly interesting, and pervasively noisy. That's not to say there weren't moments then and again that I thought were cool or found somewhat amusing, they were just drowned out by the rest.Iron Man 3 feels and plays much more like G.I Joe than any marvel movie. That especially goes for the ludicrous plot that stole it's villain origin story from an animated kidpic from ten years ago, it's baddies from (yes) G.I. Joe, and The Terminator, (sooooo Terminator, oh my gosh!!) and every clich√©' from every buddy action flick ever. I feel like somebody's gonna be like ""NO! that's cuz it was a throwback, look at who directed it jerk!"". But when your plot is derivative AND ridiculous... yeah, that's all.Some people will definitely enjoy IM 3 just fine. It's certainly one of the most ambitious superhero films thus far in terms of the amount and scale of action. But I would say, even Thor was much better as a movie because of its solid script and well-drawn characters. (Avengers miraculously managed to have both).Iron Man 3 is a mediocre film, which I happened to see coming off another mediocre film...so there's that. But my overall opinion stands that it's garish excess, endless self-referential commentary, and disregard of potentially interesting plot elements, (not to mention some completely squandered characters) renders it an underwhelming film-going experience. It might just be me, but I find ""good"" films to be entertaining. But oh well... it's gonna make sh**-loads. Oh I forgot to mention: my favorite part of the movie... Jon Favreau!! Did anyone else notice his unmistakably Vincent Vega getup in the first scene?? **/*****","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The storyline is great, and actually a bit more interesting than others among these marvel superhero movies. Yet, it's ability to draw excitement is a bit watered down by the lack of Iron Man actually using his skills and the constant precense of jokes. Don't get me wrong - the jokes are good, and the movie itself is very laughable. Nevertheless, its hard to take a movie that is meant to thrill you seriously when much of is taken a sort of ironic distance to. It's as if the movie doesn't take itself seriously. But I must admit, that i did indeed like this movie and I can't help admiring every minute of Robert Downey Jr. playing this lovable asshole. Not to mention Guy Pearce's excellent acting as the total, yet tragic asshole. When it all comes down this movie is not the most thrilling experience, but it has good humour and some redeeming action scenes and actors. I would have given it a 7/10 but i am so much of an Iron Man fan that i can't help it but give this movie an 8/10.

Iron Man 3 at leats did not kil Iron Man and itr finished the trilogy perfectly. I am glad Shane Black replaced the director Jon Favreau who ruined the sequel and didn't know what to do with the movie. I love this movie and it is one of my favorites MCU films. I love it more than the last ""Iron Man"" movie The third entry of Iron Man is a decent kick-ass bad-ass action film. There is a ton of action in there. The characters are better developments. Iron Man 3 is MILES way better than Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame and Ant-Man and the Wasp!!!!!!!!! Those movies suck I don't like em. I love this movie so much I have a blast watching it.Gwyneth Paltrow was more supporting girlfriend than she was in Iron Man 2, she wasn't so annoying like she was in the last Iron Man movie. I love her performance in this movie so much. This is the last time we see her in any superhero movie she only appeared in one scene in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) Mandarian was an okay and as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The movie is set after the events of ""The Avengers"" after New York and Tony Stark is fallen to pieces suffering post-Avengers PTSD, Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark is called upon to stop a bomb-happy terrorist known as the Mandarin, as well a mad scientist who has used the experimental regenerative drug he created to build an army of powerful mutant humans, and who is now threatening to kill Tony's sweetheart, Pepper Potts.More entertaining, better story, good Special Effects CGI. The last good Iron Man movie almost good as the first one. I also don't understand the negative reviews. Shane Black directed well action MARVEL fun popcorn film that is also intrigue thriller and different from the first movie. I have enjoy this movie a lot and I had fun with it. This is not Lethal Weapon, Die Hard With A Vengeance, Terminator 2: Judgment Day or Aliens it is an own movie about dark fantasy and a different science fiction film filled with action. Even tough Stark and Rhodey are both in that ship without their armored that doesn't mean they look like Murtaugh and Riggs or McClane and Carver the story is different.I for once have enjoyed the helicopter action sequences which were bad-ass. Attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! That was so bad.-ass action all Stark's suits were destroyed. I love the opening scene on New Year Eve in 1999 in which we see Tony Stark for the first time been selfish and arrogant person he was in the first Iron Man. We see Yinsen (Shaun Toub) how they met this deals with a prequel from the first movie. Yes I enjoy this movie more than any other MRAVEL film it so bad.-ass. The movie is set on Christmas Eve, reminds me on Batman Returns there was a kid Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy in which helps to repair his suit Mark 42. He wasn't annoying kid. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene.The main bad guy is Aldrich Killian great performance from Guy Pearce who previously played in Christopher Nolan's Memento. I thought Aldrich Killian was brilliant mad scientist who participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Guy Pearce played a great bad guy Aldrich Killian, he was right from the comic books. To mask his illegal activities as a terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin"" portrayed by the British actor Trevor Slattery to serve as his proxy, unaware that the Mandarin truly existed. He also conspired with Vice President Rodriguez in an attempt to take control over both the United States of America and the War on Terror, manipulating them for his own profit. Miguel Ferrer as Vice President is also in this movie he was in RoboCop (1987).Extremis are super soldiers who are impossible to stop. I hated it the Mandarian joke too and the twist around but I accept it they way it is. Aldrich Killian developed that program Extremis with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who was also love interest of Tony Stark for one stand. Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen plotted revenge for years on Tony Stark. Great performance from Rebecca Hall.I disagree with the haters about this movie I have enjoy it from the begging till end. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is a nice fellow guy he promoted this movie and I saw him how good he was with kids he was so nice on his movie Iron Man 3. Don Cheadle as War Machine was much better than he was in the last Iron Man movie. The action sequences on the end of the movie looks like in Terminator 2: Judgment Day in a steel mill sequence while on here was on the docks on a ship. If you see Pepper Potts falling down in to the fire you see Tony Stark goes to do what he has to do, to stop Aldrich Killian as he put more suits on him self.Was a good ending of the trilogy I have enjoy it, it is my favorite MCU MILES way better movie than ""The Dark Knight Rises"".","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tony Stark, the self proclaimed playboy, billionaire, philanthropist is in somewhat of a rut after the monumental events of The Avengers. He can't sleep, and when he does has haunting flashbacks of that day in Manhattan. What's worse, a new terrorist called The Mandarin emerges and induces more country spread panic for the Americans, whilst Aldrich Killian comes back for a spot of oneupmanship, with his new invention, the Extremis serum. The creative journey taken by Black and Marvel with Stark is a smart one. In stripping back the armour (literally), they have not only rid the franchise of Iron Man 2's flaws, but also brought the focus well and truly back in their most powerful of weapons: Robert Downey Jr. Whereas in Iron Man 2 a certain complacency was evident in his performance, Downey completely eradicates that with an honest, vulnerable and achingly human performance, with his trademark wit and sarcasm very much present and correct. His seemingly new found energy and drive for the franchise is compounded by the terrific supporting cast. Gyneth Paltrow once again proves a welcome presence, and her natural chemistry with Downey is made all the more shiny by the superb script; the actors here get the best dialogue to deliver of the whole franchise, and it is obvious the difference it has made. Ben Kingsley, in the trickiest role, proves very successful, with his menacing and surprising turn proving to be one of the major rewards of the film (and THAT twist will be a talking point for years to come. Off the record, I absolutely adored it.) Of the newcomers, though, it is Guy Pearce who makes the biggest impact, with a charismatic, threatening and wholly satisfying performance as Aldrich Killian, head honcho of think tank AIM. Don Cheadle seems to have settled in his much more defined and driven role of Rhodes, now with him being the straight Glover to Downey's Gibson, a genius decision from Black. The most impressive thing at play here is balance. Writers Black and Pearce have created a sharp, witty and quite frankly hilarious script that feels fresh and original. They have brought back the off beat energy irreverent tone that made the first one such a blast. Gone are the plodding and leaden sub plots of the first sequel, and in comes a masterfully constructed rug pulling narrative; the perfect foundation to build on Marvel's most frivolous and entertaining character. Not only this, but IM3 marks the evolution of Marvel from a risk assessing, cautious world builder to a brash and brilliant risk taker. It seems in every sense that Marvel and Black have embraced and embodied the very attitude of Tony Stark. A welcome playfulness is present in Black's script writing; a mid act introduction of a child being the most convention-smashingly inspired, allowing Downey to show his remarkably adaptable and chameleon like range. He is able, in a blink of an eye, to go from vulnerable to lip-smackingly confident. Don't be concerned, Black avoids clich√© with some brilliantly judged moments in this mid-act tone changer (on child revealing his abandonment, 'Dads leave, quit being such a pussy about it'). The emotion is never a sacrifice for the gags though, with the threat of The Mandarin and the vulnerability of Stark being ever present and constantly reminded of, even if at times the film runs the risk of being too gleefully irreverent. The script's accomplished smarts don't stop there, with Pearce and Black also managing to play on the damsel in distress plot device (is Pepper the saved or in fact the savior?), whilst also providing wholly satisfying and engaging arcs for its characters. Inevitably, though, the journey of Tony is the most thematically and emotionally satisfying, possibly of the whole Marvel canon.A recurring criticism of both IM and IM2 was the uninspiring and repetitive action, with IM2 being undoubtedly the biggest offender. Simply put, two dudes in varying types of suits fighting each other isn't very interesting, nor is watching Iron Man kill hundreds of clone robots with one single swivel at all thrilling. IM3 solves this problem with aplomb, and then some. This is in no small part down to the ingenious use of Stark's mark 42, which can, on command, send its components flying onto Stark's body, allowing for hilarious slapstick and some genuinely tense set pieces. In fact, every action sequence in IM3 hits the spot; highlights being a Tom Clancy-esque action ballet executed flawlessly by an out of suit Stark, or the thrilling climax, which makes brilliant use of Tony's over-zealous amount of suits whilst offering further surprises and heart in the mouth moments. Iron Man 3 succeeds in all counts, meaning that we are left pining for Downey to sign another contract already. Oh, and be sure to stay for the hilarious post credits sequence.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Though apart from the Nolan's series of Batman even the same masked Bruce Wayne is a superhero who performs unbelievable things (may be thats why they are superheros)Coming back to the movie, I just wonder if the script had enough depth in it. Characters like Pepper could have been done better. May be a bad choice of actor. The expectation on Mandarin is kept the movie going with the presence of a great actor. But it too went nothing when we saw Guy was the original brain behind it. Now coming to the best part of the film, The graphics and stunts. It has been the best part like I said, because of the commitment of all the artist. But still once again another movie with a climax in a port and earth movers. At the bottomline, Iron Man remains a Superhero. He will never become a legend like the Nolan's Batman.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

There were thoughts in the mind that whether Shane Black will be able to do justice with the massive movie but he gives the movie a fresh feeling.The movie is purely entertaining movie with action, drama, comedy with a pinch of emotion.As far as acting is concerned Robert Downey Jr. has mastered himself in the role of ironman so beautifully that sometimes it feels that he is the real ironman. Gwyneth Paltrow and Guy Pearce were just amazing but the best character of the movie is Ben Kingsley who portrays his role with pure perfection.Overall if you are looking for an action packed superhero movie with some of the spectacular stunts this is the movie for you and a must watch for all the MCU fans.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My initial reaction upon seeing this opening day was that some fan boys are not going to be happy. Of course, this happens every time Hollywood makes changes to the original comic book material in hopes of attracting massive box office numbers. While I recognize many of the ""flaws"", I found this to be an interesting turn on the Tony Stark/Iron Man series.Shane Black was brought in to direct and help write the script. Mr. Black is best known for his crackling buddy dialogue in movies like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also with Robert Downey Jr), but doesn't have significant directorial experience (his most recent effort was KKBB 5 years ago). My belief has always been that what sets this franchise apart is Robert Downey Jr's take on Tony Stark. A wise-cracking billionaire playboy technology and mechanical genius searching for his true identity. Mr. Black re-focuses the story on Stark. In fact, he basically takes everything away and has him start over.Regardless of the story, many line up for these movies to see the special effects and the bad guys. The special effects are everywhere ... and loud ... and massive. The trailer shows a clip of Stark's Malibu mansion being destroyed, but the entire segment is quite impressive. The number of Iron Man suits seems unlimited at times and the big finale gave me the same feeling of a 4th of July fireworks display when it ends with so many clumps of fireworks being fired at once, that the impact is dulled. As for the bad guys, The Mandarin is one of the most fierce opponents faced by Iron Man in the comics. His portrayal here by Ben Kingsley is a blast to watch, but will undoubtedly upset the true fanboys. Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a demented mastermind, once snubbed by Stark - in a scene we witness in flashback.My preference here is to focus on the fun elements since that's clearly what Marvel and Black are shooting for. Jon Favreau directed the first two entries in the franchise and here takes on a slightly bigger role as head of security for the Stark corporation ... and he provides some comic relief. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally gets to do more than roll her eyes, but she still has her damsel in distress moments. Don Cheadle returns as Col. Rhodes ... or War Machine ... now known as Iron Patriot, but mostly he is just waiting for his own movie. Rebecca Hall has some screen time as a smart woman who is not so wise in her choosing of partners. No comment. Ty Simpkins plays Harley, a country boy who helps Stark in his time of need. James Badge Dale, Miguel Ferrer, William Sadler, and Dale Dickey all have strong moments, but therein lies what may be the film's biggest weakness.It's an incredibly impressive film to watch ... giant visuals, really good actors and quick, witty dialogue. But there seems to be an overload of each of these things. Guy Pearce's character is woefully underdeveloped. I so wanted more of his backstory and motivation. Same with Harley, the boy. Much could have been done with that. Miguel Ferrer, always a worthy opponent, must have had his best scenes left in editing. The scene with Ben Kingsley, Don Cheadle and Robert Downey Jr, may have been the best in the movie simply because we got a real peak at each of these character's personality. That's way more fun that another explosion! The film pummels us with action, probably has too much Tony Stark and too little Iron Man for the fanboys, throws in a hard-to-swallow sub-plot regarding Anxiety issues for Stark, and underutilizes Guy Pearce in what could have been a world class evil doer. Still, despite all of that, it's fun to watch and Robert Downey Jr will always be Iron Man!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Tony Stark returns in the best 'Iron Man' yet","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2791518/?ref_=tt_urv","DubhDoo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29045991/?ref_=tt_urv","2 May 2013","Following a film like 'The Avengers' for is no easy feat for even one of the most successful film franchises around today. After becoming the biggest box office smash of 2012 (taking over a billion in little more than a week) and garnering unanimously positive reviews, it was undeniable that 'The Avengers' successor would come with high expectations, as not only is 'Iron Man 3' following 'The Avengers', but it also marks the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase One and the beginning of the series' Phase Two. After the disappointingly flat 'Iron Man 2', Jon Favreau left the chair (while keeping his acting role as Happy Hogan) and passed it on to 'Lethal Weapon' scribe Shane Black. Any doubts of Iron Man continuing on the poor quality of the first sequel swiftly exit the premises, because it is clear - that like Joss Whedon ‚Äì Shane Black has expertly taken the source material in his hands and placed a big personal stamp all over it. Of course this means that we are treated to a cracking script that brims with sparkling one-liners that feature some great references to everything from Croydon to 'Downtown Abbey'), but there is also a real sense of human depth and development to the characters more than ever before. And being a Shane Black film, it is set at Christmas. 'Iron Man 3' finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) experiencing PTSD after the events in ""New York"" at the end of 'The Avengers'; he is paranoid, suffering from insomnia and anxiety attacks. However, when a Middle-Eastern terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) issues multiple assaults on the US, Tony vows that he will face him...It's no great secret that Robert Downey Jr's ever-great turn as Tony Stark is one of the greatest assets in Marvel's arsenal, so it is unsurprising that many of this film's high points are when Stark is out of the suit. After having worked with Black on his directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', it is clear to see that he and Downey Jr. form a great team; Black's knack for sharp dialogue is perfectly suited to the actor and works to laugh-out-loud effect in some scenes. The other actors are also given more to do than in previous installments, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow's as Stark's beau Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes, who forms a double-act with Stark that's not entirely dissimilar to Riggs and Murtaugh.While Black has written scripts for nearly thirty years (becoming Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter at one point), this is only his second film as director, so it's a pleasant surprise that the action sequences are so well-directed conceived and directed, comparatively better than any other in the trilogy so far. A stunning first-act assault on Stark's home and a near breathtaking plane set piece are real standouts. Unfortunately, the final reel's battle, while well-staged, falls somewhat flat.Ultimately, 'Iron Man 3' is ‚Äì while not as good as last year's biggest hitter ‚Äì arguably the best solo outing for Tony Stark. It's consistently funny and occasionally heartwarming (especially in the bond Stark forms with a young boy), with great action and strong performances that are aided by an excellent script. Also, without giving too much away, let's just saw that Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin is quite good, just not in that way you'd expect. Marvel's Phase Two has gotten off to a hugely enjoyable start.Also, stay until the very end of the credits. It's a Marvel movie after all.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

Firstly, that's something Tony Stark would do. Think about it. And secondly, the Mandarin would have figured it out, because most of the world knows who Tony Stark is and where he lives.This movie is not devoid of stupid stuff. Such as...
Why won't Tony let Pepper leave?Why would Tony's fling be at the house if she knew the missile was going to hit his house?Did that kid know Tony Stark or not?Also, even though I've seen worse child acting, this kid was not great.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

By all objective accounts it's still a good film, don't get me wrong, but it cannot hold a candle to the better Marvel films.Why, you may ask? A couple of reasons. First, the general plot. It's simply the same story that we've already seen in the two previous Iron Man films. In the first one it was great. Science, technology, gorgeous flying around, missiles, explosions, quick-witter banter, Robert Downey Jr. in the role of his life. The second one also benefited from those same qualities and failed for other reasons. But now, in the third installment of the franchise? The novelty has truly worn off. Sure, one might argue that it's nice to have a formula and that it wouldn't feel like an Iron Man story without certain elements. I argue that it'd be nice to explore other aspects of Tony Stark's character instead of watching him endlessly battle enemies of his own making. At least this time the villain isn't just a carbon copy of him, only evil. Well... he kind of is, but at least not as blatantly.And to the film's credit, there is some new ground covered and it's nice that the plot takes the events of The Avengers into account. Downey Jr. is still a fantastic Tony Stark and in this film he's given a chance to explore and play the character at his lowest point, which works pretty well indeed. The action also works, the suits are still gorgeous, the special effects beautiful and it's a professionally done film in every way possible.The second problem, however, are the characters, at least the new ones. They're simply not all that interesting. There are a couple of good twists, but when a guy walks into the room and he's so smarmy that he might as well carry a flashing neon sign with VILLAIN written on it, it's not that much of a surprise when he turns out to be the bad guy. The new kid sidekick they bring in is also aggravating, annoying and needed about as much as an ice cone machine in Greenland.Iron Man 3 is not a bad film. It's perfectly functional as a summer blockbuster and a good popcorn film by all accounts. But when you compare it to the Phase One movies, its flaws start to show.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So it's pointless for a critic to complain in general terms about sequelitis and superhero overkill. But judged solely in comparison to its corporate cousins, ""Iron Man 3"" is a defective model. It's lightweight but slow, padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is. At the helm again is Robert Downey Jr. as playboy inventor Tony Stark, whose arrogant schtick grew so tiresome in ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"" that he wisely tries to spoof it here. It's a welcome change of pace, but eventually there are so many broken-gadget pratfalls and moments of deflated egotism that they lose their effectiveness.Still the jokes are better than the sad attempts to give Stark a heart. In the very dull first half-hour of the movie, he is aching about the events in ""The Avengers"" ‚Äî you know, that finale when all of Manhattan was reduced to rubble by the superheroes and their adversaries. The widespread human cost of that cataclysm is barely even mentioned, except for how it left Stark feeling vulnerable.Boo freakin' hoo.The focus of his fears is girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has taken over the gizmo manufacturer Stark Industries. When a former research geek named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) visits the company with a hunky new image and a technology for supercharging human DNA, Pepper politely declines his invitation to invest. So Killian takes the technology to a television terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who uses it to turn humans into time bombs. Unlike Pearce, Kingsley is a memorable villain, particularly when he channels his inner Russell Brand. But except for a crew's freefall from the besieged Air Force One, the overblown 3-D action sequences are forgettable variations on the rallying cry ""Iron suits assemble!"" And director/co-writer Shane Black (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") tarnishes the entire franchise with a sticky subplot in which Iron Man crashes in a Tennessee town and adopts a little-kid sidekick (Ty Simpkins). ""Iron Man 3"" is the creakiest comic-book movie in Marvel's recent history. But hey, if your idea of a good time is dodging exploded logic, scattershot wisecracks and war-on-terror scare tactics, knock yourself out.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had great hopes on Sir Ben playing The Mandarin. It was not bad, but more screen time instead of the tiring Guy Pierce could have improved a poor product. It certainly makes me wonder if I will spend money on the upcoming Thor, Captain America,etc. I paid for 3D only to find around 15 minutes of it, badly used and non-spectacular.

"","","Self-referential struggle with machinery","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2857154/?ref_=tt_urv","chaos-rampant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17699578/?ref_=tt_urv","24 August 2013","This works for me, if only a bit, in spite of all the superhero trappings, which are tired even by Marvel standards. Typical post- 9/11 hero plot, with a bit of harmless shuffling of sides but pressing the same business as the White House movies earlier this year: for all its technologic might and security, poor America is at the mercy of chaotic, evil forces and needs war machines from the skies.What if the Osama-lookalike is really a puppet and a disgruntled American is behind the plan? Tony Stark's assertion that it's not about politics but good old-fashioned revenge stays. The bombings and televised messages stay, tapping into a more visceral fear than logic can dress in retrospect. Those images register closer to televised reality, while the actual villain is a more removed cartoon, a genetic supermutant.But moving on. This time they got Shane Black to write and direct and he brings a sensibility of equal parts deflating and indulging the iconography that he has honed in previous films and that Downey knows and can support. In fact that's his main job these days in this and Sherlock. A punch and a wink. And one reason why many didn't like this is that it's really a Tony Stark movie, which means a Robert Downey movie.Probably it came down to a simple practical matter for the makers; more Iron Man time needs a faceless robot (and Downey pretending he's in a suit) which minimizes Downey's charming draw as actor.So he spends most of his time outside the suit, improvising. And many of the situations this time revolve around the fact that his gadgets won't work, those that would yield the Iron Man movie. Sporadically they do, so we get bursts of uninteresting Marvel noise. But often, only parts of the suit will fly to him performing only part of their task. Often, they'll blow up in his face revealing a flummoxed Downey like a silent era comedian, a Lloyd or Chaplin, mystified at some thingamajig that won't work.It's all about a screwy actor feigning a struggle with machinery he's built. Clever and amusing. Along the way, we meet another screwy actor inside the story with drug problems. But that is all continuously swallowed up in the larger Marvel contraption he has to deliver, where the comedian's soulmate and world peace alike are grandiosely threatened in the dull way of Marvel.Interestingly, Marvel's grandiose aims with functional mechanics are reflected in the visual map of mind Guy Pearce shows early in the film. Impressive to look at but merely an embroidered function. For a brief time, neurologists thought they could come up with a computational model of mind that would explain all. No dice. Consciousness is its own space.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It shows us that no matter how much we change, our old demons don't just go away like that. It also shows us how properties don't make a man, but his wits do, and the amount of his preparation. Despite his world being destroyed by the Mandarin's goons, he managed to escape. He might've lost the battle, but not the war, and tries to avenge his defeat.Warning: Spoilers start below.His PTSD may seem like it was just forgotten, but it wasn't. His PTSD allowed him to make the invention which allowed him to escape from the compound, and which also saved his life when his mansion was destroyed. His PTSD also made Harley give Tony a piece of advice, to invent something to catch the Mandarin, which he promptly followed up on. The ending did not mean that Tony was giving up his suits, but instead means that he wasn't going to be basing his entire personality around the suits anymore, and moving on from his PTSD he got in The Avengers 1. I know that some people didn't like the sub - plots, but I think hearing WARMACHINEROX, and then having everybody in the sweat shop laugh is a good joke. Plus, it also allowed for Rhodes and Stark to come together. I could go on further, but it would not make my point any better. It was overall a great film, which is why I gave it a 9.7/10. Thanks for reading all of this, and have a great day.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A Nutshell Review: Iron Man 3","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2787701/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2013","To tell you more about the story will be a great disservice, because whoever cut the trailers, did the perfect misdirection, with what you think you know from the trailer, being very much farther away from the real truth. So that's that. What was expected though, was how closely this narrative ties in as post-events to the Avengers, with Tony Stark now elevated to more than a hero status, instantly recognizable amongst plenty of geeks, and with countless of references back to his exploits in the finale of that movie. It's one thing being recognized, and another thing having to grapple with the reality that there are threats larger than life now, which is Tony Stark's perennial bug bear in this installment. A pity of course, since it's supposed to be the parallel of his pain and addiction to the bottle, which will never see the light of day with Disney as owner.Fans of Robert Downey Jr, will rejoice with this better than expected installment, since he spends most of the time outside the suit as Tony Stark, battered, bruised and worn out, no thanks to the reckless stunt he pulls as part of personal vendetta, but putting his loved ones at risk and under fire. One cannot get enough of the actor's charisma on screen, and at this point, it's inconceivable to think of any other actor stepping into the role other than Downey Jr, who owns the role, and makes his ""I am Iron Man"" declaration all the more a truth. There are franchises that get tired after a while, but in Downey Jr, who is portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man in no less than 4 feature films already, there's no lack of enthusiasm, and it shows. Having him outside of the suit for the most parts, is also that breath of fresh air, especially well when it got written into the plot with his tinkering having brought him to a stage where he can be inside, or outside the suit, remote controlling portions of it, and having both an arsenal to count on, plus his street smarts when backed to a corner, and having to design really rudimentary weapons with items from a hardware store.Jon Favreau continues his role as Happy Hogan, given a lot more to do this time round since he's given up the director's chair, while Gwyneth Paltrow will be that Pepper Potts we have all yet to see. The appeal of Iron Man 3 is how it takes apart the status quo without feeling like it needed to just to stand out from the crowd, but doing so in a fashion that makes it seem like natural progression. Even Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes / War Machine / Iron Patriot also had the character pick up pace from the midway point, combining once again with Tony Stark / Iron Man as an effective team. Paul Bettany remains the unseen but often heard voice of Jarvis, although I thought this time he sounded a little more baritone than in the earlier films. And the standout amongst the supporting cast would be Ty Simpkins whose Harley, a kid whom Tony Stark befriends, plays something of a pivotal role, which once again brings back a little bit of the sharp wit that the previous Iron Man role seemed to lack.The action here's slicker than what we've already seen from the earlier movies, from its large set action pieces as already seen in the trailer set to pump up some adrenaline, while Iron Man 3 pretty much showed that Tony Stark had put in dutiful hours in the gym and picking up a slew of martial arts along the way. Especially useful since he spends quite a significant amount of time outside of the suit. And the CG got kicked into high gear especially when the arsenal of Iron Men came out to the open, which is fun to watch, but ultimately really cursory and brief, which was my main gripe about it. And it's no surprise too that humour was well placed throughout the film, even when this was darker in tone amongst its predecessors.Those of you who have been up in arms about this film's kowtow to the Chinese studios, may want to take note that the scenes involving the Chinese actors Wang Xueqi, and Fan Bingbing, were nothing more than a glorified blink-and-you-miss cameo for the former, and a non- appearance by the latter. While there exists an alternate, longer cut of their scenes for the China market, I doubt their characters were written with that much depth to have caused any real impact to the narrative, since they can be so cleanly shaven off from the international release. I am curious however, as to what those scenes exactly were, so I guess one can wait for the discs to find out how, if their scenes get re-entered as deleted ones.We see more of Tony Stark in this Iron Man film, which is a good thing, but one which also bode some closure to the franchise if it show chooses to end on a high note at this point, no thanks to the finale in having a key cause removed. Something like The Dark Knight Rises having to come full circle with its characters. But it's really never-say-never since Avengers 2 is a go, so there's one more real outing before anyone can call it quits to bidding RDJ and the rest of the cast farewell for starting what had snowballed into the definitive Marvel cinematic universe. Stay tuned, as you would already know by now, until the end of the credits for a scene that neatly bookends this movie, since it began with a narration, and would reveal that bit of a surprise with the post credits stinger. A no-brainer recommendation for Iron Man / Avengers fans everywhere.","12 out of 36 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An Above Average end to the trilogy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657108/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","So next on my MCU watching list is Iron Man 3 which is also the first film in Phase 2 and set in a post Avengers world, I re-watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Tony Stark struggling after the events of The Avengers, when a new terrorist threat comes to threaten him and his life.Main Character
Robert Downey Jnr is legendary as the character of Tony Stark and this is a really great performance that shows the complexity and pain that the character has gone through over the films. He still keeps the cocky and charismatic personality but there is some real struggle here and a mature story told here and Downey gives some great scenes which sees a real development in Stark as a character.Supporting Characters
Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts and I still think her and Downey Jnr have one of the better romances in the MCU and it is handled pretty well here. She doesn't actually have that much screen time in the film but when she is on screen I think she does a decent job in the film. Don Cheadle is back as Rhodey and again he doesn't have a huge amount of screen time but he plays an effective part of the film and the story and is a fun part of the film. I've always thought him and Downey Jnr have good chemistry together and that is further emphasised here. Sir Ben Kingsley plays The Mandarin and he is superb, he plays a real chilling and sinister bad guy that draws you in and makes you want to know more and see a great showdown between him and Iron Man. But this film does take some missteps in terms of the cast, Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian and he is one of the more dull characters in the MCU and it wastes Pearce into this pretty generic antagonist that feels like a weak element of the film. Rebecca Hall is also a great actress and she is wasted here, she is a one note character which could have been played by anybody. If you believe what hall says she was meant to have a larger role in the film but Marvel changed their mind and it makes her part in the film feel a bit strange and out of place.Story
The story does some things well, the greater focus on Tony Stark's PTSD and personal issues make this a more in depth story and character study that feels natural for the state that the character is in at this point in The MCU. But this film does misfire in terms of its overall plot, I mean there is a huge twist here that for me sends the film on a downwards spiral, I feel like how much you like this film relies on how you feel about the twist. There are other elements of the plot that aren't that great and it definitely comes out the further the film progresses.Script
The script is pretty good, in terms of dialogue it is pretty top notch. There is some decent humour put in here and the drama is ramped up for this film, especially for Stark. The issue is the plot when it doesn't focus on Tony is poorly written and so are some of the characters and I think that is where the film falters a bit for me.Style
The film looks great, the visuals for this film are truly fantastic, there are a few sequences towards the end of the film that are large on scale and the film does a great job of showing that. But the film does have a bit of a pacing issue, the film isn't that long but it feels much longer and I think that is due to a pretty slow first act that makes the film take time to get going.Overall
Overall, this is an above average third film that does some things right but also does some things wrong. I think it is slightly better then Iron Man 2 but nowhere near the level of the first film. It continues Tony Starks journey well but has too much around it that doesn't work, I would say only big superhero fans are gonna really care for this one.Rating - 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Director and Writer Shane Black takes a decidedly dark real world turn in ""Iron Man 3"". Black and co-writer Drew Pearce transform the hero's journey from the inside out all in the realm of global terrorism. In ""Iron Man 3"" Iron Man, Tony Stark exacts vengeance and justice against the megalomaniac Mandarin (measured charismatic evil Ben Kingsley), who harms those he loves. The Mandarin is the sociopath anarchist, who seemingly wants to watch the world burn. In the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy, ""Iron Man 3"" assumes an eerie resonance. So if we create our own demons, can we also destroy our own demons‚Äîour fears? Shane Black and Robert Downey Jr. explore with gravitas and gratifying sense of humor. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Downey still masterfully exudes billionaire Tony Stark's charming narcissistic genius blazing through Black and Pearce's crisp dialogue. In a hysterical scene he tells young charge Harley (scene stealing Ty Simpkins), whose Dad went to the store and never came back, ""Don't be such a p***y."" Downey has the amazing gift of letting us know what he is thinking. I really loved the movie, because he makes us see that Tony is the transcendent hero even without the high tech armor. Downey's Tony is haunted by the thwarted Alien invasion from ""The Avengers"" movie. He can't sleep. He has debilitating anxiety attacks. And in his manic streaks advances the Iron Man suit technology. There is a cool sequence as Stark summons elements of the suit to his body. Downey displays his Chaplin-like physical acting gifts. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as the beautiful and grounded Pepper Potts, who is CEO of Stark Industries. She has moved into Tony's Cliffside Malibu home. Tony is suffering, and Pepper takes the brunt of the collateral damage. Happy (funny and aloof Jon Favreau, also Director of the first two movies) has transitioned from Tony's Chauffeur to anal Head of Security at Stark Industries. Tony's buddy Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is PC version Iron Patriot. We create our own demons. In 1999, Tony attended a Conference in Bern, Switzerland. He cozies up to brilliant sexy Maya Hansen (smart and strong Rebecca Hall). Maya has discovered a process to regenerate plants in this case marijuana. However, the downside is that the regeneration is unstable and literally explosive. Tony blows off enamored fan crippled Aldrich Killian (deceptively diminished Guy Pearce), who has a proposal from AIM. New Year's Day finds Maya alone in bed and Aldrich in the cold. Aldrich as the now buff and handsome Guy Pearce reappears in 2012 meeting with Pepper. Pearce exudes a charming arrogance and power. His company AIM has Extremis, a regenerating healing biotech that he proposes to Stark Industries development. Pepper declines the easily weaponized app. The Mandarin unleashes his anarchist terrorism upon the President and invariably upon Tony. ""Do you want an empty life or a meaningful death?"" Enraged Tony challenges the Mandarin, ""I'm not afraid of you! I know you're a coward."" The Mandarin sends a helicopter kill team across the Malibu shores. This is reminiscent of Black's ""Lethal Weapon"". The carnage is spectacular. Tony protects Pepper, and somehow manages to get to¬Ö Tennessee. There he hooks up with whiz kid Harley (Simpkins) to investigate the source of the terror, as Tony battles his own demons without the protection of Iron Man. Everyone in ""Iron Man 3"" is yoked out. Downey looks to have injured his hand early on wearing a brace. He is muscular and strong. He gets to use his Wing Chun expertise in a lot of the fight sequences. Don Cheadle exposes his biceps. Gwyneth Paltrow looks amazing, and shows off her shredded abs. Guy Pearce looks like he worked out with Hugh Jackman. Ultimately, the dark hero narrative culminates in the climatic showdown at shipyard, out of ""Lethal Weapon 2"" as opposed to world destruction of ""The Avengers"". A welcome departure. The pivotal plot twist works, but for me dilutes the gravity of the emotional threat. The action sequences are amazing. The aerial rescue from Air Force One is visually stunning. Robert Downey Jr. makes us believe in heroes. We create our own demons. Heroes do what must be done, in spite of their demons, and inspire others to do the same. ""Iron Man 3"" is a great movie.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow are given very little to do to the extent that Cheadle actually is wasted. And Hans Zimmer's score was a disappointment, I like Zimmer but the score was too much of an over-loud drone that was often too in-your-face and there were numerous times when the orchestration didn't fit. Iron Man 3 still does a lot right, it's very expertly made with the best special effects quality of the three films, striking locations and use of gadgets and very stylish cinematography and editing, never showing any signs of drabness, garishness or choppiness. The action sequences have plenty of great spectacle and are very exciting, especially the plane sequence and the explosive climax, that is by far the best climax of the three(the first's was rushed and overblown to me and the second's while an improvement was rather brief and could have started earlier than it did). The script had plenty of breezy black humour, great exuberance and enough surprises that are done smartly and cleverly. You may miss the mix of comic nostalgia and currant relevance that the direction in the previous two films had but the darker, without being overly-serious approach served the grittier-than-usual story here well and Shane Black does show that he is comfortable in action and in the drama and thriller aspects. The story is more involving and far less familiar than that of the second's, the only reservation being the plot-twist for the Mandarin, and doesn't feel cluttered this time round, and emotional impact, tension, fun and coherence are not sacrificed at least. Robert Downey Jnr. mixes brooding intensity and deadpan comic timing adeptly(if not as fresh and powerhouse quality as in the first) and for the villains Ben Kingsley actually plays deceptive quite brilliantly and Guy Pearce is also very effective. The supporting cast are very good on the whole, though the way they're written varies. All in all, not as good as the first Iron Man but a solid second sequel that is not wholly deserving of the dislike/indifference it gets, though the criticisms are valid. 7/10 Bethany Cox","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Another Grand Entertainment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2793074/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2013","Iron Man 3 (2013) *** (out of 4) Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) calls out a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and soon everything he knows or cares about is in danger. With the help of a special chemical created by a madman (Guy Pearce), the Mandarin plans to destroy the world and take Iron Man out with it. IRON MAN 3 isn't a flawless movie but it's certainly a very entertaining one that packs plenty of punch from the opening sequence to the last. I personally enjoyed the second film in the series, although I'm well aware than many hated it and those same people are calling this one a return to form. Well, this here is certainly a step up from the second film and it almost reaches the level of the first one. I think the greatest thing going for this third film is that it offers up pretty of funny moments. As usual Stark is full of jokes and wise-cracks and of course Downey is just perfect in delivering them. If the first two films didn't already prove it this one here certainly does but Downey was just perfect casting for this character and I can't think of anyone who would have been better. The supporting cast is strong as usual with Kingsley turning in a very good performance as the villain and his voice in the terrorist videos was extremely effective. Both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow return and are fun but I can't say the screenplay did either of them any favors. Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau and Ty Simkins were good and it's always fun seeing Miguel Ferrer. It was especially great seeing Pearce back in a good role and the underrated actor does a very good job with it. The action scenes are all extremely well-done and I thought the CGI was very impressive and mixed in well with the live action. The story itself wasn't the strongest in the world but there's no question that the screenplay got the humor right and it gave us situations and characters that kept us involved. Director Shane Black keeps the film moving at a very fast pace and there's no question that he never lets the viewer doze off or lose interest in what's going on. IRON MAN 3 is certainly a great way to kick off the summer season and it's good to see that three films in (four if you count THE AVENGERS) they're still delivering the goods.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

I could almost smell the ink on the contract Downey Jr. signed to the franchise that certainly guaranteed him a minimum amount of face time. It's ludicrous how much time he spends as just plain old Tony Stark, running around with a gun or with self-made gadgets or wearing only part of the Iron Man armor (careful to keep his face exposed). The character seems to have gone far beyond anything the comic envisioned. The movie version of Stark is more complex and that's great. Except, the armor has become no more than a metaphor for the theoretical armor Stark hides behind. They come up with many imaginative ways 42 suits of armor (all built by Stark alone because he can't help it), but in the end they just seem like more excuses to get Downey Jr's face in front of the camera and STILL have scenes with armor so it can be an Iron Man movie. I would reckon that the armor spends very little time on screen, if anyone were to sit down and calculate it. One other issue I noticed: Disney bought Marvel. Disney's animated movies move along at a bullet pace. They seem to be pushing for that same style with these comic book movies now. The way IM3 is cut, there's no time to even consider what you just saw, no time for emotion whatsoever. I wanted to raise my hand and shout, 'whoa just take it easy! Slow down!' For instance, the movie's best action sequence, where Iron Man rescues the passengers of Air Force One, starts and ends before you can even soakin what just happened. Oh and I didn't see it in 3D or IMAX but I can't imagine why anyone would want to.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sadly, in my honest opinion and not stating this as a fact, I was not won over by Mr. Stark...To me, Iron Man 3 was going down the right path until it took a complete U turn and plummeted after a huge plot twist. I also felt like Rebecca Hall's character was not satisfyingly fleshed out as her character had a lot of potential to carry parts of the film, sadly this was not the case. Those were two major criticisms of Iron Man 3. I would like to comment on Tony's dealings with the experience of 'The Battle of New York', I completely understand why they chose to stretch out Starks character development by showing a bit of humanity and emotional depth, however, due to the numerous references to Avengers Assemble, sadly the billion dollar summer blockbuster casted a huge shadow over this kick off to Marvel Phase 2...yet again, I understand what they were trying to achieve with focusing on how Stark is coping after 'The Battle of New York' but for some reason, I just couldn't connect with his character within this film. However, I would like to strongly emphasise that I don't hate this film, it's just that it didn't connect with me and sadly I wasn't swept away by Marvel's recent outing. The positives of the film are the characters. Partlow's character definitely stepped up from her previous outings, she definitely played a vital part within this film. I loved the scenes with Stark and a young boy he encounters, it's like he sees a younger self within this boy and learns a lot about himself through this encounter. Great visuals and an amazing ""battle"" scene at the end of the film. Overall, a decent outing that sadly did not allow myself to immerse myself with this adventure of a blockbuster.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

On a personal opinion, I really enjoyed the movie for the many aspects it had. Not only is this movie filled with a suspensive action, but it also shows many of the problematics in today's society like government corruption and sentiments for others. It also has the best special effects that I have seen in a movie so far. Not only does it have all of this aspects that I like to find in a movie, but I also am a fan of the ""Iron Man"" storyline and the Marvel franchise. The story takes place in the United States. The main plot of the story is how Tony Stark, the main character of the film, tries to redeem himself after the villain named The Mandarin takes control over the war on terrorism, and how he must protect his loved one, Pepper Potts all at the same time. So not only does he have to defend against this terrorist who has created a very powerful weapon, but he also has to save Pepper from him. Throughout the story, we can also enjoy many of Tony's gadgets such as the ""Iron Man"" and his super intelligent computer named ""J.A.R.V.I.S."". As he undergoes this dangerous adventures, his best friend, James Rhodes, helps him to uncover the many secrets of the Mandarin and try to kill him.When it comes to acting, I think that Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), is one of my favorite actors. The way he develops his role is not only creative, but very realistic, so the person that sees the movie really gets into the character and sometimes may familiarize himself with him. Robert takes this role into a whole new level, and as we have seen in the previous movies of this trilogy, he uses a lot of sarcasm and crude wording in order to fit perfectly in this egocentric millionaire that is Tony Stark. Now let's talk about Pepper, or as known in the real world, Gwyneth Paltrow. I think that just as Robert, she has really made her character really realistic and many women try to identify in it. I think that from all the movies she has made, this trilogy is definitely the best paper that she has represented. She has grown so deep into the character, that I have sometimes difficulties telling if her real name is Pepper or Gwyneth. I think that both of these actors make the perfect couple in order to give an action based movie with a little bit of sentimentality in it. They both make the movie funny, entertaining, full of action, and loving. As I previously mentioned, this trilogy is my favorite portion of movies. I can watch all of this movies a thousand times and never get bored, but why? The answer is really simple, the storyline. I think that the director and the scriptwriter have made an excellent job when it comes in creating this films. They make the films full of a little bit of everything. Just by being Iron Man, it has to have that action that gives us that butterfly feeling in our stomachs, and ties us the idea that we want to be indeed Tony Stark. They also give it the love part, since it has this idea of trying to save the person one loves the most in the world from a terrorist and a potential world war triggering person. This brings me to the next point, its special effects. The special effects in this movie are ridiculously good. Since the beginning of the movie when we see Tony Stark in his brand new armor, till the very end with all of the explosions and all of the advanced technology in it. The special effects are so good that one feels that one is part of the movie, and not just a spectator watching it from a couch with a bag full of popcorn and a big beverage. There are just some scenes in this movie that makes are jaw drop to the bottom because of all of the amazing special effects one can find. Every movie has its theme, but I think that this one has many themes. The first one and most important one I believe it is love, and how no matter what the situation is, love will always prevail. But on the other hand, it also shows how destructive many of the future technologies may be and how they can change the life of millions of persons in a matter of days or even hours. It also has a political view, and how sometimes the government doesn't do all of their job when they do a mess. Last but not least, it shows terrorism, and how this idea of destroying cities just to give a message is really unnecessary. I believe that this are the main themes of this movie, generalized in a way so that I don't soil the movie for many of you readers.I believe that this is a movie for teenagers to above because not only does one have to have a basic knowledge on some ideas and terms, but also because of its big violence, although not bloody, there is still violence. The movie is rated PG-13, and I completely agree with this. My final comments on the movie is that it is a must-watch and a very good movie.My rating would be a 9/10 since it may be my favorite movie. My name is Oscar Diaz. I live in Costa Rica and this was a review made for the film appreciation class of Lincoln School.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Plus, he's bombarded with threats from the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a Middle Eastern terrorist and an army of indestructible lava men. Can the superhero get his act together?Movie Review: Like The Dark Knight Rises, for a major portion of the film, the Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) stays unmasked. His new armour flies piece-by-piece to his body. He stays mortal, as in most scenes, you see him wearing just one part of the armour.Right in the beginning as Tony Stark declares he is a 'changed man', you fear the character might lose out on its core personality. You wonder if Shane Black can pull it off, considering it's his first outing as an Iron Man director and it comes after the massive success of The Avengers. But Black breathes new life into the franchise while retaining its trademark charm. He keeps the film vastly different from Jon Favreau's previous installments by adding his own brand of action-humour and twists.Black combines spectacular action, comedy and drama to get you entertained and emotionally invested in his characters. Scenes where Tony confesses his fears to Pepper ( Gwyneth Paltrow), his interaction with a small boy are heart-rending. Robert Downey Jr gets a multi- layered role and he performs with absolute finesse. His smirk and those classic wisecracks amuse you the most.However, Ben Kingsley steals the show! He is bound to get major applause for his performance.Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) is effective as an actor but his motives seem unconvincing. His character fails to make the desired impact.From the jaw-dropping attack on Stark's Malibu estate, his brand-new prehensile armour, to a mind-blowing airborne rescue scene, Iron Man 3 is every bit the superhero blockbuster you'd expect it to be. Just do not leave the theatre once the closing credits start rolling!Note: You may not like the film if you find solo super-hero films tedious post 'The Avengers'!","9 out of 28 found this helpful.

Still, I did like many of the action scenes and some of the humor presented here as well as some of the twists concerning some villains and the fate of Pepper Potts. And Robert Downey Jr. is both intense and fun when playing the charismatic Tony Stark with Gwyneth Paltrow still bringing sparks as his loving partner, the aforementioned Ms. Potts. So on that note, I highly enjoyed watching Iron Man Three.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The first film following ""Avengers Assemble"" and the start of phase 2, it's a deeper and more satisfying follow up than that first sequel.Now the Earth's protector, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is struggling with the aftereffects of the battle of New York. Struggling with panic attacks, he still sees fit to pick a fight with an international terrorist, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). When this goes badly, and without a suit to rely on, Tony comes to realise that he is a capable hero in his own right.Shane Black and Drew Pearce are the writing and directing team for this film and it's their funny, twisty script that is the best aspect of the film. Seeing Tony actively struggling with panic attacks is a surprisingly unexplored area that the MCU and its ongoing storyline is uniquely placed to deal with. It's strange to think back that people found the films big twist, which I'm not going to detail here, controversial but Marvel has seen fit to do quite a bit of work to reclaim the character.Interestingly, having been really looking forward to this one when it came to this rewatch of the Iron Man films, it's not quite as top tier as I thought it was. It's great, don't get me wrong. Visually it's very impressive and the jokes in the dialogue are top notch. It's not quite at the ""Winters Soldier"", ""Civil War"", ""Ragnarok"" level though. Some of the elements, such as characters breathing fire, was a bit much, in fact Aldrich Killian altogether felt a bit like a lesser version of Justin Hammer.It's a really good film, though not quite at the heights that Marvel would reach.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Few random unnecessary sexist bits, girls in bikinis playing table tennis (??), girls in lingerie etc. So clich√© and cringey.

I simply loved that nothing held to any type of clich√©. Nearly every interaction delivered something unexpected and fresh. Stark was shaken to his very core by the events of Avengers and further more by the events early in this film. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Tony Stark's struggles both external and especially internal. Choosing to focus on Tony out of the armor is a wonderful decision. RDJ is as brilliant as he's ever been as Stark. Fans of the books (of which I'm one) may complain about certain character translations but I really have no complaints. Flexibility has always been a Marvel strength over the years and I liked how they flexed and twisted certain ideas here. The thing they get so right from the books is the ingenuity of Tony Stark. He's so much more than a man in a metal suit. It's his brain and his wit that are the true weapons. This movie goes out of its way to illustrate that brilliantly.The armored adventure scenes do thrill but are spaced by gritty old fashion action and a movie filled with a lot of heart and humor. Again, it was well played and I found it to be genuinely refreshing while bold all at the same time. No one can accuse them of playing it safe.As for the supporting cast, the results were spotty. Pepper is given her due and Killian is an amazing villain. The rest of the supporting cast is barely seen and underutilized. Despite one very cool hero moment, Rhodey isn't fleshed out at all. I can't say much about The Mandarin. Overall, it's a well crafted, funny and refreshing number three film that wraps up the trilogy beautifully.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Bit Better Than I Expected, Yet Still Disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2794957/?ref_=tt_urv","Staffenburgen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur35191595/?ref_=tt_urv","10 May 2013","Let me begin by saying that I'm not much of a comic book fan and don't really know much about the background of the villains portrayed in the film. I say that because many people are absolutely shredding this film for how it utilizes one of the villains in the film. So, if you're like me, that's not likely to bother you very much and you'll probably enjoy the movie much more than comic book fans are. After all, Iron Man 3 is actually a decent third movie in what could be the last movie of a trilogy. In many ways, Iron Man 3 is a typical third movie. Stark is faced with his most challenging foes yet, and comes dangerously close to losing absolutely everything. This makes the film slightly darker than the previous instalments, though the constant jokes keep the mood still very light. However, it should be said that the dialogue feels a long way off from the first movie; the one-liners in this film seem quite forced and they are decidedly less funny for one reason or another. This brings me to my major gripe with the film: the writing. The ""story"" here is nothing short of a disaster, with misguided motivations, twists and turns that don't really make sense, and enough plot holes to make your head spin. However, despite all that, the movie is saved by Downey Jr., who breathes life into the Iron Man character. Aside from Downey Jr., the supporting cast does an alright job. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and does as good a job as she could've with what she was given. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley are introduced as the two central villains of the movie, and both really suffer from the writing here. Pearce, who was incredible in Christopher Nolan's Memento, is stuck with a two dimensional role surrounded by ridiculous special effects, and is never really given a chance to do anything special here. Kingsley's role is tough to describe without giving anything away, but his performance is very good given the garbage he was expected to bring to life. In addition, Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau return as War Machine and Happy Hogan, and both do well with their minor roles. One thing you can't knock about the film are the special effects. The CGI sequences are stunning (as expected) and the 3D option certainly enhanced the visuals. The score is decent here as well, although it doesn't really stand out like some of the other superhero movies (like The Dark Knight). All in all, it's an entertaining movie. After the disaster that was the second movie, I expected this to be awful. I may have been right about the story, but the film does a good job of holding your attention and will keep you entertained for a few hours (although you will forget it as soon as you leave the theater). It's a shame that this film couldn't restore the series to the excellence of the first film, but hopefully the next movie (it it's even made) can accomplish that. RATING: 6/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Iron Man Three wasn't the best out of the trilogy, I think the First Iron Man had the edge due to it being the original and you didn't know exactly what to expect, but this installment definitely was worth watching and much better than the 2nd. Unlike other reviewers saying the dialogue was terrible I do think the writers did a good job with keeping the humour throughout the film, because at the end of the day you can never take these films too seriously and the dialogue is well written to keep it that way. Unlike Transformers where they tried to make the film more serious than what it was in the 2nd and 3rd installment.The acting was great, Robert Downy put in a solid performance and did a good job of adapting to the slightly changed Tony Stark after the events of Avengers. Ben Kingsley was superb as the mandarin and pretty surprising after you realise his true character. Finally the CGI was amazing as always and the action was great. Had great action sequences from beginning to end. (Slightly slow starting like the 2nd film) My only down sides was that I was slightly disappointed with the Mandarin and how he turned out. And also that there was no AC-DC music that was key in the first two installments. Other than that which is nothing to put you off from watching, my final rating is,4&1/2 stars.But remember, do not take this film too seriously as it could disappoint you.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

For this reasons, I actually liked the big main twist of this movie (the one that you might read about in other ""spoiler"" reviews) and how it alternates between dark and funny moments .

It worked because they did indeed find their way and however Avengers managed to hit the screen it hit the screen in style! What's great about Iron Man 3 is that there's no looking forward and certainly no feeling of a stumbling or searching plot. The writers on this film made just exactly the right size sandbox for the whole story. Everything seen on screen has some meaning now or at some point later in this story arc. There is no intention to pay anything off down the line in some other film. It's a very well written movie where most everything speaks to an overall theme of some kind. There's also some fine humor mixed in as everyone comes to expect in these Marvel films.It really is a masterfully crafted film. That's why I'm so impressed with this movie. You know they could have phoned it in after Avengers. Just give Iron Man some Transformers level CGI action-fest and sit back and count the box office receipts. That really is the very last thing they did. Iron Man 3 is a remarkable movie on every level and would actually be a stand out film with none of that great action. Fortunately, Iron Man 3 delivers story first but it's coupled with the best action of the series. Marvel really did learn a lot from Avengers and those other pre-Avengers films. The lessons learned pays off big.I'm also do glad they didn't get overindulgent. It's back to Tony and Pepper and their supporting cast. That's how it should be and needed to be. This movie is Tony's journey (mentally and physically) from start to finish chasing the bad guy¬Ö and what a bad guy it is!!! The Mandarin is exquisite and he draws Tony out to places that he's obviously never been before. They hit a home run at every turn with this one.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is risky only in the sense that ""Iron Man 2"" was a rare misstep for Marvel, one from which it recovers here. Shane Black is a great choice for director and co- writer, and not just because Marvel needed a movie set at Christmas time. This isn't exactly ""Die Hard in the MCU,"" but Black's sensibility is a welcome respite from the planet-is-in-peril stakes of ""The Avengers,"" which capped off ""Phase I."" His story and direction create enough excitement to make this good fun, give Iron Man a decent opponent, give Tony Stark some demons to wrestle with, and make very good use of the familiar supporting players in Iron Man/Stark's world.Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is almost engaging enough to make me not miss Sam Rockwell, the best feature of ""Iron Man 2."" As Marvel villains go, Killian is nicely developed and reasonably compelling. He's no Loki, but he's big improvement on Mickey Rourke, and like Rockwell's, his evil plan is basically profit-driven. He doesn't want to destroy the planet, he just wants to get rich off the people who do. But his megalomania is nicely juxtaposed with Stark's, who is dealing with PTSD from the events of ""The Avengers."" Stark finally reaches out for help in a way that Killian can't, which makes a resonant dramatic point and also gives both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau a lot more to do than they've previously been afforded. Both rise to the occasion, as does Don Cheadle as War Machine. And the film does all this without Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury popping up -- he must still be in mourning for Clark Gregg.I was not as convinced by the sub-plot involving a child and his relationship with Stark. This is an over-long film for what it tries to accomplish, with one or two too many plot twists and turns for its own good. There is no cross set-up here that doesn't turn out to be a double-cross, which never gets confusing but does get wearying. The plot involving the boy Stark befriends seems like the most superfluous in a film that could stand some trimming to be as tight as it should be. Nevertheless, this is a good return to form for Iron Man and a promising way to continue the franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So this Ironman had to deliver and it had to be better than its prequels and it does so in style. This is another visual-treat and of course has a strong storyline. This time its more serious, more powerful and there's the crude humor when you are least expecting it.The best part about this movie is that this shows the sensitive side of Tony Stark along with his attitude. You'll connect to him as a common man's superhero too. The action is amazing and we get to see RDJ performing many stunts without the suit too. To get the full satisfaction of this do watch the trailer before you see the movie. That's something you really should do.Robert Downey Jr of course walks away with accolades for his masterful performance. Bring out crude humor and spares no one with his witful sarcasm. Gwyneth Paltrow is hot n great. Guy Pearce does well. Jon Favreau makes an impact in his little role. Ben Kingsley is a class act and Don Cheadle also doesn't disappoint.Its a complete entertainer with rich visual effects and also intelligent with a strong story line. Don't miss this. Don't.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

Ben Kingsley plays the 'dirty wizard' look as an Islamic extremist wanting to 're-educate' the US. Stark assures us 'there is no politics here, there's just good old-fashioned revenge'.Like all comic book threequels, this is messy, illogical and littered with too many characters. Downey Jr's mercurial wit is as quick as ever and his improvised quips save the day. Rebecca Hall is criminally cut and the big finale is like a bad mash-up of Transformers and Twilight.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film engages you the very way the other films do not. It keeps you intrigued and wrapped up in its storyline. The plot is enough to demand and be worthy of your attention. I think the acting is great too and smartly casted. Downey is his usual charismatic, non self-effacing hero self. He brings more to his Iron Man portrayal here then in past portrayals. He has more fun with the character and we have more fun watching him. It pulls the viewers in more when he is having as much of a good time with the role as he is in this installment. Pearce as Aldrich Killian really sinks his teeth into the role I have to say I was impressed and even more impressed with Bettany as Jarvis. Bettany really nailed the performance and I think held his own in the film as far as the bad guys go. I think the special effects were spot on and overall this is a thrill ride well worthy of the hype it's been receiving.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The presence of Mandarin makes all people around him become victims of the great power of Mandarin.Iron Man 3 returns with a new enemy with mysterious powers. The third film from Iron Man is somewhat less good than the previous two films. Not much presenting Tony with his flagship suit, this third film shows more on Tony Stark's character development marked by the fall of Tony's prestige and personality who is in a weak state. Iron Man 3 also brings a bit of a storyline that is not neat to be presented. Also less dense story conflicts. Too many story plots are wasted. This third film presents a plot twist in it from the Mandarin character himself. Tells the story of a Chinese character who looks threatening, but not memorable after knowing his true identity. While the main antagonist is not memorable and less convincing. It's a pity that this third film did not go well. Some scenes that do feel too far-fetched or too long to be presented. This then leads to a boring storyline. Nevertheless, Robert Downey Jr., Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow played well and quite satisfactorily. The film as a whole is less than good and less than perfect.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2789110/?ref_=tt_urv","joechar4444","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4571680/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2013","Bringing comic book adaptations to life on screen seems to be a difficult balance for anyone that's not Marvel it would seem. Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels. There's the ""hit you over the head"" type humor and then there's the drier, sarcastic comedy that Robert Downey was born to deliver. Everything meshes here for one of the better film going experiences of the year.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

You see Robert Downey Jr in a familiar role being the wise ass Tony Stark. After the events of Avengers, Tony has developed a sort of paranoia along with insomnia. This leads him to go over board with ""Hobby"". Add to this a new treat that is possibly the biggest that he has faced alone. The armour is in the next stage of evolution and its quite cool seeing it come together. Its not only Tony but all the major characters here that get considerably meatier story arch. Although the tone of the movie is same as those movies that preceded it - light. There is a twist midway through that very few will see it coming. I would think it was a Joss Whedon touch. The end fight is huge and spectacular in scale and effects. In the end of it all, tony has grown, matured up and realizes the important things in life. Though this character movement is not shown in a very sensible way and not very convincing. All of a sudden, he is more mature and he has moved on. Oh and there is an Easter Egg scene here at the end of credits though you really won't miss much if you don't wait for it. Final verdict: Better than iron man 2 but not as good as the first part.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The only real problem i have with the movie is inconsistency. The plot is inconsistent with the other movie.For instance, the Ten Rings is an actual terrorist organization in Iron Man 1, but here, they just make the Mandarin a cover-up for the real villain, who you could see coming miles away when you first see him. The twist that (HUGE SPOILER) the Mandarin is actually an actor playing a role is a great twist, if it made sense. The only way that they could possibly redeem this twist is if the REAL Mandarin, aka. The Ring Leader (pardon the pun) of the Ten Rings terrorist organization, is the villain in number 4, otherwise there's this massive hole in the plot between 1 and 3.Otherwise, in and of itself, this film is dramatic, funny and a really good time at the theatres. I'm not buthurt like some people over the sillification (that's what i'm calling it) of the Mandarin, but i get where they're coming from (imagine if they did that to the Joker. Even if the movie was otherwise amazing, people would hate it more that Batman and Robin).Conclusion: Iron Man 3 is a great film that has a twist nobody saw coming, and therefore potentially ruined the film for some people. If you're a comic book fan, you may not like this film, especially if you're a fan of the Mandarin character.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was as funny, if not funnier than the Avengers, and it was all around bad ass. I left the theater wanting to be Iron Man (like everyone else). If there was a 4th I would most definitely go see it.

I build neat stuff, got a great girl, occasionally save the world. So why can't I sleep?"" You can't sleep because writer/director Shane Black has made you this third time around the most interesting superhero since Superman flew onto the comic book scene. Played by the snarky, sardonic, witty, and conflicted Robert Downey Jr., billionaire Tony Stark, weapons maker and new-age hero, faces a terrorist menace named Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), whose likeness to Osama bin Laden is not a coincidence, and his accomplice, Aldrich Killian ( a memorably menacing Guy Pearce). In the end, however, the greatest antagonist for the insouciant hero is himself, who can't sleep so consumed is he by the contradictions of his heroic mission.The thriller tropes are all there, but Black has decided to use his writing experience for Lethal Weapon and obvious familiarity with old film comedies to enhance the repartee among the principle players, including Stark's love and assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and War Machine rival, Colonel James Rhodes (Con Cheadle). Yet more memorable than these talented vets is Ty Simpkins playing Harley Keener, a bright little boy who helps Stark, not just with electronics but also dialogue smart and fast reminiscent of the vintage screwball comedies.Although Stark is a fast-moving one line organ (As he suits up: ""You know, it's moments like these when I realize how much of a superhero I am.""), when he's with the above-mentioned characters, especially Harley, the humor is as fast as the ubiquitous missiles and subtly laden with thematic weight. The emphasis on witty dialogue made the difference for me between a good thriller and a great one.Because by my count this is the fourth movie in a few months to center its action on endangering the president of the US (Olympus Has Fallen, GI Joe, and the upcoming White House Down are the other 3), I see a concern underneath our pop culture for the safety of our open society symbolized by the vulnerable president. While in general I am impatient with many film deaths and explosions, I am intrigued by how we can accept so much terrorism on screen, from 9/11 through Iron Man 3.Perhaps these escapist entertainments help purge our fears by showing everything landing right for the country, its leaders, and its audience. If that's too heavy for you, then see this film just to enjoy its state-of-the-art graphics, talented actors, and resolutions that will not leave you indifferent to the will of the American people to overcome their fears: ""The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself!""

Now he's up against an evil techno genius played by Guy Pearce who's created an army of exploding warriors he plans to use to take over the world.Written by Drew Pearce and director Shane Black, the plot isn't all that compelling this time around, but as usual, it is Robert Downey, Jr. who keeps the super hero relatable and life-sized amidst the crassness of the movie's multi-million dollar production values and special effects. Downey's greatest achievement is that he manages to be wisecracky and smart-alecky without becoming cynical. This is enhanced by the chemistry between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as his erstwhile ladylove and company CEO Pepper Potts.The special effects are predictably spectacular - with a jumping-out-of-an-airplane scene an eye-popping, heart-stopping standout - but, as with the earlier films in the series, it's the humanity of the title character that makes it all work.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The iron patriot was a perfect idea to put in this film and seeing Tony with a new iron man suit. It felt pretty intense at some parts of the film and i think that's what made all the difference because the last two films didn't feel as seriously intense as this film.

But it was just as horrible, generic and predictable as expected.The theme and feel of the movie is all over the place. One minute something serious happens regarding a bombing, smash cut to an attempted witty one liner. Are we meant to be taking this movie seriously or as a joke! Continuity is also disjointed. All of a sudden random people know how to fight like a superhero, billions of dollars of research and equipment are blown up for pretty firework like explosions, and one minute the Iron Man suit is pretty much indestructible, then it can be ripped off the protagonists by mere civilians.The movie should have been called 'Iron Man: Low Battery'. The entire movie Stark is trying to find enough charge to keep his suit functional. And no, it's not because it uses some fancy power source. Simply hooking it up to a car battery is sufficient. How can such an advanced suit be developed, but not a proper power source! Also, where is the US military! The bad guys seem to be able to fly around the country shooting at Iron Man with no worry of being shot down or attacked by America's military.Lastly, talk about a pro-American movie. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this movie was produced by American news channels combined with the government. Everything has an undertone of 'America, we are the best'. The 'bad guy' is a Middle Eastern terrorist, surprise surprise. This is almost a movie to justify America trying to be the world police.Clearly these are not my type of movies, but it's exactly like every other superhero movie where you have bad guys, good guys and you already know who's going to win.","33 out of 69 found this helpful.

And again don't worry NO Spoilers!!!! So if u like me have been checking out early reviews of iron man 3 you would have noticed the reviews have largely been positive with some mixed ones, and that's how i think this movie will fair on the long run. Most people will love it & many might never accept it for what it is!! I'll start by listing out the Pros & Cons. PROS >>Really cool action movie with unique & creative action sequences. every cent of 200 mil was well spent. >>RDJ is awesome as ever, effortlessly carries the movie ! he charismatically plays a superhero suffering from what i thought was PTSD symptoms. >>The movie smoothly handles a superhero questioning his life & life's work without taking itself way too seriously ** Cough...cough.... Dark Knight** >>Wit & Humor is great tony stark is still the wise cracking billionaire everyone loves & many other funny moments. >>Good all round supporting cast Ben Kingsley,Gwyn Paltrow,Guy Pearce ,Jon Favreau all do a good job although Guy Pearce stands out. >>Shane Black Directing it was a good call. This one feels much different than the previous two movies and i mean that in a good way CONS >>""Mandarin"" soon to probably become the source of endless debates among fans !! I remember reading an early review that said Mandarin is perhaps the most intelligent screen adaptation of a Villon since the joker!! this got me seriously pumped up for the movie & after seeing the movie i just don't know what to make of it! This will divide the audience, that's for sure. General audience won't mind the direction they took. But fan reaction will range from Disappointment to all out Nerd Rage!!!! BUT Mandarin is to Iron Man what Joker is to Batman..........Just Saying >>""Maya Hansen"" starts out great, very interesting opening but everything just leads to a predictable & abrupt end. >>""Extremis"" again an audience divider. regular audience will be cool with it, but fans will be screaming out loud ""No Way that's Extremis"">>Has somewhat of a ""Dark Knight Rises"" feel to it!.....(PS not in a good way) seems really great at first but the more you think about it many things don't make sense >>Doesn't really kick off Phase 2 in a way the first movie of phase 2 should ""No talking Raccoons here"" Verdict All that being said i still had a great time with it! as long as you don't compare it to Avengers and see the movie for what it is you should be able to enjoy the movie 8.5/10","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Seeing a different side, a more tender side if you will, of Tony, as Pepper has become so much more important in his life, is exactly what was needed to add a new dimension to the Iron Man. As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is both captivating and beyond fun to watch. Reckless and ruthless is a fabulous combination. And in this one, he has to use more ingenuity than he's ever been called upon to use before. When all looks lost, that's when Iron Man reaches down and pulls up even more genius. Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes is the perfect partner for him to be working with and Guy Pearce as the villain, Aldrich Killian, makes a tremendous bad guy. This one has a cool little twist in the plot in regard to the bad guys and frankly, I can hardly wait to see the next installment in this exciting series.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The Fall and rise of House Stark","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2821300/?ref_=tt_urv","monkriffe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43411391/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2013","At the time of first writing, Robert Downey Junior had finished his contract with Marvel Studios, and as yet there had been no announcements that he, or Iron Man will be coming back, beyond a tantalising ""Tony Stark will Return"" during the credits. Thus the news that he is coming back for two more movies is a relief, to say the least. RDJ has over the last 5 years strikingly embodied a character fans have been hoping for since the 60s, and made him cool, as well as kicking off Marvel's groundbreaking vision of a cinematic universe that other studios are now rushing to try and follow. Without him, there would not only be no Iron man, but there might not have been an Avengers, either. That said, Iron Man 3 ceases to be simply another superhero movie, and becomes a possible swansong for a cult hero of fans everywhere. Does it live up to the challenge? Hell yes. This is not Tony Stark's finest hour. What it is, though, is his best film to date. As Tony says himself, this is a film about demons, specifically those you create. We open in 1999, pre Tony's weekend away in an Afghan cave and adding a sense of continuity to the trilogy. Tony's casual snubbing of a nerdy geneticist who later becomes a villain is one of the film's few predictable plot points, and Guy Pearce's performance as Aldrich Killian manages to sell the moment. More on him in a moment. Back to Tony. We also meet the bright and innocent Scientist Maya Hansen, played by Rebecca Hall, inventor of a bio virus named Extremis, capable of rewriting human DNA, converting humans into sizzling skin-crawling lava lamps, regenerating limbs, and, um going boom. Snap forward 13 years, and Tony has locked himself in his basement, making a prehensile suit that attaches itself, piece by piece to his body, sometimes with considerable force. His only companions are robots, the social creature seen only 10 minutes previously hiding considerable PTSD with bravado and obsessively creating countless variations on the iron man suit. This self imposed exile is not without consequence. The Big Bad quickly shows himself as the Mandarin, a drawling Ben Kingsley offering anti-Western ""lessons"", usually ending with a claim of responsibility for something going boom without a locatable bomb device. After a casual approach leaves one of his friends in a coma and an overly arrogant invitation to his house leaves said house destroyed in an admittedly spectacular action sequence, Stark starts taking the Mandarin seriously, and the rest of the Movie takes off from there. The attack on the Stark Mansion is where we start taking the movie in general seriously as well. The reappearance of Maya coincides with a helicopter attack complete with missiles, explosions, and not one but two of the Stark Family suiting up thanks to the flying Mark 42 suit. Pepper suiting up is one of the many fan services done in this movie, and it is gratefully received. Following this adrenalin fuelled boom- fest, Stark finds himself alone, homeless, and really wishing he'd plugged the Mark 42 in to charge before going out. What follows then is where the movie begins to shine- Stark suit less, alone and working to track down the people behind the Mandarin and take them out for good. Without an Iron Suit Stark resorts to hand made weapons, exploding baubles and the help of a small kid named Hayley, cleverly sidestepping the superhero sidekick clich√© with snappy dialogue, and being downright rude, whilst never becoming unlikeable as a character. Quite a feat. From there the plot develops as organically as possible, with so many plot twists that revealing here would spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. The fact is, this a story about Tony Stark- not Iron Man, showing that as much as the suits are cool ( and they are- look out for the Mark 42), it's the man inside them, who really has our hearts and this film finally manages to balance some stunning action sequences with some real character development, Dark Knight rises style. Verdict: See it already! While not perfect, and not everyone may agree with Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the Mandarin, this is definitely Stark's best outing yet, and if it had turned out to be the Golden avengers swansong, then he certainly would have gone out with a bang. (wink,wink)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Iron Man 3, well just like the 2 prequels, it was ripe with action sequences that are guaranteed to leave you spellbound. Certain scenes,especially the one where he pulls 13 people falling from an airplane to safety, are so scintillating and yet so immaculate that you cannot stop yourself from indulging with the rest of the audience in praising that moment. Tony is still the suave guy whose ingenuity and cogency continue to hold the audiences captive but the Mandarin, the main antagonist, is so impeccable in his execution that Tony has to refine his ways. With the wrath of Mandarin reaching more and more blatant magnitude with every strike and with the Mandarin now sighting the final destruction of a nation, Tony can only consort with his own intellectual brilliance and his own ""toys"" to become the savior yet again. Will he be able to pull off the decisive victory, will he be able to overcome his own internal demons to triumph against the most devastative of alliances. He may very well do that because ultimately, He is the iron man.

Namely, outstanding special effects coupled with heavy doses of Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic one-liners and playful interactions with his supporting cast. Here, Iron Man 3 does not disappoint. However, after so many examples of Tony Stark and his exploits to draw from, this particular batch seems stale in comparison.I cannot find fault in the plot, despite my lack of comic-book knowledge and the incredible amount of animosity that crowd has towards the inconsistencies and utter lack of translation taking place between particular characters and events. Things unfold at a rapid pace, and even though you have a good feeling regarding how things will all turn out favoring Stark, there are moments where the film remembers (as the original Iron Man did) to remind the audience of his humanity. The standard cast of supporting actors returns, but Ben Kingsley adds some truly unexpected...things...to the film. No spoilers here, I assure you, but his presence is appreciated by this viewer.So, what's to blame for the disappointment? Simple comparison, of course, and its unavoidable after four films based solely (or largely) on Stark/Iron Man. It entertains, but it also leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The closing line of the credits, ""Tony Stark Will Return"", is about a 50/50 proposition; we all know the Avengers 2 is coming, but Iron Man 4? Something tells me this is as far as they can (or should) take the series. Something also tells me they won't stop, and continuing to cast the light on Iron Man may end up making the entire franchise (which has been mostly stellar, in my opinion) poorer for it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But if you're a fan of comics and superheros (which I hugely am), you might feel a little different about it. If you're a die hard Iron Man fan, you'll probably be disappointed. I'm not saying it's a bad movie because it DEFINITELY is not. However, there are some points in the movie that could alter the enjoyment of the film. Iron Man 3 was my 4th most anticipated movie of 2013 (after Man of Steel, The Hobbit 2, and Elysium) and I wouldn't blame anyone for really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were insanely incredible. While the movie doesn't pull through as well as the trailers, it's still somewhat of a treat.The premise of Iron Man 3 is actually quite interesting. It ties back to The Avengers in which Iron Man practically saved the whole world in the end. He gets anxiety and can't sleep at night because of his post-traumatic stress. The stuff really affected him big time. Then, The Mandarin has to come about and just bring him even more hell. I really liked the idea and where they were going with it. Tony Stark sort of has to use his wits and go on without the Iron Man suit for a bit. I liked that idea but it was a bit drawn out at times. However, the dialogue is quite on point (from the writer of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon so I would imagine so). Sometimes I felt the humor was a little overdone but, oh well, it's a summer movie, I'll deal with it. The humor does kind of have a purpose though. That's who Tony Stark is. He's a narcissist who throws in one liners whenever he wants. Robert Downey Jr. obviously owns the role; he was born to play Tony Stark. Guy Pearce is an awesome actor and he pretty much owns his role but we'll talk about his character a little later. Don Cheadle was great and I was happy to see how much more developed his character was in this movie. However, I didn't really care about Pepper Potts in this movie as much as I did in previous movies, even though the movie tries to make you care about her. One character the movie did good at making you care about early on was The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley pretty much owns the role and I was expecting him to be awesome. If you don't get the gist of The Mandarin; he's the archnemesis of Iron Man, his most important villain. Joker to Batman, Lex Luthor to Superman, Green Goblin to Spiderman, Mandarin to Iron Man. You gotta do him well. However something happens that just completely splits the decision of whether or not you can enjoy the rest of the film. But I won't say it since this is a spoiler-free review; I'll only do a spoiler filled review if enough of you guys ask for it. Anyways, it's a pretty pivotal sequence in the movie. When you watch the movie, I guarantee you'll know what I'm talking about. It was a great move as a film. But as an Iron Man film, it just wasn't the way it should've been done.A lot of what I didn't like about the movie are spoilers, so I can't really elaborate big on them in detail. I'll say this: a lot of what happened was really cheesy and cartoony, while other things were clich√©. That's the most I can say without spoiling anything. Additionally, there were some flaws in the conveyance of emotion, where I sort of felt for the characters but then something would happen that would completely change that. But still, the action is pretty sweet in this movie. Whenever the suit just latches itself onto Tony Stark, I feel like I've seen some of the coolest things in the world. And the final battle is awesome! And that's something we didn't get with the first two Iron Man movies. It was really entertaining and I was totally amazed until the end of it... another totally clich√© scene occurred. However, I rolled with it and watched the rest of the movie, which ended up being a lot of important scenes, going through unnoticeably in about a minute or two.All in all, Iron Man 3 is definitely better than Iron Man 2 but can't quite get up to the level that the first Iron Man did. I'd say it's the most entertaining of the series for casual movie goers though. It has some awesome action and insanely cool special effects. There's subtle humor pretty much everywhere in the movie and Tony Stark is still a very lovable character. However, it does get kinda drawn out at some points, and cartoony at other times. As a regular movie, I give it 8 out of 10 Noodles. But, I can't deny my own feelings of the directions taken in this movie that really detracted from the experience for me, big time. It really doesn't compare to the level of emotion and amazement of the first movie, or the level of epicness that The Avengers reached.

The plot driven film with its twists and turn unravel and definitely does not disappoint. The film doesn't need to lay any background as the first 2 films did but dives straight into the plot, where Tony (Downey) is faced with a new adversary- the Mandarin (Kingsley), who is amazing in the film. The Mandarin threatens everything that Tony loves and cares about and goes as far as attacking Tony in his own house. The many twists in the film are great and definitely separate it from Iron man and Iron 2, the is a lot of Tony out of the suit showing his vulnerable side rather than being an invulnerable machine all the time, which was definitely a change and was very intense. However, the plot driven film (although brilliant) did lack action at some points and it unloads it all at the end in a huge bravado of explosions and action (very good indeed) which some may prefer but many would have probably prefer more 'Iron man' action peppered throughout the whole film. This film is one of the best i've seen, it has action, comedy and a great plot. Also the Stan Lee cameo was brilliant. This is definitely worth a watch and of course there is an after credits scene. Enjoy","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

Tony Stark) for the fourth time (after playing the role in two other 'IRON MAN' films and 2012's 'THE AVENGERS', for which he was paid a whopping $50 to $70 million). Returning to their roles for the third time are Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts, Jon Favreau as security guard Happy Hogan and Paul Bettany as the voice of Stark's robotic companion Jarvis (it's actually the fourth time for Paltrow and Bettany if you count their cameos in 'THE AVENGERS'). Don Cheadle returns to play Stark's buddy Colonel James Rhodes for the second time (after replacing Terrence Howard from the first film). Joining the cast this time around are Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, James Badge Dale, Stephanie Szostak, William Sadler, Miguel Ferrer and Ty Simpkins (as the first kid sidekick in any 'Avengers' film). Favreau handed off directing duties to Downey Jr.'s pal Shane Black, who directed Downey in the 2005 action buddy film 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' (which he also wrote). Black penned an assortment of other popular 80s and 90s action buddy films as well like the original 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'THE LAST BOYSCOUT' and 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT'. He co-wrote 'IRON MAN 3' with Drew Pearce. The movie doesn't quite live up to the original two 'IRON MAN' films or 'THE AVENGERS' but it's still an excellent inclusion in the popular franchise.After the events of the alien invasion in 'THE AVENGERS' film Stark (Downey Jr.) now suffers from PTSD and spends most of his time making obsessive improvements to his 'Iron Man' suit (as well as building many others). As a result he's been neglecting Pepper (Paltrow) as she's visited by a man from both their pasts, scientist Aldrich Killian (Pearce), who works in regenerative healing research. A new terrorist, going by the name of 'The Mandarin' (Kingsley), has been bombing innocent civilians and harms Starks security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau). This pisses Stark off causing him to threaten the terrorist on TV as well as give him his address. 'The Mandarin' retaliates by attacking Stark at his home and putting both Pepper and an old fling of Stark's (Hall) in danger. Stark's suit is severely damaged as he's forced to battle his enemy with only his ingenuity and the help of a 10-year-old boy (Simpkins). When Pepper is kidnapped and put in grave danger as well Stark is forced to overcome all his inner demons in order to save the day.The story is based loosely on six-issues of the comic from 2005 and 2006 involving the ""Extremis"" story arc. 'Extremis' is the regenerative technology Killian's character is working on in the film. I didn't like this element of the movie so much but I did like the PTSD storyline and it was very interesting to see the otherwise super confident superhero suffering from panic attacks throughout the film. This is where the film's greatest strength lies. Of course the Tony Stark character is always one of the greatest comic superheroes to watch and Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as him. Does he deserve over ten times the pay as any other 'AVENGERS' cast member? I don't know but he is a joy to watch here once again and he does help make the film. Black was the perfect director to replace Favreau and the other additions to the cast are good as well. Pearce and Kingsley aren't nearly as memorable or powerful villains as the ones in the first two films though and Black's screenplay isn't quite as clever or well written as those other movies either. Still it is a good addition to the series; flawed but still about as much as you can expect from the third installment in a blockbuster action series like this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

As such, I won't spoil the plot for you.I am not a comic book fan, so I had no expectations going into this movie, except what was promised by the trailers, and of course the previous Iron Man movies. I enjoy good movies of any genre equally, so I was really not prejudiced in any way. I thought the movie was pretty terrible, and very underwhelming and disappointing overall.Let's start with the good.Acting. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always. Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce are both predictably solid as well. The rest of the cast does not stand out, but overall the acting was a high point of the movie.That's it. The acting (particularly RDJ) was the redeeming feature of the film. It's for that, and the good production value, that I rated this a 4/10.Now, onto the bad.The plot. It's convoluted, uninspired, and just plain boring. The movie is not about Iron Man being awesome, it's about the drama in Tony Stark's life as he tries to get over his near-death experience in The Avengers. The film plays out like a drama, with a bunch of weak sub- plots pulling at it from all directions. It's predictable at every step of the way, and it never really gets anywhere.The dialogue. This movie strives hard to be funny. Tony Stark in particular is throwing one liners left and right throughout the movie. It works a few times, but more often than not it just falls flat. In any case, you've got a lot clich√©s again, especially when it comes to how Tony's inner struggle unfolds. Weak and very boring.The action. There is little more action in this movie than there is in the trailer. In fact, I'd say the trailer makes the action look a lot better than it does in the movie itself. The action scenes themselves are OK, but very few for an ""action"" movie.The trailers are selling this as a dark, almost Nolanesque look at Iron Man, but it's not that at all. It's just a pitiful mess that doesn't know what it wants to be. There's very little Iron Man in this movie. Whenever Tony gets into a suit, it breaks down or malfunctions right away, and it suddenly feels like his tech is being manufactured on a boat somewhere.It's also worth noting that whereas Iron Man suit(s) were few and unique, in this movie he goes through perhaps 15 of them, making them feel more akin to pairs of sneakers.To wrap this up, I would say that if you found what the trailers are presenting to be interesting, you will probably be disappointed. If you liked Iron Man 1, you will be disappointed. If you enjoy action, you will be disappointed.This overly long movie will present you with seemingly hours of exposition. What's worse is that it's so predictable, that you feel like you've seen it all before even after the first few frames. Given another chance, I would never go to see this in the cinema again. It's just not worth the money.","23 out of 46 found this helpful.

Some people call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. Lesson number one: Heroes, there is no such thing.¬®Iron Man 3 is the first film following the events of The Avengers, and if you wondered if the movie was going to lose entertainment value considering it shifts the focus back to only one superhero, you were wrong. Despite not having all those great characters together, Robert Downey Jr. manages to capture the audience's attention once again with his vibrant portrayal of Tony Stark. He has been the main reason why I 've enjoyed these films so much because they are just a perfect fit. New director, Shane Black (Lethal Weapon), who worked with Downey in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, knows that the secret to the success of this franchise is letting Downey be himself and focus on his character. In this third film Starks is stripped down of his toys and questions whether or not he is worth anything without the suit. The Nolan effect which has been a key element in superhero movies is present at the beginning of the movie. We see a much more vulnerable Tony Stark, who is suffering from panic attacks due to the events in The Avengers, and who makes mistakes like putting his beloved Potts in danger due to his big mouth. This first part of the movie didn't work very well because it felt like a different kind of hero, but the effect wears off real quickly and Starks is once again back to his normal self once he realizes he is what makes the suit and not vice versa. Having his character stripped of his toys and having to manage to depend on simple things once again to defeat his foes is what made this film so entertaining. It was like if Stark had to go back to the basics and rediscover himself, although he never loses his goofiness. The villains in this film were also a huge improvement from its predecessor. This might not be as great as the original Iron Man, but it is an improvement from the first sequel. Black did a decent job following Jon Favreau's work and he manages to keep the franchise afloat. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has to face a new set of villains in this third film which takes place after the events of The Avengers. A terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is terrorizing the world through several explosions across the globe. Meanwhile Tony has found himself absorbed trying to perfect his suits and may have crossed the line trying to overprotect his love interest, Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). The reason behind his obsession is that he can 't afford to lose what he loves most. When Stark threatens The Mandarin, his army destroys his home leaving him for dead. Stark has to hide out while he figures out more information about this terrorist. He discovers some information about an AIM program run by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) which seems to be involved with the well known terrorist. Without being able to use all his equipment and technology, Stark is forced to use his intellect and capabilities to defeat his new enemies, while at the same time trying to protect Potts. Along his quest he makes some new friends, like the young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps gather some materials for him to work with, and counts with his always reliable friend, Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle). Rebecca Hall also has a small role in this film as Killian's assistant, and Paul Bettany lends his voice once again to Jarvis. As you would expect, the visuals in this film are great and the action sequences are also very entertaining. The two hours go by in a flash thanks to some decent pacing. The franchise doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it still offers some great summer popcorn fun entertainment. Iron Man 3 is the perfect way to start off the 2013 summer and we can only hope the rest of the films keep this streak going. I loved the little twists and turns the film takes here by making you think it is going to be so much darker than the rest of The Avengers, but then all of a sudden it returns to its playful self. The Marvel universe is one that doesn't have to be taken so seriously because we have fun with the lightness of the characters and situations. The entire spin with The Mandarin was incredible. I wasn't too pleased with the opening minutes of the film considering Stark was much more vulnerable and not as fun as his usual self, but once he got his confidence back everything seemed to play out really well. Black is a master at mixing some great action scenes with tons of comedy (Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are proof of that) and we see it once again with Iron Man 3. Downey Jr. continues to deliver with his clever lines and charismatic self. He is the only reason we need to want to go see this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

First of all, if you're a comics fanboy and you want the movie to closely adhere to the comics and not do anything contrary to that, then yes you won't like it. For those who have a more open mind and can simply watch a movie without expectations or preconceived judgments, then this movie is actually quite good. In terms of story, I'd actually say it was better than the first Ironman movie. The pacing is better, and the story is a lot deeper. Of course it doesn't quite have the WOW impact of the first movie simply because the first movie had that ""first time wow factor"" involved. Here, the suits are pretty much what you've seen before. But the action is better than almost any Marvel movie to date. Only the Avengers comes close to the action.There are a lot of funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie is a lot more serious than the first 2 Ironmans. So give this movie a shot. Watch it with an open mind, and you'll be extremely pleased.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Everything you'd ever want from an Iron Man film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2787638/?ref_=tt_urv","chrismartin181-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19918213/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2013","After The Avengers set the bar so high last year in terms of how to make a super hero movie truly fantastic there's been a lot of pressure on Iron Man 3 to match it's success. Does it succeed? S'pose you'll need to read on. Or watch the film, whatevs.Speaking just about the Iron Man films here I'm willing to say this is the best in the series. Iron Man showed a great origin story and it's sequel, as much as it was a great little ride, was a little underwhelming when compared directly to the original. It just didn't seem to be on the same scale and there was a feeling that something new needed to be brought to the table to make it feel fresh. Iron Man 3 is the film you hoped Iron Man 2 would be. It brings new elements to the story and the decision to give Tony Stark panic attacks and anxiety problems is one that I feel works wonderfully in the film. He's still cocky and in that suit virtually indestructible but showing that weaker side, his inner demons eating him up, makes him seem far more relatable and more of a 'real' man than this kick ass invincible human he has become since the other films and The Avengers. I also like how what happened in The Avengers is talked about sometimes and not just glanced over as something that happened at some other unrelated time. It's the presence of gods and aliens and worm-holes in New York that have pushed Tony over the edge which makes sense really. Finding out about all that stuff and being the peoples' hope to defend them from it all will fairly mess a guy up. No characters fade into the background here and everyone, the heroes and villains of the film, put on a great performance. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are probably my favourite movie couple ever. They have issues with one another but the lengths he goes to to protect her remind you that the love is there. In terms of story I think it's just above standard comic-book movie fare that changes the focus just enough to make it stand out from the other films. Whereas the Iron man series has usually been machine vs machine, Iron Man 3 changes the formula more to machine vs super humans. There's little twists here and there but nothing to over complicate or at the same time really revolutionise the story.It provides a great vessel to showcase the incredible action sequences and relationship development between characters. Speaking of the action is as spectacular as you'd expect. There are never really any moments of slow down as the film goes from action scene to action scene with elements of the story acting as bridges between them. Two particular highlights are the Stark household being blown up by 100 explosions and a great scene involving Iron Man saving people as they fall out a plane. Fun fact everyone- the plane scene was actually shot with a sky-diving team actually falling through the air to give it an extra edge of realism instead of just shooting it on a green screen. It really pays off and makes you appreciate the extra mile the film makers are willing to go to make these scenes truly epic. The finale, without spoiling any of it, is completely awesome. It's everything you could ever want if you're an Iron Man fan or indeed a fan of action movies in general.Another element that works in Iron Man 3's favour is the humour that rarely misses it's mark. It's not enough to cheapen the film and make it feel goofy but the odd remark here or there just keeps the film light enough and give it a personality. Stark's impromptu nicknames he gives to people never fail to get a chuckle. So to return to my first question- Is Iron Man 3 as good as The Avengers? I'll put it like this. If The Avengers is a massive cooked breakfast buffet with trays upon trays of delicious food, Iron Man 3 is a specific tray of perfect bacon.The Avengers felt like more of a special event bringing lots of exciting characters and stories together while Iron Man 3- while not quite the event The Avengers was, stands up by itself as a terrific action comic book film that ends the Iron Man trilogy on a massive high- assuming there won't be an Iron Man 4 of course.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

And I do not regret it.Firstly unlike the comics I read in my youth where superheroes could accept without blinking Aliens (which is what human-like Loki and Thor are) followed by an invasion of Chitauris (less and less humanoid), we see Stark coming up with accepting things ourselves would take quite sometimes to digest. T Stark also has to come up withe the consequence of his behaviour in the past. In short the missed opportunities of IM2 are reworked and this time they are finally reflected upon and amends are made.True, Disney being Disney they introduced a kid and I admit I had a gag/heave moment but the kid cheesy story is quickly sorted out and the interaction is rather limited (bless you RDJ, kids are either stellar scene thieves or kill-joy meaningful text lines).Gwyneth Paltrow was good, very good. in fact, she is perfect match for RDJ/TS so go girl power... The villain was unexpected and good. Not perfect but quite decent though I am still wondering why he chose to be a villain unless as per IM, it got personal... My husband whose youth and teenage years were MARVEL comics free (yes these people do exist, they are rare but they exist) enjoyed the movie and loved B Kingsley who is a marvellous actor. Whose comic timing was showing in the Mrry Wives of Windsor (yes I remember that TV movie).So the Mandarin: no spoiler here... but The Mandarin/Ironman is just like the Manhattan Attack/Avengers for MARVEL, a way to exorcise and push to where they belong the bogeymen of Bin Laden. Mandarin tapes are crying out loud Osama and Manhattan Buildings destruction by the space whales was the twin towers (I live in Europe) Does MARVEL feel it is time to move and call these /waful /people for the cartoon characters they are just like when they started to show on telly Hogan's Heroes.Regardless it was enjoyable,made me think about time and how people start to digest and overcome the emotional consequences of RL tragedies. As for the post credits scene, it was a pleasure to meet again the Hulk. 'we have a Hulk' and I hope to see Ruffallo in his own movie, he deserves it.Go and flock your movie theatres. Enjoy it. Have fun. Do not listen to the Moaning-Myrtles. Any show who respects women, is uplifting, where the hero admits to PTSD and imperfection and where baddies get really punished by where they have sinned ... oh, go, guys, you will not regret it! 9/10 because I very seldom give 10","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Iron Man 3 opens with an untold backstory, just not the kind you might expect, given such a statement. After that, the movie takes the post-Avengers route, which is to say it shows one piece of the aftermath. The impact of these preceding events is apparent in the first act, but offers little more than a character roadblock, in the long run. Beyond that, the threat of a new villain is brought up consistently enough (through broadcasts) to warrant Tony Stark's curiosity. The rest is left to be seen first-hand.Iron Man 3 returns much of what was missing from the second film: delight. The laughs and conversations can definitely get obnoxious, but even when they fall flat, there's still an odd gravitation to find towards it all. At least, with the very potential exception of the film's key plot twist. Spoilers will not arise, but those in charge of the script choices really jumped the shark here. This will be an experience-destroying moment for some, especially given what is initially built up. From there on, the plot begins to fade away as action is (finally) incorporated on a more frequent basis. Like the laughs themselves, Iron Man 3 has tone shifts splashing left and right. To say the film loves leaping from detrimental threats to light-hearted scoffing is definitely an understatement. If it wasn't so brash--usually courtesy of Robert Downey Jr., you could almost pass it off as dark humor. Whether it works or not rests entirely on the viewer's emotional flexibility.One certainty, however, is that the cast had a fun time doing this film. While there are some serious scenes, a lot of room is made for whimsical or play-along-with-it moments. Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle and Ben Kingsley get a lot of the latter. In fact, if there's anyone who gives Robert Downey Jr. a run for the suck-it-up award, it would have to be former series- director Jon Favreau, even with his brief screen time. There really aren't any weak points in the cast, although Gwyneth Paltrow could've had more footage during the second act. Where Iron Man 3 shines the most, unsurprisingly, is in the action sequences. No, they aren't always plausible. Then again, neither is half the technology Tony Stark has at his disposal, so credibility is far from top priority. As Guy Pearce says in the movie, ""ever since that guy came down with the hammer, things haven't been the same."" Nonetheless, this leads to some pretty impressive stuff. The attack on Stark's mansion is as thrilling as you'd expect, while the climax almost feels like it got mixed up with The Adventures of Tintin in some spots. But given all of the style, it's tough to complain.The final word on Iron Man 3 is that it's a very misleading film. Things start off quite serious before quickly turning comical. There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but it isn't always for the best reasoning. Still, everyday audience members won't have a problem rolling with what comes around, simply because it means plenty of entertainment. Iron Man 3 is a worthy successor and inclusion to the franchise, but the first film has continued to prove a tough piece for Marvel to match.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Will our hero be able to vanquish his foe and reclaim his place this time too? Will loved ones be sacrificed in this quest? Will our hero get a fitful redemption in the end? All these expected questions are answered in Ironman 3, topped with a resolution that reminded me of Kevin Spacey's final monologue from American Beauty. You can even predict how the camera will move around its characters, when it shall pan on its characters' faces and the kind of expressions the characters will give at a particular moment. You may not be a musician but you'll know what kind of music will be played for the concluding part of the Ironman Series. You'll basically get everything you expected from Ironman 3, and this is the reason why Ironman 3 feels predictable. Is it a bad film? Not necessarily. Did I find it unbearable? Oh, yes. In short, I couldn't bear Ironman 3 not because it was a badly made movie, but because I couldn't put up with its predictability. It's only been my second science fiction film this year (the other being Star Trek Into Darkness) and I'm already fed up with the 'seen one, seen them all' vibe I get from this genre. You breathe the same stinking air of bullet firings, explosions, bomb-blasts and missile-assaults every single time, the only difference being that the 3D brings the assault to your senses and sensibility even closer. And the worst part is that a majority of the audience has acclimatized itself with this stinking air, and this is why Iron Man 3 has made close to a billion dollars. I'm sure there's an Iron Man 4 in the nearing future; the producers wouldn't discontinue this profit-making franchise that's hot on almost everybody's minds. So much for the American Beauty-style ending! So don't fret people, you can get your supply of stinking air probably after two years. Till then, you have other options to assault your sense and sensibility, so don't panic!Ironman 3 starts with Tony Stark, the face of Stark Enterprises narrating about his journey towards 'enlightenment' and a 'new beginning' with his quintessentially sardonic delivery. So at first we have a scene of the past, which happens at a New Year's party with Tony acting like the lovable jerk and ladies man as usual. He meets Maya Hansen, a scientist and is amazed by the invention she is working on ‚Äì an experimental regenerative treatment to allow recovery from crippling injuries. The same night he is also accosted by Aldrich Killian, a disabled, eccentric scientist who offers Tony a place in his company called Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M) which the latter rejects, humiliating Killian. Cut to some years later. Stark is working on advanced Ironman suits and spends most of his time in the basement with his artificial intelligence companion Jarvis. He sleeps little and suffers from post traumatic stress disorder due to his near-death experience (in the first Avengers film). His relationship with his girlfriend Pepper also takes a toll because of his strangely aloof behavior and because he spies on her on one occasion through his former bodyguard and head of security of Starks Enterprise, Happy Hogan. The occasion: Pepper, who's now Stark Enterprises' CEO, is approached by Killian, who's dapper and dashing now and demonstrates his brain modification experiment to her, proposing a joint alliance between Stark Enterprise and his company A.I.M. She declines his offer, finding the experiment to be too dangerous but Killian nevertheless casts a spell on her.Meanwhile, there is news of Mandarin, a ruthless terrorist who claims that his organization The Ten Rings is responsible for the bombings at various American landmarks. Sparks doesn't issue any public statements about Mandarin until Happy is gravely injured in one of the blasts, after which he publicly threatens to take Mandarin down. There's another conspiracy brewing up, as super-strong men and women capable of generating extreme heat haunt the country. Starks, using his advanced technology, finds out later that Mandarin may not be responsible for the blast which injured Happy. Maya Hansen, the scientist whom he slept with after being wowed by her invention years ago, returns to inform him that his boss, Killian may be plotting to kill him. The game begins for Tony Starks ‚Äì will he be able to overcome his post traumatic stress disorder and become the Ironman he was before, or will this be the last we see of Ironman?I know I haven't summarized the film well, but I can't really help it as my interest in Ironman 3 dwindled after the first twenty-five minutes. No doubt the screen wipes, cuts and dialogues do make the movie feel like a true comic book adaptation but I was bugged by the constant punch-lines that everyone's treating like a work of genius, bugged by the elaborate special effects and totally anxious to get out of the theatre. Maybe when I catch the television premiere of this film, I won't hate it as much and my review would be less harsh and better written. But for now, I can only express what I felt when I watched it in theatre ‚Äì it was tedium.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

He is joined by Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as Colonel Rhodes.

"7","/10","At least they made a decent sequel to iron man this time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3695984/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanskywalker-87402","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73361392/?ref_=tt_urv","29 April 2017","Marking the commencement of the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe after the first one culminated with The Avengers, Iron Man 3 presents a definite improvement over its insufferably insipid predecessor but it still falls short of the magical experience that was the first Iron Man film. However, it does carry a new energy & has a refreshing vibe to it, thanks to the new director at helm.Iron Man 3 continues the story of Tony Stark who's recovering from post-traumatic stress caused by the events of The Avengers. Unable to sleep & genuinely afraid of losing what he loves, Stark's life is turned upside down after he issues a threat to a radical terrorist who retaliates by destroying his personal world, leaving him far more vulnerable than ever before & forcing him to rebuild from the scratch.Co-written & directed by Shane Black, Iron Man 3 really benefits from a fresh perspective & is an enjoyable ride for the most part but is also marred by its attempt to try out way too many things at once, out of which only a few work out in a convincing manner. Technical aspects are finely executed for its Cinematography favours a slightly darker tone, Editing steadily paces its narrative while Brian Tyler's adds more vibrancy to its plot.Coming to the performances, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley & Rebecca Hall join the reprising cast & ably fill up their given roles while Robert Downey Jr. once again manages to impress the most. The best thing about this sequel is the position it puts Tony Stark in & Downey Jr. does a terrific job in bringing that vulnerability on the screen. Also, while I was a bit furious at what they did with Iron Man's arch-nemesis, I did later warm up to what their intent was here.On an overall scale, Iron Man 3 is a solid follow up to Iron Man & you don't even have to go through the crap that was Iron Man 2 to get to this one. The film's intent to cover the darker issues at hand while keeping itself light-hearted & plenty of fun is a combination that doesn't gel so well, is at friction on many occasions & is bound to divide its viewers, but its improvement over everything that was so wrong with its predecessor nevertheless makes it a welcome chapter, if not a worthy one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you enjoyed the first couple of Iron man movies the chances are you'll like this one as well.The movie is obviously at it's best when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is showboating. As with the first couple of instalments there are plenty of scenes where this happens. The character isn't really fleshed out any further though. The villain of the film would also have benefited from a couple of extra scenes to flesh out their character. The film isn't a masterpiece, but it's a pretty pleasant couple of hours of mindless fun.I saw this movie in 3d, but don't really think that helped or hindered my enjoyment of the movie.

"8","/10","Thrilling movie for fans of the Iron Man franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2793575/?ref_=tt_urv","Left-Handed_Liz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11815917/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2013","Ever since Batman Begins in 2005, cinema fans have been living in a world ruled by what I have termed Dark Knight Syndrome: Action-adventure and comic book movies nowadays are expected to be cerebral and dark, and not in the way of the noir-ish, theatrical Batman films of Tim Burton. While action movies have always had a high body count and buildings exploding, the consequences weigh heavier on today's mainstream movie hero: Loved ones suffer and die. The hero is put in a situation where he is stripped of his power, all his secret weapons, and forced to literally fight for his life. Themes run throughout of revenge and atonement, facing inner demons and past mistakes. And while such themes are powerful, all that brooding weighs as heavily on the audience as it does the characters. Which is why, for as much as I love the complexities of films like the now-completed Dark Knight Trilogy and the rebooted James Bond, I truly enjoy Iron Man for its ability to keep the pulse racing, but also to laugh at itself and its over-the-top situations, and keep spirits high. Iron Man has been framed from the outset as the story of Tony Stark's path toward redemption. Like Batman, he chooses to use his wealth and power for good, but rather than fighting crime as the result of a personal tragedy, he becomes a hero in the hopes of cleaning up his act, while somehow never losing his hedonism and arrogance. This third film continues the theme of reckoning for past sins, opening with narration from Tony himself featuring the usual old hat about the past coming back to bite you in the ass, and inner demons and so on. We see Tony focused on his own vulnerability and mortality in a much more believable way than the previous film (where, ironically, he was actually dying), as he throws himself into creating more mech suits, sleep deprived and plagued by nightmares. The focus here is on the man, not the mech, as the two are treated as almost separate characters, especially here, with the suit being able to move on its own (or dragged through the snow like a sled when de-powered). Also similar to The Dark Knight Rises is the film's interpretation of the Mandarin, an all-too-familiar mishmash of foreign affectations and over-the-top mannerisms, and the inevitable twist reveal of who really holds the power. Where this film differs from, and is in a certain way superior to, other blockbusters of a similar nature, is in the humor and high spirits it has throughout. Iron Man as a film franchise has always had a quirky, out-of-left-field sense of comedy, which can hit its target or miss completely, and come even in dramatic or intense scenes. Even though the films' attempts to make connections with the War on Terror and the Iraq War can frequently seem crass, if not downright exploitative, I believe that, if this film is any evidence, the effort was to heal, rather than to traumatize. The theme throughout is one of healing and reconciliation (Tony's anxiety attacks are all related to the alien ""terrorist"" attack in New York that occurred in The Avengers), and suspension of disbelief is stretched far enough that it's hard to call BS when the main players all get happy endings. As a serious movie, Iron Man 3 is uneven, to say the least. In this case, though, I'd say being an entertaining and interesting movie is more important. The action scenes are absolutely brilliant, with shining moments for the supporting cast. Gwyneth Paltrow's scene in the Iron Man suit is sadly brief, but she gets a few great moments later on; meanwhile, Don Cheadle as Rhodey gets some truly impressive action stunts sans armor. Though some may find it repetitive, I loved the innovation of the coded armor, which flies through the air and assembles piece by piece. If nothing else, it made the fights more interesting, and was certainly better utilized than the suitcase-portable armor from the second film. Overall, coming from someone who's a fan of fun, interesting movies, even when they don't know the source material very well, I give Iron Man 3 a solid thumbs-up. If a movie has you jumping up and down in the aisle after it's over, it's doing something right. The first movie, I felt entertained; the second, I felt nothing. Third, I was grinning like an idiot. ""Tony Stark will return,"" the stinger promises, and I'll be quite excited to see what he'll do when he does.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

After seeing The Dark Knight Rises last year it left some impressions on me. In my opinion that was the best batman movie out of the latest ones and it being the third one I expected the same out of Iron Man 3. I'm not saying its a bad movie but it missed out on some key factors that would make it a great movie. The writing was decent with the exception that the outcome of most battles were determined by a conveniently placed object, weapon, etc. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting was pretty good but a couple of the minor roles were off. Maya Hansen didn't do as good of a job as I had hoped and Gwyneth Paltrow overdid it a bit in the end. The movie did have some good points though. For example some of the story didn't exactly follow DC's original comic version-such as the Mandarin and Iron Patriot - but it was written into the plot well enough to make die hard DC fans love it. Despite the bad things said about the movie I did enjoy watching it. I highly recommend any fan of comic books, superheroes or movies in general to go see it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not able to cope or fully recover, Stark hides himself amongst his suits and gadgets neglecting his partner Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow in a more substantial role this time around). The story starts though with a flashback, going back to 1999, before Stark became Iron Man.The events that unfolds, informs us of how a budding young scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) comes to Stark with a new idea which unfortunately, he dismisses, this in turn results on his past decisions coming back to haunt him... Fast forward to the future and there is a more imminent danger in the form of The Mandarin (played with great joy and humour by Sir Ben Kingsley), who targets the US and threatens to kill civilians via bombings.Stark ignores the publicity and news on the Madarian and doesn't see it as his duty to get involve but when his ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Favreau), becomes one of the latest victims and suffers from major injuries, Stark issues a threat on national news and announces his address to Mandarin which was an unfortunately the wrong thing to do.....There is quite a bit of substance to the story and there is a some choice dialogue littered throughout the film. Not really surprising come from the director Shane Black. Anyone who is familiar with his screenplays will know he has some killer quotable lines (just check out The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Stark is once again imbued with great charm and retorts, but it isn't only the heroes who come out with funny dialogues, even the henchmen come out with some comedic lines.This is a much improvement compared to the last film, which did feel a little tired and more of warm up towards the big gathering of superheroes that was The Avengers, this time around Downey Jr is given more of a job of acting, instead of just his face in a helmet. The film's logically progression is to show what he can do with out his powers, or in this case his multi million dollar suits and gadgets....which is of course to rely on his wits and charm.It's probably fair to say that this is more of Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man film. That's not to say it's a bad thing. There are still some amazing set pieces within the film to satisfy the action junkies (most notably standout would be the multiple passengers rescue in mid air). The plot just feels more meaningful and thought out. If this is to Downey's Jr last stint as Iron Man (he will reprise the role in the forthcoming Avengers sequel), this is a good send off to a character he has made his own and anyone looking to step into those red Iron boots, will have a hellava job to match (let alone improve) his interpretation.read more of my reviews here: http://fsfilm.blogspot.co.uk/","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A movie that could have been better executed, yet still succeeds in what it wanted to do.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3066463/?ref_=tt_urv","TheAvenger95","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34179104/?ref_=tt_urv","11 August 2014","'Iron Man 3' takes off where 'Marvel's The Avengers' ended. After an invasion by an alien horde, led by the Asgardian Loki, the world is adjusting to the idea of aliens and monsters and gods inhabiting the universe; and our hero, Tony Stark, is left with mental scars and panic attacks after the battle of New York. Not only that, but he now has a few ghosts from his past to take care of as well: a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (who was responsible for Tony's kidnapping and multiple other evil-doings throughout the movies), and Aldrich Killian ‚Äì a scientist gone mad after an event revolving around Tony Stark and broken promises.This is by far the best character driven movie of all the Marvel movies thus far - which is a nice change of pace. In terms of story, there is quite a few things left to be desired, but if you're not going to nit- pick or analyze it too harshly, you'll enjoy the overall narrative. The pacing was quite brisk, which was fantastic. The previous Iron Man movies had a much steadier pace (and a fairly underwhelming third act), but this beast was the exact opposite: you never know where it's going next and it doesn't ever stop to catch a breath.The main characters were all very well fleshed out. Robert Downey Jr. took his performance to a whole new level. We see such a different side of the character we've grown used to over the past few years, and it worked extremely well... If anything, the end of the movie really makes you wonder where things will go next. Because of that, this movie will ""reignite"" many people's interest in this character (other movie franchises such as the Pirates of the Caribbean could learn a thing or two from this). Don Cheadle (Rhodey) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) had much more important roles this time round, which was great. I don't feel like I have more respect or admiration for the characters after seeing the movie, but it was nice that they were given something to work with besides ""best friend"" and ""love interest"". Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of The Mandarin character will be a love/hate thing with most, but whichever way you feel, there's no denying it: his actual performance was good. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) kind of played the token ""evil scientist"" role. Even his motivations for doing what he does comes across as a clich√©, but for the most part, he's an enjoyable character... despite being a little forgettable. The ""kid-helper"", Harley Keener, was something I was very nervous about, and the inclusion of such a character could very well have ruined the movie, but oddly, it worked! I'm not a fan of child actors, but this kid didn't come across as the usual ""Oh golly! I'm a little kid helping a superhero!""-type character. It actually felt very real and the chemistry between him and RDJ was great. The other characters weren't given much to do unfortunately... so there isn't really anything worth pointing out on that front.As far as the action and VFX goes, it was insane. Visually, this is a very different movie than any of the other Marvel movies - and I can't stress that enough... DIFFERENT. In a way, it almost felt a little too far out there at times (especially with the ways in which Stark now ""suits up""), but when you have Norse gods and green rage monsters in the same ""world"", I think it's a given that people should provide a little leeway if they want to enjoy the ride. Some if the CGI shots seemed overly fake (again, mainly the way in which Stark gets in and out of his suits), but there are plenty of brilliant shots that'll make you forget about those. In terms of spectacle and scale, don't let the early reactions fool you: this isn't as big as The Avengers, or as funny - but it is the closest we might get in a while. For me, the action wasn't as memorable as The Avengers' either. For instance, in The Avengers we had iconic superhero fights and moments, whereas in this one, I couldn't really find any iconic ""poses"" or ""moves"".Other aspects of the film: The score was great. It's not as memorable as Ramin Djawadi's score for the first movie, but this one will most definitely go down as one of the more memorable scores in superhero-movie-history. The 3D was surprisingly exceptional. There aren't many pop-out effects, and that's exactly what makes it work so well! It adds depth and makes you feel closer to the characters. In fact, some of the best 3D moments in this movie were during the intimate, dialogue driven scenes. The post credit scene was fun. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it was super fun. That scene at the end really ties the movie up in a nice little bow.One's enjoyment of the movie really depends on where one's loyalties lie. If you're just a casual movie fan, looking for a good time, you'll love this movie. However, if you're a comic book die-hard or a cinephile, I think there might very well be a few things that'll annoy you, and distract you from enjoying the film to its fullest. My advice would be to go into the theater with an open mind, and your expectations dialed down a bit. Also, don't try and compare it to The Avengers (which is what I tried to do) - if you can do that, you'll have a fantastic time.In summation, I'd like to reiterate that this is a wonderful, character- driven film, and extremely different from any of MCU's other films.

This movie falls in line with the Avengers!!!! One of the things people need to keep in mind is that this is a movie about a comic book character! If you are a comic lover, then you know they are supposed to be funny, over the top, great dialogue, action, and at times the things that happen are unbelievable! Iron Man 3 is all of those things and more.This movie has everything going for it! Wonderful acting, amazing special effects, a great an entertaining story, spectacular humor, and a really cool twist! I actually think that this movie is better than Iron Man 2! The first one is my favorite because it is an origin film of how it all began! Please do not let the negative reviews deter you from going to see it!

Kingsley is great with all his accent & grueling diction. Pearce is vindictive & absolutely in his character all way long. The villains impress more here than the superhero (or his friends range - from a kid (& his sister) to suspicious women) does.

But, second half is marvelously carved. Good direction. Good post-credit Easter egg. Nice rendition.Music reminded me of Inception & it is terrific. Screenplay/effects/SFX/CGI is all top notch & make a great complement.But... IM3 is vague in its foundation, so yes I spent some rupees for the movie, but I won't buy the BluRay (& that would cripple my MCUniverse collection along with that disastrous CAmerica) because it is just not worth. The 3D was bad, probably because of the post-production hassle.Why do I rate it 7.7 out of 10? Because I enjoyed the 2nd half more than I enjoyed the last installment of The Dark Knight or if you are a Batman fan... sixth & seventh installment of Star Trek. The lights, luster & adrenaline is pumped up towards the end, while the conclusion is kinda kinky (read bongo-bongo).BOTTOM LINE: If you follow the Marvel Universe, IM3 is a pretty relishing watch but not great as its predecessors...Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Driven by the personality of the character Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.'s iconic role), Writer-director Shane Black along with Writer Drew Pearce have churned out a film that charms us in spite of ourselves, similar to the way a young, unattached Starks might lure a young woman under his sheets. And like those conquests, we allow ourselves to be duped even though we see it coming.Even if we haven't watched another Iron Man film, we know this character‚Äîcocky/funny, so cool that sometimes he impresses his own self, but with a heart of gold, if not a chest arc reactor, underneath it all. It's the role that defines Robert Downey Jr. as an actor. Whether the man was this character before he took on the role or Tony Starks consumed him is a matter of the chicken and the egg, but to the fans of late night talk shows, the difference between the real man's personality and that of his character is zilch. It makes you wonder if he's doing any acting.The film opens in the standard fashion of the third movie of a trilogy, if I'm to believe the words of a self-aware character in the third ""Scream"" installment‚Äîit takes us back into the past and develops a story-line that was lurking all along. Starks tells us as much as he narrates the introduction scene. So we know this is going somewhere‚Äîsomebody is going to get slighted and hatch some diabolical plan. Starks lures a beautiful botanist (the lovely Rebecca Hall) into bed while raising the hopes of a fledgling scientist (Guy Pearce, in a bland role) desperate to speak with him. If he happens to disappoint either one of them, that's just Starks being Starks, plus he can always fall back on the old standby that he was drunk.We fast forward to the present and find Starks taking a break from the superhero game, dealing with anxiety stemming from the aftermath of his last adventure, and tinkering around with building new Iron Men. Yes, for those uninitiated, He Is Iron Man. And the innovations to his new prototype suit will be utilized later in the film in any creative way imaginable, as well as the numerous older models. In fact, the artificial intelligence Starks has installed into his suits surpasses the intelligence and wit of most humans, and it in itself could be considered superhero material. Alas, Tony's tinkering days seem numbered as a new threat appears on the national stage, a menacing terrorist known as the Mandarin. When we see the Mandarin played by the distinguished Ben Kingsley, we know something's up. This is going to be a juicy role, and when his true nature is revealed, we are far from disappointed. For now, the character confuses us. He says some wise things about human nature amidst Native American imagery, and seems to even brandish a Native American accent, but he also appears to be your stereotypical Middle-Eastern terrorist. What exactly are his motives and aims, to take over the world or what? This part of the movie was not well developed to me, and becomes murkier when more Bad Guys pile up. As Tony Starks investigates this new threat, supporting characters go a long way in playing off of Starks' personality. It leads to a lot of wisecracks and clever lines‚Äîa lot of comedy‚Äîwhich all manage to set Starks up for the one-liner to trump them all. I was especially impressed by a young boy who kind of serves as a young Tony Starks, played skillfully by Ty Simpkins. Starks and the script don't infantilize the boy, but respect the character by providing him with just the right amount of intelligence and maturity. Yes, little boys can be strong characters post Star Wars Episode I, featuring a mop-topped little Annie contractually obligated to yell, ""Yippee!"" in every scene he's in.The makers of this film have keyed into Starks so much that he doesn't even need to wear the Iron Man suit for much of the movie. Maybe because I generally don't like superhero movies or tedious action, I didn't hate them for it, and since his character has been developed over three movies previous to this one, every other character can just riff and react to him. Starks drags us and his suit along and it doesn't really matter who wants to take over the world and why. At times the character so coolly goes about his business that I wish the role carried some extra gravitas, but I do get a sense of that later on when Iron Man must deal with an incident on a plane. This is one moment when we're reminded that Iron Man is a superhero in a sequence that you just may find exhilarating if you remembered to check that disbelief. Still, I never got the sense that the stakes were that high or Iron Man was in any real peril. And the closing action sequence for a movie like this always seems to take place in some dreary abandoned warehouse or its equivalent, and this is film is no exception.The film has more than one surprise, which goes a long way to offset its standard comic book clich√©s. The Iron Man suit does everything we imagine it can potentially do and more, in ways that both pleasantly surprise us and cheat us. Seeing Jon Favreau in the film in what basically amounts to a cameo, although a character vital to running the plot, took me out of the movie. It made me think, oh, that's the guy who directed the first Iron Man; did he direct this one too? Directors, in this case former directors, need to avoid putting themselves in movies. Especially if their name is M. Night Shayamalan . And the movie's longer than you want it to be. But it's entertaining and exceeded my expectations.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am not a comic book purist so I quite enjoyed the Mandarin twist and all the interactions with the young boy in Tennessee. Also Tony's PTSD moments are well done and show decent consistency from the first Avengers movie.There are plot elements I struggled with, such as the 'save the President' scenes, which appear cheesy and patriotic. Everything involving Pepper and the Extremis virus and what happens with Tony's chest arc reactor feels contrived.Although the effects are technically brilliant, the sheer volume of visual spectacle is ludicrously heavy handed. There are so many scenes of characters jumping about alongside numerous Iron Man suits, falling, smashing and things exploding it is tiresome and distracting. I loved the Airforce One free-falling scene and the early sequence where Tony practices getting into his suit, but everything else was unnecessary. Also Tony was portrayed as having fairly decent combat prowess outside of the suit and this doesn't fit with the character for me. For me he should display all his coolness either in the suit or in the shop developing the suit not running about like a shield agent with a gun in his hand.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as ever and is supported well by the rest of the cast.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Disjointed, but fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5280680/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","25 November 2019","This movie has large sections of it that work quite well in isolation, but the movie as a whole doesn't really come together like it should.I realized something was wrong pretty early. Tony has been tinkering ever since his close encounter with a nuclear weapon in New York, losing himself in his work and developing dozens of Iron Man suits. When confronted by the events of that day, he has anxiety attacks. Meanwhile, a terrorist called The Mandarin has been setting off explosions around the world and delivering messages to the American devil. One explosion occurs in Los Angeles and Tony's former bodyguard Happy gets grievously harmed because of it. This is where I realized something was off. Tony has an emotional reaction that is way too much for the situation, and his unveiled threat to The Mandarin in response is too angrily directed at The Mandarin himself.Wait, that doesn't make sense, does it? Happy has been at Tony's side since the beginning of the first movie. Of course an attack on him is going to piss Tony off. And here's where the difference between the intention of a movie and its actual execution becomes important. Happy is barely a character. He was largely a source of mild laughs in the middle of light sequences. He had never developed an emotional connection with Tony or with the audience, so to see Happy in danger and to have his injury drive Tony's next series of actions that are meant to be powered with high emotion feels unsupported by what's actually come before. Injuring Pepper, Tony's girlfriend, though, would have done it. For all the faults of the first two Iron Man movies, they did manage to sell the relationship between Tony and Pepper well enough so that if Pepper had been injured and Tony had delivered the exact same speech it would have landed emotionally.The reverse of that are ideas that seem curious but end up being executed fairly well all while feeling isolated from the rest of the story. Tony getting isolated in Tennessee with the plucky kid is an example of this. The plucky kid is a trope of movies, especially sequels, in order to artificially heighten stakes and create a new dynamic for the characters to explore. The kid here, though, gets treated like an adult by Tony. He doesn't soften at the kid's doe eyes, nor does he learn his lesson in abandonment through him, he's there to help Tony in a time of need, and I think it largely works. However, it's done in isolation and feels extraneous at best.The other major element that I really like on its own but doesn't seem to fit the rest of the movie is The Mandarin himself. Now, fans of the comic hate this interpretation of The Mandarin because it turns a terrifying and evil character into a joke, but I am not a fan of the comics, I think lack of adherence to source material is a junk criticism, and I quite like him. The subversion of the big bad being the main target, leaving the guy we've thought is the bad guy as the actual antagonist, is a fun one, and I think it's handled well. The Mandarin gets built up very well throughout the movie with his video messages to the world, and the sudden deflation of that image to find out that he's a drugged out cockney actor named Trevor is really funny. However, it feels like just extra stuff, like material you could cut without much trouble.So, yeah, I have some problems with how the movie's constructed. There doesn't seem to be a particularly strong throughline for the whole story, though by the end of it, it becomes obvious that Tony's supposed to be learning to say goodbye to the suit. I think the movie largely supports that, though. He doesn't have a full working suit in the whole movie. In fact, he spends most of the movie having to solve his problems without a suit. From the moment he lands in Tennessee to when his suit flies to him in Miami (which is about an hour or so), Tony is just Tony. He has to solve his problems without the high tech gear he encases himself in all the time. In fact, he has to go out and get analog in finding ways to beat down badguys by running into a hardware store and collecting a couple cartloads of stuff to make offensive weapons. He's learning that he can live without the suit.However, that core idea is hidden behind a bunch of other stuff (like Trevor, the kid, and some political talk that never goes anywhere). The movie looks fantastic, though. This is the first standalone Marvel movie that got seriously huge wads of cash thrown at it, and it shows. The attack on Tony's cliffside mansion is one of the most beautiful scenes of pure destruction I've seen. The final battle with the few dozen Iron Man suits flying around it detailed and inventive.There's great fun to be had in this movie, but the movie as a whole is disjointed and full of distractions. In terms of construction, I think a couple more drafts might have smoothed out the whole experience and created something more successful.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He has a personality so unique and it perfectly suits the character Tony Scott. The panic attacks, the humor, every detailing of his character in this movie has been well executed by him.Iron Man 3 was fun to watch summer superhero flick. This is the first movie I am watching which is directed by Shane Black. The screenplay is fast. The story for me is average with fewer laughs and not better than the first 2 movies of the franchise. The only thing which saved this movie for me was Robert Downey Jr.'s charm and the amazing climax which was a treat to watch. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts looks very fit & pretty. She gives a nice performance as her character gets more detailed and has a friction with boyfriend Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley is an unexpected surprise package to watch out for, but is it likable or not, thats for you to decide. Guy Pearce is smart and gives a good performance.The cinematography and action & VFX sequences are very cool and do entertain you to an extent. Especially the climax action and the scene where Tony & Pepper reunite. Tony's brief camaraderie with the little kid was sweet but not memorable. The direction of Shane Black was good but not without flaws. I liked the dark humor but at times it border lined Iron Man as a superhero ridiculing himself to the brink! I liked the advances of the technology that Tony is been shown integrating in his new Iron Man suits, but showing them being shattered into pieces every now and then depletes the Superhero quality in Tony for which he is looked up by the audience. Tony Stark is a genius and by the 3rd movie he should be so brilliant at making suits, that the suit can't end up being a piece of joke which really irked me. Secondly though the thought of Mandarin was a very good one as an antagonist, it wasn't executed in a deadly way. The villains of the first 2 movies were far more effective.Overall if you are fan of Iron Man, you will like Iron Man 3 withstanding its shortcomings. Otherwise its a onetime watch. Robert Downey Jr.deserves one more outing for sure in the Iron Man suit, as I applause his performance and wait for the next sequel, hopefully!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I quickly set up an account so I could write a review and hopefully present a better overview of the movie. Let me start with saying I understand why a die hard fans may be upset with the portrayal of the Mandarin, however to everyone else it was great! If you don't know who the Mandarin is (which most people wont) then trust me you will appreciate the move taken here as well. Yes there are a few insignificant plot holes, but I only realised these afterwards thinking about the movie and they didn't take away from the core experienceThese two issues are nothing however when you take into account the movies upsides, the classic RDJ comedy was the best its been with the packed theater laughing continuously and the action was probably the best id seen in any super hero movie bar 'the avengers'. And to me, action and comedy are the two most important parts to IM, and a more vulnerable IM made things much more interesting also.This movie was not made for fanboys, rather the mainstream public. It was the most enjoyable movie by far and so if you're just some average joe that hasn't read an IM comic before (like 99% of the public) do not be discouraged from seeing this movie!","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

I had high assumptions regarding the movie, but I ended up enjoying it even more than I knew to expect.I think the movie was better than its prequels in many ways. It was full of events, the tension in many parts was exceedingly thrilling and the plot went on fluently. The new characters suited the plot perfectly and I found it really hard not to love them. The movie also gave us a change to get to know the old characters more deeply. As for Tony, it was amazing how the movie brought up so many of his sides, the humorous, sarcastic and smug part, but also the other, more deep side of him. I have never liked Pepper as much as I do now, and the movie served Happy and Rhodey as well.The movie was also visually beautiful and the effects were stunning. I give credit to the brilliant visual development, too. The explosions, battles and other scenes alike were realistic and exciting.Altogether, Iron Man 3 was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend watching it, were you a fan of Marvel or not!","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Directed by Shane Black, the film sees Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) face off against his most formidable opponent yet, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), while also dealing with personal demons and a failing relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).One of the strengths of ""Iron Man 3"" is the humor that permeates throughout the film. The witty banter and one-liners that have become a hallmark of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are present in abundance here, and they help to balance out some of the more serious moments. The film also benefits from a strong supporting cast, with standout performances from Don Cheadle as James Rhodes and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot can be somewhat convoluted at times, with multiple storylines weaving in and out of each other. Additionally, some fans were disappointed with the way the Mandarin was portrayed in the film, feeling that it did not live up to the character's comic book counterpart.In conclusion, ""Iron Man 3"" is an entertaining and enjoyable addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it may not be perfect, it still manages to deliver on the action, humor, and spectacle that fans have come to expect from the franchise. For these reasons, I would rate the movie 7 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So to say my expectations for Iron Man 3 (Marvels first movie of phase2) were high is somewhat an understatement.This movie starts at what I'm guessing is a few months after the events in New York in 'Avengers Assemble' although they never actually address how much time has passed. Tony Stark (RDJ) is still tinkering away in his basement creating new suits and tech to add to his armour and doing anything to avoid sleeping (Stark still suffers horrible nightmares from the events in Avengers) He is still as loved and famous as before and protecting the world as Iron Man. Although, in the East a terrorist by the name of The Mandarin has taken claim to many bombings around the globe and vowed America will be next and will 'never see me coming'. Curious as to how these bombings were committed and left no trace of a weapon, cue some investigative work from Stark and a welcome introduction to the new Iron Patriot (War Machine from IM2 with a paint job) and the movie finally gets going. Some of the story is shown through many flashbacks, and we are introduced to both Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and the origins of something called the 'Extremis virus', which develops into the main focus of this movie. What is very different about this film compared to the previous outings is that this instalment takes Tony Stark and completely strips him of the Iron Man image for much of the film. After his house (and many suits) are destroyed Stark must rely of his wits and intelligence to find out what exactly is the Extremis Virus and who is The Mandarin. While RDJ is a fine actor and easily holds the screen, I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed that there wasn't more in- suit action. I also wasn't overly keen on the relationship banter between Stark and Pepper (Paltrow) I think I preferred the boss-employee relationship from the previous movies. There was always sexual tension and an inkling that Tony loved her, but now its all out in the open it seems dull and Pepper comes across as a nagging wife for much of the film!The performances in this film are all solid. RDJ is as good as ever, both Hall and Paltrow do a fine job as female leads and Kingsley as The Mandarin is a shocking performance in more ways than one! I was not expecting what he did with the character at all! The standout for me though was Guy Pearce as Killian. I thought he was great, and gave a smooth performance as the head of AIM, and aggressive in the action scenes. This is the first time as a viewer that I believed the 'villain' was a true match both intellectually and physically for Stark.All in all, Iron Man 3 is a fun, if sometimes dark outing for the armoured avenger. There were a few plot holes, and some of the edits at times looked a little messy but with good performances from the cast, and some great VFX it made up for it. I would've liked to have seen a few more action scenes and the villains could have been given more back-story. but otherwise a nice start to Phase 2","0 out of 11 found this helpful.

In fact, it has numerous problems, such as the Mandarin's plot twist, the villain and the development of the story. However, none of these factors make the movie as bad as people say. The third film in the trilogy is only average and is certainly better than the second film. It is full of jokes that work, it creates an interesting drama, but I didn't use it so well, and the action scenes are wonderful. If the movie could focus more on Tony Stark's post-traumatic stress it would be much better.

It had great action, acting, special effects, humour and other things I could be missing. But what kills this movie for me was its writing and the Mandarin.First off let me begin with the Mandarin. What the heck did they do with that character?? I have no disrespect for Ben Kingsley as he brought life to his role but they turned that character into some cheap clown that could be used in a comedy show. In the movie trailer they made it look like the Mandarin was going to be a killer enemy for Tony Stark and I was very excited. But the end result out of it? An utter disappointment and a misleading way to get my money.The second was the writing. The quality of the writing felt bland, and in some parts predictable.Overall, this movie was still pretty good but it is considered as the weakest Ironman film for me.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

About the movie. Great comedy moments lighten the mood from time to time as the body count is pretty high for a 12 rated movie. People who like the dark knight trilogy because its 'dark' even though no one dies will find this great. This film has it all, great special effects, action sequences, comedy and concepts.Its Main bonus that it has over the other two installments is that is not just another bad guy in a rip off suit. Those looking for another Avengers will be expecting too much, and may well be disappointed, but they need to save the team ups for Avengers 2! My only fault in this movie was the lack of scenes with Rhodey in his suit, War Machinedeserves more screen time!

I want to start off by saying how much this movie exceeded my expectations. It was a brilliant, action-filled, funny and overall a great movie, which serves the Marvel Universe wonderfully. This movie delivered on a series of levels , which only some movies achieve. It executed the emotion, action, characters, plot-development and ending spot on! We explore parts of Tony Stark that we didn't see in Iron Man 1,2 and the Avengers before. Robert Downing Junior's betrayal of the character was simply brilliant. From the start of the movie, I was taken in by the character and that draws and emerges you in the movie. We also see familiar faces such as James Roads and Pepper Potts, once again great acting delivered by Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Mandarin was interesting and nothing what you'd expect from the trailers (Wink wink). The more compelling villain in the movie was Aldrich Killian. I feel that I can't go into detail of those characters, unless I include spoilers in this review, which I'm not. But hopefully you guys will see what I mean when you see the movie. The ending was great. Let again I can't go into detail what happens to kept this review spoiler free, but what I can tell you that the ending was very satisfying to conclude this movie. I would also like to say that there is an after credits scene after 60 years of the credits, but worth it. I know some people might think that I'm praising the movie too much. I'm really not. It generally was a great movie and the best Iron Man movie out of the 3 released.The verdict: Iron Man 3 is a movie which serves justice well to the Marvel universe and a great way to kick off 'Phase 2'. I give this movie a solid 4/5 stars. It had everything worthy of a 4 star movie, however it could have gone further in terms of depth to some characters and plot to get the prestigious 5 star rating. This movie levels the quality of the 'Avengers' if not a bit more, which comes to show how great I thought this movie was.Rating: 8 solid stars.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

He wasn't bad, but he was always boring in comics, and now in movie. I definitely enjoyed the 1st Iron Man more than the 3rd but the 2nd and 3rd were snore fests and all the tech and actions didn't help one bit which is a double whammy because I am also a huge sci-fi fan on top of loving comics but I just couldn't enjoy this movie.

In my view, Iron Man 3 succeeded at both.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This sets up a very interesting prologue to what could have a been an amazing adaption of the 'Extremis' comic series. It does manage to keep you entertained till the end (post credits in fact) and later if a realization sneaks in on you that maybe it wasn't all that memorable, you are not alone. The movie has two super villains, the Mandrin (a well know character in the comics) played expertly by Sir Ben Kingsley and Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce) the 'Extremis'( a regeneration technology) scientist. Strangely enough the latter turns out to be more menacing in the end, in this nerd-turns-super villain yarn that is not entirely original. Even the extremis goons and Killian himself will definitely remind you of those famous killer machines with regenerating powers. (read: Terminators)The protagonist Tony stark is having a personal crisis post 'Avengers initiative' after facing ""gods', aliens and a Hulk"". The Aliens(Chitauri) have not only physically drained him but have crept into his nightmares causing anxiety disorder. His girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) has taken over the reins of the company again, but it is evident that Tony's insomnia and stress has taken a toll on their relationship. The creators have tried to include the famous comic arc in a way that might have seemed creative on paper, satisfying both the comic geeks and the rest of the movie goers, but in execution, something goes amiss. It is hard to pin point what exactly is lacking, the action scenes, especially the one involving the sky dive from the air force one, is jaw droppingly good. The characterizations have more dept. Last year we saw a billionaire face his deepest fears, suffer thoroughly only to 'rise' a hero again (but he gives it all up in the end) , this year we see another billionaire go through pretty much the same thing . Pepper Potts is joined by Maya Hansen(Rebecca Hall) as the co female lead and both their characters are fairly well sketched. The plot has a good many twists too, yet there is something very evidently formulaic. One particular surprise is momentarily amusing but ultimately turns into a huge disappointment, it will seem like major character and a versatile actor were simply unused. Usually a movie with the above mentioned faults will collapse like a poorly constructed tower and disappear into oblivion, but not Marvel's Iron Man 3. There won't be a free moment to dwell on the missteps, for the movie runs at break neck speed throwing an action sequence one moment, clever but emotional scenes like the one involving tony stark and a smart ten year old kid, in another. It is a pure entertainer from start to finish pulsing with mind blowing CGI and witty one liners one would expect from an iron man film. Although it should be mentioned that the post processing 3D here looks nowhere as good as the Avengers did. So in the end, complaining that Iron man 3 is not thought provoking or dark enough is just inane. This is no Nolan flick. It is a vibrant and deeply engrossing summer blockbuster from Marvel who should be praised for trying to bring out the human side of iron man while making it completely worthwhile. Looking forward to the next marvel movie this fall, just hoping the God of thunder doesn't come back with anxiety issues. Damn you Aliens!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now i want to preface this by saying i love the escapism and distraction movies offer. you name it, i've probably watched it, but COME on guys and gals. lighten up! y'all acting like you don't know the machine that is Hollywood. So it didn't follow the original book. whats new. it was still entertaining. I started to wonder while reading some of these reviews if they were from people who didn't get the part' or disgruntled people somehow attached to the movie as it really wasn't bad. I've seen worse and worse remakes. wanna talk comic book i was not overly interested in health ledgers joker , only getting such raves because he died. Jack Nicholson did it better, but such is the Hollywood machine. Look, the comedy seemed to me in all the right places. nerd turned psycho suave villain believable in his obsessive 'you will see me now' revenge and the one, two one- two with the kid was fun addition it did seem to move the plot forward and appeal to kids and yes, toy manufactures rub their hands with delight but i can see how the leads who all have kiddies prob pushed for this inclusion but i digress. stop looking into things not worth looking into turn your critical eye on the political machine and stop allowing the brain melt of Hollywood to distract you from more important issue. AlsoI cant help but be surprised at how many people got on here to review this movie with such passion of opinion and i cant help wonder if these same people are taking the time to complain about the money they lose on electing people to power who aren't looking out for their best interests and it sickens me that these same type of reviewers petitioned and raised money to get a veronica mars movie made with an actress whose long since retired the role. gross misdirection of people power and money.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I was very surprised by one aspect especially - It works as an action/comedy movie, rather than a ""Comic Book Movie"". Regular movie goers can follow everything without a ""nerd in tow"". Since I am usually the ""nerd in tow"" for my wife this was the 1st Marvel movie that didn't require a discussion answering the ""why did this happen?"" and ""what was this all about?"" questions that typically accompany an outing.The film works almost stand alone from the universe. There are minimal references to the other heroes apart from a couple of lines. While events from the Avengers are a plot point, I really don't feel like not having seen the previous Marvel movies would cause any issues. The fact that nothing really seemed to be set up for future continuities either, dialed back the synergy somewhat. This is not intended as a negative, just an observation. I usually revel in the little hints that are dropped concerning other characters or future developments and there didn't seem to be many. However, those hints could be in the film and I just missed them.Now that the nerdy bits are out of the way, the film is superbly paced, almost never dragging, and pretty much always interesting. As a whole it just flows well. The action is filmed excellently. The acting is top notch. The jokes hit pretty much every time too. The visual effects continue Marvel's high standards. Even the 3D was done well - every scene has depth and made me feel like I was in the world just that little bit more.There is some debate about some very spoiler related aspects of the film. I personally feel that everything worked very well in the context of the established film universe. But to each their own of course.Highly recommended - see Iron Man 3 in the theater and in 3D. I think you will enjoy it - even if you aren't normally a Comic Book Movie fan","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

After Iron Man 2's overextension, this film shows restraint by emphasizing Stark's character and delaying action. Specifically, Stark suffers from PTSD after the events of The Avengers, which doesn't intertwine with the villain but prompts emotional reflection as he solves Mandarin's puzzle. This personal quality, where Stark works with less while finding himself, is fairly refreshing from Marvel. Unfortunately, that aspect is lost once the finale shifts into excessive action. Nevertheless, this character arc is still the best of the trilogy. That, along with the witty dialogue, helps counterbalance the unmotivated villain story.Technically, Iron Man 3 is an improvement. Notably, Stark's panic attacks are portrayed with rapid editing, distorted sound, and dramatic camerawork. Plus, there are cinematic overhead shots of Iron Man's broken suit. The effects remain reliable (despite being overdone), and the limited production design is still highly recognizable. Also, the freefall rescue sequence is tense and relatively unique. Furthermore, the acting is strengthened by Downey's range and Kingsley's antics. The music is the most generic of the trilogy, but Iron Man 3 is otherwise proactive. Ultimately, it's not peak Marvel, but Iron Man 3 is a step in the right direction.Writing: 6/10

This was the best of the 3 IM movies so far.IM1 was OK, first in the new franchise. Ridiculous ending where Stark admits he's IM. IM two came up with this bogus villain. Really not fulfilling. Pretty slow story for a superhero movie.My expectations were low for IM3, but when I saw the Mandarin was in it, I said, great, finally one of IM's longtime villains takes him on. Yes, I will admit that seeing the Mandarin reduced to a puppet was hard to take. But you know, already the franchise had changed so much from the comics, that I said, WTH, just go with it.So the Disney aspect takes over, and you just have fun. Seeing Stark suffer physical and mental pain was a great story line. Seeing Pepper finally get more action was great. This kid, a little annoying, but hey, again, it's a Disney film, so they all have kids. Get over it.RDJ was fantastic. Again. Guy Pearce also fantastic as the bad guy. I loved this movie. Just jettison your attachment to the old IM comics, and you'll enjoy it too.

The villain is extremely uninteresting and has a very poor and weak reason for his plans, the movie also uses a focal point of plot as a joke however, I think the jokes do actually work as comedy but it does feel like a waste of time and adds very little to the plot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But I'll floor you by saying that Iron Man 3 held it's own and was the best of the lot.In Iron Man 1 & 2 we saw the ego of Tony Stark, playboy billionaire who felt he had nothing to loose, so why not build a toy only he could play with. Both movies were about ego. Nothing more, nothing less. And as the comics showed us --- Tony Stark really is all ego.But here in the real world we have things that we love that we are always fearful of losing. This movie brings that back home and shows us that for all his boisterous noise and grandiose ideas ---- Tony Stark really is a guy like the rest of us who cares about SOMETHING in this world other than himself. Consider for a moment the fact that in IM1 & 2 most of the ""save the world"" good deeds were really just something for Mr Stark to do to bolster his self-image in the media. Here --- we have a hero who actually realizes it's not always about himself. Sometimes you need to step back and let others help you along if you're really gonna progress.All that said --- Guy Pearce's role was pitch perfect. Ben Kingsley's character was eerie, creepy and stunning to the end... I love that the man can give you a surprise you don't see coming --- and keep a straight face about himself. The villains were impressive and the Iron Man Suit upgrades even more so --- but the heart of this story really is Tony Stark finding out that the world isn't always about himself. Ego is a prison that makes it hard to love anyone other than yourself... and without love, what is life anyway?","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Here it was necessary to show how devastating events had changed the world, which now promised not to be the same.It is immediately noticeable that the movie is deeper than the previous two films in the series. The tone has changed noticeably, there is even a gloominess (hello from DC?). The main theme that I saw for myself was the life of a man Tony Stark after he had been in a cosmic alteration, realized that he and his world are not one in the universe. Probably, this can be the reaction of a mere mortal. It's not every day you fight hordes of alien invaders side by side with a godlike blond alien from another dimension, a soldier from another time, a scientist irradiated with gamma rays and others. All this does not fit well in Stark's head, and he falls into depression, trying to realize what will happen next in his world. Robert Downey Jr. Perfectly demonstrates all this on the screen, involuntarily you yourself begin to plunge into a similar state and wonder if the world of superheroes is so beautiful and cloudless?The hand of another director is also felt, which noticeably distinguishes the third film from the first two by Jon Favreau. Shane Black was the leader here. He is well remembered for the movie ""Lethal Weapon"". Here the director brought something from the militants of previous years, successfully flavoring the film with modern trends.This picture finally focuses on Tony Stark, and not on Iron Man. The hero's thoughts, experiences, reasoning and the constant mute question of what will happen next are well shown. All this unfolds against the background of the appearance in the franchise of the long-awaited villain Mandarin. Unfortunately, he did not live up to the expectations placed on him, but what can I do. The vector of the cinematic universe took a different path.Ben Kingsley is good, but the role of Guy Pearce is much more important. Handsome, strong and determined. His villain looks very decent against Stark's background, poses almost unsolvable problems to Tony and it feels like Stark is on the verge of death the whole movie.And at some point you realize that you are not watching a superhero entertainment movie, about which you can then talk with friends with laughter. This is a new stage for superheroics. Now you see that the main character is an ordinary person. Yes, rich and smart, but still a man. He is vulnerable, not omnipotent, has his flaws and problems. And that's why Tony becomes even closer to the audience, although he is already adored more than others.The rest of the heroes are in place. And just as good as before. Happy still puts on airs, although it is difficult to perceive him not without a smile. After all, he has become a friend and helper for us. Pepper is beautiful because Peltrow is beautiful. Cheadle is still important as Tony's friend. There are no heroes that could be crossed out and not lost in the plot. Each of them is important for us to see Stark from all sides.The final part of ""Iron Man"" seems to put an end to Stark's solo albums, but the hero continues to develop. The film is good, strong and dramatic. And it is definitely worth the viewer's attention.7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I for one was really looking forward to this movie and I wanted to see if this was the sequel that Iron Man really deserved.When the first trailer for this movie hit, a lot of people, including me, thought that we were to expect a darker and grittier movie. That turned out to be false alarm. This is by far the funniest movie in the series and it feels fresh and new, despite it being the third installment in the Iron Man franchise.The movie starts with a voice over by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and he tells us his story, in case anyone didn't know about him yet.You can say that the whole story of Iron Man has been a long journey of character development. In the first movie Tony Starks world is changed when he is kidnapped and he decides to use his technology for the good of mankind. In the second movie Tony grows into the role of being a superhero. Tony has to accept that he isn't the only superhero in the world and the fact that some things are beyond his control in the Avengers. In Iron Man 3 Tony has to kind of go back to his roots and realize what is worth fighting for.When we get up to speed we see tony tinkering with his new armor, MK 42, in his workshop. It turns out that Tony has been busy building new Iron Man suits as a distraction to forget the scary events of the Avengers. The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a terrorist leader, starts to threaten the whole United States in live videos sent directly on TV. When Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tonys body guard, gets injured and put in coma by one of the Mandarins attacks things get personal for Tony and he declares war against the Mandarin. The story centers around Tonys journey to get the terrorist leader while he is hunted by figures from his past such as Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), a brilliant scientist and one of Tonys old one night stands, and another scientist called Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who works on the serum called Extremis. Extremis can by hacking its way into the repair center of the brain repair body parts and oh, I forgot, turn the hosts into burning soldiers. These burning soldiers look really nice on screen and they provide some terrific action scenes. The Extremis serum is an essential part of the movies plot.Along the way Tony has to rely on his own intellect and not on his trusty suits that he is used to do.Iron Man 3 offers some of the best action scenes I have ever seen both with Tony and his friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle). Even Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is in the action this time. And wow, what action she offers!This is in my opinion a fantastic movie. The acting is top notch from almost everyone, especially from RDJ, Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce. It is good to see that Gwyneth Palthrow and Don Cheadle get more space in this movie as well, since they had pretty dull roles in the previous movies. One thing that hit me was the chemistry between every actor. Everyone is acting so well against each other and it makes every scene interesting and enjoyable. Like the scenes with Tony and the fatherless boy, Harley (Ty Simpkins). Ty and RDJ are so well synergized and the lines that they exchange are spot on.The score made by Brian Tyler is fantastic and really hits the right notes (no pun intended). Sometimes it even rivals the Avengers soundtrack by Alan Silvestri (and that says a lot). Maybe some of you reading this have heard about the twist that involves the Mandarin. I don't want to spoil it for you but it is pretty interesting. It may not be the most original twist ever but it's still a nice move nonetheless. I would've maybe preferred a more ass kicking Mandarin but I liked this version of the character anyway. I like when directors can take some space and do what they think would be good even if that involves changing an already established character.Oh and I almost forgot! The visuals for this movie are really good and all of Tonys suits look great. You can really tell that the budget for this movie was high and used in a great way.I love this movie because it feels well thought through, it has breathtaking action, the acting is great and that the story has a nice focus. I only have some minor complains about this movie but that is not enough to drag this movie down. Iron Man 3 is a summer blockbuster with all the right ingredients and this truly is the sequel we all wanted for Iron Man in the first place. 9/10","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Also something what many said before is the fact that we see a lot more of the human side of Tony, other than the egocentric billionaire...And that's a good thing. Pepper on the other hand is more 'present' in the movie and i appreciated that a lot. The story in general is actually better than i expected, or as i'm used to in most action movies. It's difficult to write about the story without spoiling things so i'm going to keep it with that for the story. The special effects are (like all the Iron Man's) very spectacular and there's some new tech too, to keep Iron Man up to date ;p. I'm really afraid of spoiling things, so i'm going to wrap up here!

I still remember the days when just this time 20 years ago, superhero movies were still a burgeoning - if not seriously overlooked (by the mainstream) - film genre, and Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman,"" or the first two ""Superman"" movies starring the late Christopher Reeve, were relegated as the best the genre had to offer.Not anymore.Superhero movies are a dime a dozen now, it would seem. While this was unheard-of in 1994, 20 years later, they're everywhere. It seems that on average, Hollywood is releasing at least two big-budget superhero films a year. This is good for comic book superhero fans who are finally seeing their (modern-day) versions of the ancient Greek gods get the big-screen treatments they deserve. And therein, for this viewer, lies the biggest problem with the latest crop of superhero movies.In past reviews, I've made no attempt to hide the deep love and respect I have for comic books and superheroes. 10 years ago, I got the opportunity to see what I still consider to be the greatest superhero film of all time - ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) - in the theater. Of course, at that time, the superhero movie genre was still gaining wider prominence and acceptance in Hollywood (and by extension, the rest of the mainstream as a whole), and was not the commercial fad that it is now.My problem with the latest crop of superhero movies - meaning most of the films made since 2008 - is that the genre has become formulaic and commercialized. The earlier films made in the second wave of superhero films 10 years ago, and even the films made earlier than that, whether good or bad, were clearly driven by passionate filmmakers who understood the medium and at least tried to give their films some deeper meaning or dramatic/thematic complexity; Donner, Burton, Proyas, Raimi, Singer, and others knew what they were doing back then. I don't really see this type of cinematic artistry, and craft, much anymore; most films are just big, empty, glossy-looking blockbuster spectacles with no greater depth to them than any other major Hollywood film.What I'm saying is that Hollywood has effectively hijacked what was once the most novel and original of film genres and turned it into formula. There have been occasional flashes of brilliance or originality - ""Chronicle"" (2012) has so far been the biggest ""original"" (meaning not based on pre-existing material) movie made during this time, and I'm sure we were all over-joyed with James Gunn's smart-alecky ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" earlier this year.But I got way off-track here, and I must go back to what we were talking about originally, which is 2013's ""Iron Man 3."" ""Iron Man 3"" is perhaps the darkest ""Iron Man"" to come out yet. One of the biggest regrets I've ever had of this particular Marvel Comics cinematic franchise, is that Marvel's Man of Iron, Tony Stark, has had some of the most harrowing and dramatic personal battles of any superhero since Peter Parker/Spider-Man. While Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired, pitch-perfect casting as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the films have regretfully avoided the deeper dramatic possibilities that made the original comic book character so fascinating: of course, Tony Stark is arguably the most famous superhero to have ever struggled with the perils of drug addiction (alcoholism).While a great inventor and superhero in his own right, underneath the armor, Stark was still a normal human being, and he was vulnerable to the same personal afflictions that could affect any one of us. That was what drew readers to his adventures, both personal and societal, and it was always this dynamic that made it interesting in seeing how he overcame it all. The ""Iron Man"" films have largely taken the ""safer"" (commercial) route.In this third cinematic outing, set just before the Christmas holidays, Stark is still his big old arrogant self, though for some reason he's suffering the effects of PTSD as a result of the events of ""The Avengers"" (2012). This time out, he's battling a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who may or may not also be connected to yet another corporate rival named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). In the meantime, Stark must also try to rebuild his crumbling relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and maintain his friendship with Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who also moonlights as War Machine (who has since been renamed as the more politically-correct ""Iron Patriot"" by his government sponsors); regretfully, Cheadle's War Machine is pretty much nothing more than a cameo here.The first two ""Iron Man"" pictures were directed by Jon Favreau (who also returns as Happy Hogan, though he's also been pretty much reduced to nothing more than a cameo here), while this latest effort is co-written and directed by ""Lethal Weapon"" scribe Shane Black. Anyone who remembers Black knows that he was pretty much the screen-writing master behind several witty dialogue-driven action blockbusters - think ""The Last Boy Scout"" (1991) - back in the '80s and early '90s (before the arrival of Quentin Tarantino), so it's no surprise that virtually every bit of dialogue written here is a one-liner with an exclamation point at the end.I already stated my ambivalence toward this film series, but I can take pleasure in the fact that this might be the last, and that at least Iron Man seems to fare better when paired up with other superheroes. Robert Downey, Jr. is his usual appealing self, but the movie itself is also a disappointment, if not a completely enjoyable disappointment.7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If You don't want to risk a SPOILER FREE Review of the film possibly ruining it for you, then STOP reading and GO SEE THE FILM and come back.Right, Iron Man 3! The Shane Black Directed, Robert Downey Jr Starring Threequel to the Iron Man Series. Picking up after the events in new York ( That's The Avengers to those who weren't sure what they were talking about - I Know there were a few people asking that ) and we are shown Tony Stark trying to shake off the whole mental-ness of Aliens, Worm Holes, Big Green Men and a Man with a Hammer falling from the Sky. The Film proceeds to delve into more of Tony Stark and his inner demons coming to the surface due to his previous Drink induced, Arrogant and Egotistical party lifestyle coming back to haunt him. Showing his attitude towards the people he loves the most and how he is prepared to do anything to save them. Bring in an old acquaintance who has ideas and ways to help heal people in the midst of a Terrorist ( or a Teacher as he likes to call himself ) appearing on the TV Screens and threatening to Bomb more and more places until he can get The presidents attention. That is pretty much all I can say story wise. That's the general set up. BAD GUY appears, Rival Scientist Guy appears, James Rhodes ( AKA War Machine/Iron Patriot ) is around to lend a hand and Pepper Potts is caught in the crossfire. Simple Stuff.The Entire Film was thoroughly enjoyable, although slightly predictable at times ( and extremely UN-predictable at times ) but none of this was a problem. Coming off the back of The Avengers Movie and the lack lustre Iron Man 2, This film had a lot riding on it.With Jon Favreau Out of the Directors seat, but still much a part of the film as Tony and Peppers Security Man ( And given a meaty scene to deal with ) it was all eyes on Shane Black. Now a lot of people won't have heard of Shane Black, So let me give you the names of a few films he has written - Lethal Weapon 1 and 2 - The Long Kiss Goodnight - The Last Boy Scout - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( Which he Debut Directed )So Straight away, if you know these films, the script is a major part of his entire appeal. In Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ( Also starring RDJ ) he exploded on the scene with slick directing and witty dialogue. I'm pretty sure this was a main factor for getting the job, as well as RDJ putting in a good word for him. From the Out, this felt like a NEW tone and style for an Iron Man film. With it's immediate witty and slick dialogue between all the characters and the Action set ups that fill you with dread, the film set off with a new aim.........and that aim was to make Tony Stark more than just a man in a suit!I for one would say Tony Stark spends 80% of this film OUT of the Suit, making The Iron Man Suit a sub character.This Film is all about Tony Stark and I for one am all for that. The main reason Iron Man works is due to the way the character is played. In the Comic Book world the Suit/Armour is usually the thing people want to see. People want to see more Batman than Bruce Wayne, More Superman than Clark Kent, More Wonder Woman than Diana and so on. Iron Man works more simply because RDJ plays Tony Stark so well and makes you root for him, even though his ethics and morals to begin with are a bit dubious.The entire film was brilliantly paced, never dulling and always bringing in great Action sequences ( the Plane Rescue is a triumph ) and brilliant and witty DialogueKid: You're going to leave me just like my Father did Tony Stark: (pause) yes.The supporting cast were great and played their parts great. Guy Pearce ( an underrated actor in my opinion ) is great as usual as the rival scientist who Tony Stark isn't a fan of, Rebecca Hall ( Who made the Skirt and Trainers combo look Sexy ) was underused but still worth her due in the film, Paul Bettany ( The Voice of Jarvis ) was great in some witty and exceptional exchanges, Gwyneth Paltrow ( Utterly Gorgeous ) finally gets to do something worthwhile as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle ( Subtly Excellent ) manages to tease us with more to come with his character and Ben Kingsley ( Ben F*****G Kingsley ) is without a doubt the BEST thing in this movie! He really took this role with both hands and really went to town with it. A Joy to watch!So All in All I was exceptionally pleased with Iron Man 3. I think it sets up Phase 2 of The Marvel Avengers Saga and has gotten me excited to see Thor 2 and Captain America 2 when they are released.Verdict: Great Film, NOT a masterpiece but definitely well worth a watch.Have you seen it? what did you think? Let me know. @BarkerPodcasts","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The themes of Tony's PTSD or moving forward from your past are interesting themes but are barely emphasized in the movie. Many elements aren't connected with the theme the film is trying to face. Instead, this movie focuses more on being a fun superhero film, which conflicts with the severe issues the movie is trying to meet. But its fun moments are the biggest strength of Iron Man 3, and it can keep the audience entertained. But if you are an Iron Man fan, this movie isn't an insult, but it is a significant miss in developing Tony's character. If you want to see fantastic scenes with robotic suits, you can watch Iron Man 3. But don't expect anything significant for the MCU.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is nothing to say about Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark, he is the perfect one for the role of Tony Stark. Breathtaking scenes, stunning 'suit-ups' and the occasional 'Jarvis Pun' make this movie a lot entertaining and fun to watch. I always liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, and she did a fantastic job in Iron Man 3. I'd put her above Robert Downey Jr. in terms of their contribution to the plot and entertainment factor, just fantastic. Ben Kinglsey as The Mandarin blended well with the overall plot. Guy Pearce was pretty bad ass and provided the protagonist with just the thing that a superhero needs to push himself to the limits for protecting and defending the innocent and the good.The plot itself has a very powerful vibe to it, the conflict of conscience comes up at the right moments, making the plot unpredictable because you'd be left guessing with the way these conflicts are portrayed. These are the subtle things that keep the plot interesting. And just when the viewer feels 'there is too much seriousness in the frame for sometime now', quick one-liners crop up and make you laugh out loud. People shouted and cheered quite a few times, thanks to the stunning scenes. I can't give so much as a review on the individual departments as I have no clear idea about which department does what. Fans of superhero movies, The Iron Man fans, the Tony Stark fans and the Robert Downey Jr. fans would enjoy it a lot. Note: You don't want to miss the first 5 minutes, the plot is such that you would have to 'guess' what you missed to understand certain things as the movie comes to a close. And seriously, reviews of any movie shouldn't contain any part of the story or scenes! At least not until a few months of its release!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Robert Downey Jr. Once again shines as Tony Stark, delivering both wit and vulnerability in his portrayal. The film editing keeps the pace brisk and engaging, weaving together a complex plot with several unexpected twists. Its strength lies in its exploration of Tony Stark's character, showcasing his ingenuity even when stripped of his suit. Brian Tyler's score adds a sense of grandeur, and the cinematography captures the spectacle of Stark's high-tech world. ""Iron Man Three"" takes risks by deconstructing its hero, reminding us that the man behind the armor is just as important as the suit itself, and my liking for it is as resilient as Iron Man's determination to protect his loved ones.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Iron Man 2 also had a way of communicating the the potential positive and negative impact of technological innovation....then it all came crashing down with the Avengers movies which seemed to me to comprise mainly of fight scenes and CGI.Iron Man 3 has reintroduced the tech innovation albeit mainly in a bio-tech/genetic instead of an electro-mechanical context. As a innovatively minded engineer who has pitched my fair share, of (high and low quality) innovations, it's good to see the standpoint of take-it-or- leave-it-investor and desperate-tech-entrepreneur represented too! I can see why some are saying that the plot is disjointed, but it is in fact quite the opposite. None of the technology is introduced for frivolous reasons and the film surprises on quite few occasions.Not as easy to watch film as 1 or 2, but thought provoking nonetheless.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Initially the film promises but develops into an average affair with no depth and punch. Ben kingsley looked perfection personified in his portrait as the terrorist image, which was later goofed up in plot twist. The air force one diving scene for example was brilliantly picturised but lacked the impact. A problem with current action movies is fast skipping of frames during action sequences(also with transformers series).

Comic creator Stan Lee has admittedly stated that in creating Tony Stark his goal was to create an arms dealer during the Vietnam era who becomes a hero. The challenging element to this creative decision was in making him likable to a generation of youths who were against the Vietnam War. By injuring him mortally through a heart wound and making him vulnerable and then leading him to essentially don a suit of armor like a chivilaristic knight, Stan Lee was able to create a sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation. Throughout Mr. Stark's storied history, comic creators have added further moral conflict into his character. These additional conflicts have included alcoholism and absolute black & white decisions.The question posed by this unique character is what is it that makes up the worth of an individual; is it the contributions made toward the community or is it something more innate? In the film Iron Man 3, Mr. Stark struggles with the idea of is his value as Iron Man or as a person able to contribute to society with his own natural talents. This is a question that he is only able to answer when his quality of life, his technology, friends and family are taken away from him.This is a dilemma that many people have to face at some point in their lifetime. Generally when someone introduces themselves to a new acquaintance they state their name and their occupation. By doing this a person is prioritizing their occupation over other areas in their life. This displays a sense of identity within how a person contributes to their community whether it be local or regionally.This is a concept that is reinforced through our upbringing and family life. The message that some receive is that there is value not only in your occupation but that there are occupations that are better than others. This leads to behaviors geared to attain the best occupation possible to display yourself. Some of these behaviors include gearing our life to be more available for work such as where we live, what we do in our leisure time and other personal decisions.While there are other areas of life that suffer in importance in opposition to a person's occupation such as volunteer time, personal relationships, personal development and so on. While the potential of community impact and personal value is just as great for the other areas of life; they are put on the back burner for the professional life. This causes some individuals to become numb to a complete life and to minimize the importance of such a life. It is only when we lose what we consider to be our life that we are able to find value in the rest of our life. It is regrettable that this tends to only happen when we are forced to in order to find happiness within our lives.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Good Marvel film but has a few shortcomings","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2792358/?ref_=tt_urv","sedativchunk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19611514/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2013","Many years ago I was hardly a fan of any of ""The Avenger"" movies. I'm a younger guy in my 20's but I always thought of them as kids movies until my friends took me to see ""The Avengers"". I was instantly hooked and watched all the previous Avenger films afterwards. With that being said, I was extremely stoked for the new Iron Man 3 movie and went to see it in the theaters on the day of the release. Without further ado, here is my review. Tony Stark is back as Iron Man. IM3 takes place shortly after the events of ""The Avengers"". The story mostly revolves around Tony Stark's mental well-being. After the events of the Avengers, Stark is dealing with severe anxiety and mental breakdowns that interfere with his work and role as Iron Man. Any mention of the events in New York City and Tony completely loses his cool. Meanwhile, a new villain arises known as ""The Mandarin"" who, in a nutshell, is out to overthrow the worlds governments and seek out world domination.First of all, this has all the ingredients of a great Marvel film. State of the art CGI with lots of fun action and adventure in between. The acting by everyone was excellent as usual with some new, welcoming, cast members including Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. As usual there was also the classic Stan Lee cameo as well as a cameo by Linden Ashy as a military commander (Mortal Kombat/Resident Evil fans, anyone?). Lastly as with any Iron Man film, this has plenty of raunchy, comical moments with Tony Stark and his typical adult humor. Overall the typical ingredients of this film were great. But for all the good this film has, there were just a number of shortcomings that prevented this film from being a classic. Now for the downside. In IM3, the storyline is just bad. It's filled with too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and overall the movie just didn't work that well. For most of the film, Tony is coping with his mental issues. Too much of the movie seems to go on with ""Tony Stark"" personal problems and not ""Iron Man"" goodness. He spent about 90% of the movie out of his suit. Also the story all happens around Christmas time which is fine except it just felt a bit... strange, almost like this was made to be a holiday themed Marvel movie. The villain, as menacing as he was, just doesn't quiet hold up to all the other villains of the Avenger universe. And even though the CGI was good, there was ""budget"" areas of it as well. There is a scene where a water tower gets destroyed and you could tell it was a mini model of a town getting dumped on with water. There also seemed to be a lot less CGI scenes in this one like they were trying to save money on it.Beyond the rather ""clunky"" story telling, one of the biggest let downs of this film was the ending parts of the film. I'm not going to spoil the ending here but I personally didn't like it. As with any Marvel movie, after the ending credits role there is a brief scene of (usually) what is to come in the next Avengers film. Without spoiling it the scene after the credits I can safely say isn't very revealing and not worth staying through the credits for. Overall a good Marvel/Avenger film but just doesn't quiet hold up the predecessor films. The original Iron Man to me is still the best. The original film is one of those films that I would tell anyone to watch whether they liked the Marvel films or not. IM3 is not one of those films. If you don't know Tony Stark's backstory and your not that interested in the films, you might actually want to pass on this one. Good Marvel movie, not for everyone. And I'm sad to say it but it feels like they are running out of ideas of Iron Man. This felt more like a film milking the ""Iron Man"" franchise for big box office money rather than something that was a real story teller. And it shocks me that any parts of it felt budget-y considering how big of money makers these movies are. Overall 7/10 average film, just not quiet what the other movies were. I would still recommend it though, if you remotely like the Avenger films it's still a great, fun movie to watch. Just not quiet where the originals were.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is not as good as the first one. I think everyone has said that, but I still like this movie quite a bit. There is a philosophical side to this movie. Iron Man has gone down to Earth, experiencing symptoms similar to PTSD, and is suddenly thrust into his job again by forces beyond his control. There is a twist involving the true villain, and this actually works in the film's favor. The villain is usually who we least expect. Tony is crushed spiritually by his burdens, and this villain is smart enough to exploit that. I thought this writing was very clever.It is a Tony Stark movie, and that's perfectly fine. Marvel knows what makes their movies work and uses that to their advantage.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is very exciting and attractive film. The characters are very good. Robert Downey, Jr is always cool and funny, and just right for the role of Iron Man and Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow /Pepper Potts's action scenes are really exciting. The plot is unique and interesting. There are not only uniqueness of Tony but also suffering and love for Potts. This movie starts from the cause of the story and includes the ending. The special effects is near perfect, and the action is very great. The armor's battle and explosion scenes are heart stopping. However, I think that the soundtrack lacks a little stylish. There is not peculiar style of Iron Man. Moreover I want to see scenes about the mechanism of Iron Man, what ability, what purpose, how to assemble.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well in my opinion it rusted ever so slightly. The main problem with this film is the villain for me. The motive is good but the execution not so much. Jealously can be a dangerous thing and arrogance can set it off. But for me the previous instalments had stronger character development for our main antagonist. Maybe the twist gave the main villain much less screen time than we were prepared to accept. The main villain is a terrorist in the name of the Manderin or so we are lead to believe. But not everything is what it seems. Tony Stark does some crazy stuff for an intelligent man and is easily sent over the edge when his friend Happy is injured. Although there isn't a great deal of character development on their friendship. One big flaw for me is the simplicity in which the manderin is offered Mr Starks home address on the entire news. Now we know from previous instalments Tony can be his own worst enemy, at times egotistical, but seriously this is ridiculous. Does Tony not consider the danger he is not only putting himself in but his girlfriend Pepper. Being the third instalment like most third parts the exaggeration and humour has stepped it up a few levels and of course so has the explosions. Robert Downey Jr maintains his believable flirtatious chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper but also begins ascending new friendships in the unlikely nerdy boy in basement type or garage to be accurate. More of a distraction or annoyance than a friend but a healthy one to remove him from his PTSD after the events of the Avengers alien invasion. Downey Jr shows great emotional depth and along with humour/witty intellect he brings stress and anxiety to a much more round less invincible Tony. He proves that he is much more than just iron man. At times a mentor/father figure to the boy that he treats only like an adult. Juxtaposed along with how his father may well have treated him judging from flashes we have seen of Howard Stark throughout the marvel cinematic universe. Pepper is no longer the damsel in distress in this one but a influential team player and a worthy ally and partner for Stark. Guy Pearce is good in his role as the envious Aldrich Killian but we don't seem to get enough of him as we'd like. Overall it's a solid sequel but nothing groundbreaking in the comic book movie world. More of a story or revenge and how our hero will adapt against the odds.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It did a good job of tying into The Avengers and blending the Extremis arc with The Mandarin. There were some details I didn't enjoy, like how they turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (who is Norman Osbourne in the comics), or Aldrich Killian being alive (who is dead and has a smaller role in the comics). However, these were details I felt were minor enough to forgive because the story was initially progressing in a good direction. However, once they revealed The Mandarin's secret, everything took a turn for the worse. How do you manage to take the main super-villain to Iron Man, fill his role with one of the most revered actors in Hollywood, and still manage to completely ruin the character that bad? This version of The Mandarin is just laughable, and it's really frustrating because Shane Black completely missed an opportunity to have one of the most bad-ass movie super-villains ever. And it seemed like everything began to just spiral out of control from that point. Aldrich Killian turns out to actually be The Mandarin, Pepper gets injected with the extremis virus and kills Aldrich, and just a bunch of other nonsense plot devices. They just strayed so far off from the comics that it became too hard to forgive all those minor details.I will say this for the movie though: If you ignore the comic-book mythos, then Iron Man 3 is actually a good movie. All the actors played their parts really well, the CGI looked great, and the action was solid. However, as a fan of the comics, this movie left a very sour taste in my mouth. If this is what MCU has in store for us, then I'm not excited at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Instead of continuing the from Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3 goes back into the past when Tony Stark makes a mistake that today threatens to loose the most important thing for him in the world, Pepper.The movie has a lot of story throughout and action only towards the end and the fact that the plot hasn't really continued from where it was left in Iron Man 2 which may disappoint some viewers. But let's not forget Iron Man 2 wan't the last time Tony Stark appeared in a movie. It was in The Avengers. So Iron Man 3 is really the post Avengers than post Iron Man 2.Iron Man suit has undergone a lot major technological advancements in this movie. The suit is now completely robotic i.e, You don't even need to be wearing the suit to be able to fight. The suit now basically is a robot controlled by Jarvis when Tony isn't in it. Also the suit can be worn on the fly, which was hinted in The Avengers.Overall a complete entertaining, worth watching movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some are so messily structured that we can't immerse ourselves in that world.Some films are glaringly plot-holed and messily-structured yet we can enjoy it & feel immersed regardless. Iron Man 3 is this kind of movie.An engaging main character, decent support, excellent FX and action. Gets quite dark in places, those fire-burning foes are almost like something out of horror movies. But nicely offset with pathos & wit too.The main draw here are the big action setpieces, I just wish the camera would slow down and hold the image once in a while (or the editor cut down on the coffee and let some images breathe). This fast-moving fast-editing is typical of modern action movies and I get why: to instill a sense of hectic urgency while disguising movie-magic-tricks like stuntwork & FX. I would like some action images held a few seconds, they look really high-quality and can definitely handle it.Story is fair, some decent character moments and good sci-fi ideas but nothing on an epic 'wow' scale, and unrelated to the wider Infinity Saga (aside from some PTSD from the previous film).A solid 7/10 this.

There, I've said it! If anything, I would say that I'm more of a DC/Vertigo, Image and Dynamite Comics kinda guy really and still not much into the superhero side of things either, and so 'Iron Man 3' wasn't originally on my movie watchlist for 2013. Yes, I'd seen and enjoyed the first 'Iron Man', didn't bother with the second, and wasn't overly fussed about 'The Avengers', although did catch it on blu later, so I wasn't too bothered about watching Shane Black's take on 'Iron Man'. That was until I'd seen the trailers.For once, the trailers did their job on enticing me to want to see a film I had no plans to see, which makes a change! Hollywood suits knowing how to promote a movie? Whatever next! And as always, I try to stay clear of any clips and spoilers before going in, I like to watch a movie with knowing as little as possible beforehand - a difficult feat these days with a multitude of websites scrambling to get snippets of news and spoilers out.What I saw was a Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), suffering from an inferiority complex, after battling a God and aliens in his exploits in 'The Avengers', and coping with that by building new suits at the cost of his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as well as the rise of a new villain, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), to deal with. And after Stark seemingly losing everything that mattered to him in one go and being stranded, it's up to him to find himself again and to save the day!I watched it in dazzling 2D, and the film is a well rounded feature and is what you would maybe expect from Marvel these days. It zips along at a good pace, but I did feel it kind of sagged in the middle, which coincided with the annoying kid sidekick for me, after Stark is stranded in a small town. The film does pick up again towards the end though with the climactic confrontation and the suits all joining up to battle at the end, as seen in the trailers.Ben Kingsley's performance stole the show for me, totally not what I expected. And the rest of the cast played their parts well too, as you would expect. Especially RDJ portraying the fall of Stark from cocky braggart to finding his human side again, and an awesome Gwyneth Paltrow as the love of his life.As always, go in with an open mind, and if you enjoyed Marvel's Phase One superhero films and were one of those that squee'd yourself at 'The Avengers', then you'll definitely get a kick out of this movie and the first of the post Avengers Phase Two Marvel movies. Don't forget to stay after the end credits too!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While it is chalk full of jokes and jibes, the lack of any real character development or plot is a serious negative for Tony Stark's third solo adventure. The special effects are quite spectacular, and the on screen fireworks are very entertaining. The script tries to improve on the pretty clueless Iron Man 2, and perhaps succeeds only a little in that this installment fares slightly better in the villain department. Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley and of course Robert Downey Jr. put in solid performances. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but the lack of a proper story makes Iron Man 3 a pretty forgettable film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To make it easy for everyone: Iron Man 1 > Iron Man 3 > Iron Man 2.I doubted from the start that a final film in a trilogy could ever top the first (if it was good) film and I was right. Still, Iron Man 3 was a surprise, a pleasant surprise luckily. Its complexities lie even deeper than what meets the eye. It deals with a lot more modern day anxieties than its Avengers/Shield subplot heavy predecessor and its funny. Funnier than any of the other Phase one movies. Don't let the dark, edgy trailers fool you, because you'll be (extremely) unpleasantly disappointed if you were seeking a dark or serious movie(or anything like the Dark Knight series). Despite this, Iron Man 3's tone is consistent so expect an Action Comedy. Does the comedy sometimes compromise the drama? Yes. But it works and never feels too cheesy. There's a part of me that wished Tony would get in his suit more often and do Iron Man stuff. But that was the point of the movie, to show that the man made the suit, that showed that Tony Stark is Iron Man no matter what. On the bright side, it shows that Tony's real power is his brain, so you'll get to see neat McGuyver-like stuff. The only real negatives that show in my opinion is the CGI. I know everyone will scream plot holes or the twist but if you watch closely enough (or visit IMDb forums), most of the the former will be answered. The latter, unfortunately, is subjective. Those who see the movie as an insult to their dedication to the lore, or those who want/prefer a more traditional villain, will leave the series with a bad taste in their mouth. They maybe even be done with Marvel for good. Others who aren't really comic fans, like movies that have unusual surprises, and can see the movie for what it is (an Action-Comedy) can roll with it just fine.Overall Iron Man 3 was a great film, especially for taking the risks that it did. It did a good job of connecting all 3 films together (with cameos, pivotal references, etc.) and tying up Tony's story arc with a neat bow. While future Phase two films look promising, it will be a difficult task for them to be as unique as Iron Man 3.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To start with, the famous sense of humor of Mr. Tony Stark this time forms a combo with the true emotions and finally Miss Pepper Potts finds the caring, sharing side of Mr.Stark for her. The chemistry between the couple has been the trade mark of the franchisee, though this time Mr. Shane Black with the director's hat emphasized on the romantic side of the super hero. Terrorism at the heart with the commingle of American politics, this time the baddie Mandarin reaches the secure zone of WHITE HOUSE and his demand for a call from the Prez and the resulting betrayal and Miss Pepper falling from 200 ft height was perhaps the two shocking moment that turned the reel world and the real world silent for a while. The DNA Coding and the resulting fire power which has been used as the lethal weapon by Mr.Mandarin stands believable but again somewhat repetitive and falls into the category of the same age old Hollywood action formula of mutation and desolation. The audience will definitely be spellbound by the special effects but somehow the movie wrapped up being an action-romantic outing. The revelation of Mr. Ben Kingsley as the fake Mandarin was a little earlier and that is the only loop hole in the screenplay that I felt. Overall the movie is a full on entertainer and all the checklists of a super hero movie is ticked.Children gonna love it, adults gonna like it and we poor reviewers like it but with some Ifs and buts.. Eight Cheers for the movie and one more for Miss Pepper's amazing fight scene at the climax..Go For It !!!","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

The producers of this film used way too much creative license in veering off from true Marvel mythology and also attempted to give the film a different feel to the previous two installments, which obviously didn't work in their favor. The apparent lack of AC/DC in the soundtrack was a particular downer for me.All of that being said, I do believe that this film was necessary in it's structure to pave the way for the next ""phase"" (to quote Marvel themselves) of the Iron Man/Avengers story. To put it on the big screen the way it has been presented in the comic book universe would have taken far too much story telling. Granted it could have been done in a better way, but this is what was needed to break the link Tony had to the Iron Man suits and mature him as it were to the character we're expecting to see in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"". While this is no real consolation for the let down after months of anticipation waiting for Iron Man 3 to be released, we can (hopefully) look forward to ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" being what we expect from Marvel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie certainly pleased me and Robert Downey Jr steals every scene. This film is much more humorous than the others which was good but the constant need to puncture every half- serious moment with a witty one liner grew tiresome. Tony Stark had differently improved his tech though, I was amazed. The last full paced action scene was differently the best out of all the Iron Man films and will please many I also loved how Pepper Potts got to kick some ass! The special effects were done exceptionally well! The Mandarin I thought was a great villain until the twist. I was actually a bit disappointed as our new villain didn't cut it for me. Overall was a good movie better then the second not sure about the first.Overall I give Iron Man 3 a 8/10 -Being a big Marvel fan there seemed there was something missing.

Compared to 'The Avenger's' (2012) it's obviously a step back since that clash of Superheroes was just a tad too epic. We are back in the Tony Stark universe now. And I would've been fine with it if the plot would've convinced me more.
I think all of the 3 Iron Man movies have very entertaining parts and freaking great CGI. Yet all of them have some flaws. First Iron Man start and ending a bit lackluster, 2nd one I think the showdown was a bit short and 3rd plot and villains too average.

These movies were pretty good at staying believable and realistic for the most part, but it's not getting better.Also, Jon Favreau hamming it up at the end was painful.

This movie described the character of some good but were not consistent and many were poor and unclear. The plot was boring and predictable, although it did have a few unexpected twists in it, the twists were not clever and failed to impress me. The plan of th villain was passionate, but that was all that was shown of the villain and the villain was very disappointing and failed to be made as a match for the hero. Also many parts in the story are ridiculous and actions of Tony Stark don't make any sense. The character development of Tony Stark was good when he was forced to overcome several obstacles, but the movie focused too much on the one character and very little attention was given to the rest of the characters. So in conclusion the movie was a disappointment and had a boring plot but had good although limited character development, but is a nice movie to watch if you are looking for some action scenes with stunts and special effects.INNER MOTIVATION=7 OUTER MOTIVATION=5 FINAL RATING= 6 out of 10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This film has it all from its great sense of humor to the amazing action set pieces. The story here is more personal than any of the other film in the series as it focuses more on Tony Stark than his suit of armor. We get a sense of depth to the character and the psychological problems he has since putting on the suit. Iron Man becomes more like a cocoon rather than something that actually enhances the man. Throughout the movie we see his over dependency on the suit and how much weight it puts on is shoulder, which is well elucidated by Tony pulling the suit through the snow.The pacing of the film in certain areas felt off mainly do to how fast they were jumping from topic to topic. However, the action sequences are always spot on and really gets the audience involved. Tony's house exploding is a great highlight of the film and my personal favorite set piece as it tell a lot of story of the relationship of Tony and Pepper through stuff blowing up. Another thing to note in the film is its humor. It is funny and timed well. Some of it can be off putting in certain scenes or moments, but for the most part these particular segments are few and between.The characters are great and the actors do a fine job. Robert Downey Jr. has finally found the perfect balance of arrogance and likability in Tony Stark. He's great as the character and we finally get to see other side of him that we've never seen before. Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is finally a useful character. She holds her own and it's great seeing this character grow and given attention to. Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin is great. I particularly like how they introduce him with some great edited shots that highlight the amount of power and terror he poses. Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce are great in their roles as well, but the standouts are easily Downey, Paltrow, and Kingsley.Overall, ""Iron Man 3"" is a really good popcorn flick that is not only entertaining, but engaging. It's great seeing these characters develop and also seeing these actors hone on their personalities. The action and humor, for the most part, are spot on and give the movie the right amount of energy. There is a twist towards the last third of the film that can be jarring, but if you go with it, you'll enjoy the film a lot more. I give it 4/5, incredibly entertaining and the best Iron Man movie yet.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Ever since the flawed Iron Man 2 came out, it was pretty obvious the Iron Man franchise wouldn't follow this rule. After that set back, on the other hand, it was rather unclear what to expect from the third one. Will it be, nevertheless, the worst one? Or will it completely negate the superhero franchises' rule and triumph as the best one? The answer to these questions is: Iron Man 3 is neither the best nor the worst Iron Man movie. However, it is the strangest. You may ask, what do I mean by strange. Well, first of all, unbelievable as it may sound, Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie. Of course, there are some superhero movie elements here and there, but in its core Iron Man 3 is an action/comedy/thriller. To put in the words of director/co-writer Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau in the director's chair) - it's kind of a Tom Clancy style thriller. Because of that, Iron Man 3 is much more similar to another Robert Downey Jr. movie - also directed by Shane Black - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. While I applaud the idea of experimenting with different genres, the ending result was not satisfying. Before I continue, I'll just say I have not seen the movie in 3D so I don't know how it holds in that aspect.The movie follows Tony Stark, as usual,who apparently got PTSD from the events that took place in the Avengers movie. He has trouble sleeping and has panic attacks from time to time. As if that weren't enough, his luxurious Malibu mansion gets destroyed by a terrorist called the Mandarin. Now he has to deal with the Mandarin and other potential threats in the form of old acquaintances. Thematically, Iron Man 3 is similar to The Dark Knight Rises - destroy the hero, put him on his knees so he can rise once again. That being said, Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark rather than about, you know, Iron Man. The similarities with The Dark Knight Rises don't stop here. Both movies have overly complicated stories. Not complicated in the intellectual way, mind you, but in a way that there are just too many intertwined subplots in the movie. Since this is the case, Iron Man 3 is prone to have some plot holes. I, myself, didn't notice many of them nor did I let them diminish my viewing experience, but I'm sure other people will notice them and they'll get frustrated. Anyway, the question remains - why all the TDKR similarities? And it's not only me, I've already seen people on the internet jokingly call this movie Iron Man Rises. To answer this question, we'll need to go back in 2012 when the Avengers exploded at the box office. Iron Man 3 was the first Marvel movie to be released after the Avengers and the stakes were pretty high. No doubt everyone involved wanted this sequel to continue the Avenger's financial success. When everyone realised they can't possibly re-create that success, they turned their heads to another last year superhero box office juggernaut, and copied it instead. And that's how the Iron Man franchise also jumped on the whole Dark Knight Trilogy bandwagon. I find this to be ironic since DC is trying to copy Marvel's Avengers by creating a Justice League movie. However, all of this is strictly my opinion.There's another famous rule in cinema, affecting especially superhero movies, which says that the movie is as good as its villain. And so we come to the Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, in spite of how hard the trailers wanted to convince you, is not the main antagonist of the movie. Which is a damn shame, since he may be Iron Man's most famous villain. Instead of being the main bad guy, he plays this disappointingly strange role which I can't explain thoroughly without spoiling the movie. So yes, the movie is as good as its villain - Iron Man 3 is disappointingly strange. It puzzles me why he wasn't given the role he deserves. The reason for that can't be the 'realism', since the real main villain's powers aren't convincing as well, which contradicts Shane Black's statement that Iron Man will be fighting real world-type villains. I'll just say that regarding the villain, there's a definitive Dark Knight Trilogy vibe.Now that I got the two main things in superhero movie, the story and the villain out of the way, I must say I fairly enjoyed everything else - especially the humour. The acting is decent (Ben Kingsley being the best actor), the action is superb and the several Iron Man suits that show up in the movie are also nice. All in all, it seems that Iron Man 3 works best as a dumb popcorn flick. Unfortunately, it has no real re-watch value.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

With the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Rebecca Hall in the 'Bond girl' roles, we are clearly in a different ballpark from SPARTACUS on TV (not that I don't get a kick out of SPARTACUS!)The film starts a bit slowly and, as seems to be the case in all superhero stories nowadays, Iron Man is going through a 'long dark night of the soul'. Once we get past this guff and the mayhem begins, this third episode delivers the goods that teenage viewers have paid to see (in 3D). Marvel comicbook fans seem to be unhappy with liberties taken with the source material, but I thought it was terrific fun.

It's better than Iron Man 2, and equals in many ways the original Iron Man.

Seamless astounding special effects. Lots of good jokes. Great immersive photography. Interesting story.The actors. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow were just as good as in the previous episodes, but Ben Kingsley almost steals the shows as The Mandarin. So incredibly surprising.The bad. The scenario is pretty straight forward and doesn't bring anything new to the table, but who cares? The bad guy is a trifle simple, no depth. No need for 3D, it's just as good in 2D.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must see, unless you can't stand Robert Downey Jr., super heroes, action or bloodless violence. See it on a giant IMAX screen with the best sound even if it means seeing it in 3D, an experience not to be missed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I guess they just wanted to wrap up the series. Now what is expected of a superhero movie?? Hero has a tough time with villains, super powers, awesome tech etc. Here the hero did have a tough time but with the side villains and his internal fears rather than the main villain who made an entry towards the end of the movie and disappeared as quickly. And when we talk about iron man, we talk about his suit. This was a movie about Tony Stark. Many things are left unanswered. They made a story with bits and pieces of smaller stories. The ending was horrible. Only good part in the movie was his backup call and i sat excited that something's gonna happen. And i hated it when he makes a Christmas gift out of the his suits.Its a one-time-watch movie with nothing going on at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is a very entertaining and humorous film. Robert Downey Junior and Gywneth Platrow give a great performance but the story itself has so many plot holes that it almost spoils the entire movie. Even if you are familiar with the whole Iron Man series you will still sit through this movie and ask a few questions. Another thing that upset me was what they done with the War Machine character played well by Don Cheadle. They could of done more with him and got him involved in more action scenes but he barely gets stuck in. Solid performances also by Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. Double villains with a twist. Special effects are as good as ever with any Marvel Comic Studio film.This is a great film despite the dodgy plot but if you can get past that you will enjoy this movie a lot.

The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers? The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time. It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time. So, how do you follow that kind of success? The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success ‚Äì at least for any other comic book film, that is. We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it? The answer to that question is: momentum. Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine. Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film ‚Äì well, we have that answer for you.Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks. Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States. One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire ‚Äì which quickly gains Stark's attention. At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an ""explosive"" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis. Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr. Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress. The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions. Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley ‚Äì who is nothing short of treat in this film. They couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character). Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark ‚Äì just because he's smarter than everyone else. Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting character addition to the franchise.Now ‚Äì here's the good, the bad, and the ugly. First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight. If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption. The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers. If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Pine, or Chris Hemsworth ‚Äì you'll be very disappointed. Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance. And, the ugly has to start with an apology. Sorry, kids ‚Äì there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy (unless Shane Black decides to add another scene after the fact, like Joss Whedon in The Avengers). This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be. Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of the Empire Strikes Back. He gets an ass kicking in this film that just keeps on giving. However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films. For the average movie-goer, Iron Man is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy. Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning ‚Äì in the grand scheme of things ‚Äì Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers. Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) ‚Äì yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The plot is where this film isn't so great. Comic book fans may have been let down in this film because of the famous plot twist. I understand why fans may be angry, I personally didn't mind the twist, but I didn't think it was that well done either. In summary, lots of good stuff in this film, but the story could of used more intensity.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Iron Man 3 Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2792865/?ref_=tt_urv","Al_The_Strange","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24364152/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2013","So now it comes to this. Iron Man started off beating the snot out of terrorists and confronting the Iron Monger, all while trying to right the various wrongs of his life. Then he was challenged by Whiplash, and made to face a number of personal challenges. Lastly, he helped save Earth from an otherworldly invasion, and he personally passed through a wormhole to deliver a nuke to the Chitauri mothership. Where does Tony Stark stand after all this?The third Iron Man film pits Tony Stark against more challenges, which elevates the stakes to a more personal level. He has his home taken away, before his friends and loved ones are thrown into peril, and he's forced to find answers on his own. It all culminates in a final gambit that involves an attack on the entire nation, and the emergence of a powerful new race of people. The endgame is a chaotic sequence in which multiple Iron Man suits wreak havoc on a freighter loaded with Extremis terrorists, and it is quite the explosive setpiece.There is definitely a ton of action and quality special effects to behold here, but unfortunately, the pacing tends to sag between the action scenes. Aside from some sporadic action and comedy, very little of the film stands out, especially when compared to the last two films. In fact, the film's tone, atmosphere, and style never seems to mesh well with Jon Favreau's work, and as a result, the film is overshadowed. The story that Iron Man 3 tells is full of high stakes, and it is notable how it rounds off Tony Stark's progression through the whole saga, providing some satisfactory closure. However, the film explicitly states that he's a changed man, but it's hard to really see such change; he remains his same old self throughout the whole runtime. He is a character so full of color and personality that he's entertaining to watch, but he ultimately delivers more of the same. The villains he confronts lack such personality, and elicit no sympathy; there is a twist behind the Mandarin's character that has upset countless film fans, and other characters never really stand out.This film is competently-made with good photography and editing. Acting is as great as ever; Robert Downey Jr. is still apt as the title character, Gweneth Paltrow is still great, and so is Don Cheadle (although his role is rather limited). Ben Kingsley is rather cheesy, albeit on purpose, and I found him amusing that way. Guy Pearce is superb, even if his character is less memorable. The writing is generally good. This production has plenty of fine-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty cool.Iron Man 3 has its moments, and it feels like it tries to be bigger and more relevant than its predecessors. Unfortunately, it's not as memorable, not as fun, and the substance isn't quite as deep. It will satisfy some and disappoint others, so I'd only recommend it as a rental to fans.3/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Mixed | Film: Pretty Good)","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Comedically, it is never overpowered or too weak there are really inventive bits with numerous minor characters being involved in most of it . Each character has their own ""moment"" such as Jon Favreau, who is a real treat throughout the entire intro. Out of the 3 films this one is ranked right in the middle, the first one was such a surprise that it could reinvent our view on superheroes while the second one completely wrecked Stark's character without a sufficient villain. I'm not going to spoil anything but the villain in this film, The Mandarin seems like one of the most menacing and original antagonists that I've seen in a Marvel film but it could have gone with a serious and still entertaining tone but it ended up going in a more comedic route that is not necessarily cheap but I would of personally preferred more maturity but nonetheless, the film was still satisfying. All of the performances are pretty standard and nothing you would not have expected. The film itself is extremely layered with intensity/risk as it progresses and has a really memorable scene involving a rescue in mid-air. In it's conclusion, it was not as rushed as most people say and it was filled with amazing action, some twists, and a really appropriate send off to this franchise even though the conclusion was not as climatic as The Dark Knight films.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I groaned, and hoped that there would not be a lot of fluff. To my pleasant surprise there was not. It was the first time in a long time, that I could not feel the time go by. There were a couple of surprises that I did not see coming, which made the film even more entertaining. I also liked the fact that the film made reference to what happened to the Avengers back in New York. It gives all the Marvel characters a sense of connectivity. I even saw the same connectivity in the Trailer for the next Thor, where Loki is locked up for what he had done. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) is true to form and brings with him his usual wit and humor. Ben Kingsley (The Mandarin) was brilliant as usual, but I had no idea that his range was so expansive and that he could play this type of role. I think that a lot of folks will be surprised. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) who is the mad scientist of the bunch, is one of the more creative villains ever created. The ""tug-at-your-heartstrings"" role went to Ty Simpkin (Harley Keener), who is quickly befriended by Tony as a mini partner in stopping the bad guys. Although Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) did not have a lot of screen time, her character made a definite impact on the outcome. Don Cheadle (James Rhodes) reprises his character very well, although he gets a bit of a make-over that is kind of cheesy. Director Shane Black has really made a name for himself behind the camera instead of in front of one. I have to say that I liked this Iron Man better than the previous films. I think it was because this film focused more on the man instead of the superhero. We get a chance to see Tony as a little vulnerable and that he has issues just like the rest of us. I did not see this film in 3D, but I could see where some of the action scenes would have been more explosive in that format. I have to say that I left the theater smiling because I thoroughly had a good time (you will too). I give this film a glaring green light.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I've had the chance to read a lot of other reviews to this title and I honestly find a lot of the criticism brought to it unfair.Yes, it is somewhat childish and not altogether compelling. They tried going for a slightly more mature feel, but it didn't really work. At least not in the way I imagine they had hoped it would.We get to see a lot more of Tony Stark out of the Iron Man suite, and we get to see more of Tony Stark period. His fears and insecurities in this -post New York invasion- world. RDJ plays brilliantly, as always, managing to add complexity to his beloved character.The plot, this is where it gets messy. Initially I enjoyed the idea of a villain who isn't evil just for the sake of it and who is somewhat integrated in the political struggles of our time. And then there's the plot twist. Which if you have seen more than, lets say, two movies in your lifetime you will be able to predict from early on. And from there on the movie doesn't expand properly, it doesn't give the appropriate amount of details or background to is characters.The visual effects are good, nothing breathtaking, but passable. I enjoyed the tech and watching the characters use it, even if isn't even remotely rooted in anything realistic.But most importantly, the movie is fun. RDJ makes you laugh at every turn and the truth is you enjoy watching Iron Man win over his enemies and get out of sticky situations, even if after a time his escapes become rather simplistic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

HOwever, after finally watching Iron Man 3, I was a bit confused.Don't get me wrong,it is a darn good movie, but I feel like some things were played out in a wrong way. In example, Mark 42 was supposed to be the most advanced suit of all. It was funny to watch all the glitches Tony had with that suit, but I was really disappointed how fragile the suits after Mark 7 became. In Avengers Mark 6 withstood a lightning attack from Thor, but here the suit is destroyed in an accident with a truck - c'mon on guys (it was funny, but stupid for Stark).The main idea of movie being set a few months after the Chitauri invasion of New York and Tony Stark is haunted by the experience, having nightmares, panic attacks and staying up all night tinkering with his inventions was neat.Somehow, I am under the impression that this movie shouldn't have been called Iron Man 3, but Tony Stark - The Motion Picture. In my opinion, we see too much of Stark and too little of Iron Man. On the other hand, I was expecting to see more of Tony's tinkering around the suits, as in the first one when he was building his Mark 2 and its boosters and exteriors.The take on Mandarin was new and surprising. However, I don't think the incarnation did justice to the character. I was expecting the Mandarin to be the true leader of the Ten Rings that kidnapped Stark in the first one, but no. I somehow hope that the real Mandarin will show up in later Iron Man or Avengers films.The ending itself was great and unexpected, no matter what people say. Tony Stark will always be Iron man. But I somehow don't get the fact how Tony managed to cure Pepper. That should have been elaborated - did he upgrade the Extremis or what, and will he use it on himself in Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4? Who knows. However, Tony is a great tech maniac, not a chemist.to conclude, I would give the movie 8/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Doubt it'll make a difference cause everyone will watch it anyway.It's the best Iron Man so far, I will say that. However, the first 2 films weren't all that great in my eyes anyway. Director Shane Black takes the franchise in a slightly different direction. Focusing on the Tony Stark character instead of all the gadgetry (there is still a fair amount here, not to worry). It's slightly darker than the previous 2 films and actually has a proper plot this time round.Robert Downey JR does his part again, it's almost as if he was made for this role. The character that I loved most was the Mandarin though. Ben Kingsley steals every scene that he appears in as the terrorist threat to Iron Man. The others sort of trundle along, letting the special effects do the talking.There were too many unexplainable events in the film to rate it seriously, and it's expected being a popcorn Hollywood flick but it's fun, it's one of the blockbusters out now.

And what a villain in The Mandarin!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2793694/?ref_=tt_urv","TheSquiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur34414709/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2013","I'm tempted to say Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise so far in this strand of the Marvel universe. While the 2008 original was thrilling and introduced the world to the mega-rich playboy Tony Stark and his creation perfectly, 2010's sequel floundered at times. With Shane Black taking over the helm from Jon Favreau, Iron Man is back with a punch and it's an absolute blast.When Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) personal life is severely threatened and his home obliterated by a terrorist, The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), it becomes personal. Iron Man 3 is not so much about saving America from another larger-than-life villain but about personal revenge. Stark finds himself out of his depth and needing to rely on instincts and the core of his knowledge rather than the excessively equipped laboratories and workshops. As he battles villainy that runs deep, the stress on his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his own panic attacks, Stark must face the truth of the real question that plagues him: Does the man maketh the suit or the suit maketh the man? Iron Man 3 opens with a fun pre-history of Stark where we see what an arrogant fool he was. It serves as an easy introduction to principal guest characters Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) as well as a giving a wink to the fanboys and a nod to the previous two films. It sets the film up nicely as a romp with plenty of gadgets, effects, explosions and a broad smile. More than anything, Iron Man 3 is fun and, at times, very funny.Black, directing only his second feature (after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), has co-written the screenplay with Drew Pearce and his own taste for fun and excess is stamped all the way through it. We see far more of what makes Stark tick; his foibles are laid out for us to mull over and, rather than making him seem weak, he becomes more approachable, more tangible, to us. Downey Jr. is on familiar ground but stretches more to give a fuller performance. There are no surprises but he is satisfyingly suave and cheekily engaging.Black gives Paltrow more to play with in this third installment. Whereas she was previously consigned to forgettable girl on the arm, her Pepper has a more integral role in the film and, even more, a substantial effect on Stark's life and decisions. Here we see that she genuinely matters to him. She is fun, she cares and she isn't going to stand for any more of his bad behavior.Hall, as old flame scientist Maya, is just there. She appears in Iron Man 3 and is effective but, a day later, her presence is barely memorable and she fades behind even the vocal performance of Paul Bettany as Jarvis, the computer with more human qualities and attitude than, well, Maya.Pearce almost reprises his role as Peter Weyland (from Prometheus) but with perhaps a little more tongue in his cheek and a step towards Bond villain status. We have too little of him to really enjoy but his moments on the screen are enjoyable as he evolves from geek to super-brained scientist with a political agenda. Pearce moves easily from star to supporting actor and rarely phones in his performances as certain other stars seem to on 'easy mortgage payment' movies. He adds a welcome edge to a film that would otherwise be all about explosions and digital effects but never slows down the pace.Iron Man 3, however, belongs to one man, and he doesn't wear a metal suit. When we first meet Kinsley's Mandarin it looks as though we're in for a king-sized dollop of ham, as the trailer testifies, that should have been consigned to the bin along with The Hood (No, don't try to defend Thunderbirds, it just won't cut it with me!). But as the film rolls on and his character unfolds, Kingsley provides the greatest moments in a thoroughly enjoyable romp and one is left to wonder whether Downey Jr. respects him for his portrayal as the villain or is severely miffed at having his film well and truly stolen from him. The Mandarin is as memorable a character from Sir Ben as Behrani, Don Logan and Itzhak Stern; and just look at these characters to understand the true versatility of one of the finest actors working on stage and screen today! There are certain names that, when they appear on the screen, leave no room for ambiguity. We know what we're getting from Pixar, Disney, Aardman Animations. The same is true of Marvel and Stan Lee; we're in it for the action, for the spectacle, for the disposable entertainment that will biff, bash and bang. Iron Man 3 gives us all of that and plenty more and it doesn't need 3D to make it work. Having watched it in good old two dimensions, only one scene looks as though it would have been more complete with the third dimension and it was in there purely for the gimmickry. Iron Man 3 doesn't need those cheap tricks with the talent in front of and behind the camera.The final text upon the screen declares that Tony Stark will return. Whether that will be in Iron Man 4 or just the touted The Avengers 2 remains to be seen. But if this is the end of Iron Man in his own right, what a way to bow out! Who knows what the future holds for the franchise? For now, let's just sit back and enjoy every moment of this fantastic, explosive ride.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He also co-writes it with Drew Pearce. Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau and Paul Bettany return as Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, James Rhodes, Happy Hogan and the voice of JARVIS. The direct sequel to 2008's Iron Man and 2010's Iron Man 2, but also to The Avengers (2012.) It is the first in ""Phase 2"" of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. As ""Phase 1"" was the Iron Man films, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor and The Avengers, ""Phase 2"" consists of this, Thor: The Dark World in November, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in April 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy in August of the same year and capped off with The Avengers 2 in May 2015.In Iron Man 3, Tony has made Mark XLII (42) armour - to put this in perspective his suit last seen in The Avengers was Mark VII (7.) After a new threat, terrorist The Mandarin, plunges Stark's life into ruin, he must rebuild himself and face retribution as the stress attacks and nightmares which have haunted him since his experiences in New York (The Avengers) get worse and the question which has eternally bugged him is discovered - does the man make the suit or the suit the man?As a huge fan of superhero films (DC over Marvel, Justice League not as good as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Trilogy over Iron Man Trilogy, Superman not as good as Iron Man, etc) i have been anticipating Iron Man 3 for months. Ever since the first tears I experienced when Tony's suits exploded in the first trailer, I have hoped it would be amazing. And I wasn't disappointed. While not reaching the standards of the first Iron Man, it is better than the 2010 sequel (although I don't hate Iron Man 2 like many others seem to.) So, the acting. As always, Robert Downey Jr utterly knocks it out of the park. Even as Iron Man 3 is more thoughtful and also deeper than the previous instalments, the witty, well-written script gives him plenty of room to be funny. Gwyneth Paltrow is, as always, a pretty terrible actor and annoying while Don Cheadle was hideously underused. Guy Pearce was interesting and I liked him, as were James Badge Dale and even Jon Favreau in their smaller roles. Oh, and of course Ben Kingsley is wonderful, but also underused in my opinion. Rebecca Hall wasn't brilliant; she seemed a bit useless and irritating. However, if child actors annoy you then you can still watch this as the annoying child (Ty Simpkins) was only annoying for the purpose of the film and is absolutely fine in his role. The script was, as I mentioned before, on the same level as The Avengers it was so great, while the action left me with a dreamy expression as a moment near the end was so ridiculously awesome that I had a broad grin. The score was good as well. There is a twist in the film which is the main reason for the split in opinions, however as I am not an avid reader of the comics I didn't mind the change in lore. I won't reveal this twist as I'd prefer to keep this review spoiler-free. So overall, I would say that it has many strong aspects and is a thoroughly enjoyable ride. But it isn't a 10 because I found it to drag and meander a bit in the second act and, as mentioned previously, some characters were underused and some actors weren't great. Also, the ending seems a bit rushed. Finally, I would just like to praise the film one more time. Without giving away too much, there is a good theme about the face of terrorism and the real people behind things. If you like good films, watch this but it isn't really the sort of film you just watch without really focusing properly - you need to be in an ""Iron Man 3 mood"" to be able to watch it!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Iron Man is back and in full force, and it was the best Iron Man movie to date. With a new director (Favreau was Executive Producer but it was directed this time by Shane Black), Iron Man surprisingly didn't loose any of its shine or appeal, which seldom happens when franchises change Directors.Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, and will always be Tony Stark. Some actors get stuck with a type cast role, but in a rare instance, there are those roles in which no one else could play. Who else could play the rich, egotistical, genius playboy character of Stark? Who else could deliver such humor that is so genuine to the role? No one, that's who. Without RDJ, Iron Man would never deliver such a phenomenon of comic book movies.The script was perfect for this film. The funniest Iron Man in the trilogy, the humor combined with the most action in any Iron Man movie kept you laughing till your stomach hurt or got you on the edge of your seat. The production designs of the suits - all of them - are amazing. Every single actor on screen pulled their weight and the chemistry played perfectly. Also, there is a lot of mention of what happened in the Avengers, and the story focuses somewhat on how that has affected Tony.There was one twist near the end, to which I will definitely not reveal. Now, this twist is either good or bad depending on what people were expecting. It is a creative direction I never thought would happen, and the surprise caught me off guard. I'm still not sure if I am disappointed, but in essence - I could see why they played it that way. I won't spoil it. I can't, because it's such a big twist that it's like telling you the end of the movie where Tony Stark dies.(hahaha. just kidding).Iron Man 3 was definitely worth the wait. And don't forget, stay at the end of the credits!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I found it to be very enjoyable, but yes, a little different from its predecessors. Admittedly, there is less action during the first two thirds of the film, but the story keeps you engaged and anxious to see how it will all come together. I felt this film played more as a comic book than the other two films, and was slightly darker then one and two. People sometimes fail to realize changing the director can change the general feel of the film, which i admit, was the case here. To claim this was ""the worst comic book film ever"" is absolutely ridiculous, take a look at Ghost Rider 2 and get back to me. I will say, the 3D in this one wasn't very impressive, but aside from that i found it to be a great film, worthy of the franchise, with a small twist and a tremendous final sequence that makes up for the story-driven beginning. One word of advice, unless your a die hard Iron Man fan, I suggest skipping the ""Easter Egg"" after the credits. All in all, very enjoyable film that i will most defiantly see again. 8/10, well worth my money, but skip it in 3D and save the extra $2. .","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The first entry in the MCU's second phase has great points, but also a lot of nagging flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8976353/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2023","Sometime after the events in New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is in a committed relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) but is burdened with recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress from his near death experience going through the wormhole. As a string of unusual terrorist bombings that leave behind no bomb fragments orchestrated by an enigmatic figure known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) shock the world, one such bombing gravely injures Tony's friend and former bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Enraged, Tony Stark issues a challenge to The Mandarin and is soon attacked in his home where he suffers a panic attack just barely making it out. Now stranded in Rose Hill, Tennessee which his suit flew him to while unconscious due to it being the first possible bombing site, Tony tries to piece together how the Mandarin is doing these bombings and what his end goal is.Iron Man 3 is the first MCU film to be released after The Avengers and marked the second phase of the cinematic universe. Jon Favreau had made clear early on that he would not be directing Iron Man 3 but would stay on as an executive producer and as the character Happy Hogan. Robert Downey Jr. Approached Shane Black about writing and directing Iron Man with the two having previously collaborated on comic noir film Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang back in 2005 which despite being ignored by audiences on initial release scored solid critical praise and would be retrospectively recognized as a ""prototype"" for his roles as Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes in the Guy Ritchie films. Black along with co-writer Drew Pearce made clear of their intention to look at the film as a more ""grounded"" take on the character in contrast to the fantastical nature of The Avengers. With Marvel still riding high from the halo effect of the first Avengers film, Iron Man 3 became the second film in the franchise to cross $1 billion worldwide with a final tally of $1.2 billion against a $200 million budget. Critical and audience reception skewed mostly positive with many in agreement it marked a considerable improvement from the second Iron Man film, but many were divided on a certain twist that went against what was promised in the marketing. Iron Man 3 isn't without issues, but thanks largely to Shane Black's strong dialogue and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance it is a mostly engaging piece of entertainment despite those underlying issues.In terms of exploring Tony Stark further as a character, Iron Man 3 does a decent job following on from the events of The Avengers as we see a decidedly more vulnerable version of Tony Stark after the trauma inflicted upon him. If you know anything about Shane Black's work, many of Black's staples are here including the ironic Christmas time setting, buddy dynamic with Don Cheadle's James ""Rhody"" Rhodes alongside Tony, and character exploration of masculine but very broken/flawed characters in a manner similar to Lethal Weapon or The Last Boy Scout. While Iron Man 3 doesn't sport the R-rated edge of Black's prior projects, it still maintains that same darkly comic noirish with Stark spending a good deal of time out of the armor and forced to rely on his wits and intelligence rather than the armor. That's not to say Black avoids the super heroics entirely including two standout sequences involving a siege on Tony's house and a mid-air rescue of 14 people in freefall, but Black's primary focus on Tony is the man behind armor.I think the biggest issues with Iron Man 3 is that it does feel like a bit of retread of thematic material covered in Iron Man 2 where he engaged in self-destructive behavior because he was dying. Don't get me wrong, I thought Iron Man 2 handled that poorly and it's done much better here, but given the similar trajectory the arcs in both movies take it's pretty inescapable there's a feeling of ""deja view"". The other issue in the movie comes down to a major twist that goes against what's promised in the marketing. While the twist is cleverly setup and did catch me off guard the first time I saw it, it did feel like a bit of a bait and switch and while there is a novelty to it, much like the PTSD character arc it feels like it takes us down roads taken not only in Iron Man 2, but also the first one.Iron Man 3 isn't as good as the first film, but it's much more cleverer and ambitious than Iron Man 2. The movie has some of the best writing in this series which goes without saying when you have someone like Shane Black behind the reins, but the little nagging elements really do pile up and detract from the experience. A decent entry in the MCU even if it's not the best.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A worthy conclusion to the ""Iron Man"" trilogy? Or, is it just a pile of garbage? Check out my review below!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8392527/?ref_=tt_urv","TheHonestCritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur66610649/?ref_=tt_urv","2 August 2022","""Iron Man 3"" (2013), also stylized as ""Iron Man Three"" (which is stupid, but we'll talk about that later). For those who may not know, I'm a huge fan of the first two ""Iron Man"" films. The first two movies in this trilogy, in my opinion are two of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe! So, you can imagine my excitement when I heard the first announcement for ""Iron Man 3"", right? I was counting down the days leading up to it's release, my hype for it was overwhelming. Unfortunately, it just ended up being an underwhelming letdown at the end of the day. ""Iron Man 3"" has a boring and inconsistent story, and the acting was embarrassing overall. The plot is, Tony Stark is suffering from PTSD following the final battle in ""The Avengers"" (2012). To make matters worse, his whole world winds up being torn apart by an extremist, known as the Mandarin. He eventually goes on his own odyssey to rebuild his life and seek retribution. When I first read the spoiler-free synopsis, I thought: ""all right, this sounds like it could be interesting. If they can just execute it properly, then we'll have ourselves a winner!"" Sadly, very little to no potential is utilized and we're dealt with boring and inconsistent results. One of the biggest problems here, is the changing of directors. Right there, I knew that this film was in trouble. The first two ""Iron Man"" movies were directed by Jon Favreau, who also plays Happy Hogan in these three films respectfully. For ""Iron Man 3"", Shane Black takes over as director. Once I saw that it was going to be someone different directing, that really concerned me right away. The director of a movie makes all the difference, and nowhere is that any more obvious than here. Granted, there have been other films in different franchises where different people direct throughout the lineup of movies. A perfect example is the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise, the first five films each had a different director, which really helped each individual movie stand out and be distinct. I was hoping that would be the case for ""Iron Man 3"", but no. When I saw it, I felt like I was watching something else. Seriously, it hardly felt anything like an ""Iron Man"" film. The pacing for it is inconsistent, and it drags on for way too long. That being said, there are some good elements in the story. Such as: Tony dealing with PTSD, and a few of the action sequences were okay. Other than that, it's just nothing special to me. One of the biggest insults was easily the twist about the main villain. I actually knew of the Mandarin from the comics before I went to see this movie. So, I was very excited to see how he would be portrayed! Unfortunately, we end up with cringe-worthy results. On a final note regarding the plot, I feel I must bring up the end titles. Usually, I don't critique opening or end credits. However, this one is a rare case. After ""The Avengers"", most Marvel movies showed the title at the end, like the DC films, which is lazy. But, that's not the worst part. When the title is shown, it's written as ""Iron Man Three"". No, really, that's how they wrote it. Why? That's just stupid! It's like the editors were ashamed of this movie. Wow, you know it's bad if the editors hate it! Right? It's like they were trolling it on purpose. Film Making 101: when you do sequel titles, end it with a number, not a word. ""Iron Man Three""? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry to keep dwelling on that, but it just really perplexes me. Any way, why don't we move on. Shall we? As for the acting, it's just an embarrassment. The only ones who seem to be trying with what they had to work with, are: Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. Everyone else is standard to just plain horrible with their performances! Probably the most annoying acting comes from Guy Pearce. He's just so obnoxious to watch here! The acting is a terrible letdown, what a huge disappointment. Now, let's get to the positive elements in this trash heap. The sets/locations are interesting and give the film a unique atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well-done. Which is no surprise, being that this movie came out in 2013! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Brian Tyler is excellent. His film score sets a great tone for the storyline. Although, sometimes I think the music is trying harder than the plot! ""Iron Man 3"" is nothing short of an embarrassment to the Marvel movies. All of the films in the saga leading up to this one have been good, so this one, for me, was the first real dud in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it the worst superhero movie I've ever seen? Absolutely not, there are a lot of worse ones out there. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Iron Man 3"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, to be a bad movie. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this film? But seriously, if you skip this movie, you'll be doing yourself a favor. Just stick with the first two ""Iron Man"" films instead!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thus found myself enjoying the non-suit scenes more.""I loved you in Christmas Story."" For a cinema buff, there are many asides that I was enjoying, but that many seemed to miss. I didn't expect it, but Ty Simpkins, playing a 12-year old, comes across as one of the most likable characters. Robert Downey / Tony Stark acts as a person well adept at politely brushing people off, and it all plays off very well, as various ""little boy"" clich√©s are built up then hilariously destroyed. Small-scale destruction was done well, but I may be spoiled by some games that did it better, such as Uncharted 2&3. The fight scenes were well done, but I liked the action in such movies as Inception, Ghost Protocol, Dark Knight, Avengers, Incredibles, and even Wrong Trousers more.The 3D/IMAX effects did not seem worth the extra $10 to me.I did enjoy this movie a lot, and nothing nags at me.

They did a nice job as a villain, only wish they have a cooler role and not Mandarin. This character is a little too comical. The good thing about this movie is they able to maintain good sense of humor/ more screen time for Gwyneth Paltrow/ very stylish / and more or less nonstop action scenes. Plus the scene where Tony stuck in a small town with a little kid who help him pick himself up add a little different to the seriesAnyway I do recommend this movie (especially for dull Saturday evening with your kids). It is still is fun movie to watch despite the story get a little stale. Rating: 6 /10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Like the movie, the comics in this day and age are a good blend of entertaining, thought-provoking, controversial, and frustrating‚Äîwhile constantly screwing with the usual continuity of the comic book characters. With an action-comedy staple writing the script and directing the movie, this film is the ultimate evidence of what happens when you choose an accomplished staff (See: the infuriating Dark Knight Rises) over a lesser-known staff that is head over heels in love with the comic (See: The ever-pleasing Avengers).This frustratingly fun movie follows Tony Stark as he starts to hit rock bottom following the events of The Avengers and a rising threat that is attempting to spread terror and fear amongst the Americans---as if the aliens that had invaded New York previously wasn't enough. As Stark starts developing anxiety and worry about protecting his precious Pepper Potts, the Mandarin shakes things up by directly starting a war against Iron Man. Written by Shane Black, the movie feels less comic and more like a serious action movie with heavy buddy cop qualities seen in his earlier work.The two biggest gripes that the hardcore and the old-schoolers will experience while watching this is the very grounded plot that doesn't allow us to see Iron Man in much actual combat, and also the rather baffling portrayal of The Mandarin. Iron Man 3 feels like Dark Knight Rises in terms of character running time, as Bruce Wayne/Tony Stark has far more screen time than their alter-egos. Luckily, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Stark remains spot-on and absolutely brilliant---whether he is cracking jokes or cracking under pressure. His surprise partnership with a lonely 6-year-old was a nice added touch.Then there's The Mandarin.Oh boy.His portrayal here is so different from the comics that it may create a worldwide depression amongst the most avid of Iron Man fans. Even with an exhilarating final sequence that involves more Iron Man action and carnage than you can handle, the potential disgustingly bitter taste of seeing the very unique and rather ho-hum take on Iron Man's greatest nemesis will remain on your tongue.What the movie industry still hasn't fully figured out is that comic books are like video games---you need a truly, madly, deeply dedicated fan to translate the work into the big screen successfully and to the appeal of the masses. With comics and games the fans are more invested, more embedded in the culture than most other kinds of entertainment. This is why there has yet to actually be a good video game movie (although Scott Pilgrim and Wreck-It Ralph are good gamer cultured movies) and just a handful of good comic book films.Iron Man 3 will most definitely entertain with its great blend of action, comedy, heart, and a small hintage of suspense, I will give it a cinematic stamp of approval. The special effects was impressive, the direction and editing was crisp, and the entire cast did well with the script they were given. But forgiveness is a difficult thing, and I am not sure Shane Black and the Marvel staff will be forgiven for their---direction with the Iron Man franchise and brand.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

But this time, Tony is also confronted with his inner-self after the battle of New-York (the one you can see in Avengers). This might be the best of the three movies because in this one, you can see a Tony Stark in a weak position and not in the strong and self-confident way you are used to see him. Although some useless scene or some incomprehension about some character, the movie keep you in suspense the entire time. The movie has a interesting twist that you certainly don't expect.

I'm not an Iron Man comic fan, but I'm a huge fan of the film franchise and Robert Downey Jr. So any hang ups others have with the storyline, I don't care.I can tell you that the script, the dialogue, and the Downey are brilliant. I'm giving away my old age when I say I had Lethal Weapon flashbacks through the entire movie. Iron Man 3 is truly a triumph for Shane Black, and I give him props for fighting back from the brink and coming through looking good! The plot is complicated and doesn't always seem like there is one, but that's only because Black is playing it close to the chest for the big twists toward the end.Tony Stark can't sleep in the wake of the Avengers, and he's having trouble coming to grips with his most selfless act at the end of that movie. Basically, he's a selfish guy, we love him for it... And yet here he has gone and given his life to save humanity (it was pretty much a fluke he survived, so I'm giving him props too for going all the way with it). You'd be pretty messed up too if you were a super-rich playboy one day, a introspective entrepreneur the next, and then nearly killed by sacrificing yourself to save Earth the last.This movie is all about personal demons. It says so from the start... And why wouldn't it be? Both Black and Downey probably share the same sponsor... These guys have been to hell and back... They know about demons. From the first frame Tony is fighting his demons, and since life has a funny way of knowing when you're struggling, events begin to unfold that have him questioning his very existence as Iron Man. Can he save the world and protect the woman he loves? Can he be a selfless protector and an OCD hermit crab at the same time? Can he move away from a past full of trampling over others to get to where he wants to be? I realize these are pretty big themes for a summer blockbuster, but Iron Man 3 isn't your every-day actioner. This isn't The Avengers. This is an intensely personal film that finalizes the 3-movie-arc of Tony Stark's transformation from what he was, into what he will be. For a solid hour in the middle of the movie he's not even in the suit. He's out solving a mystery, chasing leads, and chumming it up with a surrogate child/inner child in Tennessee. Throw in a maniacal terrorist, a power-hungry industrialist, and an army of T100-looking Extremis soldiers, and you've got yourself a summer movie! I would have like more exposition with Rebecca Hall's character and the background on Extremis, and I would've liked more of a fore-shadow than ""Mark 42"" but all in all I have very little complaints about this film. It's well acted, it's hilarious, the Air Force One scene alone is worth price of admission, and I bit my nails the entire movie. I don't know why everyone seems to hate it, and by everyone I mean the few thousand people that troll IMDb... But I loved it.Every single choice the filmmakers had to do the same old thing, they chose something else. Just when you think clich√© is about to happen, Black spins it. It's really fun to watch. Plus like I said before, if you're a Lethal Weapon fan you'll love this flick. There's a Christmas theme, snappy one-liners, a buddy-cop-flick feel, and even an Xmas tree lot! Come on, how can I be the only one catching this?? The finale even takes place on a BOAT! (I realize that's Lethal Weapon 2, but you're getting my drift here right?) Brilliant movie. Don't believe the negative hype. It's smartly made, smartly written, and I think when all of these haters watch it again they'll realized what they missed before and change their minds. Go summer 2013 movie season!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This was the ""Spider Man 3"" of the Iron Man series. First off, this movie is way longer than it needs to be in which I mean not only by actual length (130 min) but by plot structure. Where the previous two films were filled with humor, action and suspense, this one leaves you depressed and wanting more. This is by far the least humorous of the three and if anyone has seen the previous films, they would know that humor was essential to the success of these movies. The new director here tried to take a chance and ultimately failed by screwing up what was essentially a good formula for these movies. It almost seems unnatural that this movie takes itself so seriously when the others were fairly light-hearted. The direction of the other two films was great and there was no need for such a change-up in the series. Easily the biggest let down from a superhero movie since ""Spider Man 3"".","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

From the beginning I had doubts about this third installment because it was not written or directed by Jon Favreau as with Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Iron Man 3 was directed and co-written by Shane Black, famed screenwriter of Lethal Weapon.Given that, this movie exceeded my expectations. The action and effects were spectacular. The plot was cohesive and they definitely added some new and interesting elements to the Iron Man franchise. Without spoiling anything I will say that Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts gets to be more involved in this third film, she is not relegated to the sidelines. And lets face it guys, we like to see a woman of action. Ever since Alien made it a mainstream archetype, we have been drawn to attractive, strong, independent woman that is not just a girl to be saved. I kept this in mind when I wrote the character of Gessica, the female lead in my movie Cam-Girl (AKA Web-Cam).Iron Man 3 also had a few surprises along the way, how the characters developed and what the villains weapon really turns out to be. These moments of the movie were refreshing, spontaneous and realistic for the given situations.The one minor complaint I had was that a few parts of the story were written in a contrived way to reach an end result. This was done to force Tony Stark into his low point and it was also present during the big finale of the film. It turns out a lot went into making that final scene. In a Entertainment Weekly interview Robert Downey Jr. laments that he injured an ankle performing a stunt which caused a six week shut down during production.This third Iron Man film provided great closure for the character and the storyline. As of now this is the last time Robert Downey Jr. is obligated to suit up as Iron Man. Part of me wishes this is the last Iron Man movie they make because it ended strongly. I'm sure they will make more Iron Man films because of there success. The question remains if it will be Downey Jr. as the character, it would be hard for me to imagine any other actor filling those iron shoes. I recommend Iron Man 3.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This was perhaps what the Iron Man was missing the most. That is until the Mandarin came along. Showing little emotion, Ben Kingsley emulates a terrorist to perfection. Places are bombed with no trace of the type of explosive device left behind. He challenges everything Iron Man stands for. Slowly midst all the chaos, a pattern seems to emerge in the way the chaos unfolds. In the end, Tony Stark issues an open challenge to the Mandarin to come and fight him face-to-face.Tony is made to pay dearly for this. Mandarin's reach is beyond Tony's wildest expectation. He takes hit after hit. In a couple of moments the life and home of Tony Stark come crashing down. He is put in such a precarious situation that losing all his tech (including the Iron Man) is probably the last of his woes! Even with his long time pal Colonel James Rhodes trying to help him out, Stark cannot get out of sudden anxiety attacks. In the meanwhile, he befriends a little boy when trying to figure out how to tackle Mandarin.With the world looking vulnerable once again, Mandarin pushes on. His target now includes the President of the United States. With no one around to stop, evil seems to spread in all directions. Can the man inside the suit muster courage and help salvage his pride, is what forms the rest of the movie.Effects: This movie is technically brilliant. The sight of Iron Man crouching on one leg ready to spring to action is simply exhilarating. Given the fact that we get to see almost an army of Iron Men, makes it all the more enjoyable. The sound effects keep the visuals at pace. At no point could I feel the effect was overdone.There are a couple of scenes really worth mentioning. For example, the brilliant scene that is shown in the trailer where Stark's mansion is torn down, is even more brilliant in its full length. There was one more visual where Dr. Killian gives a demonstration of the live feed of his brain. The concept itself is cool and I somehow felt the visual was even more glorious to watch on large screen.The action sequences, though not that many (sadly) were still worth waiting for. The climax is like a crescendo and makes worth watching on a big 3D screen.Cast: There is no viable replacement for Robert Downey, in my opinion. So the producer's better pay up and retain him in any immediate sequence (Avengers sequences included)! This guy nails the character so well. Paltrow makes a fine girlfriend, but I felt there were a few scenes like the one where she meets Dr. Killian after years, when she under performed.Ben Kingsley fits in so well. The way in which he portrays a terrorist and a show man with √©lan is really unbelievable. He is the show-stealer in all the scenes; even when he shares the stage with the inimitable Mr. Downey Jr. Others like Cheadle, Pearce do justice to their role. However I felt the later was underutilized. Ty Simpkins probably acted a wee bit more sheepish than was required but I think that kind of felt good on the whole.Direction: Shane Black has done decently in his first Iron Man flick. If the intention was to show more of Stark (the human) than just the gloss and glamor of the man in the armor then he certainly excelled.I do have second thoughts on whether this kind of story will hold good in the future. People flock to cinemas to see superheros like Iron Man kick evil bosses butts. But the director kind of makes up in the climax.There is also this humor portion of the script, which was kind of nicely handled. There were a handful of scenes which had the audience in splits. Especially the one where Tony (all tied up) awaits his suit when he is talking to a couple of bad guys. Overall, I feel the director has portions to improve, but there is no major flaw that is worth talking about.Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-iron-man-3-2013","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

All the performances were excellent as usual with Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow taking top plaudits (for me anyway). I also have to mention the young Ty Simpkins who plays a kid, Harley Keener, who befriends Tony when he's 'dead'. He played his part very well and we can only hope it leads to bigger things for the young man.

In the third installment we come across a more vulnerable & anxiety ridden Iron Man. After the life changing battle of New York(the battle takes place in The Avengers), Stark still has nightmares about the incident & suffers from insomnia. A new threat, who calls himself The Mandarin(Ben Kingsley), is a terrorist who's known everywhere. His next target is the USA & the president of the US, Sal Kennedy(William Sadler). In the course of the film, Iron Man also meets people he met long ago at a new year's eve party in Switzerland like, Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce) & Maya Hansen(Rebecca Hall). Now, it is up to Iron Man & James Rhodes/Iron Patriot(Don Cheadle) to protect America & the president from the brutal terrorist, Mandarin.I would like to start by saying that, Iron Man 3 was a brilliant film! The special effects were mind blowing, the action sequences were insanely awesome & both Aldrich Killian & The Mandarin were terrifying villains. The 3D was spectacular, especially in all the action sequences. However, the film wasn't brilliant enough. After watching The Avengers, my expectations were sky high. Though this film was wonderful in many aspects, it didn't have as much Iron Man in it, as we would've liked to have. We have plenty of Tony Stark but, we hardly see Iron Man in action. Even in the sequences where he's in action as Iron Man, he's overshadowed by the Iron Patriot, his various Iron Man suits & even Pepper Potts who have more to do in the action packed scenes than Iron Man himself. Iron Man just stands around doing almost nothing. The performances are mind blowing. Robert Downey Jr. is irresistible as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After seeing him in four movies playing the same character, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the title role. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Stark's girlfriend Pepper Potts. Guy Pearce is outstanding as baddie, Aldrich Killian. Ben Kingsley is terrifyingly brilliant as Iron Man's archenemy, The Mandarin. Don Cheadle is impressive as James Rhodes/Iron Patriot. Rebecca Hall is effective as Maya Hansen. Jon Favreau is hilarious as Happy Hogan. Paul Bettany is hysterical as the voice of Jarvis. William Sadler is great as US president, Sal Kennedy.

The movie is very different from the characters actually created for comics. It is similar to the 'Elseworlds' series created by DC. If you are a politically conscious adult like me, you will find similarities from real world. To cut it short...the movie has everything for everybody, child, teen or adult. Its not just about the action or the Iron Man suit..its about the people in them. The undercurrent of the movie is strong. The subtle message that whatever you watch on news media is not always the truth. You will be disappointed if you are expected full on Rambo style in-your- face action or if you are expecting a comic book copy of character. Its like the new Batman series movies which recreated the characters with whom we can relate to...not just super-villains with magical powers. To end it: Perfectly timed action, humor and comedy. Love the script and story.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

The good thing I think everybody can agree on is this is a movie that can be taken seriously and is much more mature then the other Ironman films, in a good way. I've seen several spoiler filled reviews so people can talk about what they liked didn't like.Here's how I'll put it. If you don't think you'll like it you won't simple as that. This will not be the movie that will change your mind, catch it on Redbox. This is the big deciding factor on if you will like this movie or not. Are you willing to unbiasedly watch a movie, putting away all previous expectations from trailers, earlier movies, and comic book lore, and enjoy it on it's own merit. If yes then this is a great Ironman movie. It's almost more of a Bourne / Tom Clancy movie then an Ironman movie. Which is great everybody complained about there not being enough tension or Avengers being a kids movie. Here you go, most tension I've felt in a superhero movie while still having fun and laughing.But as I said, admittedly the marketing for this movie completely mis sold it and I cannot begrudge anybody for being disappointed. But honestly if you can get past the total change in direction for the series then you will probably enjoy it a whole lot.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

There had been a deluge of Superhero films recently it seemed and I wasn't sure I really want to see another one. Yes the Avengers had been fun and I had enjoyed the first Iron Man, but not seen the second one which I had been told was disappointing.I have said it before, every great movie starts as a great script, and here we have one. Tony Stark's one liners and put downs even in the company of a small boy are priceless and restrain the film from slipping into melodrama that we don't need. The plot here is pretty simple, the world is under threat from a villain and Stark / Ironman is going to stop him. There is an important message here, that not every terrorist is what he always seems. Robert Downey junior who seems unstoppable at the moment, is on top form again as the playboy genius and all the supporting cast are great as well with a star in pretty much every supporting role. Guy Pearce does a great turn as a disgruntled Scientist. I found the film very enjoyable, well paced and well directed by Shane Black, who I remember from the original Predator movie, and if memory serves me right he made his name in Hollywood by writing The Last Boy scout. It seems he was ready for the Directors Chair and does a great job with what I hope is the last Iron Man film for now. The film brings things nicely to full circle, yes, by all means let him appear in more Avengers films, but I think, and I am sure Downey would agree, that this is a more than satisfactory end to the story of Iron Man. Thoroughly entertaining!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

It starts nicely with 1999 New Year's eve which becomes the back bone of the story that develops. It has a beautiful mixture in right proportions of drama, humour (very enjoyable and subtle ones) and of course the blasts, instead of just sticking to one tone of seriousness or coolness. Shane Black's taken a bold step by moving out of the clich√©s and creating something which has some very innovative moments of ""Superhero Rescue"", Iron Man(s) sky spectacle and a couple unpredictable twists. Everyone's played their part very well, though Sir Ben Kingsley clearly needs a special mention for his amazing portrayal of Mandarin. The character builds its image of unstoppable terror such wonderfully with Kingsley's unique oration style that one might start thinking that if he continues in the same way, he might even beat Joker. I find it surprising that it has submerged below 80% in Rotten Tomatoes and under 8 here in IMDb, since these are the same people who loved Avengers which if you have a brick by brick comparison doesn't match up to Iron Man 3's fun and enjoyable experience or even directorial beauty. A pure summer popcorn movie, thorough entertainment nevertheless!(imeansuraj.blogspot.in)","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

The Action was superb , even though not touching the heights of Avengers it was still quite good and innovative. I could not understand the motive of the villain properly and it felt quite generic to me , which is a big minus point for me . The ""twist"" was done in a funny and unexpected way and caught me by surprise . Talking about 3D , it was pretty non-existent and only a very handful amount of shots had depth . So, While it does not reach the height of Iron Man / Avengers , this Shane Black 's film is a definitive improvement over the dull Iron Man 2 , It has good amounts of comedy and one-liners but I think it was under the margin for me. I also expected it to expand the MCU and introduce or hint new characters and other films but it didn't happen . It is a very good, if not quite a brilliant start to Marvel's Phase 2.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

With him having borderline PTSD and a new villain that has an odd connection to Tony in more ways than he would ever want.Iron Man 3 is the first film in the trilogy to not be directed by Jon Favreau but still include him as the memorable and lovable Happy. But instead of Favreau, Legendary writer and director Shane Black takes over with being silent for nearly a decade of not working on any films to break out again with the biggest solo film yet. Black directed the hell out of this third installment and yes there is a tone change from two to three but the barebones of the series are still their with a new and original story and a whole hell of a lot of amazing action sequences. And with Black building a lot of the sets and doing a lot of the stunts in real life instead of digitally adding it in makes this film feel real. Writing wise, the film is overall extremely good, one major piece of the film I didn't like too much but the overall film is very enjoyable and fantastically written as well. Robert Downey Jr. hasn't felt more comical or broken, depending on what way you look at him, with the fantastic writing of his character. Each character in the film has a sense of comedy in a lot better ways than they did back in Iron Man 2 and it makes the film feel a lot more light hearted and more fun as well. And with the physical comedy like Mark-42 and his imperfect quirks in the film with him being a prototype suit makes the film feel real showing a fractured Tony that isn't at 100% and is almost caught off guard in every scene. My biggest issue is during the third act the 'villain' comes off very awkwardly and somewhat upsets me with his write off and destruction of the iconic comic book antagonist. The acting is amazing though with Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley joining the cast and making some memorable performances throughout out. Obviously Downey Jr., kills it with such a different look at his iconic Tony Stark with him being broken and knocked down from The Avengers and his personal ties in this film. Cheadle also is great with his best performance in the series yet in this film with his dialogue feeling more smoothed out than in Iron Man 2. And of course my favorite performance done by Pearce is haunting and definitely makes a huge impact on the series and shows that the MCU can make a good villain in a stand alone film. With one flaw that is pretty big, this film is great in a lot of other ways and makes the perfect end to a great trilogy. Iron Man 3 gets an 8.75/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""Iron Man 3""- A welcome return to form and a fine start to Phase Two of the ever-growing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3683353/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","12 April 2017","After the misstep of the divisive but well-meaning ""Iron Man 2"" and the phenomena that was ""The Avengers"", Marvel kick-started Phase Two of their ever-growing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" with the trilogy- capping ""Iron Man 3,"" now under control of the magnificent director and co- writer Shane Black of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" fame. While the film has suffered a slight bit of backlash due to some unconventional choices in the narrative, I personally felt the film was, if anything, a welcome return to form for the ""Iron Man"" saga. It reminded me of just why we fell in love with Tony Stark in the first place, and emerges as a generally stellar entry in that beloved franchise that Marvel has been building for the better part a decade now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is at an interesting place in his life. After having thwarted evil on three occasions prior, he's finally finding some real purpose in life and making great strides in his development of newer and more complex armor... yet at the same time, he's also finally started to feel the repercussions of all he's been through, manifesting in the form of anxiety and panic- attacks. When his friend and colleague Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is critically injured in a terrorist attack orchestrated by a mysterious figure known as the ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley), Tony goes into a rage and directly issues a threat against this menacing presence. As a result, he is attacked and left for dead, stranded in rural Tennessee, where he will find inspiration in the most unlikely of places- a precocious young boy (Ty Simpkins)... At the same time, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) investigates a corporate rival from Tony's past (Guy Pearce) who may be connected to the devious goings-on that have left her boss and lover stranded and presumed dead...In my mind, the greatest strengths of the film are the very same risks taken with the story and development of character that some others take issue with. Black has woven a tale that serves as a near-ideal continuation of the saga while also subverting virtually every single expectation we have as an audience. We came in to see ""Iron Man 3"", and yet the film places the great portion of its focus on Tony as a man first outside of the armor, with the action making up only a small portion of the screen time. We came in expecting a dark and treacherous tale, yet the film is filled with heart and humor and a sort-of unconventional surrogate father-and-son story. We have pre-conceived notions regarding who will be defined as hero and villain, and yet nothing is quite what it seems. The film is a giant gamble, seemingly pushing the audience's buttons at every turn... and I think it was a great success. You won't know what to expect at any time, and it's a thrilling and enthralling experience as a result.At the heart of it all is the cast, each and every one of whom continue to shine in their roles. Downey Jr., Paltrow and other returning actors such as Don Cheadle and Favreau all give in the same top-notch performances as they always have. There's nothing more that can be said in their favor that hasn't already been echoed a thousand times before. Newcomers including Kingsley and Pearce are a welcome addition, who provide further levels of intrigue and development to the overall universe. And I was quite taken by Simpkins in his supporting role as a young child who forms a sort-of begrudging relationship with Stark. I was familiar with Simpkins from his turns in the bone-chilling ""Insidous"" franchise, and he continues to stretch his chops as one of the finest child-actors working today here. He's definitely one to keep an eye on.In terms of visuals and storytelling, the film is spellbinding and greatly builds off of what came before to magnificent results. While I did miss original director Jon Favreau's creative vision, Black is a fantastic replacement and very much incorporates what came before while giving it his own creative spin. With his quirky ""buddy cop"" sensibilities leading to some of the best banter of the series and his decidedly ""80's"" style giving the film a sort-of throwback feel at times, the film is definitely a great deal of fun and compliments the first two quite well. This feels like an ""Iron Man"" movie that had somehow gone back in time and was filmed in 1987, and I loved that about it. Even the musical score by Brian Tyler (who I'm honestly usually not a fan of) gets right into the mood Black established with some funky beats and amusingly kitschy themes that somehow work.While the film might not be perfect with a few too many oddball moments and a slightly over-stretched narrative, it boggles my mind that anyone- let alone a healthy portion of people- dislike it. It's fast. Funny. Crazy. Old-school. And just a blast and a half. It's one of my favorite entries in the entire Marvel saga to watch and re-watch, and I think it's a darned good capping chapter to the ""Iron Man"" trilogy. I give it a very good 8 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And they've done this with Iron Man by incorporating the best of the Classic IM comics (Gold/Silver age) and the modern 2000's IM comics. And in so doing, they've been challenging and surprising us consistently along the way. What Iron Man fan would've ever expected the speech that Tony Stark gives at the end of Iron Man 1 to go the way it did...in the FIRST film? Who would've thought that they'd actually find a way to realistically depict the 'suitcase suit' as they did in IM2? Or incorporate SHIELD so seamlessly (including its otherwise preposterous carrier, as in Avengers)? So, you have to really go into these Iron Man movies with an open mind, because you never know what to expect...and maybe never more so than Iron Man 3. Make no mistake: there is at least 1 character that is so drastically changed from its comic origins that it will likely upset a lot of fans. And it took me out of the movie for a few minutes while I tried to reconcile it with my own preconceived expectations. Ultimately, I'm OK with it, for the reason that I hope people think of the real world for a moment, and the parallel veiled political statement it makes.And this movie is filled with a lot of wry statements like that. It is even more of a 'thinking man's Iron Man' than the first movie. If you're a Golden Age IM comic reader, you really need to challenge yourself about what Iron Man always was: one of the deepest, 'thinking man's' comic books. Fantastic Four was crazy fun, Spider-Man was wisecracking action, Avengers all-out battle. So, on this note, I think Iron Man 3, for all it's ups and downs, actually delivers brilliantly.This is not a wall-to-wall action fest, but rather a character-driven dramatic ride that gives Downey, Paltrow, & Cheadle plenty of screen time to explore their characters. It's nice to see Rhodey get some real heroic moments this time, and Cheadle has now clearly taken ownership of the role, making us completely forget that 'other actor' who played the part the first time.There are laughs, there is suspense, drama, and yes some slow parts. But, Iron Man 3 certainly bakes its cake and knows how to pull it out of the oven at the right time for a rousing finale spectacle. And, this time, the inventive villains (which 2000's-era comic fans will know & enjoy) are a refreshing change-of-pace from the ""metal vs metal"" of the previous two films.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The good news is, IRON MAN 3 is a minor improvement over the tepid IRON MAN 2 (2010). Unfortunately, just about everything in IRON MAN 3 is an overkill -- the plot is heavy-handed and the humor is too broad while the superhero element is surprisingly a bit too grounded for its own good (you know it when you see it).Director Shane Black (who replaced Jon Favreau from the first two IRON MAN movies) does a credible job handling his first big-budget Hollywood movie. He knows how to stage a few exciting action sequences as well as delivering his trademark of witty one-liners. You can say IRON MAN 3 is the funniest of all three movies and this is especially made possible by the ever-charismatic Robert Downey Jr. As the ego-centric and now-anxious Tony Stark, Downey Jr. is often funny yet engaging enough to root for his character. I must say this is the best incarnation of Tony Stark I've ever seen so far. One surprising element that I never thought possible is how Black delivers a great buddy chemistry between Tony Stark and Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle). They immediately reminded me of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the LETHAL WEAPON series (where Black used to write the first two installments). That's not all, Downey Jr. also has a brief but memorable buddy moment with the talented Ty Simpkins who plays Harley during the Tennessee scene.It seems to me that Shane Black is more interested to feature more Tony Stark in person than the Iron Man itself. On the surface, it's a bold reinterpretation from the usual IRON MAN movie but I'm sure a lot of fans and moviegoers alike are expecting an IRON MAN movie, not a Tony Stark movie. Then there's the radical change of the bloated plot written by Drew Pearce and Shane Black himself. Apart from trying too hard to cram a lot of subgenre into a 130-minute length, I was particularly shocked to find the surprise twist halfway through. Let's just say it's a total cop-out the way how they treated a certain character in this movie. As for the two featured villains, Ben Kingsley's The Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian are sadly unmemorable. Even the post-credits scene this time around, let's just say, doesn't get you excited all over the place.Overall, IRON MAN 3 is a middling effort and it's quite sad to see Shane Black fails to capitalize the full potential of a superhero genre.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/iron-man-3-2013.html","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

This one is the best of the three. And no, it's not the special effects, not the fire works, not even the plot twists. They're all in, but they were there beforehand, the special bit about this third Iron Man movie is the combination of a very well written character whose weakness in a manner of speaking is also his strength. Who shows more humanity with all its frailness, as he faces his greatest adversary. It's not exactly the Mandarin we're familiar with from the Marvel comic, but Iron Man himself is not exactly the comic book Iron Man, so it makes sense. But it all works, as I said because the well written character is met with a tour de force of acting by a certain Robert Downey Jr.who's simply superb. It's one of the best performances I've seen from an actor in a long while. And it makes this super hero movie just this extra little bit better than most. It makes it real, even if you're not a fun of the genre, which I have to admit, I am.

He fears he will not be able to protect his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) from the various enemies he has come to have after wearing the Iron Man armor. One of them, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), decides to attack him with full force, destroying his mansion and putting Pepper's life at risk. To face him, Stark will need to rise from the bottom of the sea, where he was taken along with the wreckage of the mansion, and overcome his greatest fear: that of failure.Black and Pearce wrote the script for this sequence based on the comic book arc ""Extremis"" written by Warren Ellis. Obviously, the adaptation is slightly inspired by the comics, maintaining only one basic idea and introducing a new technology: remote control of armor, without going deeper and showing in the film the real potential of this technology. One of the creators of the virus in the comics was Aldrich Killian, who does not have a major role in the comics, but who has changed his story in the film, being the main antagonist. Even a story of an unrequited love from the past is created to strengthen the bonds between Killian, Potts and Tony throughout the narrative of the film. Another difference is that in the comics, Mallen is the host of the Extremis virus and it is he who confronts Iron Man. Mallen's powers are basically the same as we saw in the film, super strength, that shape with red eyes, blasts of fire through the mouth, the only difference is that it doesn't explode. However, the fidelity of adapting the comics to theaters is no demerit, on the contrary, the end result is extremely satisfactory.In this third film, the producers and screenwriters took the main character to another level, addressing some aspects in more depth. Not only does Iron Man stand out, but mainly Tony Stark gains several layers of depth. The first minutes of the film are the ones that make this clearer, when we see a more fragile, more humanized facet. Tony starts to deal with his worst fears and suffers consequences from facts from previous films, being just a ""man in a can"" and having to deal with aliens, other superheroes and the fear of not being able to protect the people he loves from even more real and powerful threats. Since the Chitauri attack in New York, Tony has been extremely emotionally shaken. He began to isolate himself in his laboratory and devote less time to Pepper, has recurring dreams about the battle of New York, has difficulty sleeping, even staying awake for days and doing what he knows best: working nonstop on new creations and technologies , thus developing constant anxiety attacks. Tony's vulnerability permeates the entire narrative.The most political tone of the script is noteworthy, previously treated only as a background. Mandarin, through his speeches, points the finger in the face of the United States and points out the hatred that has led to attacks in recent years. It also speaks of the neglect of oil spills and shells aimed at favoring only a few groups or individuals, and how all this will lead the country to continue suffering at the hands of terrorists. Not to mention that the organization IMA (Advanced Mechanical Ideas) and the oil giant Roxxon, known to comic book fans, gain space on the screen, in addition to the appearance of cinematographic versions of several of the Iron Man armor loved by readers of the comic books. Interesting to the public also to see the first meeting between Tony and Yinsen, many years before the cave in Afghanistan, which had been mentioned in the first film.Even with mistakes, in general, Shane Black proves to be a talented artist by mastering humor and action, from the conception of the script to behind the camera. The director wisely bets on the talent and ability of Robert Downey Jr, who shines again on the scene with his unmistakable sarcasm, writing numerous clever, fast and fun dialogues and making the action move forward in an intelligent and bold way. The scene of the destruction of the Malibu mansion is one of the best-directed and most creative sequences in recent years. It's really exciting and breathtaking and it was just the trigger for the rest of the action. In the course of the projection, we still see the Tennessee fight, the escape of Stark in Miami and especially the rescue of the Air Force One crew and obviously the megalomaniacal climax on an oil rig, in more action-packed sequences over the air and over the land, all packed with stunning visual effects, which get better with each film.In fact, the effects are a show apart, as is the production designer of Bill Brzeski and photography by John Toll. Brian Tyler's soundtrack changes the tone of the first films and brings a greater variety of styles, but in the instrumental part it does not present anything so innovative, but still very efficient, action renas have gained a lot of emotion and urgency in the hands of the composer. The pair of editors Peter S. Elliot and Jeffrey Ford, on the other hand, deserve a lot of reverence, as they deliver a two-hour film that flies by. The film does not get to be irregular and has a very well defined pace.Iron Man 3 is undoubtedly an exciting start to Marvel's second phase. Even with errors, the film entertains and delivers what the Iron Man fan has gotten used to and looks forward to. After the worldwide success of The Avengers, there was a great expectation for the following films and fortunately we were not disappointed. The sarcastic humor and the action used correctly and at key points in the story are very well balanced and exciting. The narrative advances in the story of the title character, promoting changes that will certainly influence his participation in the next films, in addition to entertaining an audience of all ages.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie simply wasn't fun. It jumped from scene to scene without transition, and there were entirely too many characters. The music was bad. I think the worst part was the focus on Stark's PTSD. I realize that writers and directors seem to want to try and humanize movie heroes, but superheroes aren't ordinary and I at least don't want to watch them break down; no matter how triumphantly they return.From the reviews I have now read it sounds like they tried to do too much and there just wasn't enough time to do it well. I am certain many people will like this film, but it was bad enough I don't think I can ever even watch any of its predecessors again. Its an amazing piece of work that can ruin what came before.","19 out of 42 found this helpful.

In this film we see a lot more of Tony Stark rather than Iron Man which I liked. Robert Downy Jr is once again great. The action is a lot of fun in this, I really liked the final battle and there is good humour in this film. I didn't mind the twist with the villain because I never read the comics so didn't know who he was but I can understand why it upset people. I do think that the film might have been better had they not done the twist because the real villain was not great. Also some stuff that was done at the end of the movie was ignored in the future movies. But overall there is a lot of fun in this film and it is better then the second Iron Man .8.0/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tony stark is on the run after being targeted by some hidden enemy during the height of his fame and tech level, but this movie helps him realize he needs more than the suit to be content in life and really commits to Pepper. You get to see all the signature tech from his movies while also enjoying bonus action from extra suits in his arsenal. However the worst part of the movie was actually pretty cool, the glowing pill taking bad guys felt like very heavy sci fi. They were a terrifying idea for an enemy though and it would be cool to see what they wouldve done against the Avengers or even Thanos, but still its not as easy of a rewatch as the first one for me so it gets 9 stars. Cant forget to talk about how the main bad guy was very well done.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A LOT! The early critical reviews are so unreasonably favorable it almost seems like a conspiracy to get the people to the theaters . Well its been happening a lot lately , early reviews being so great that people expect all these movies to be potential game changers like 'The Dark Knight'.Robert Downey Jr. is a great personality , an amazing actor and the only one who breathes any life to this franchise . But a movie depending on an actor's name can never be great. An actor should never be bigger than the movie.NEVER. The movie starts like every superhero movie does , leaving you with plenty of expectations. Apparently , the experience with the wormhole has had an effect on Tony Stark and he begins to suffer from these anxiety attacks and insomnia and becomes a workaholic spending a lot of time in his private 'lab'. Enters new villain.And then begin a series of action clich√©s all of them been done already...too many times. There were a couple of comic moments and maybe one hilariously twisted twist.Other than that no attention is played on the screenplay. Things happen just because they have to in order to get to the (boring) climax.How people get where they do without any hurdles is comical. Why don't these guys learn from Mr. Nolan that the writing, story and screenplay is MORE important than the meaningless special effects.There is nothing special about this movie but i gave it 3 stars simply because of the cast. Apart from RDj , the star who shines out is Sir Ben Kingsley. He simply steals the show and i wish there were more of him. The guy is a class apart and does a brilliant job as The Mandarin. Oh how i wish there was more of him. Guy Pearce is potentially wasted and so is the talented Rebbeca Hall. Gwyneth Paltrow is the same old and so is Don Cheadle. And yes there was this clich√©d cute kid who served no purpose whatsoever except for making the movie more cheesy.Shane Black's directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was an amazingly crafted crime comedy. With Iron Man 3 he disappoints. But the positive that we take away from all this is that IM3 is the last of the installments.Regardless , like me , people will rush to the theaters to watch this and most of them will be , for the lack of a better word , disappointed ....and let down.And for all those who wait for the credits to roll so they can watch a post credit scene , let me save you those 10 precious minutes to say that nothing epic happens. Let me rephrase that. Nothing happens.Looking forward to Man Of Steel now.","20 out of 45 found this helpful.

My favorite character is Tony, he is so strong, flexible, clever to use his suit. I want the directors to produce more movie about Iron man. For example, Iron man 4 or Amazing Iron man, etc... All the scenes are great such as fighting scene, love scene between Pepper and Tony, and the scene when he finding out the true that cause the problem. I watch this movie for about 4-5 times already.I really dislike the scene in the end of the movie when he throws his power into the sea.

Enhanced with a decent and by now mainstream 3-D experience that still doesn't quite bring in the complete visceral experience and a subliminal psychological incorporation of the Jaws (1975) audience identification storyline that pulls on the American public's patriotism echoing the recent Olympus Has Fallen (2013) espionage-terrorist genre along with a huge enjoyable Ben Kingsley twist, this superhero action-thriller explodes on the screen. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark's character continues it deepening layered personality, exposing more humiliation and humanism that Jennifer Garner's character reflected so well in Elektra (2005).The movie is somewhat dependent on its technical photographic 3-D special effects for part of its presentation and it suffers somewhat in its lack of complete immersion into the clarity and focus on all its elements (either the technology is not quite there yet or more money and time needed to be expended), thus the rich density while enhanced doesn't quite match up with a movie such as Hugo (2011) for its qualitatively superior 3-D presentation.Iron Man 3 continues to improve with its further inclusion in its storyline stronger emotional relational elements to balance the movie's action sequences offering this movie a more human component than say the more consistently fast-paced suspense ridden Speed (1994) or the tech-intelligent and slick sci fi thriller D√©j√† Vu (2006) though not as substantively strong or conflicted as found in Spiderman 2 (2004), Spiderman 3 (2007) or even The Incredibles (2004), Bolt (2008), or The Dark Knight Rises (2012).The storyline is somewhat spoiled by its overly ambitious inclusion of cute lines and characters that reflect it attempt at audience identification with the everyman or everyboy characters in the movie from the over the top comedic television producer or the small town boy even though it might capture the enlarged audiences interest and appreciation of the movie. The Green Lantern (2011) excelled by incorporated instead an everyman as its principle character played by Ryan Reynold for the audience to identify as well as a much more subtle use of rich humor so as to avoid having to use secondary characters to obtain a similar effect or some more obvious and standard manipulation for laughter, The Green Lantern's entire movie was focused on the mass audience instead of the smaller elite population.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I hadn't watched a Marvel movie in a while, so had forgotten how good he was until I watched this and I was grinning from ear to ear in a lot of his scenes (and sometimes crying). Tony Stark is so brilliant and witty!
This movie is narrated by Tony Stark, which is interesting and different. The plot is awesome and has some surprising twists and turns. The animation and CGI is top notch as usual and the dialogue is great and the acting is perfect. It plays like a mystery thriller, specifically like a James Rollins novel, which was awesomely disturbing at times. The villains are interesting and not whom you expect. The climax is so, so, so tense and thrilling and very well-played - actually the whole movie is.
I also loved how this focuses solely on Tony Stark and shows him when he's a rock bottom with no-one and nothing, pressed into a corner with nowhere else to go. Downey really did an awesome job of capturing Tony Stark as he battles PTSD.

It was very different but enjoyable. The action was great but it definitely had a different feel to it. The story is about Iron man, who this time around very close friend, is injured by a terrorist and is in the hospital fighting for his life. Iron Man shows a different side in this film this time. This time he appears to grow up a little bit and not be so self absorbed. Along side his sidekick, flawlessly played by Don Cheadle, this film is another great addition to the Iron Man trilogy. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys the Iron Man trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The only thing I was praying for was for the creators to give me a better experience than the one I had with Iron Man 2. And it did.So, the story involves Tony Stark's confrontation with Mandarin. Not to give anything away, there's a twist connected with the main villain, but any average movie-goer will call it about 40 minutes in. There's also a story going on with Tony's growing paranoia about his and his partner's safety. This is actually my biggest problem with the movie: the writers don't go deep enough into Tony's personal story and development. All his issues seem to be resolved off screen or during one of endless array of fight scenes. With that said, I do believe that Tony's obsession with the suit could make for a great story, which could be told so much better, should the writers skip a few action scenes and devote more time to character development. Aside from that, the story doesn't offer many surprises, but is compelling enough to keep you from being bored, with some genuinely funny jokes and a few really good action scenes. All in all, a good addition to the franchise, definitely better than Iron Man 2. Totally worth seeing just for Robert Downey Jr.'s great (as always) performance and some high-quality action sequences in the frames of a decent story.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I read many of the reviews here before I watched this third installment and after watching it I don't understand why so many viewers hated this film.The movie had almost everything. The only thing that was missing for me were the Avengers. Having said that, it was a small price to pay as I totally enjoyed this new take on the Iron Man series and definitely felt entertained the whole time.To say as some have said, that there was little humor in this, that's the part I don't quite get. I found it very funny throughout and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was still clever, irreverent and just plain hilarious in his dialog and I found myself giggling and laughing sometimes outright. One particularly funny scene is when he's talking to super fan Gary in his van. Gary who says he's patterned his whole look after Tony, shows him a tattoo on his arm of a man. Tony says, ""Uh.. A Hispanic Scott Baio?"" LOL! Then says, ""Oh I'm sorry is that me?"" Gary says yeah and says ""I had them do it off of a doll that I made."" LMAO! 
Not only that, even that bad guys had a few funny lines. As Tony, two thirds of the way through the movie corners one bad guy from up on a balcony, the guy sticks his arms up in the air, drops his weapon and says, ""Honestly? I hate working here, they are so weird!"" LOL! (Tony doesn't shoot him and the guy slips away.)Plus I was mesmerized by the plot and sequence of events from the time I started watching until the end of the movie. It was interesting seeing Tony from a new perspective. The fact that he loses his home and is basically homeless and presumed dead by the majority of the world and oh yeah, then there's Pepper who he's separated from and after all that, he's suffering anxiety or panic attacks, Not to mention he has to fight the bad guys without his suit at various points through over half the movie. With everything that's going on he never falters for very long, he just picks himself up and keeps moving forward.I thought it was a great movie, Great acting, Ben Kingsley in particular was superb as was Robert Downey Jr. There was corruption in high places as well which is no big surprise, with lots of drama, yet also containing a lot of humorous moments. Exciting action and phenomenal special effects round everything out. In one scene near the end of the movie it spectacular as Tony does an air rescue. I've never seen that in any movie before.So this may not have been as great as the first Iron Man but it's very close and it definitely held it's own. I enjoyed it start to finish.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its funny, its full of action to the brim, it has a solid story, it has plot twists, memorable moments and above all it has a little bit of charm. The acting is superb and Robert Downey Jr rocks once again. Shane Black has saved the Iron man trilogy. After the second movie, I was worried that like the Transformers movies, there would be such a perfect first instalment that the other simply could not reach its level. I was wrong, and gladly too. Iron Man 3 is by far one of the best Marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder. From the one liners to the unfamiliar feeling of desperation for Tony Stark. The fiery AIM's weapons feel like they have been deprived from Terminators, they are fantastic and make great enemies to all of Starks suits, MK1 to 42. Iron Man 3 is an exhilarating joy ride. Watch it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyway Iron Man 3 though not on par with the first film in the trilogy ,is still a quit entertaining yet overrated movie at the same time. So why is that?Firstly up to today (2016 September) is the highest grossing solo superhero movie of all time making 1,215 billion $ and Robert won the People's Choice awards for the best Action Hero of the year and in general the movie won and get nominated on several awards. And yes the story is quit interesting, the effects are amazing and Ben Kingley was a mega troll move on the director part. Though not many liked this interpretation of the Mandarin this troll move was really funny to say the truth. Those are the pros of the flick.Now to the cons: it has a strange pacing and at times it feels either too fast or too slow, and the second revelation about our lead villain was a bit dumb and didn't make a lot of sense to me at least. Now it is common knowledge that the MCU movies are lacking in making good villains with the exception of the fan-favorite Loki and her is the same story ,different melody. And now to the box office, I find it too much that the movie grossed more than the two previous Iron Man together and this is due to three things.One the Iron Man Logo sells big, two it is a closing chapter to the first Marvel Cinematic Universe Avenger (not in the time- line of the series, but of the release of the movies) and three and final as a Christmas movie it is among my favorites along side Die Hard, It is a Wonderful Life and Homw Alone. All in all the Iron Man trilogy isn't one of the best and with only the first movie being praised by everyone and the two sequel being OK and good closure respectively.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The finale is insane and one of the best action set pieces of the series.

The suit is a part of him the same way the rest of his body is.The love interest, Pepper Potts, gets the screen time and development she lacked in the previous two films.

I'm sorry. That was rude. Okay, let me be clear. I love Iron Man. I love Robert Downey Jr.. I love Shane Black. And I've admitted many times that RDJ could spew out Black's dialogue in a film about recycling Coke bottles and I'd watch. It's just that Iron Man 3 does everything it can to test that loyalty. Is it as good as Avengers? Of course not. Is it the best film of the trilogy? Not in my opinion. Is it better than Iron Man 2? I'm not so sure I can say that. To be honest, Iron Man 3 is a different genre than Iron Man 2 and even Iron Man 1. And that is where my hesitance to tout it comes from. When I first heard that Shane Black was doing part 3, I was psyched. The man has made a living of making great action comedies for years. Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, and Long Kiss Goodnight, to name a few. However, the things I loved about those films is that despite the humor and comedic interactions, you could suddenly find yourself in a gritty, bloody, hardcore shootout. Humorous scenes suddenly turned on their ear by a visceral murder. A suicidal breakdown. Revenge at any cost. And Black could weave these things effortlessly. Even though those films had the help of an R rating, I had faith that Black could still come close to delivering a little taste of this in Iron Man 3. Especially with the threat of Tony Stark's biggest comic book nemesis, The Mandarin, looming over the storyline. The tone from the commercials also seemed to hint at the darkest plot we'd seen for the character. However, Iron Man 3 turns away from Martin Riggs, Charly Baltimore, and Joe Hallenbeck and leans more toward Gay Perry and Harry Lockhart. In other words, Iron Man 3 is not an action comedy. It is a comedy with action in it.Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is one of my favorite films. However, the tone wouldn't be the first I'd use to fit this superhero film. Take for instance the handling of the film's villain. Director Shane Black does something with The Mandarin, that I won't spoil, which comic book fans will either love or absolutely despise. This...um...how should I put this...'reinvention' fits the tone of a Kiss Kiss Bang Bang but not any Marvel film we've seen thus far. Now, don't get me wrong. The jokes in Iron Man 3 are very funny. But they far outnumber any action you will see in it. I, for one, thought the balance of this action comedy franchise was preparing to shift. I was just misled as to which direction it was shifting. A direction I thought was reserved for Edgar Wright's Ant-Man or James Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy.The performances by the returning cast are solid once again. They are the one constant of the franchise. As I've said before, Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. He captures the essence of that character better than any actor has any comic book character ever. Though, this is the lightest lifting Downey Jr. has had to do performance wise. They touch on Tony's post traumatic stress disorder brought on from his experiences in The Avengers. Unfortunately, it is not fully explored and eventually brushed away through jokes way faster than Stark's self destructive tendencies were in Iron Man 2. This film is probably the funniest Tony Stark has ever been. However, the best performance Robert Downey Jr. has given as the character is still, ironically, in Avengers. Even though Paltrow is disliked in her public persona, she is adored as Pepper Potts. Keeping serve opposite an actor such as Downey Jr., in four films now, is something she deserves enormous credit for. Cheadle, though almost an afterthought in this film, also has proved that he can hold his own against Downey Jr. in a scene. More so than Terrence Howard did in Iron Man 1. I just wish these two could get more screen time together. Because when they do interact, the relationship of Tony and Rhodey just sings.I had high hopes for Kingsley as The Mandarin. Sexy Beast proved to me how much of a badass he can be. However, Black's risky reinvention of his character limited what Kingsley was allowed to do. Speaking of missed opportunities, Guy Pearce's abilities were also minimally tapped in this. His flippancy, though amusing, didn't really seem to present a viable danger to our hero. Even through the climax. Love or hate Iron Man 2, there was no question as to the danger and threat that Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko gave Tony. The villains in Iron Man 3 don't scare you as much as Vanko, Stane, or even Hammer did.After all that, you'd think I hated the film. I don't. Iron Man 3 is not a step backwards for the franchise or for Marvel. It, to me, is just a risky step sideways. A step in a different direction. A direction, as the Mandarin warned, I didn't see coming.For more reviews check out simplisticreviews.blogspot.com","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I Personally Liked The Music TBH.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

AFTER WATCHING DARK KNIGHT PEOPLE EXPECT OTHER SUPER HERO MOVIES TO BE IN IT,S FLAVOR BUT IRON MAN IS SURELY A FRESH NEW FEEL.WHY WATCH IT : SMART, HUMOROUS,AND FUN.WHY NOT CATCH IT : YOU BEING A BATMAN FAN BOY.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie starts with Tony Stark in the flashback remembering how he created some personal demons due to his egoistic and brash personality, without realizing it at that particular moment. Of course the build-up is quite obvious, leading us to the present day where Iron Man is back from his encounter with the Aliens in New York (the movie The Avengers) and as usual spending most of his time in his laboratory at his Malibu mansion playing with his toys, the Iron man suits. Enter the Mandarin leader of an international terrorist organization called Ten Rings, hell-bent on teaching the United States of America a lesson, nothing original about that, controlled by a suave scientist Aldrich Killian, who can manipulate the brain cells and use it as a deadly weapon literally turning a person into a bomb.But behind this plot this movie is different from all the earlier ones. It is about Tony Stark's emotional ride experiencing friendship, love, anger, fear and most importantly anxiety. There is in fact a scene in the movie when a kid asks him a question and he feels weak. Jarvis (the voice behind the suit) tells him that he is perfectly fine besides just feeling anxiety and his reaction is of complete disbelief. Seeing his world being destroyed in front of his eyes, the cool Tony Stark succumbs to the emotion of vendetta and sets out to seek the Mandarin. Robert Downey Jr. was meant to be Tony Stark, period. The skill with which has interwoven the complexities and eccentricities of Stark along with the responsibility of Iron Man is a treat to watch. As a man he has no superhuman powers or strength, just his intelligence and money and this side of him has been exploited to the hilt in this outing of his. In the previous 2 movies he was building Iron Man, but this one is more about the development of both Stark and his Iron Man Suit. As he rightly remarks, at the end of it ""I am just a Man in the Can"". Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts has transformed into a strong personality and like all husbands/ boyfriends, even the Iron Man listens to her and pays attention. The chemistry between them forms the underlying basis of the movie and for me the whole plot is interwoven around relationship of Tony Stark and Pepper Potts.Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Tony's bodyguard and now security manager of Stark Industries is awkwardly brilliant and funny, albeit in a small role. Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, the brilliant scientist using his intelligence for devious means, is menacing as well as good looking. The woman would love the shirtless scenes of the man and his suave style. With her assistant Maya Hansen played by Rebecca Hall the form a formidable team of villains. Ben Kingsley (our very own Mahatma Gandhi) is a great actor and shows it in his performance as the Mandarin, especially when his secret is revealed. Don Cheadle as Col. James Rhodes and the Iron Patriot (a blue and red Iron Man which was seriously cheesy) lends complete support in the fight against the band of villains.The surprise package in this one though is the young actor Ty Simpkins playing Harley, a young kid in a small town with a knack for technology bordering on the lines of a whiz kid. His chemistry and the scenes with Tony Stark are the best in the movie (more like a badly behaved dad and a mature son) and we see a promising actor in the making. Maybe Iron Man might have a prot√©g√© in the future.Shane Black's direction is surreal and the screenplay adds a lot of wit and humour to an action movie. The Airforce One crash scene and when Tony's mansion is attacked are one of the best action sequences I have witnessed using technology. You do come out humming the background music out of the cinema.Iron Man 3 is full of one liner's, puns, emotions and some wild twisted humour besides over the top action. Tony Stark has detached himself from the suit and at the same time emphatically stated that no one can take away the fact that ""He is Iron Man"". This movie is a must watch for all Tony Stark lovers and of course the Iron Man fans.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

They left me cold. Iron Man was not just my first encounter with Marvel but my first real enjoyment of any Superhero movie. I missed watching the first Avengers movie that predates Iron Man 3, admittedly, because I don't get the concept of teams. Yup, so Iron Man 3 was my first love. Having said that, this is not the real Iron Man. Iron Man has armour. That armour has a purpose. The real Iron Man would be A LOT nosier. He would like to know who he is working for, for a starter ? Who is the Pentagon ? Don't just listen to their marketing. You have an armour, Iron Man! Find out who they are! Sneak in! Like those ancient animals called 'Trilobites'! In all fossils, you can see them stretch their necks. They died stretching their necks because they were SO curious. That's who the real Iron Man would be, because that's the real reason why he has that armour. Had he done that, he would have found out that California was trying to cut social benefits, in spite of taxing the mick out of Californians for decades. And in spite of 1600s' Francis Drake offloading tons of Peruvian gold there. These days better known as CalPers (still loaded, more loaded than ever). And Cal's police just watch those benefits disappear. After all, they are on the public payroll. What could possibly go wrong in that system ? That would upset the real Iron Man, after he found out about that. Seriously, imprison all of California's oblivious cops. You can't always quite tell whether cops are dead inside. In general. That has to do with the Saxon spirit. Cops often have that originally British spirit. Sometimes that spirit plays dead, and comes back. The real Iron Man would have figured all that out. Because he has armour. Imprison all those people, seriously.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It may not be necessary too Christmas but still. It does take place during Christmas time and has a Christmasy atmosphere. It may not really have anything like giving presents or Santa (yes, Santa is a real character in Marvel comics. He is a mutant so he likely got rolled with the X-Men at Fox at the time that the MCU was being developed). There may be more superhero action and what not rather than what may be considered Christmas themed, but there's still some Christmas atmosphere in there. This may be a good superhero project to watch when Christmas gets closer and closer.I feel like this movie encapsulates the negative effects of being a superhero. Tony seems to have anxiety for what he did in the Avengers. The movie has him coping with it. I feel like that really seems to make him a little more relatable as a character. I feel like good action/vfx with some good humor here and there can make a movie good but it's that the characters being somewhat relatable and properly developed is what ties everything together.I feel like this could give a natural stopping point for Tony, but the Infinity Saga isn't over yet when this movie released, so obviously he'll return.There's definitely some plot points that could be discovered in later films (the Mandarin, Rhodey doing missions for the government) and the plot points that connects it to the pre-existing MCU (the Avengers PTSD).To wrap this up, I feel like this is good overall. It'll be better if there's slightly more Iron Man but still good. This may be my favorite Iron Man movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

England won the World Cup.Star Trek aired.I've grown up with Star Trek. The likes of Star Trek, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica and so many others helped me visit strange, new worlds and boldly go (or baldly in the case of Jean-Luc) where I had no chance of actually going in real life.Gene Roddenberry was a genius to my young mind, and a visionary to my older one. Creating a western in space, along the lines of Wagon Train - except with space ships and aliens rather than wagons, horses and Indians, of course.Okay, so Star Trek, the actual original pilot, starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike instead of William Shatner as Captain James Tiberius Kirk, aired in 1965, but Star Trek as we know it exploded on our television sets a year later, the year of my birth (I'm that talented writer I mentioned, if you hadn't guessed).As we were born in the same year, I didn't get to see the programme until I was older on one of its many re-runs. It didn't matter to me. At the time, I didn't know what a repeat was. I didn't get the chance, as a child, to watch it that regularly. The main programmes I was able to see each week were The Muppets and Doctor Who - both still favourites to this day. But I watched Star Trek whenever I could. It was brilliant. I wanted to be Spock. I wanted to see what was in the scanner thing he always looked into. I wanted POINTY EARS! And then there were the spin offs. The Next Generation. Voyager. Deep Space 9. Enterprise. All good (and occasionally bad) in their own way. I loved TNG. Ryker was a bit too much in places with his puffed out chest and stance and bravado. Wesley grated. But Jean Luc, Seven of Nine and most especially Data were brilliant. I enjoyed Voyager, though I have yet to watch the final episodes. Deep Space 9 was OK. Not bad, but it didn't grab me, and Enterprise, I wanted to like, and for the most part did, but it was let down by not enough drive from the producers.Either way, there was plenty to fill my Trekking time. Also, we had the films.Star Trek: The Motion Picture was amazing. I so loved that film. I was elated when they made an actual movie of the series. I enjoyed all the original movies, to be honest, with The Voyage Home being, probably, my favourite. But then, horror upon horrors, they made a PREQUEL! I don't know if I was ready. I think I figured they were going to be sort of cashing in on the name. It wouldn't be that good. I could hope, but I think I expected to not really like it.That shows what I know.I'd been a fan of Zachary Quinto from his Heroes days, and love him in American Horror Story (both seasons). I wondered how he'd fit into the role of my favourite Vulcan. Extremely well, as it happens. The first of the new Star Trek films was excellent, as far as I'm concerned. Exciting, well plotted and full of life. I wasn't sure of the hot-headed young Kirk at first, but I quickly warmed to him. As for the also young Sulu and Chekov, they're very well written and cast. Chekov is hilarious! So, it worked. A big thumbs up.Then, oh my gosh! They were bringing out a sequel with none other than Benedict Cumberbatch! I honestly couldn't wait. I am desperate for the return of Sherlock, which was my first introduction to Mr. Cumberbatch. His portrayal of the seminal detective grabbed me by the bits and didn't let go. The way the show was done all together was sooo good. If you haven't seen either of the two series, it's a definite must see. Moriarty was brilliant and Martin Freeman as Watson was a delight. I quite like Elementary, but Sherlock is something else! So, Benedict Cumberbatch as the bad guy? Bring it on! And what a bad guy? Khan, no less! Star Trek: Into Darkness is great. Really, a fab film. It brings the Star Trek franchise quite firmly up to date. Plenty of meat and a bit of gristle thrown in for good measure. There's excitement, pathos, humour (you've got to love the ever fine Simon Pegg as Scotty) and lot's more.I saw the 2D version of the film, but I'm told the 3D effects were excellent. If you're going to make a movie in 3D, give us something to make us glad we sat there with silly glasses on. I was so disappointed with Wrath of the Titans (for many reasons but...) when, at the climactic explosion at the end, it cut to the base camp. Where were the bits of god thrown in our faces, hmmm? I didn't see, so I don't know, but it appears the 3D was used to good effect. That's what we want. Make us duck out of the way. Make us want to reach out. Don't just give it a bit of depth, as wearing those glasses detracts from the colour and essence of the film - we need something to compensate.Star Trek: Into Darkness is a definite hit. If you're not a Star Trek fan, don't let that put you off. There's a great deal more to this film than the name.Oh, one thing. I so wanted Kirk - or better yet, Spock - to, when wondering where they'd go for the start of their 5 year journey, say: ""First star on the right, and straight on till morning.""Live longer and prosper, people.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Mandarin is a bit of a weak villain, but there's plenty of plot twists to keep the audience engaged.

(It turns out Tony has a heart of gold, or rather, palladium.) ""Iron Man 3"" completes the story by seeing Stark fully redeemed, while at the same time delving further into the nature and consequences of man's inhumanity to man. Oh, and it's also a rocking ton of popcorn-munching fun.Robert Downey Jr.'s main character began as a man who made weapons of mass destruction for profit while ignoring the human costs. Now, three films later, with his rocket-powered Iron Man suits honed to perfection, he's a weapon of mass destruction himself ‚Äì one who experiences the human toll of combat first-hand. The film begins sometime after the events of last year's ""The Avengers,"" which saw Stark teaming up with several other super heroes to fight alien invaders. It turns out the experience has left Tony with a bout of post-traumatic stress disorder.In this troubled state, he finds himself compelled to take on a sadistic terrorist threat known as The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. But The Mandarin is not all that he seems. There's a twist involving the villain that is as audacious as it is entertaining ‚Äì one that forces us to question what we think we know about terrorist bogeymen. At the same time, people from Tony's past (namely a scientist with dubious motives played by Guy Pearce) emerge to cause him personal trouble ‚Äì just as his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) hits a rocky patch. Inevitably, all these internal and external battles converge to create Stark's biggest challenge to date.The ""Iron Man"" movies work because we like and care about Tony Stark -- because a great actor brings him to life. The best scenes in the Iron Man films have always involved Downey out of the suit -- watching a CGI robotic suit fly around can only be entertaining for so long. His witty one-liners and his improvised banter with Paltrow have made for some of the trilogy's best scenes. The filmmakers seem to have picked up on this fact ‚Äì since the latest installment finds Tony forced to make due without the suit more than ever before. This movie resembles more of a James Bond flick ‚Äì with a dash of buddy cop camaraderie thrown in for good measure (thanks to Tony's sidekick, Don Cheadle, as Iron Patriot a.k.a War Machine). New director Shane Black keeps the improvisational feel of the first two movies and doesn't allow the Academy honored cast members to get lost among all the explosions and effects. Most viewers won't notice much of a difference in tone. Maybe that's because the former director, Jon Favreau, was still on set, reprising his role as Tony's loyal employee, Happy Hogan. The most notable and unfortunate omission: AC/DC blaring on the soundtrack.Beneath the top-notch action set pieces and comic dialog, the movie does explore some serious themes. Tony's aforementioned PTSD isn't the only side effect of war that the movie delves into. The epidemic of suicides among war veterans is strongly hinted at in a subplot that sees returning soldiers literally turned into ticking time bombs. Another subplot also seems to examine the slippery slope of drone technology. This time around, Tony uses several remote controlled versions of his suit to defeat his enemies. This is not a movie that challenges us to stop and ponder complex issues, but if you do take the time to do so, the symbolism of unmanned killer flying robots shows what could happen if our advanced modern weaponry fell into the wrong hands. There are also references to the Deep Water Horizon disaster and the downside of our consumption of fossil fuels. However, these thought-provoking topics are merely hidden nutrients that sit below the surface of what is explicitly fun, feel-good summer entertainment.In the last act, Tony's transformation from war profiteer to war/super hero is brought to its logical conclusion. The ending certainly closes the loop and leaves us wondering if we'll ever see Downey's Iron Man in another stand-alone movie. If we don't, he'll be sorely missed ‚Äì but we can say he went out on top.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

This installment deviates from the traditional superhero formula, delivering a narrative that delves into the man behind the Iron Man suit.Robert Downey Jr. Continues to shine as Tony Stark, showcasing a more introspective and vulnerable side of the character. The film takes Stark out of his comfort zone, stripping away the technology and forcing him to rely on his ingenuity and intellect. Downey Jr.'s performance captures the essence of a hero grappling with post-traumatic stress and the consequences of his actions.The Mandarin, portrayed by Ben Kingsley, provides a compelling and unexpected twist to the typical superhero villain. The film cleverly subverts expectations, offering a layered and nuanced portrayal that challenges the conventions of the genre. Kingsley's performance adds depth to a character that initially appears as a one-dimensional antagonist.The narrative's focus on Tony Stark's personal journey adds emotional weight to the film. The exploration of anxiety and self-discovery humanizes the superhero, making him more relatable to audiences. The themes of identity and resilience resonate, creating a storyline that transcends typical superhero tropes.This one doesn't shy away from humor, and the banter between characters, especially Stark and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), provides moments of levity amidst the intense action sequences. The film successfully blends humor with the more serious aspects of its narrative.The action sequences are visually impressive, and the use of technology, particularly the Iron Man suits, remains a highlight. The airborne rescue scene showcases Stark's resourcefulness and ingenuity, reinforcing the notion that the hero is more than just the suit he wears.Overall awesome fun and super enjoyable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't think I'm the only who saw Iron Man as the one who stole the show in The Avengers. Sure Hulk had his moments, but Iron Man really just took everyone by surprise. And that's really the main reason I was looking so much forward to Iron Man 3. I like the two first movies, but I think they're a little bit overrated (at least the first one).In this movie, the United States is threatened by a viral terrorist called the Mandarin. So Iron Man and War Machine (who has now been renamed Iron Patriot) go on a quest to find out who this Mandarin guy really is. That's all I'm gonna say.I actually enjoyed the story in this movie a lot more than I did with the other films. The Mandarin, who at first just seems like a clone of Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, actually develops into a very different kind of villain. It's actually pretty original. I also found myself more engrossed in Tony Stark's character.I wish the story would focus more on the teamwork between Iron Man and Iron Patriot. If there's one thing that make superhero movies great but aren't fully realized in movies, it's teamwork. Movies like Spider-Man 3 and The Avengers utilize teamwork greatly, but those are just two movies. Iron Man and Iron Patriot are mostly separated throughout the movie, communicating wirelessly.The action scenes are terrific. Especially the last one, which is a lot of fun to watch and very well thought out.The main reason this movie is disappointing, though, is because as a follow-up to The Avengers, it fails miserably. Of course, it's not really meant to be, but we all know it's part of the Avengers saga, and that makes it kind of underwhelming in comparison. I don't think any movie will able to top The Avengers until the true sequel comes out in 2015.Overall Iron Man 3 is a bit disappointing, but in the end I didn't really expect it to be as good as The Avengers. It's not the best Iron Man movie, but it is the best superhero movie released since The Amazing Spider-Man (which is not really saying much when you think about it).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Needless to say, I am profoundly and utterly in shock at how average the movie is. It's not that it's all bad per se, but the screenwriters thought that by putting lots of comedy in an action movie juxtaposed with the seriousness and verisimilitude of a Tom Clancy novel that this would work. It didn't. The little side-kick kid was absolutely terrible; although I don't know if it was a cheap gimmick to get more parents with their kids to see it, or cater to that specific demographic, I'm not sure. But they need to stop. I wouldn't have minded if said side-kick was a teenager or someone in their early 20's, THAT would've made a whole lot of sense. All I could say is what was Shane Black thinking?!?!?! This film would've been a lot better if they skimmed the comedy bits and focused more on the story and characters; especially the villains. Although the special effects and action are really impressive, they cannot make up for the uneven and disorienting screenplay.I don't know what to think. Should you skip this movie? Tough choice, but all if you want is something to pass the time, then go for it.(I recommend the matin√©e) If you're the kind of person that wants story and character development above all else, then you will be disappointed. It's a shame really because Iron Man is a really cool superhero and the first film was a blast to watch. It's MILES ahead better than this one. You're probably better off watching the first film, or wait for Star Trek: Into Darkness or the eagerly anticipated Man of Steel. Iron Man has depth and integrity along with a high dash of wit and charm. Yes the charm is there, but there's no juicy meat.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Osam Movie.. There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is literally the same as the incredibles. And that's hilarious to me. It's still pretty good though. I absolutely love how we get to see way more of Tony Stark in this. Having Tony just be human and not using the suit for most of the movie, shows why he is such a great character.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 9/10
This movie is actually really enjoyable to watch. You get less cool Iron Man scenes, but that is just replaced by some very entertaining Tony Stark scenes.The is some perfect Tony Stark humor in this movie that keeps you well engaged throughout.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10
This movie has so much emotion it it. It is all very very personal to Tony Stark. Everything hits him personally as a human and not so much as Iron Man too. It's cool because we can see how he acts as a hero not in the suit.You get pretty invested in the story because you feel for Stark. As he is going through hard times, you feel for him, and want to see him solve his problems.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
The theme of this one is all about how Tony Stark is still human, and how he deals with has problems like everyone else.I love how Tony goes through PTSD in this movie. Because he really is just a normal guy. It gives his character way more depth, and knocks him off his pedestal in a great way.5. Characters - 7/10
The villain choice is unique. I love how it is just a terrorist at first. And then the way they change it to becoming a much more personal bad guy to Tony is cool.I like how we see Tony and Pepper Potts in a relationship together, and what that is like for them.I actually really like the character of Harvey. Because of him, we get to see Tony reacting to more ""normal"" people. It's cool to see how he talks with him, and tries to help him.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
All of the actors are great in this. I have no complaints at all. Ty Simpkins did very well for how young he was too.The writing is also very good. I love the classic Tony Stark humor, and how quippy and sarcastic he is.7. Cinematography - 5/10
Nothing special or worth talking about. The fast paced Iron Man scenes are always cool to see.8. Score - 6/10
Good but not the best. Iron Man music is good, but this was just about average for Iron Man music. Pretty exciting in the moment, but nothing crazy.9. Editing / Pace - 9/10
The editing and pace for this movie is great. I love how they edit all of the terrorists stuff in. It's very cool to watch.The only thing I wish was different was to focus more on his PTSD. It is a major focus already, but I love that plot point, so wish it was focused on more.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
All the effects in this are great. The CGI is phenomenal. I love the effects that the bad guys have as their powers. It's very cool to see. At no point in this movie did something look not good, unfinished, or cheesy.Average Score:
8.4/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
8/10
I really love how we get to see Iron Man without his suit. It shows how and why he is a superhero. And not just some rich guy stopping bad guys. He is Iron Man. He is an Avenger.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3). Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance. By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects. At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications. Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related? The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy. A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role. Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin. Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy. He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience. It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot. At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing. There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists. The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly. What's a superhero to do? The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs. Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections. Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1. There's a certain finality in the way it ends which makes one wonder how will they do another Iron Man film. This is Downey's last contractual Iron Man for now and it would be a shame to deny fans another go at a fascinating character especially with The Avengers 2 in the not too distant horizon. And yes, do stay through the lengthy credits for a brief but amusing scene and cameo.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A sequel to both Iron Man 2 and The Avengers simultaneously, the movie deals with Tony Stark, developing a crippling case of an anxiety disorder who obsesses over creating more and more Iron Man suits to be prepared for any possible attack. After dealing with Gods, aliens, and living legends, Tony has realized that he and his loved ones are more vulnerable to attack than he originally thought. This couldn't come at a worse time as a new terrorist bogeyman, The Mandarin, has begun a campaign of fear with an almost mythical sense of anonymity. After one particular attack that hits close to home, Stark publicly challenges The Mandarin, leading to a retaliation where Stark is on the run relying on his wits, rather than his armor, to save the day.What gets me boiled is that people get the wrong impression about this film. There is one particular revelation which is a big ""gotcha"" moment that was absolutely brilliant. The film's thematic content lies in the idea of identity, status, and keeping up an image - something that Tony Stark and nearly every character in the film deals with, including the humble Happy Hogan who finally gets more of an opportunity to shine than in the previous iterations of the franchise. The narrative gives way to a political-espionage/detective story of Tony piecing together the mystery of The Mandarin, the source of his attacks, and how he fits in the puzzle. A great mystery yarn is peppered with terrific action scenes (including an air-rescue scene and a big-finale fight that will go down as some of the best in the superhero genre) alongside a fairly damning portrayal of the current military industrial complex and the rather absurd concept of the American government's idea of ""keeping the peace."" Robert Downey Jr. is awesome as Tony Stark, but that almost doesn't require mentioning. Gweneyth Paltrow is really able to come out into her own in this film as Pepper, who was usually treated as the stability anchor for Tony, gets to be the voice of reason and gets plenty bad-ass moments of her own. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is an absolute treat; a charismatic industrial leader who's spurn by Tony gives him unforeseen motivations. Rebecca Hall plays Maya Hansen, and while she's fine in the role, there isn't terribly too much for her to do outside of provide some key plot elements and give some pretty good banter coming back as one of Tony's old flames.Ben Kingsley plays The Mandarin, and he turns it up to 11. I won't reveal too much of his character, as discovering who he is remains one of the highlights of the movie, but let me just say that Kingsley's Mandarin had me thinking about his performances weeks after the movie was over. Although some fans might not like his interpretation of The Mandarin (but given that the original source material essentially had him as the ""fu-manchu"" Asian stereotype that is as offensive to the Chinese as ""Uncle Tom"" is to black-Americans), it's a terrific turn in terms of storytelling that not only connects deeply with the themes portrayed in the film, but offers a terrific surprise that I guarantee you no one will be able to guess. To paraphrase The Mandarin, ""you'll never see him coming."" Give this film a chance, embrace the story, and I PROMISE you, you'll walk away from Iron Man 3 with a burning desire to turn right around and see it again!...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is something about MCU's Iron Man that I really like. The only Marvel comic I have read which has Iron Man in it is Avengers vs Thanos, and I really didn't like him in it. So to be specific, I really like everything about Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. When I had watched the Iron Man movies for the first time, I used to always talk and behave like Tony Stark. That's how much he influenced me. And now that this was the fourth movie (including The Avengers), of course I was gonna like it.As usual Robert Downey Jr was the star of the movie. Whenever he's in any scene, his charm always makes it interesting to watch. The movie begins with Tony having PTSD from the climax scene of The Avengers. And now he also has to battle The Mandarin. I had heard that people did not like what the movie did to him, but it was only after watching some videos I learnt why people were unhappy. Like I mentioned, I have only read one Iron Man comic, and that too I began just a few weeks ago. I watched this movie a few YEARS ago. So obviously, like Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern, I really enjoyed it until I learnt I wasn't supposed to.Other than that I like everything about this movie. Once again the CGI, the acting, the music is all great. This movie also has much, much better action scenes than most other MCU movies, considering Iron Man movies always have those. I get excited seeing one new Iron suit, here there are dozens. Consider me sold. The only one problem I had was how weak Iron Man had become, that his Iron suits are getting beaten up by normal humans with weapons.You know those movies that stay in your memories but you don't talk about them until they are brought up? For me this is one of those movies. I watched it after he release of Infinity War, since that was the time I started watching all MCU movies to catch up before Endgame. This movie clearly stood out in my bingewatch. This is the reason why I'm all praises for it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

+ Tony's arseholeness is his undoing - which is a long time coming.
+ Meeting Yinsen from Iron Man 1 at the gala just the way he said he did is a brilliant little flourish.
+ PTSD, the wormhole kid, the panic attack notions building the right way on demon in a bottle storyline from the comic - brilliant followup on first from Avengers. Makes sense that these movies affect the minds of characters.
+ The Mandarin is a smart look at Terrorism iconography and media in our century. Appropriation being a perfect ironic retooling from the comic's racist image of the Mandarin. It's possible that those that didn't like it, didn't get it.
+ The twice bait and switch from Mandarin to think tank to actor is clever.
+ Trevor Slattery/Kingsley - pure Monty Python levels of comedy - delicious.
+ Image of an unmanned suit towering over someone in their sleep and fuelled by nightmares grapples Pepper is a fantastic comic book looking spooky moment.
+ He calls the bad guy out and he attacks him. I mean, that's brilliant.
+ Stark calling suit to save pepper.
+ Nice little creative uses of Iron Man suit don't feel gratuitous, the hand pulling Stark up out of the water for example.
+ The Kid is a good actor, all that stuff is a nice middle act diversion, simple Spielberg without the schmaltz.
+ Pepper in the suit watching Tony's message is sweet.
+ James Badge Dale.
+ Tony going in all home-alone to infiltrate the mansion, then busting out with a gun and a hand is like a retooling of an old spy flick.
+ I want to say burning things and breathing fire is silly, and it is - but it's also pretty cool.
+ Music is nice, a little Enemy of State spy movie-ish.
+ ""...Toast of Croydon"" heh.
+ The goon that gets let go by Tony. hah.
+ Air Force One action scene is clever, can't beat physics, he's only a man in a suit, he has to be creative.
+ ""What did you see?"" ""Too fast. Nothing"" Lovely Shane Blackism.
+ All those toys. I mean suits! Suits! Great action sequence, sort of a 90's action sequence with a modern twist.
+ Love Liquid Snake-looking Guy Peace as a badass going full tilt villain.
+ Tony's one-on-one with Guy Pearce plus the way he finishes him off is a properly conceived watchable piece of action.
+ The real reason for Tony's voice over, not just a Shane Blackism!
+ Clean slate protocol making fireworks at Xmas. I mean I want to think it's silly but it just plain cinematic!Post-Credits sequence review: 5/5: Funny, surprising, personable, throws new light on to a trope/device/Shane Blackism. Crowd-pleasing and yet gives nothing away. One of my favourites.Stan Lee cameo where he plays: An Old Man that rates a model 10: 3/5: Yeah, he fits the bill. Trimmed and passed in to the background, that's smart.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After mysterious attacks by a terrorist only known as The Mandarin, Tony Stark must come to face a new enemy unlike anything he's fought before while also discovering a connection to his past, and what it truly means to be a hero even without his suit of armor. For starters, the film is heavily missed by Jon Favreau's unique directing style like the first two Iron Man films had, but Shane Black was able to pull of in my opinion my favorite film in the Iron Man trilogy. It's has action, comedy, heart and is emotional at times that pull at your heart strings that help make the film be the most sentimental and truest of all the Iron Man films. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after the events of The Avengers (2012) that has a bit of anxiety and paranoia while trying to be one step ahead for the next big threat that's thrown at him or the world. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts once again and this is probably my favorite performance of her playing Pepper Potts out of all three Iron Man films. Don Cheadle returns as Rhodey and I thought he was great as always. Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian I thought did a good job as well, but the problem I had with his character was how obvious they made it that he was the true mastermind of the whole plot of the film. I also liked Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery/The Mandarin. The only real problem I have with his character was that I felt after knowing his character's true purpose, I thought it was kind of a let down, because of how much I looked forward to him being the villain, but after what it would later set up in the MCU, I'm not really mad about it anymore. Out of all the superhero trilogy's in the MCU, Iron Man 3 was the film that I felt not ended Iron Man's story obviously, but ended the Iron Man saga and it did it in fashion with all of the characters, it's incredible story, and Iron Man suits unlike anything we've imagined.

Why? Thats the question I ask. I am not a superhero movie fan. And that is why I love iron man three. It isn't a mind numbing mash of explosions and pointless action like most superhero movie tend to become. The movie focus on tony stark battling his own demons and struggling to do so rather than iron man just showing off and shooting things. (Iron man 2 coming to mind) Robert downing JR shows the world just how good he really is as an actor and dominates the screen with subtlety and diversity ANY actor would be proud of. Guy Peirce is as brilliant as ever, and the plot is gripping and tight.OK so it drifted from the comic books somewhat. But let's be honest, who really cares? How many of us know a great deal of info about the comic books? The Nolan batman trilogy did the same and became the best comic book movies of all time!

I felt the need to express my anger.I understand how most people say it is good because the movie is a decent action movie if you completely ignore anything about Iron Man, watched and understood previous movies, if you have never read any comics, watched any cartoons or simply went onto the Marvell Wiki and get some background information. Actors great work as usual, they did their best with the garbage the writer and director gave them. I imagine if the story was kept just to the extremis series then it would have been better.How could Disney and Marvel allow this rubbish on screen to destroy the franchise?Sadly I was so looking forward to this movie and I watched Iron Man 1 2 and The Avengers before. To my surprise nothing from the previous movies linked into this one, the director and writer destroyed any history behind the technology and characters. These are the people that didn't have the decency to watch the previous movies, read any comics, watch any cartoons or the easiest thing to at least go on wiki and read up before coming up with some half assed movie. I won't even mention what they did to the fans, comic buffs or anyone that grew up knowing the Marvel heroes. If I could sum it up it would be like someone taking the Holy Bible or another holy book and making a parody out of it, blasphemy. They ruined the Iron Man, the man behind it and the most notorious villain. I wanted to see the Mandarin in all his special effects glory.I don't want to give spoilers but the quality of the suits? I guess it is the new i-man suits low on charge, running out of juice when you need it most and full of bugs. The ending? Seriously (it had the most screwed up issues contradicting previous movies and marvel history)? On the plus I hope Pepper joins The Avengers next:))))))))))They did to Iron Man what was done to Mass Effect 3 (pooping on the fans), so I will chose to ignore this movie stop at Iron Man 2 and not add it to my collection hoping that a remake will come along to salvage it or that Avengers 2 will make up for this pile of garbage.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Shane Black's Dark Humor and Verbal Wit isn't Enough to Save This Formulaic Ruination of the Original Comic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2791777/?ref_=tt_urv","generationfilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22971631/?ref_=tt_urv","3 May 2013","Marvel's ridiculous dogmatic hold on their chosen formulaic plot structure for their films hasn't yielded the best products when it comes to their character specific adventures, especially in upholding untouchable comic book material and characters. After the atrocity that was Iron Man 2, where Jon Favreau tinkered with not only one but two villain interpretations Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo, it was clear that the reins of control might have to change hands in order to preserve the shreds of positive creativity that were rather limited. The decision to hire director/screenwriter Shane Black wasn't an odd one because his incredible sharp wit would definitely compliment the narcissistic persona of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark and has been evident before through penning the Lethal Weapon franchise and in his directorial debut Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. But not even the darkly humoristic additions or the frenetic action sequences could salvage the complete bastardization of the comic in relation to the utter ruination of Iron Man's devout nemesis, the Mandarin. Basically Iron Man 3 squanders needed guidance from its comic book source by completely ignoring its merits creating a storyline that is practically insulting to dedicated readers and longtime fans. What becomes crystal clear throughout the latest Iron Man installment is that Disney, with their unfettered franchise building of Marvel material, really doesn't care about original fans and seem to be quite antagonistic towards their love of the origins and characters in the comics themselves. There's no doubt that many desensitized moviegoers will find a great deal of enjoyment through Downey's witty banter and Shane Black's kinetic yet hollow action sequences, but the limitations posed by the Marvel formula is a creative barrier that needs to be eliminated. It never mattered who was piloting this cinematic suit, whether it was Jon Favreau or newcomer Shane Black, because the real villain behind the curtain is Disney and Marvel itself since their focus on potential merchandise in gadgetry has diminished the creative soul and drive of their pictures. Franchises might make money but sometimes, or most times when it comes to Marvel films, they make fools of us all when they claim ignorance to the original comics and create travesties of epic proportions much like Iron Man 3.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-y1 More reviews: Generationfilm.net","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

IMO, no point in good art and poor plot, but the opposite works most of the time. That being said (and Iron Man being one of my fav), I feel comfortable to point a few things about this movie.I honestly was expecting a lot more. And this is not a conclusion, I felt this as I was seeing the movie. Teasers and trailers looked amazing, everything kids (even big ones like me) wanted. By the expectation, I was hoping to see a cool movie with lots of FX... all the FX are there, but this wasn't enough, the plot is too weak, poorly developed and rushed. There are explosions and armors everywhere, but not really a point for them to be there. The movie was shot in a way that looks confined, no big sets and nice landscapes too. In the end of the movie I had that feeling that nothing (that matters) really happened.I'm also disappointed with the way some good Iron Man story arcs are smashed together in a plot full of things happening but for no real purpose. I recognized some armors from the comics... in the comics, the armors have a ""why"", they have a reason to exist and designed for a practical application, but the movie completely ignores that.One other thing I like in Iron Man is the impossible technology based on ""possible"" technology (last 2 movies had some of this). This movie lacks this compromise with technology... the armor does things that had me thinking ""hey, how it did that? And why it had to be done that way?"", among tech things that wasn't supposed to work the way they did in the movie.The main armor Tony uses is ugly. Can't tell much more about this or I'll spoiler this review, but it's ugly, what was Tony Stark thinking when he built that thing?Worth seeing it? Only if you're not that familiar with Iron Man and/or want to see the cast (Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as usual, Sir Ben Kingsley is just amazing). And, as strange as it sounds, if you don't care too much about the whys and hows in technology.I'm rating this as a 6 because the actors are good. By the story alone it would be a 3. At most.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

So full marks to the cinematography. 2.The Entertainment :The movies got a lot of it.It has nice funny moments and actors too did a good job .And this is exactly what we expect from a large commercial superhero movie. Don't we?3.Robert downey Jr. :Needless to say the kind of actor he is.Sometimes he does such great job that he singlehandedly pulls the quality of the movies he's part of.He has done exactly the same here. So all you RDJ fans out there ,you guys are most likely to enjoy this movie a lot.Now lets talk about the negative points of the movie:1.First and perhaps expected one - lack of depth.In fact the movies got no depth at all.Just a lit bit of Drama into it which appears quite hollow and not something that will impress you. No drastic improvisations by Shane black which was a huge disappointment to me.2.Poor story: The overall story is full of flaws, errors and ambiguities. A superhero movie story is always surrounded around 2 roles- the superhero and the villain. In this movie the superhero part is just fine but villain part is being built very badly and the story appears confusing and full of crap since the beginning.Ben knigsley did a needless job and the whole mandrine thing was crappy.Bottomline : The movies is overall entertaining which is quite evident from the huge collections but has nothing that can touch your heart.At first it appears better than IronMan 2 and the Avengers but IronMan was certainly far better than this.RDJ fans are most likely to enjoy this movie.Lastly , i would like to express my huge surprise by the metascore this movie has scored .It shouldn't have been more than 55 hardly 60. That just goes to show that Critics words can not be taken for granted ......Always.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The so-called love story between him and Pepper Potts, tolerably played by Gwyneth Paltrow, leaves you cold as it is with the super villain who is just a huge blatherer.All in all, you have to be very patient with the movie until it gains momentum during the last 30 minutes or so where you can be assured that you don't have to try finding any sense and significance in all this any more, because there never was any, but simply lean back and enjoy the action pleasantly aware that it's going to be over soon...Phase two of the Marvel franchise had a weak beginning, very weak.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Not to forget the suit melts very quickly like butter.6 For iron man to continue wear this suits and play iron man in this movie because of quick trashing of his suits into pieces they have shown excessive and endless supply of iron man suits (STUPID DD!!!!!)7 Final joke on iron man and the fans that went to see it is that iron man suits are used replacing fireworks to explode in the air as fireworks it looks pretty lame and pathetic.THIS MOVIE IS SO DAMAGED by its director that he needs to be kicked out of every production he may be on, he took a good movie a good plot and ruined it for fans this guy does not even have common sense that how can u charge iron mans suit like a laptop. or trash it so many times in this movie. this guy destroyed iron man for us AND MADE A NASTY JOKE OUT OF IRON MAN AND HIS SUIT. do not spend Ur movie in theater to watch this crap wait for it come on the cable or DVD.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

When you have a story that is pure fantasy/fiction and tying to make it look more like a conventional film then you have a problem, because no matter how work is put into maturing the persona of a metal covered super hero, he still is a sci-fi character, plus it will not get you any more fans.As a result, there was an overload of mumbo-jumbo, which could have been reduced, and lesser of the impressive action sequences we have come to like about movies like this.It thus ended up looking more tacky than a brilliant sci-fi/action movie.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

I think many Tony Stark / Iron Man series fans went to the movie (as did I) with a strong predilection to like the movie (as did I). I was ready and excited for a great flick.Sadly at around 38 minutes into the movie, I found myself checking my watch again to see if I shouldn't have seen enough that it would start making sense. I would find myself checking my watch many times after that, wondering when this movie was going to be over. I am sad to report that this episode is tragically long.I've loved this Iron Man series (some better than others). But now, this current Iron Man 3 element seems to be part of the series only in that you recognize some of the gear, mostly suits that work poorly or not at all and of course we all recognize Pepper and Tony Stark. And if you've seen none of the previous movies in the series, I suspect you will be completely lost. What is with all these unexplained round light sources in the chest and hands of Stark and the gear? Admittedly it would be very difficult to explain all of that without showing all the previous releases but just a heads up to those getting into the series late; save your money. I am still sitting here bewildered by how this movie got released. I am still sad I find myself writing a negative review for anything ""Iron Man"" related.

And Marvel went all out in their efforts to make this one really, really, bad.As the legendary Dr. (Seuss) himself put it so succinctly: Stink, stank, stunk.If you were never a fan of the Iron Man comic books (especially the early ones; I owned the first editions of almost every single Marvel comic in 1968, when I was 14) --and you are okay with people breathing fire and running around with a body temperature of 1000 degrees in what is supposed to be a superhero movie series dominated by ""realistic"" technology-- then you may not have the same set of issues I did with the film.I had some concerns from reading the various discussions of the plot -- starting as far back as a year or so ago-- regarding the rumor that the film was built around the ""Extremis"" story line from the more recent Iron Man comics, which I personally felt was unsuitable material as the base for an Iron Man movie that would fit well with the first two.But more recently my fears had subsided because a very different take on the movie's plot was being offered by many people who were supposed to be in the know about the film (a take that turned out to be totally false, but alleged that the film would be a more down-to-earth spies, assassins, and technology type affair). It turns out my fears were warranted, and from my perspective the plot was a total disaster.I knew the moment that the ""illusion"" (as I will politely refer to it for now to avoid spoiling the ""fun"" for those that haven't seen the film) regarding the primary villain was revealed one thing was was bound to happen: The Iron Man comics fans would savage this movie because of the way The Mandarin was depicted. For long-time fans of the Iron Man comics the manner in which The Mandarin was handled and portrayed would almost certainly be perceived as heresy, or sacrilege. And, based on the reviews preceding this one, my intuition was spot-on accurate.I have no doubt that I myself emitted an audible gasp when that moment arrived, and I was also overwhelmed with nausea, because it basically -- in an instant-- consigned Iron Man 3 to the scrap heap of superhero movies.And then, it got worse...In general things just happened in the film, with little or no explanation provided for the events, processes, or results. And the movie's conclusion consisted of about a minute and a half of a poorly executed scramble intended to wrap-up all of the loose ends left behind during the course of the film. In not much more than a small fraction of the movie's running time a half-dozen or so intractable issues were magically resolved and numerous life-altering decisions were made --even though none really had to be.In the end, the movie fell flat because the writers, directors, and producers tried to do way to much with it and in the process completely lost control of the story line. They, as a group, simply allowed the film to suffer from what we in the product engineering field call ""feature creep"": the tendency for project managers to try to cram in a bunch of enhancements and features at the last minute, which detracts from the reliability of the more important 95% of the product that is already complete and just needs to be polished up and tested properly.It was also apparent that the producers of this disaster had way to much film ""in the can"" and way too little time to fit enough of it in, leaving a seriously jumbled mess as the result.My advice, in a nutshell? Go see it and make up your own mind. But be forewarned.Me, I'll be trying to wash the bad taste of this unsavory film out of my mouth for quite a while.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Could've, would've, should've¬Ö.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2806034/?ref_=tt_urv","Dory_Darko","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14277539/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2013","There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.Everything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is ‚Äì let's be honest ‚Äì precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all ‚Äì the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and ‚Äì big shock ‚Äì it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.Well, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.The more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.This was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.This is definitely a filmmakers' case of ""could've, would've, should've"". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.No story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I watched today in IMAX, totally disappointed. I expected some action sequence with Iron man suite and a exploration of the new suite invented.But it was like 95% of the movie, it was just Tony Stark, not Iron man at all was featured and even in the action sequence, Iron man had a very less priority given, and the suite was given least priority. I would say its the worst when compared to the other 2 part of the movie.One more thing noticed was , the other two movies, we felt everything as natural and along with it Tony add his technological skill to build a suite. But in this one the movie has lost it's natural look, as some Un-natural things like human with fire inside, regenerating humans from fire etc, all kinda unwanted things they have introduced.Finally I was wondering how it got a IMDb rating of 8, a rating of 5 should be more than enough.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Is Tony Stark trying to save the world, discover who he is, avenge his friend, save his girlfriend or unravel a sinister plot? None of these themes was developed at all and nothing really holds this movie together or drives the main character forward. Another huge problem is that there's no real antagonist until the last 15 minutes of the movie. Sure, we see clips of some maniac blowing things up but there's no conflict between the good guy and the bad guy until the last few minutes of the film. This film left me feeling empty and disappointed. I'll just have to wait for Joss Whedon and Avengers 2 to get Iron Man right again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie is absolutely, not an exception. Filled with a poorly constructed plot and jokes which took too much effort to make work, the clear focus of this film is the clich√© of childish action flick: some good action and lots of explosions. Overall, quite disappointing as the first two iron man movies were quite enjoyable in my book. I don't know if Disney's involvement or Shane Black's directing is to blame and I don't care. I will say this, if marvel ever decides to make another movie with Iron Man in it, I beg of you, look towards pre-avengers movies for guidelines on how to make a movie that appeals to a mature person.Also, I cannot stress enough the annoyance I find in the absurd length of the film and the constant desperation of the screenwriters to slip in another joke. Contrary to Marvels opinion, a movie can be good AND be under 3 hours long. Also, the constant barrage of ill-though out jokes make for poor entertainment.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

There is nothing in the movie which is new or innovative. Just the same lame run of the mill action herky jerky as the second installment (which, unbelievably, is worse yet!).Trailer looked promising, execution on movie obviously sub-par. The emotions and more gritty feel of the trailer was extremely misleading, as the actual movie is somewhat more akin to comedy than drama.Marvel franchise is getting drive to the ground with this bullshit. What ever happened to the Tony Stark of Iron Man 1, where the character evolvement actually makes sense? In this latest installment, the very-hard-to-believe anxiety attacks and the mushy interaction between the 'Mechanic' and the all-too-cute little town boy is completely over the top. Whoever came up with this story arc should seriously rethink his career... Only bright spot is Robert Downey JRs usual great dialogue and Ben Kingsleys erratic Mandarin character.Would not recommend this to anyone with an IQ above normal house temperature Celsius.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

And it's easy to see why. In the grand scheme of things, this film does not add much to the universe. But that is precisely why this movie is so enjoyable. Not every single movie in the MCU has to be part of a bigger story. Some films should stand on their own, and this film does that exceptionally well.Of course, this film does have its problems. This film came out during the time that Marvel had a major villain problem, and Adriach Killian is not a particularly fascinating character. Then there is the Mandarin, whom I think the movie handled rather cleverly. There are plot holes, which do make the experience less enjoyable.The action scenes especially are really different and intense. Instead of most of the action being about two big robots shooting each other, it instead focuses on Tony Stark trying to get himself out of sticky situations without only his ingenuity. The action in this film is relatively sprinkled out, with just enough of it until the final battle, which is both visually impressive and exciting.RDJ's performance as usual is pretty great, as is the humor. The script constantly pokes holes at some of the cliches that modern action films usually have, which are pretty funny. The film starts to really get good at the end of the first act, when Tony is forced to go on the run, but it's pretty consistent from there on.If you're looking for a film that's deeply inter-connected in the MCU and is necessary for the overall universe, then this film is probably not for you. But if you simply want a stand-alone movie that focuses more on Tony Stark and his troubles that is pretty simple and small scale, then this is the film for you.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Making The real Mandarin the villain in next IM movie! It should be a sequel(with or without RDJ) So this is the story..Although IM 3 is so lame, I found a silver lining in it.Now i think this movie has laid down a good foundation for a possible Mandarin outing in near future,despite all its plot holes.Do you ever guessed how Aldrich got all his money to do such research? Do you ever thought why he is having dragon tattoos on his chest? or why is he having such dragon statues and symbols when Trevor's TV Announcements were filming?? Or if he was actually the head of Ten Rings Organization ,what was the reason for him to name his organization as Ten Rings????That name never fits with his personality by any means,its so weird!!.....Did Tony ever think about that weird strange connection in this movie????Black must have included such a scene where Tony puzzled and thinking about all this.And he has lot of clues to think on this matter.Now we come to the real Mandarin.So this real Mandarin as usual in comics a wealthy Chinese who's been raised by his aunt,a regional ruler in a Chinese province(a post which has been inherited by his father),a very fine martial artist and later discovers an alien ship(Makluans) crashed on Earth 1000s of years ago and finds the 10 alien rings(each with a specific power)whom now seeks to make china his empire and rule the whole world(and to watch the west burns)from his global terrorist organization. Aldrich is actually been hired by real Mandarin,the invisible head of Ten Rings Org. He ordered Killian to hire Trevor to symbolize himself and as the false head of Ten rings.Every word Trevor said were all thoughts of Mandarin(simply its his script),his plans....And Trevor doesn't know anything about Mandarin and he thinks it's all Aldrich's plans!!So now Aldrich is dead(although we didn't see his corpse he is supposed to be killed by Potts)and Trevor is imprisoned but nothing is over yet until the real face of Ten Rings reveal........Now everything is set for Mandarin,the arch nemesis of Iron Man for a close encounter with Stark!!!!!!!","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

I think my forehead now bears a permanent imprint of the palm of my hand.If you're looking for a visually stunning action movie accompanied by witty, snide remarks by Robert Downy Jr. and unexplainable science fiction nonsense, this is the movie for you. If you want a good vs evil movie with a villain that has sensible motives, goals, and intentions, save your money and watch something else at home.Much like Prometheus or The Avengers, Iron Man 3 is very entertaining but becomes more and more illogical as it goes on. The plot twists feel forced. Some of them you can see coming and the ones that were actual surprises were nonsensical and underwhelming.Also, the highly anticipated post-credit scene was not at all worth sitting through the extensive credits for and gave almost no information about upcoming Marvel Universe installments.Overall, it was fun to watch but I found myself cringing quite a bit at the logical gaps and unnecessary crap. I won't be watching it again unless I'm with a group of friends that insists we put it on.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It gets really hard to find a joke in it. then as we learn how these bombings happen, we don't believe it, it can not happen in the real world. The odd thing is the movie realizes this in the second half of the movie and mocks it self. it turns into a full on comedy mode. it is really hard to find any seriousness any darkness in the story line. I appreciate that Shane Black mocks the formula every other movie uses(which is dark knight formula) what I don't appreciate that he does this through iron man franchise. If you are hard core fan of Robert D. Jr. you should go and see this movie.

Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.However, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails it just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.What is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark's cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time.The end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I said ""oh no¬Ö""Action wise this was nice to see in IMAX, and the action scenes are done very well and special effects are second to none, sadly that's about where the good ends. Also I should point out early on that this one is not so kid friendly. I expected to come out of this loving it and looking forward to taking my 9 & 11 year old kids to see it, but I am seriously second guessing that. This one is darker, more intense, shows much more graphic scenes and situations which are not as kid friendly and boarder on the Rated R scale.The flow wasn't really good, and some scenes I liked and others I about fell asleep, I didn't really care much about the side stories and just took away or needed to be edited down a bit more. The whole anxiety thing while I thought was an interesting addition totally fell flat and was not an issue at any critical moment in the film. It's really hard for me to dig into issues I didn't like but really can't without giving too much of the movie away.The non flowing story, the needless intensity of a few scenes. Probably one of my biggest gripes in this movie was the suits! While they looked cool they were just feasibly impossible, or at least the main one. Not to say that the previous ""Iron Man"" suits were totally believable of course, but now he has a modular suit, which each piece can fly attach to him or whoever he points to, cinch itself together, and then when it runs out of power it can simply open itself all the way up so he can just crawl out? I'm sorry while it looks cool it's just too beyond the believable point. Not to mention his other suits were torn through like butter. I mean so much for the impenetrable suit of armor in this one where it could actually take a beating. I guess lastly I didn't really like the bad guy or his minions. I like Guy Pierce and thought he did a good job, but the fact that you didn't ""feel"" for him nor really hate him it just made for a lack luster bad guy. While they had a cool power, again it was a little beyond the realm of believability. I know that sounds silly for me to say given the whole Marvel Universe of powers.I walked out similar to those who came out in the previous show. Thinking it was just okay. There were some great action sequences, I was bored at time and overall thought the story was ho hum. It wasn't one or two things, but quite a few.

The second Iron Man was the perfunctory comic book movie we thought the first was going to be. And now here comes Iron Man ""Three"" (I'm not sure why it's not numerical). Tony Stark (an increasingly bored- and bitter-looking Robert Downey Jr), traumatised by the events of Avengers Assemble, taunts a bonkers terrorist megastar named The Mandarin (an amusing Ben Kingsley, wholly self-mocking), who then proceeds to blow up the Stark empire. So, rather than the franchise going bigger and badder, and rather than a potentially intriguing P.R. head-to-head between the world's two greatest egomaniacs, we get a kind of origins tale. Again. I wanted to like Iron Man ""Three"", mostly because it represents the final piece of the Shane Black resurrection puzzle (the puzzle being why he hasn't been consistently at the forefront of wisecracking blockbuster Hollywood ever since Lethal Weapon), but I could only let it pass harmlessly over me. It has stacks of great ideas and some whizzy dialogue, but it's also tonally erratic, narratively reckless and overlong. And I can't help feeling that the fanboy-angering twist in the middle might simply be there to make up for the lack of an interesting bad guy.This feels like a good place to leave the standalone Iron Man movies, although Stan Lee's money-making machine shows no sign of slowing, especially now that he's realised that the Chinese are lapping up his solid, gaudy entertainments like there's no tomorrow. Just because the returns this time aren't as diminished as part two, that doesn't mean we need a fourth. All good things come in threes. Except The Godfather.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

It was one of the better superhero movies I've ever seen. This is a sentiment shared by most of my friends.IM3? Let's say it was enjoyable enough to watch as an action flick. However, it failed to impress me in any of the ways I would hope a major feature film would. For instance, the story. OK, granted, not all movies, especially action movies, have to have a great, let alone deep, storyline and script with sensational dialogue. It all depends what they are TRYING to be. That's where IM3 fell short, to me. It seemed like it was trying to seem deeper and more intelligent than it was.Let's make that clear, right now. No matter how much you may have enjoyed this film, it's neither ""deep"" nor ""intelligent"". Any thrills derived are more along the lines of action and shallow motifs.IM3 seemed to give us a number of elements just for the sake of handing them to us. The most infamous of these, what they did with The Mandarin. I won't get into that, here, in this review. But let's say the ""twist"" was more a twist for the sake of the twist. It was not innovative or clever. They could easily have pulled off the same plot device with any other number of names or new characters. Instead, by dropping the name The Mandarin, they slapped the faces of everyone who were familiar with this character from the comic book and wanted to see him brought to life.Another cheap-trick element was Tony's emotional issue (again, not discussed here). You can't just drop something like that in to a character like Stark without working it in, with purpose. Otherwise it seems random and just ""thrown in for the heck of it"".I'll also mention the ending, which left us wondering ""why DID he do that?"" Just for the sake of a few pyrotechnics and a feeling of ""starting fresh"". Sorry, sometimes a theme needs to make sense.That leaves us with is not bad. Not great, though, since the Extremis characters were just a bit too over-powered (and not consistently, I might add) and a far different battle than what I might have hoped for. RDJ, of course, is masterful as Tony Stark, and he was the best part of the movie. I just wish Stark, who is one of the more interesting characters in the Marvel movie franchise, was better-used in this installment.It's interesting to note that, while there were minimal moments of pure dialogue, they seemed slow and to drag. This is indicative of the quality of the writing and characterization, since I usually love moments of meaningful dialogue, even in an action movie. I guess this wasn't all that ""meaningful"". Hmm.I leave you with the notion that if you want to just see an action film, you may, indeed, enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't set your expectations too high. Take all the elements with a grain of salt. They seem to be geared towards a more juvenile audience than the average comic book reader (yes, I meant that as it sounded).IM3 has its moments, and is worth a view, but it's far from great, if you hope for any meat with your cheese.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

While Downey Jr. yet again delivers a stellar portrayal of Tony Stark and there are a few great action scenes the plot eventually crumbles. This movie isn't awful but it's just a major disappointment, I personally blame the moronic writing and direction. One scene in particular will enrage comic book and Iron Man fans alike, I am neither of these and was still baffled as to how such experienced filmmakers could make such a big mistake. There are so many reasons why this movie should have been great and so many reasons why it wasn't, this truly is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. I am now deeply concerned as to where Marvel is heading with their universe and i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way. Let's hope Thor and Captain America can pick up the pieces and save the day because Iron Man needs some backup.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main problem with the film was that it played it very safe, far to safe for the finale of what could have been a genre defining trilogy if done correctly. I feel that the film was sufficiently dumbed down to achieve its blockbuster status with sub par writing throughout and levels of exposition that border on condescending. Although this may seem overly critical I feel that it was a marked improvement from the second film however, I found that the ridiculous amount of comic relief found throughout the film would have been far more appropriate in Iron Man 2. I am in no way saying that the film should be 'Nolan serious' however, I feel that such a significant Marvel film should have a more substantial ending with some level of catharsis at the end SPOILER ALERT>>>>>> * would have preferred it if Pepper Pots died* as I feel that it would have lent far more to the further development of Tony Starks character for the second Avengers film.This film adds new meaning to the phrase ""meh"".","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall did a great job to elevate a terrible story/script.
That's all the good on this movie.The rest of the acting was terrible.
Downey Jr was awful because this movie required more than the one note that he nails like few ever (cocky-funny).
The script was awful; the pace terrible, with an incredible boring middle of the movie to show ""the superhero without the suit"", including cheesy acting/dialogue. It looked like an early 90's movie... in 2010's. Also the twist sucked and made a mockery of the little tension the movie could've built.Last point. Like Age of Ultron, they throw a gazillion of terrible jokes and one-liners and they only work when they refer to Tony and Peppers relationship.The movie is so bad, that even making almost Avengers movie type of money, it ended Iron Man's franchise movies.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hope fans don't get their hopes up for Star Wars , there's probably going to be a musical in it and Mickey Mouse is going to have a quick cameo in it along with Justin Biever playing a new Jedi.

So, for the sake of consuming time and minimalising the repetition, I'll be summarising my feelings when I sat through this last night.Whenever I sit through a film, I rely heavily on my impressions and general feelings towards the spectacle. After enjoying the majority of the original 6 'Avenger' movies (of which I felt IM2 was the weakest), I was expecting something better than this. I will grant kudos for the flashbacks to the Avengers in IM3, but instantly burn the respect by the way TS suffers anxiety attacks 'Nam film style throughout, followed by the bearing that these panic fits have no relevance or importance as the movie reaches its climax.That mini spoiler summarises everything. There's way too much clich√©d cinema which has little relevance to the plot being ripped off throughout this movie. There's Short Round from the Indiana Jones movie. Here's Edward Nigma from the Batman film of the '90s. Bye, bye home base, as seen in Xmen 3.It's all be done before; but throw in some sloppy/not well thought out plot twists you know is coming from the opening flashback (the geek will be a supervillian, the shunned girl his helper), and the tone is set for predictability and rehashes of other not so great movies.It all boils down to the superficiality of a comic book movie made shiny by 3D. The movie is soulless and devoid of humour. War Machine/Iron Patriot/Rhodes... what a waste. Pepperpot... standard damsel, with a predictable twist. And RDJ... He was bored when shooting this, right? Even his ego was embarrassed by the usual 'in joke about his early career' which made earlier films charming but are no longer amusing considering he's arguably the biggest and richest actor around these days; or so it seems.After watching this film, it's pretty apparent that my impression of IM3 is not good. The reason can be broke down to the following statement: once again Hollywood has gone for style over substance, as the producers of this movie rehash not only old lines from previous movies, but also rip off and rehash audience tested plots from not so great movies which create a lot of pointless set pieces and plot conflict.Avoid, unless you're really stuck for a new movie fix. Even then, prepare yourself for flashbacks of every other clich√©d and overused set piece you've ever seen.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My question is with the large sum of money made off this film, more than doubling what it cost to make, why have they not green lit another one? I know he is going to be in Avengers 2 but I figured they could start moving forward on Iron Man 4 too. Anyone know why they haven't?

Just so bad. Its just so disappointing that people keep making movies this bad.spoilers - nothing really, but just being safe. After spending 3 movies establishing Tony Stark as the King of Cool (V1), they've decided to ""character develop"" him. So here come these panic attacks (V2),....except they're so unbelievable that I found that I was rolling my eyes while sitting in a theatre. If you have to *tell* the audience that you're having a panic attack,... Robery Downey Junior does his best I suppose, but its just not him. And nobody can pull off being the ""King of Cool"" and simultaneously having a panic attack. Just not possible.And of course, he's having these panic attacks because he has no armour and needs to fight the bad guys,....except by the end of it he's had 50 armours all along but just didn't use them??? Huh? And he has no panic attacks when he should be having them, like when people are shooting at him and he has no armour. No, that wouldn't be cool to see the King of cool cower,...so he's awesome of course. But then when we switch out of action mode into ""character development"" mode, he can tell everyone that he's having a panic attack so that we know what's happening; (all the meanwhile fully maintaining his King of Cool persona,...he's having the coolest panic attack you ever saw).Then there's the Tony Stark V3 when he's around Rhodney. Well I'm still cool, but now I'm a military dumb-dumb since I'm around 'Rhodney the military guy'. Please ignore the fact that I just kicked a whole platoon's worth of bad guys with only a hand glove and a machine gun because clearly now I don't know the first thing about guns or ammo or shooting,... face-palm.It just sucked so bad. And then there was bad guy(s). Oh watch out for this one. The ""#2"" bad guy (AIM) had so little substance that it wasn't even funny. At the end of the movie try to figure out what his motivations were. Was he trying to be a rich industrialist? Well he seems to already have infinite wealth and control. Was he trying to get his little science project off the ground? Well, he was pretty much there already. Compare him to Magneto from the X-Men movies or Norman Osborne from the Spider Man movies and that 'character' just comes across as so lame.Anyway, if you like Michael Bay movies this one's for you. More bang! More boom! than the other 2 movies. Spend 5 minutes thinking about the movie after you walk out and it sucks,....bad.OK SERIOUS SPOILER HERE. ""I'm Iron Man"". ""Does the man make the machine or does the machine make the man"". Well that little catch phrase seems to have wagged the dog. I'm the man, that's why I spent 3/4 of the damn movie running around without armour despite being, you know, and Iron Man movie. And now I'm going to destroy all of my armours because I'm really Tony Stark the man. Except now I'm going to claim ""I'm Iron Man!"" as my last line in the movie. Jeeez. Seriously, run around the whole movie with no suit. Then show us that you have 50 suits. Then destroy them all because you're Tony the man. Then end the movie with ""I'm Iron Man"". Who the hell thought that up. Gawd, Jeeez.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes, it was fun and the action and effects were respectable, but it wanted to be more like an adventure comedy family film than a superhero action film. It did not follow the tone or the aspect of its predecessors and they wanted to make it more funny than it should have been. I did not like the villains, I felt them to be like too overpowered and their characteristics were like too much to swallow, but not enough chew. It was like you're all ""there, you have powers"" and I'm like ""Why?"" and you go ""Because!! now get to it!!!"" And the thing with the Mandarin it was just a big NO for me. It was nothing like what they offered me in the trailers. It's like when you go to the circus and the announcer tells you about this wild jungle cat and when you enter it's just a kitten with a wig. There was a kid in there and they wanted to make him all witty and funny and cute, but I personally hated him. I thought it was a completely unnecessary character. And another thing is that they were making funny comments when their lives were at stake or before a very intense near-death experience. I just didn't like that they wanted to be funny at inopportune moments of the story. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because it was a big disappointment, although it had very good action sequences. And to top it all, it was based on Christmas time. Seriously, a Christmas movie in the summer. It should've been called ""Iron Man: Saving Pepper's Christmas"" and leave the ""Iron Man 3"" title to someone who knows what to do with superhero films.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But hard to say but the truth it is, the third instalment of the franchise is comparatively a disappointment, content wise.Starting from the start, the earth shattering promos are amazingly wonderful and it did indeed create an urge in the minds of the viewers to watch the movie. The painful dialogues of Tony Stark of how he cannot relax even after having an amazing life and how he has to fight for Pepper, whom he loves the most, have been sentimental enough to bounce up the eagerness in our hearts. Of course, these elements are more than enough for a faithful Iron Man fan to watch its third part.Coming to the movie, Iron Man 3 starts with the year 1999 when Stark (Robert Downey) was the arrogant and the self obsessed 'machine maestro'. The small prequel shows how he urged some people to be the bad and the destructive. The movie then jumps straight to 2013 when he is a changed man with feelings and love in his heart and of course with his new identity of that of the Iron Man. But what done cannot be undone in life and that is what exactly happens in Stark's life. The past haunts him and this time in the form of a hell named MANDARINE and it breaks him nearly in a way that it almost takes his life. But Stark is Stark! The man comes back and this time with his automatic, ultra magnificent and highly developed suit. Oh! Correction; SUITS. Yes he has back up this time. Stark, Pepper and Rhodes showcase their action best and well, Pepper can become a big surprise for you. After all said and done, unlike the promos, the movie does not show up to as much as expected when it came to the storyline. The first and the second instalments indeed gave us a breakthrough to action heroes and their stories, but this time, there are certain disappointments. Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadale and Guy Pierce have portrayed their best in the movie. In fact Pierce might even surprise you. But more than them, the actor whom everyone was looking forward to was the Mandarin played by none other than the one of the most versatile actors of Hollywood, Sir Ben Kingsley. But alas, the character has not been much utilised and the actor has not been exploited much. His short and kicking appearance in the movie will be remembered though. There is no doubt about the technical aspects of the movie as the suits have been improved and also the action packed sequences will take you off the edge. The action sequence in the air when Iron Man saves 14 inmates of a plane is one of the best sequences of the movie; the next one to be the climax action sequence. There are fireworks and fire blasts in the sequence that will make you scream for more. The sets are magnanimous and the Stark mansion is one to look forward to.If you are an Iron Man lover, then there is no way that you are going to miss this third part. Go for it this weekend.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The lack of Bruce Banner in the film was a let down as in the end of the Avengers we clearly see that Tony and Bruce drive off together as also mentioned in the earlier parts of the film where Stark was telling him about the ""top 10 floors all R and D and that he would love it there"" So that was a bit of a let down... Not that i expected it to be a Hulk themed movie.Second... The Mandarin...The Mandarin is one of Iron Mans greatest villains. The Mandarin is to Iron Man as The Joker is to Batman. Imagineif at the end of ""The Dark Knight"" if you were to find out that the Joker was only an actor hired by the mafia to keep Batman Busy... You would probably be a little upset right? Well thats what they did with the Mandarin. Its shameful.And this turn of events would not have been SO bad if they had not added in all the extras to make it seem like he was real. Evidence that goes back to the first film.In the first film the lead terrorist that was holding Stark captive in the cave was wearing one of the 10 rings of power. He was even admiring it in one of the scenes. along with a poster of the 10 rings in the back of his tent. Why would he do this if the whole ring thing was faked. Why would they fake the 10 rings of power for Iron Man 3 as you can see ""the Mandarin"" wearing them in the video. The Mandarin and the 10 Rings are real in the Marvel universe. its a shame they made all these errors and made it out to be fake.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is a loud and brawny piece of cinema. Multiple shootouts, explosions and death defying Iron Man stunts make up for a lack of storytelling in an overall weak film. While the cast does the best to salvage what is left of the franchise, you can't help but wonder whether or not Shane Black took this too serious or not serious enough. Either way, it doesn't turn out a masterpiece entry in the Marvel franchise.Iron Man 3 proves to be a high octane action thriller in it's first and third act, however the second act is so muddled it is impossible to ignore. The film is what you would expect out of a summer blockbuster in the action category but fails to deliver on any story structure. Shane Black's direction gets some things right, an impeccable set of performances namely from Ben Kingsley and Robert Downey Jr keep the film from being a total washout but once the credits roll, you're left with an empty feeling in your stomach and failed expectations. While this entry is light years ahead of the second installment, it still lacks the energy of the first one. This should be expected out of a trilogy, which is why my rating isn't completely honest. By any regards, this is not a great film. The dialog is horrendous, the story structure is finicky and it is more brawn than brains. However, considering it is the last installment in the franchise, it does gain some recognition on effort. Overall, if you're expecting a summer blockbuster then look no further. Iron Man 3 is mindless, over charged and high octane. However, if you're looking for anything over and above that then skip it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Obviously not in the near future as this comic book recreation IRON MAN 3 has made almost as much money as HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE - $1,215,439,994 and counting. Money talks and in this case it shouts, so we are likely in for more Iron Man episodes. 'A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.' This quote form the film is cogent in that it nods to the feeling of some viewers. The plot is more about 'things' than story but in case a story line is needed then the following help decipher the reason this movie takes over 2 hours to tell: 'IRON MAN 3 pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) against an enemy Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and his 'front' ""Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?' That makes the film sound like it has a tale to tell.Actually the writing (Drew Pearce, Shane Black, Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Warren Ellis, Adi Granov ‚Äì whew!) tosses some terrific one-liners that do entertain, but the main character is the special effects crew. Actors Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau, Ty Simpkins, Paul Bettany's voice and a host of real TV personalities help the derring-do do, and likely in 3D this is quick a show. But these escapism films are wearing thin ‚Äì except in the pocket books of the producers. Grady Harp, January 14","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just a jumble of a movie and a surprise considering the previous were good, I found myself wondering whether they'd had the budget cut or something towards the middle of the movie because I couldn't believe Iron Man 3 was that TEPID. Boring wet floppy fish of an Action movie. I was hoping for kick ass action, big effects, a little comedy but instead i got a wet, depressed Downey Jr for 70 minutes of the film before finally we get a little Iron Man action, which in itself was quite disappointing.

But later on the film you find out the Mandarin is a wimp, and the real Mandarin is a rich guy who wants revenge on Tony Stark for blowing him off on New years eve. How does he get revenge? By blowing up places, stupid! As in the comic books the Mandarin has powers using his rings. Does this Mandarin have powers? No not really. He stole someones idea (which can heal himself) and breathes fire ONCE.How does he die? Tony Stark uses his suit and self destruct the Mandarin. Does he die? No he doesn't. He dies by one blast of Iron gun shot used by peppers. STUPID! Worse Iron Man film ever!

Your audience has built up its expectations of how the movie should feel, and if you play with the tone too much the relationship to the previous films will suffer. Iron Man 3 does this in a big way; however this doesn't inherently make it bad. Both Iron Man and Iron Man 2 were directed by Jon Favreau and while the hedonism was a bit much, these films felt very connected and watching them back to back tells a very fluid story. And then there's Iron Man 3.Ironically Joss Whedon's The Avengers was a substantially better ""Iron Man 3 film"" than the film Iron Man 3. Not just in quality, but in the character focus and the story of Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, Tony Stark's character feels completely removed from the previous Iron Man films. The excuse of this radical change is told with flimsy conjecture that his actions in The Avengers somehow hurt his psyche. Although going from a spoiled, rich, and hedonistic lifestyle to being held prisoner for three months in a Middle Eastern cell, that he just shrugs off with no problem.To tell the plot summary with as minimum spoilers as possible, can be summed up with a simple concept: abandonment of focus. Iron Man, the first film, was Marvel's lash back at DC for the successful retelling of Batman in Batman Begins. DC chose to focus on how their superhero Batman could practically exist with only minor jumps in technology along the way. Iron Man follows this idea to the T. And as you probably already assumed, Iron Man 3 abandons this concept. Why? The character of Tony Stark is intrinsically interesting. He is rich, handsome, charming, and confident; however, Iron Man 3 feels the need to humanize him. But this is an exercise in futility. From the moment we meet him we also learned his faults. He was an alcoholic, womanizer, and had no respect or love for anything but himself. Despite resolving these issues through the events of the first two movies, by far his largest character fault was his ego. Again this was somehow bruised by saving the world at the end of The Avengers. Because we all know that someone with an overwhelming large ego would not in any way become more full of himself after saving the world. And that this would simultaneously cause a complete shift is personality.The supporting cast is great; both Ms. Potts and Happy continue their respective character stories well. The villains however were laughably out of place, and sadly this was the only aspect of the film that was similar to the original Iron Man. One of the only improvements that Iron Man 2 had over the first film was dropping these flat, one-dimensional, Saturday morning cartoon Bond villains. But if you missed them, they're back for Iron Man 3. Hooray? Despite being a very entertaining film, it seems its editing might be the greatest enemy. There are several rather important plot points and character decisions that either make no sense or happen at the wrong time. In fact, throughout the whole movie I kept thinking, ""Man, I can't wait to do a Fan Edit of this"". The flow of the narrative is perhaps the most damaged by this sloppy editing. The story is in there somewhere, but it's just not coming through very clearly.Visually the movie is amazing. And the special effects keep you enthralled throughout every action sequence. From the barrel of monkeys to some spectacular fight/flight choreography, you'll be glued to your seat. At least until the scene is over and Tony Stark is back to babysitting some random kid. What's that? We need to appeal to the young kids in crowd? You want us to shoehorn a random subplot of a child in this film for no reason other than a blatant marketing ploy? Sure no problem.Iron Man 3 does have a lot going for it, but the degree of its strange choices adds up and in the end it leaves you with a bad aftertaste in your mouth. Did we mention this was a Christmas movie? Yeah, let that sink in for a moment. This is early May. So I ask again, why? And not knowing that it is a Christmas movie before watching it is even more confusing. There are no plots or subplots that justify it either; it is simply Christmas and there is no reason for it.Iron Man is by far the most beloved Avenger, and with Thor and Captain America sequels in route I'm worried that this film may cost the others at the box office. Iron Man 3 pulled in over 175 million dollars in its opening weekend, one of the largest in history; second only to The Avengers. As this was the first film to follow The Avengers, it thusly was guaranteed to succeed financially, but at what cost to its fellow heroes? Although it is a very watchable film, the structural inconsistencies and abandonment of character focus deeply hurt the ability to enjoy this film.Check out more reviews at http://www.budswatchingduds.com","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And yes, I'm talking about the script.Some of the bad guys have specific powers that are hardly explained mainly because they don't make much sense.

This new universe is filled with poor writing, a crappy story, and hokey characters. I thoroughly enjoyed Iron Man and Iron Man 2, when I saw that Jon Favreau would not be directing the third installment, I became extremely wary about the direction of Iron Man. I cannot believe that they gave a 200 million dollar movie to a relatively inexperienced Shane Black. I further cannot believe that they read the script and signed off on it. They really need to run this stuff by Joss Wheden, as he is really the spearhead of all the Avengers. Shane Black should never direct or write an action movie ever again.Get ready for lame jokes, childish humor, hokey sentiments, and poor action sequences. Also there are so many plot holes, it will drive you insane. Robert Downey Jr. plays a Tony Starkesque character named conveniently named Tony Stark, except this version of Tony Stark has lost his charm and is no longer the ""Bad-ass"" Jon Favreau created. As I do not except this piece of trash as a true Iron Man film, I'll just refer to the character ""Tony Stark"" as Robert Downey Jr. So Robert Downey Jr starts the film off narrating about a lame party he was at in Switzerland in 1999, he briefly meets some guy (Guy Pierce) and snubs him, he also sleeps with a young scientist who's not really serious about her work. Then it's present time, he's suffering in a relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow (Potts), he spends his time building random suits (big plot hole, why suits he'll never wear) instead of with her. During this time attacks start happening, it's very obvious who's behind them, the director doesn't even try to hide it. Big stuff starts happening, SHIELD and the Avengers do nothing and aren't even mentioned even though everyone in the film talks non-stop about them (nother big plot hole). So Robert Downey Jr, has to save the world, from super-humans who are a cross between Wolverine and Human Tourch (Fan 4).Overall, this movie just made me angry, it is NOT an Iron Man film. I hope that in The Avengers: Age of Ultron they have Tony Stark wake up from a coma and completely disregard this movie as a figment of Tony Stark's imagination.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Shane Black manages to inject his own style into the film, giving it a fresher feel. The dialogue is crackling and witty, and the performance from Robert Downey Jr is, as always, top notch.Unfortunately, the fresh direction from Black cant overcome traditional superhero movie tropes, but that's expected from Marvel films. More glaring are the villain's muddled motives and Rebecca Hall's character who is basically a throwaway aside from the opening scene. Not only is Hall's character a throwaway, but so is the young boy that Stark comes Ito contact with about 1/3 through the film. That entire plot point felt unnecessary and more unrealistic than most points in the last two Iron Man films.Overall, Iron Man Three is fun to watch if you want some action and a few laughs, but if you're looking for something like The Dark Knight, look elsewhere.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was OK to see the X-Men, Spider-Man, the Hulk and Iron Man once each. Each one has his/her own superpower and has to use it in his/her own way. But it gets boring when each movie has two or three sequels. Seriously, how many bad guys are you going to defeat? I can think of stories that haven't gotten filmed, but Hollywood is stuck on superhero sequels, tween pop, and remakes of horror flicks and foreign films*. Therefore, ""Iron Man 3"" just doesn't seem original. It especially comes across as a letdown when you consider that Robert Downey Jr. has starred in ""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"". I don't recommend this movie.*I can proudly say that I've seen ""Solaris"", ""Open Your Eyes"", ""The Dinner Game"" and ""Death at a Funeral"", but not their American remakes.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I love movies big and small but I'm not a comic book fan and these superhero movies are a formulaic fad that I wish would fade away soon to let another movie-phase through. However, the marketing and the fact Shane Black was writing and directing Iron Man 3 started to make it a one-off exception. Then the reviews came in and the response was mediocre to terribly poor. I really like Black for Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang so I was surprised he could disappoint this badly. The only movies that failed this bad for Marvel have been the Hulk and Thor movies as well as that abysmal third X-Men movie but that's usually because of the poor directors behind the camera. Iron Man has always been a highlight of the series.I went to a Shane Black talk this Summer at the LA Film Festival and he asked the audience ""who went to see that piece of s--t?"" He defended himself that he wanted to make Tony more vulnerable and have his machinery break every once in a while but then he admitted defeat that it just didn't work. At first it put me off but then I couldn't help but be curious, what went so horribly wrong? I don't care about official comic book canon so any changes don't particularly faze me but Black changed Iron Man far too significantly from the other movies for it to be ignored. I like the idea that he's trying to show growth with the traumatic events of The Avengers having a big effect on Tony but it's so clumsily handled that it doesn't work. The film isn't actually that bad in its first 45 minutes but when it gets into the meat of the story is when it starts to become ridiculous.It constantly struggles with momentum, stopping too much for Black's taste in quirky self- referencing humour and none of the characters who deliver that comedic relief suit it, particularly Don Cheadle. The villains and the special effects simply weren't believable, probably due to a lack of explanation. Every left turn or surprise in the story ended up lowering the stakes or taking me out of the moment. But the biggest problem is that Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark of Iron Man 3 is just too mean-spirited to support which is a big problem as there's not nearly enough Iron Man action, and this is coming from the most casual of viewers. The hope for this film crumbles like far many of the suits do when they hit the tiniest of roadblocks. I'll be avoiding the rest of Marvel but hopefully Black can redeem himself with an original and R-rated film like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.4/10","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Marvel is known for their cut-throat operating tactics, and, after rumours of internal strife with Jon Favreau on Iron Man 2 (word has it he felt they were rushing him and his production -- which, in hindsight, given the lackluster response to the film, is probably a fair assessment), they unceremoniously ditched him for the guy who made Robert Downey Jr's lead role comeback vehicle, ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,"" in 2005.Black was the Tarantino of '80s action screenplays, an overnight sensation who was hired to act in ""Predator"" purely so that Joel Silver could get free on-set script rewrites. He had a string of big hits into the early '90s until a couple bombs stung him and he retreated for ages. It's sort of weird that he chose a $200 million franchise picture to be his route of re-emergence - but so it goes. The trademarks of Black's scripts are here: the movie is set at Christmastime, has a lot of witty banter, and there's probably a lot more humour than in the last couple Iron Mans.Here's where my first fault lies: the tone of this movie is decidedly different from the first two. I think that was deliberate and a wise choice, given that the first two Iron Man movies seemed to be set more firmly in reality, and ""Avengers"" (and the Thors and Cap Ams) sort of opened Tony Stark's world to something more fantastic and unbelievable. If you rewatch Iron Man, if an alien suddenly showed up at the end it would be a jarring tonal shift. But after Avengers, anything is possible, so Black takes the action a little further, takes the Extremis plot to extremes (pardon the pun), and makes the movie a little more goofy than I expected.Here's what is odd, though: if they're trying to reestablish Iron Man as more fantastical than he was in the first two installments, why the controversial Mandarin subplot? I don't have a dog in the race so to speak since I don't read the comics, but if they're going to try to make the Mandarin a 'realistic' interpretation, why bother to (some might say) ruin the iconic character instead of presenting him with his magical powers? Would having powerful rings be *that* much weirder than gods from Asgard showing up or a giant green hulk? I also thought Black's dialogue, though clever, was under-served by some of the woeful supporting actors. The main henchman working for Guy Pearce's character was entirely non-intimidating -- they should have gotten someone whose supposed menace wasn't so laughable. The female Extremis warriors, all supermodel status with their flawless makeup, just made me roll my eyes. Black gives all these characters cheesy one-liners that wouldn't be so cheesy if they weren't such bad actors. When you're sparring with Robert Downey Jr you need someone who can match the verbal delivery - that's why Val Kilmer's smarminess was a perfect complement to Downey in Kiss Kiss - but Black consistently gives Downey poor pairings. It's sad when the little kid ends up being the best one of the lot.Don Cheadle is fairly wasted again and Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do. Such is normal for the franchise so far but you can't help but feel that whole (fairly odd) hour build-up with Tony out of the suit for much of the time they could have better developed these characters. The biggest disappointment, though, is Guy Pearce. If you thought they wasted Mickey Rourke in the last film, wait til you get a hold of Pearce. First he's given the Jim Carrey role in Batman Forever to redo in the beginning, then he's just a sort of charmless yet hammy villain later on. His motivations are clich√©d and underdeveloped. Pearce is a brilliant actor and filmmakers continue to waste his talents.The movie has some cool action sequences and the $200 mil is up on the screen. The CGI is some of the best in any film made to date. But it's also becoming all so mind-numbing. The big long action sequence at the end goes on and on, and because 99% of it is so clearly CGI, much of it becomes uninspiring. You lose interest in Tony's humanity when so many of his feats betray physical limits: I think there's a hundred shots in this movie where he's leaping off a high building of some kind and jumps into an Iron Man suit mid-air and flies around and does something just in the nick of time to save someone.I don't know - maybe I'm just burnt out by the onslaught of Marvel products and how relentless they've been with jamming these movies down our collective throat - but I really think I'm getting bored by this franchise already. Judging by some of his recent comments, so is Downey. Part of me hopes he does take a hiatus from Iron Man so he can start acting in proper films again - a sequel to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang would actually be quite nice.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This film had neither in my opinion. I, luckily, waited and rented it on DVD, but still feel like I wasted my money. Robert Downy, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rebecca Hall did a good job with a horrible plot line and terrible dialogue, but that's not enough to save a terrible film. If you want to know how the producers, director, writers and crew could waste so much money producing this bad a film, look at the bonus features on the DVD. The sole feature is 17 minutes on how they made repeated skydives to make the special effects sequences of about a minute of the 130 minute movie realistic because computer graphic images (cgi) are not. Then after shooting all these skydives they replaced the real background and much of the actors parts with cgi. Instead of telling a story, they spent the majority of the production time playing and being fascinated with special effects. That may have amused some of the cast and the crew, but does not and will not amuse or entertain the audience. What a terrible shame.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

TBH it's the last point that I found the most irritating. It's also absurd to think that in a reality where aliens have attacked and superheroes are running around, the villain's main goal is to gain some power over the US govt.

This wasn't a snobby movie, but that should drive home the poor rating even harder. This was a poor example of a Marvel movie. Is it representative of what we can expect however? More Amazing Spider-Man? Yes probably.Overall the Acting was very poor, RDJ turned in the same wooden performance he did in the last 4 films, except this time the role did not call for a wooden actor. The film felt overall like a B-Movie with an A++ CGI effect budget. IT is not his fault he is what he is. The role provided for him required a more robust acting experience however.the Movie has no center. It lacks a positive message. It lacks a triumph of good over evil. Instead we get a facade of corporate America posing as 911 conspirators to delude the public into fighting a war on terror that does not exist. Sigh. It almost makes me wish I lived in communist China. At least Chinese citizens are smart enough to understand that what they read on the Internet is probably someone with an Agenda posting it. This story line was written by a child that lives on he Internet and believes that wiki pages are a valid source of information.Let me paraphrase a line from the movie.""Hollywood seems like an American culture representation. Except it is not. It was made by anti-American cooks. Cooks that think America is Evil, 911 conspiracies are real and straight people have no idea how to dress themselves. Just like those beliefs, it is hollow inside.

Captain America was nice, age of ultron was good, iron man 2 was OK, and I've seen this one. It was released in 2013 to high amounts of praise. But I think it's over-hyped. And here's whyThe story in this film is about terrorists about to completely take over the U.S., and it suddenly starts to focusing on people that can burst into flames. See, this is super disorganized this film is? What makes it more choppy is the fact that Tony Starks home was under attack, then he gets in his suit unconscious, flys off, and wakes up in a totally different place. I thought while seeing that, what just happened? Things get more disorganized for reasons that will spoil the film. The writing is just super choppy, disorganized, and a bit confusing. It goes on like this for so long and it just makes me wonder what the heck is happening here. There is not much logic. Its just super messy and just doesn't make sense.The special effects look super great. I will not lie, it just gets you excited and hyped during the action scenes. It's another big budgeted set of special effects that played off. The iron man suit looks great and it really gets you. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the action scenes makes you think about the cgi in the movie. So overall, the effects have a lot of effort.The characters in the movie are flimsy just like the movie. For the main character Tony Stark, instead of learning more like in the second one, he's just the ordinary hero. The kid in the movie serves more of a plot device and is a bit bland. The rest of the characters are mostly forgettable like the people who can burst into flames and more. So there's not much to offer with these guys. There just isn't. So overall, Iron man 3 is one of marvels worst films. It may have done things right like the special effects are great, and the acting is good . But it's not enough to save it from its lackluster writing, and bland characters. Iron man 3 is so over-hyped that I think some people were a bit harsh on the second one. So bottom line: Its a waste of a screenplay, a waste of characters we watch for two hours, and it's overall a bad film. Rating: D+ = 3.5/10One more thing: This movie was so confusing that I even wrote a factual error about the plot that I had to remove.

I couldn't even believe this movie was being serious with the idea of creating a man who fueled himself revenge due to the fact the world's most sought after billionaire didn't meet him on the roof to discuss an important matter, this is complete and utter childishness. He couldn't schedule to meet with Mr. Stark later on. Once again, the convenience of the film's sieging of an opportunity towards elaborating on a plot that died the moment they involved revenge was utterly pathetic, and the fact that this movie made 1.2 billion dollars makes me question whether people care anymore towards whether or not their money goes towards something beautiful; which this movie was far from. I couldn't stand any of the characters in this movie because the script was non-engaging, almost every five minutes there was a giggle joke intervening the concept of the story so by the time the movie was over it comes off more as a comedy more than an a film to be taken as a serious installment towards the Avengers II. Which is why the first Iron Man, will always be the best out of the franchise no matter how many more films there are in the coming years involving Tony Stark. If this is the best they had to offer after three years for Iron Man then this franchise can go nowhere but down.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Why oh why do they throw everything but the kitchen sink at you and expect it to work? Especially galling is the writers borrow from the Dark Knight Rises (phew) putting the superhero's alter ego on camera for 70% of the movie. Then there's the business of everybody gets to wear the Iron Man suit, which dilutes and cheapens the whole premise. As soon as the bad guy or his minions smash the armor to the point of non-operation, another suit flies out of the sky and clamps itself to the hero, or the hero's girlfriend, or his buddy, or the paperboy if he's nearby. Finally, the villain is ...well, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it. In the early comics the Mandarin was Iron Man's Luthor or Dr. Doom, his main nemesis. This movie portrayal is an outrage. Even the Stan Lee cameo was not good and over in a blink of an eye. On the plus side, Gwyneth Paltrow is gorgeous.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even Robert Downey Jr., as entertaining as he is, seems to be coasting through this film. Plus, in the end, they try and quickly wrap everything up in a tidy trilogy package and it just doesn't work.

Unfortunately the story was completely different, don't get me wrong, I enjoy movies with twists and surprises but Iron Man 3 crossed the line. Don't worry I'm not going to give away any spoilers.The actors do their jobs well and the visual effects are amazing but the people who worked behind the scenes completely ruined what could have been one of Marvel's greatest movies. It surprised me how much of a success the movie actually was, because usually a movie like this goes straight to DVD. If you would like to know what happens in the movie I would just search it on Google, as it is a faster and won't bore you for 2 hours.In the past i have really enjoyed Marvel's movies ( especially the first two Iron Man Movies ) as they have a great balance between action and humour but Iron Man 3 takes all of that away turns it into a comedy. I hope this movie is forgotten because to be honest I preferred 'Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer' than this awful embarrassment of a Movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a huge fan of his previous works; Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (which also stared Robert Downey Jr) I figured how could this fail. I was wrong. Not only did this film fail but they some how made a film about Iron Man boring and mundane. As the first phase 2 film in Marvels line up, Iron Man 3 immediately stumbles out the gate. The film is riddled with plot holes, bad writing, and flat humor. The characters are one dimensional, the villains are dull, and there was no sense of threat or urgency.This is an IRON MAN movie!, there are years worth of interesting stories and scenarios that could of been utilized to tell an engaging story. Instead we are given a poorly executed version of the Extremis storyline. There is a twist towards the 2nd act that your either gonna love or hate.

By the way: Robert Downey Jr. needs to go over the books when it comes down to choosing the next movie roles because while making a fortune with these popcorn movies he dangers himself by losing role credibility. Why? In my opinion these kind of movies don't require acting skills very much this is Downey Jr.'s 4th appearance in the Iron Man series (Avengers included) so I tend to think he's choosing roles or movies that make him tons of money but don't challenge him as an actor.Anyway, I think you really have to be an Iron Man fan in order to spend your money on this.

And Iron Man, a character rescued from lesser known Marvel comic books, is proposed since 2008 the beginning of a saga that draws, in my opinion, so that the contemporary world shows how the ideal or aspirational it to be: a successful playboy , millionaire, eccentric, intelligent and creative character named Tony Stark. The story, from its inception, has developed some traumas of Tony personal conflicts, friendly and loving. The mixture has attractive, its origin is traumatic, Tony Stark, untouchable, suffers an attack, is kidnapped, gets his lesson for being a creator and arms dealer who does not mind the conflicts and deaths caused by their having capitalist participates. Stark underwent surgery with an implant energy that prevents shrapnel it reaches the heart. So goes Iron Man and its sequel. But among the laws of history, in the third installment, Tony Stark attacked by anxiety attack mid-40s, starring many of the sequences of the plot of Iron Man 3 WITHOUT the armor that provides Iron Man, no longer attractive. While this is part of their trauma, the creation of 50 or more Ironmans detracts from the unique, the unusual, the reified in that symbolic element of the representation of the hero, the icon. This is a law of the comic book hero. The second law in failing Iron Man is a character, an icon should not break apart physically. Abused And this film the armor is now decomposed and recomposed and travels through the territory, handled virtually. These dynamic changes in history are slowly draining the movie to a mediocre one third version of the Iron Man comics stories often develop the conflict of man a hero, one who acquires ordinary supernatural powers and becomes unique and exceptional. But mortal man without powers, meritorious connotes building a character that will power, mind, desire for revenge and to do good, it conforms itself by gadgets, cloak, armor, almost supernatural human strength. In his case, the mere mortal strengthened, Batman, given for a unique trilogy of Christopher Nolan, in which, in the end, Bane literally bankrupt and breaks the mask over his face. This collapse is part of history, the rebirth of the hero who runs towards the end of the authentic self, his future, his lost love. But in Iron Man Character decomposition is his undoing. The character is disrupted, then the film falls apart. Tony Stark, meanwhile, strives to move its powers to third parties, Colonel Rhodes, and even the president of the United States of America is dressed in costume. Third Law: the hero is the sole bearer of its symbols, communication image it projects. Even Pepper Pots have acquired powers survives. Part of the drama of Batman in the Dark Knight is the inability to save the life of the alleged love starring Chapter, and understand that the hero's life is sad, complex, and that their condition represents the loss of those he loves.

Reviewing it as an objective viewer there are a lot of stuff to like in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. kills it again in his role and his comedic timing is excellent. I even enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrows performance. Guy Pearce also plays a pretty awesome villain and Ben Kingsley nails it as the Mandarin. Don Cheadle however is a different story. He does not have a lot of scenes and he does not have an important role in this movie....Jon Favreau had more of a role here than him which is a shame, since in the comics War Machine actually becomes Iron Man for a time. And Some humor does not always work in this movie because it feels like fart jokes a lot of times. Also do not expect to see a lot of Iron Man in this film and even when he you do the suit breaks apart almost immediately. The reason why I give it a 5 is because of a scene during the 2nd half of the film which ruins everything about the Iron Man saga which the comic book fans came to expect. Its a scene that truly ruins everything you know from the comics and it does not make sense why the creators of the movie went down this path.

I think that I prefer when Downey Jr is being cocky then when he is love struck and vulnerable. The big showdown at the end was a bit messy and it seemed like the director just wanted to show off his CGI skills. I also wasn't that impressed with Don Cheadle, but Terrence Howard wasn't that much better. I liked the chemistry between Downey and the little kid, but it was the storyline that let the movie down. Judging by the money that the movie made, the audiences obviously are into this franchise, but I was expecting some reference to the Avengers or at least, Samuel L. Jackson popping up like he has in the previous Ironman's. The writers need to come up with some fresh material and try not to rely on gimmicks and flashy shots. Expected Better!Round-Up: Robert Downey Jr. puts in his usual great performance and the chemistry between him and Gwenyth Paltrow was believable. I must admit, for a superhero, Ironman got his ass kicked way to many times which is why he is trying to improve the suit all the way through the movie. Because of the disappointing 2nd movie, I was hoping that they would have brought in a director that could bring something amazing, but its pretty average in my opinion. I had to watch the showdown at the end a few times because there is so much going on, but I'm sure that the comic fans will love it.Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $1.2billionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Ironman franchise, and there is loads of action for people to enjoy. 5/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well, it was worse than that, and Iron Man 2 is almost a masterpiece next to it. In the initial 45 minutes I was always excusing what was happening up to that point, giving it a chance and expecting it to get much better Then I realized that wasn't going to happen, in fact it only got worse, the script was everywhere, it had so much idiocy it that I went into desperation. I even think Tony Stark never even make it to the set, it was all completely unrecognizable.

When a terrorist known as The Mandarin emerges and almost kills Stark's ex-bodyguard in a bombing, Tony swears to get vengeance by killing The Mandarin himself. This time Tony Stark's ego might have lead him to go too far as his actions put more than just his own life in jeopardy.Iron Man was a surprise hit and one of the three best super-hero films next to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2. It began introducing us to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a role he seemed born to play. Like in all super-hero films, it had some far-fetched ideas yet it was able to keep a level of believability due to some key ingredients that more of these films need to be using in order to keep from embarrassing themselves. The first ingredient was to not just explain but to show how the technology worked, like in Batman Begins. The other key ingredient was to keep a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, making everything light and fun, never taking itself too seriously. Some great laugh-out-loud moments were provided thanks to Robert Downey, Jr. in his performance. Add a twisted villain and an adrenaline-fueled hard rock soundtrack and you've got a lovable super-hero that balances comedy with explosive action.While Iron Man 2 made the mistake of under-using what could have been better villains with Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell, the few action scenes there were showed Jon Favreau had become a master at directing edge-of-your-seat sequences. And while it was held back with a subplot setting up The Avengers, it contained some cleverly written, witty dialogue that delivered the same humor that made the first one so much fun.Iron Man 3 takes a storyline from the Extremis mini-series with a new director, Shane Black. The first sign that Black was taking Iron Man in the wrong direction was the use of the most over-played song of 1999 and what could be considered one of the most annoying excuses for music of all time. Forget classic rock themes from AC/DC or Audioslave, this time we are burdened with having to be reminded of the worse thing that came out of 1999, Blue (Da Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65. Some things should be left in the past, buried in shame and hopefully forgotten, never be played or heard again for the rest of our lives.Music aside, there's an unnecessary voice-over and the witty dialogue we've come to expect has been replaced with slapstick comedy. This includes Tony being hit in the groin with a piece of his new prototype suit, which is left unexplained as to how it is suppose to work, and toilet humor involving the villain. Guy Peace is a good choice for a new bad guy behind the Extremis technology, yet this is also left unexplained as to how it works or what it's purpose is. Ben Kingsley is a great addition but the film is as guilty as the last sequel with under-using such a great actor.Iron Man 3 suffers from trying to do too much. In the beginning it seems Shane Black wants to make a serious character study of Tony Stark, this could have proved interesting but then, as the film moves forward, it is clear he is also trying to appease the younger fans of The Avengers with out-of-place, cartoon antics including a fire-breathing villain. All believability is thrown out the window causing any excitement or suspense to be lost. What made Iron Man work so well was it didn't take itself too seriously, as this one does. The fun is lost.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

With the only Marvel stand- alone superhero film to have a sequel (so far - Thor: The Dark World and Captain American: The Winter Soldier are imminent) being Iron Man, did the world really need a third entry into this franchise? More importantly, did we want it? Well, with over $1 billion in the bank and the label of fifth highest grossing film of all time, the answer is an overwhelming yes. The franchise certainly needed a fresh injection of life - Jon Favreau's massively disappointing follow up to his impressive Iron Man (2008) perhaps showed his inexperience as director, though he has stayed on to reprise his role as bodyguard Happy Hogan (looking worryingly bloated). Changes have been made, and although the critics seemed to lap up Iron Man 3, audiences opinions seem strangely polar opposite.Interesting choices for director have always been Marvel's thing, to allow a respected or rookie director a chance to inject their own sensibilities into the familiar superhero film. Sometimes it pays off - Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian background gave Thor (2011) a certain gravitas when it could have been plain silly. But sometimes it doesn't, such as the choice of Joe Johnston - whose career is a very mixed bag anyway - for Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which I found rather dull. So for Iron Man 3, in steps Shane Black, 80's buddy-comedy extraordinaire, whose filmography was somewhat re-discovered in fits of nostalgia of late, especially after the excellent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005). And deservedly so, as Black's obvious talent for writing led to movies such as Lethal Weapon (1987) setting the benchmark for countless buddy movies to follow (and ultimately damage the sub-genre). So Iron Man 3 would bring Tony Stark back down to Earth, allowing a more intimate side to be seen and a chance for the supporting characters to finally make their mark.It's certainly more down to Earth, with less of Tony Stark's quick- humour and arrogant prancing (which is what we love him for, especially with Downey Jr.). His new foe would finally be a match for him - not just a man in a different sort of Iron Man suit, but a true criminal mastermind that would meet him physically and mentally, in the same way that Bane smashed Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012). And after the opening third, Tony Stark is simply Tony Stark. His suits have been all but destroyed, his friends are far away, and the prototype escape suit he is left with is damaged almost beyond repair, so even the trusty JARVIS (voiced by Paul Bettany) isn't there to help. He must now use his wits, but without his suit, he is physically and mentally vulnerable, not helped by the pursuing super soldier Savin (James Badge Dale).This is where I find that superhero movies get interesting, when the central character is stripped of all his powers and we see the true man (or woman!) underneath. Yet Stark's task is a rather tedious one, trying to put the pieces together of a relatively simplistic yet clumsily executed central plot with the help of a precocious child (played by Ty Simpkins), who just so happens to have an obsession with engineering. Didn't child sidekicks die out in the early 1990's when film-makers realised that no-one likes them? If it is in fact Shane Black's way to give a nod-and-wink to the audience, then there's not really any call for it. This is not a throwback to buddy movies so in-jokes of the like have no place here.If there's one thing to be said about Black after seeing this, is that he must have balls made of diamonds. Alec Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) certainly would have employed him in real estate. The decision he made regarding the main villain of the story is one that had the comic-book nerds shaking the foundations of their parents' basements, and one that had me appalled. I cannot say much without revealing the twist, but it's a baffling decision, one that would have been rather clever under different circumstances. It leads to Stark's nemesis being just as dull as previous instalments, which have been the main problem with the franchise. Finally we could have had a bad guy up to Christopher Nolan's standards, but it is side-stepped in favour of something all the more familiar.Iron Man 3 is a mixed bag. Action-wise, this is the best so far, with excellent CGI work leading to a thrilling climax which includes an army of iron men suits. But the humour - Black's forte and something that has been spot-on in the first two movies - seems forced and, at times, awkward. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Tony's best friend and frequenter of War Machine, has a larger role, but the chemistry and banter between the two lifelong friends is just not there. They are certainly no Riggs and Murtaugh. It also outstays its welcome, stretching credibility as far as it will go to the point of the ridiculous (since when has Tony Stark been Jason Bourne?), but it is a definite improvement of Iron Man 2 (2010), employing a more interesting internal struggle for Stark than mere daddy issues, and a more satisfying climax. As a whole, Iron Man 3 was undoubtedly a let-down for me, quite shocking given the talent involved, but my eagerness to see the film and my unquenched thirst for superhero movies proves that Marvel's formula still works even if some of their output just isn't up to scratch.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.co.uk","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Acting is good, its more of what we have seen really. Humor is hit and miss, some very funny bits and some that miss the spot. 3D, its OK, nothing that makes you grip the seat. The main issue I have with it is that I don't think they sat down and watched past Iron Man stuff, because in this film the suits seem to be made of tin lol when you watch it you will see what I mean, the guy went toe to toe with Thor and yet....oh wait and see. There are lots of silly errors, most films have them but they spoil it when they standout so much (big cuts that the paramedics seem happy to leave untreated, and nor does the character seem to care) might seem silly to point them out but on such a big film there should be nothing that pulls you out of the film and make you think eg ""why does she"" As it is the film is good but it is easy to score it lower than the first 2, although 2 was not a patch on the 1st one either. Worth seeing but but I hope they get another director/better story next time. 7/10","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

(Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.After the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) ""Iron Man 2"" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's ""more serious"" than ""Iron Man 2,"" it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of ""more seriousness"" is marginal.People say ""Iron Man 3"" plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.The movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.GRADE: C+","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Apart from the Thor franchise these are the two worst Marvel films that I have seen Iron Man 3 starts off well but slowly goes down hill. There is very little chemistry between Cheadle and Downey JR. Cheadle is a very good actor but is not right for Iron Man. Howard was better and its to the detriment of the franchise that Marvel chose to replace him.The film follows on from Iron Man 2 and makes the same mistakes. My car has more security to prevent someone stealing and driving it than your Iron Man suit. The ease in which you are able to modify and fly the Iron Man suit is quite unbelievable considering the difficulties Obadiah Stane had to go through to construct his own suit in Iron Man 1.What they done with some of the film characters divergence away from their comic equivalent was very disappointing.Worse of all in the movie was the spectacular ending, which was a case unbelievable spectacular nonsense.This movie has a lot of action, good moments between Downey Jr and Paltrow but very little sense.

Sadly, that's this film.Robert Downey Jr is ever watchable as always: witty, sharp and devilishly charming. However, the story lends little to help him and I just could not find much to enjoy in it. Maybe there were too many characters this time, plus what was the point of the addition of the wee boy sidekick? It's a faux pas alongside the little guy in Temple of Doom.Guy Pearce is a fine actor but didn't seem to have much real airtime as the villain and then little developed. The story wasn't helping, it was uninteresting, and actually seemed to be little Iron Man but too much Tony Stark. That isn't necessarily bad, but the writers seemed to not know what to do with Tony Stark.Okay, the effects are on par with the previous films and the action is good, but by the time it all kicked off for the finale, I just wasn't into it by this point. I don't want to give much away, but some of it was too clich√©d.Disappointed with this but I know Iron Man will be back on track in some time, and I hope it's the next Avengers movie, plus I hope Downey Jr does reprise his role for more sole Iron Man movies. Despite this film, he has more than proved that he deserves that honour.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Frankly, it doesn't fare any better for the effort. That's partially due to the Tony Stark character hitting a wall - his arc has been stagnant for a while now - but I found more culpability in the icy set of cold feet developed around the plot's halfway point. In the blink of an eye, the whole tone of the picture changes from a topical dash of political intrigue (and a pointed metaphor for the US's approach to terrorism) to just another struggle between Stark and the latest in a long line of bland, suit-wearing, self-enhanced business rivals with an eye on one of his inventions. That the Mandarin is downplayed doesn't necessarily bother me. Actually, I found Ben Kingsley wonderful in the role and enjoyed the sudden wheel-jerk of his change in course (those upset about his blasphemous take on a sacred character need look no further than the short follow-up film All Hail the King for vindication). But that sudden, accompanying leap from a new path to a tired, over-familiar formula is a development sour enough to curl toes. This character needed a blast of fresh air, some momentum to carry him through the next phase of Marvel's plans. Instead, he's simply planted his feet deeper in the same vat of quicksand. Despite all its intentions, it's really no better than Iron Man 2.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This week we made it up to ""Iron Man 3"", which I had to track down on Blu Ray because Disney has made it so hard to rent online.I came to this week's viewing hopeful that this movie would leave me with a better impression than it did when I saw it in the theater two years ago. It's been 22 months, so I didn't remember exactly why I didn't like the movie the first go around--I just remember having the depressing feeling as I was leaving the theater of ""Well, Marvel has officially beat that dead horse into the ground.""Seeing the film the second time didn't do much to improve my opinion. I will say, though, that I feel like I have a bit more of a grasp on why this film just doesn't work than I did when I first saw it in the theater. It all boils down to too much action and not enough story telling. Marvel essentially made this movie in the format of the Transformers movies. Let's dissect that a bit. What does it mean not to have good storytelling in an Iron Man film? Well, in this particular movie the problem is that there's not enough development of certain aspects of the plot. Instead the plot is kind of just thrown at you. Take the Mandarin for example. You don't really get any explanation of the Mandarin before he first appears on screen. All of a sudden the Mandarin's home movie that is taking over every TV set in America flashes up on the TV screen and you're supposed to know who he is. Now, the caveat to that is that it is true that it's easy enough to figure out who the Mandarin is as the movie goes along. It's not that this film leaves you completely in the dark. It's easy enough to follow--but the problem is that it just simply doesn't work as GOOD storytelling. (Although I must say, while up till now I've been speaking about the Mandarin in regard to how the film introduces him to us in this movie--for the comic book fans out there, no spoilers here, but they really did a huge disservice to the Mandarin as this movie goes along...just terrible).Another example of poor storytelling in this film would be the villains along the way who have the uncanny ability to regenerate wounds and also seem to have nuclear reactors built into their guts somehow. When they first appear on screen we're given no indication of who they are or why they have this amazing ability. That wouldn't be a problem if the tension between the initial ignorance and the suspense of wanting to know that was eventually resolved well with a clear cut explanation of what is going on there. But that is never really given. Yes, yes, I got it--I know how they received their powers (I'm trying not to write a spoiler here). I understand completely what accounts for these strange characters. But, again, the problem is not that the audience isn't smart enough to ""get it"". The problem is that even if you do get it, the movie still just doesn't do a good job of telling its story.Then you couple that with the gratuitous, grandiose action scenes, and basically what you have here is a Michael Bay film. The action is just over the top in an extreme way. It's not balanced. There's too much poorly explained story crammed into too little of a chunk of time, with very little cohesive storytelling and too much emphasis on explosions and special effects.All that said, this is one of, if not the, worst movies in the MCU line of films. It's not that the story wasn't good in and of itself--the concept was fine and could have been made into a very good film overall. But it wasn't made into a good film. It was made into ""Iron Man 3"".That being the case, I've given this movie a 5/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it a 4 or a 3. I've given it a 5 just purely based on the fact that I enjoy the characters in the film and the overall concept of the film in spite of everything else I've said in this review. It's watchable in a mediocre, ""that wasn't the best"" kind of way. Fortunately Marvel recovers from this well with its next three films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

How cool would it be if he turned up at your house on Christmas Day and just sat about drinking beer and telling entertaining yarns about Croydon and Ray Winstone... I actually had a long think about this as various iron men outfits fought bad fire people near a boat for about 30 minutes. Finally, I saw a credit and realised it was time to start paying attention - as I had to find the remote and turn the TV off.No I don't read comics so I enjoyed the big thing involving Kingsley. With hindsight (after reading other people's reviews) it seems like a really dumb ass thing to do if you're trying to make a superhero franchise popular. However, Kingsley is still AWESOME in this movie. Don't blame him.So many plot holes here which leave a sour taste. Gwyneth Paltrow is reliably awful and totally miscast as expected - but I get the impression she couldn't really be bothered to try and act in this film - and why should she? The bit with the kid was funny, then the director realised how funny it was and - like so many other bits of this movie - he went overboard and it just got a bit annoying.One thing really annoys me - how come Tony Stark still drives an Audi A8 with an internal combustion engine? As an engineer himself surely he would be aware of it's meagre 11% power efficiency and would have built an Iron Man drive to power it. Maybe he did? If so why didn't he solve a larger world issue and just start making more fuel efficient cars for everyone? He could have based his HQ in Detroit, thus aiding the redevelopment and regeneration of an impoverished area of the country. Hmmm.Little things like this got on my nerves throughout the film, but overall it entertained me until the predictably loud, fighty and explody end which sent it into a final nosedive.In a nutshell - started promisingly, took a gamble, lost direction and veered out of control to become a other pointless waste of moviegoer's time.Watch it ONLY for Ben Kingsley.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The idea is ridiculous, the movies are just glorified violence, with no purpose. The special effects are OK, but the acting is marginal. Over the three movies, the plot is very much repetitive , dull and boring.

Tony Stark is out of the suit most of the movie trying to be a human action hero. Hey, we go to the Iron Man movie to see Iron Man and that involves him in the suit fighting injustice. We see his Iron Man suits (yes, suits plural) break into a million pieces like cheap china. We see Tony Stark having panic attacks. Say what ? The bad guy, Killian (Guy Pierce), gives Tony's girlfriend, Pepper (Gweneth Paltrow), super powers for a short time while Tony Stark watches in amazement. Say what? Tony Stark befriends a 12-year old boy and these scenes didn't make any sense. Attempts at humor fall flat. To be fair Guy Pierce as Killian and Ben Kingsley as Trevor did good.

What a disappointment :( it was the most drab incoherent movie I have seen in years, I have been a massive iron man fan for over 30 years and the first movie was fantastic, then the 2nd came out and again not quite up to the first but really entertaining all the same! Then out came the Avengers and blew my mind so you can see how excited I was at the prospect of the third movie and boy was I disappointed it was mediocre at best I have actually sold the movie on as unlike the other 2 movies I know I will never watch it again it was that bad. I just hope they sort out a new director for the next movie as I won't be taking a risk on the next movie as it is I think I will wait for it to come out as a rental first.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm typically easy to please with movies. I'm one of those people that likes almost every movie I see to the point of annoying people. This movie was horrible bottom of the barrel stupid. The thing that angers me the most is the fact that the previews looked great! If this movie was what the previews pretended it was, I would be giving this movie a 9.

For Iron Man 3, I think Shane Black just used the large amount comic book material he had of the Mandarin, who btw is Ironman's arch nemesis, and just use to wipe his ass.Firstly, I would say that I somewhat enjoyed how they made Tony Stark scared about the prospect of aliens and another world because of his avengers wormhole incident. I also enjoyed that Ben Kingsley, a really well-known and credited actor, was playing the Mandarin. The set up for the Mandarin as just excellent. I liked how they made him really evil and just all round horrible man, with no care for humans.However, my compliments end there because we find out that the 'Mandarin' is just some dumbass named Trevor. I mean seriously? You needed Gandhi for that? And btw if they wanted to go that direction of misleading the audience, then they should've done the same thing from batman begins. Replace one Mandarin with another Mandarin like replace one Ra's Al Ghul with the real Ra's Al Ghul. And many people would argue that Guy Pearce's character said he was the Mandarin. I wouldn't take it as if he meant that he was the Mandarin from the comics with the ten rings and all. I would take it as if he meant that he was responsible for all the threats and attacks not the useless Trevor. Another complaint I have is that Tony Stark wasn't smart in this movie as he is normally is. We are told in the film that he is smart but he made so many stupid decisions like: 1. Giving his address to the enemy 2. Not knowing that there is a missile flying towards his mansion until he sees it on the news. 3. Not using his 42 Iron man suits against those helicopters shooting at his house 4. And only using his 42 Iron man suits on an oil tanker (yeah that's safe) 5. Making Iron man suits that crumple like tin foil but apparently can withstand Thor's Hammer? (Technically inconsistency in the storyline) 6. The president not using the Iron Patriot suit to fly to safety when he is hung(technically the president's idiocy) or not having JARVIS remotely fly the suit to safety. To be honest, the only point to this film is that Iron Man is a major source of income to Disney Marvel and they need a way to continue from the avengers. So those who want to watch this film....don't watch it. Just don't watch it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There are a ton of 4 letter words who's use isn't just bad, but they are used in bad ways making it worse than just normal curse words.

At the time this came out, I don't think anyone knew, including Marvel, how the phases would play out. This film, however, doesn't do much to further the main plot arc.Tony Stark is losing his mind. He's not sleeping. He's experimenting with the Iron Man armor, reaching 42 models in record time. All of this to escape the trauma of nearly dying during the battle of New York. It's nice to see that the filmmakers continued Marvel's tradition of showing the human side of comic book action. However, it doesn't stay very interesting.You see, back during Y2K, Tony was approached by a man that appeared very unstable, trying to pitch an idea for Advanced Idea Mechanics. This leads into the film adaptation of the Extremis story published in the comic books back in 2005. The Ten Rings are brought back into the story from the first Iron Man, and the Mandarin, also from the comics, is introduced.But then, it gets, well, dumb. A conspiracy cooked up to mess up the US Government, topple Tony Stark as petty revenge, kidnap and experiment on Pepper, and nearly kill Happy, happens in a haphazard way bringing characters together that make no sense. A lot of things are not as they seem, and there really is no resolution.Stan Lee judges a random beauty contest, which was cute, but it didn't fit. Tony has his shrapnel removed, sleeps again, and appears to destroy all the Iron Man suits. What? It's like this movie wrapped up his storyline and he was supposed to go away.Also Rhodes becomes Iron Patriot instead of War Machine, because changing names really matters. I know that actually happened, and it's not the movie's fault, but still.I will finish by saying this was only the 3rd time I've seen this movie, and I can never remember what it's about when I start it up. That should tell you something. I believe that this movie is forgettable and unnecessary. I know the next Thor movie in the phase has a similar reputation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's fun to watch. So is the supporting cast. Without him, or them, this flick would've been pretty bad. Whomever writes the script outlines and decided on the FX (which are well rendered for what they are) should be fired. The movie meanders, trying hard to please everyone, and winds up proving the old adage. I call it script writing by demographics--you have to throw in a scene to appeal to every category of movie-goer, no matter how little sense it makes or how it affects the flow. It also seems they promise a certain amount of screen time to every actor/actress to get them to sign.The FX are conceptually over the top, especially in the climactic scene. It seems that in FX-driven movies, there's an arms race to see who can create the most ridiculous, outlandish material. Only a ten-year old would be impressed. It's getting so obvious that the FX are becoming a distraction rather than an enhancement.Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the movie--for the most part. As I said, there were interesting characterizations and quite a few fun bits. But I found the ending trite, unsatisfying, and hypocritical.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The biggest problem that people have with this movie seems to be an awful representation of the main villain. This particular aspect is bad in its own right, but, honestly, I think this movie's problem go far beyond that specific gripe that people have. My problem with this failure of film is its defective writing, poor conceptualization, dull characters, inconsistent tone, lack of intelligence and thematic integrity. Iron Failure 3 is as superficial and trivial as you can get. Depth in this movie is non- existent. Character motivation is flat. The characters themselves are poorly written cardboard figures with no personality. There is no stakes and no tension. Everything is paint by numbers and generic. As for the controversial miss-handling of the main villain, which many defenders of this movie have described as an act of brilliancy, because it had some imaginary message behind it, I have my opinion on that.The only hidden message that this movie gave us, is that Shane Black should never again direct another comic book movie. I guess people think about that meaningless plot-point too much. Iron Man 3 is not a Dark Knight, when you can write a book about all the subliminal meanings behind the film. Iron Man 3 is a cookie-cuter, generic, uninventive schlock. Maybe the idea behind this ""hidden message"" looked good in a concept, but the execution is what kills any potential for this to be taken seriously. It's like with the Prometheus, which had great ideas, but the execution of those ideas was flat and dull. Iron Man 3 was even worse than that. I am fully aware, as a few other people with actual brain cells, that this cheap option was not executed well and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have.Iron Man 3 is generic, cheesy, poorly written mess with no actual depth. If Shane Black, who is definitely not someone who has brilliant writing and directing skills, intended to mock the perception of terrorism in society, he would have an entire film dedicated on exploration of that. But he's too dumb and generic to actually make something good out of that concept. People are giving simply some generic excuses for the fact that Shane Black did very poor execution with the story and the conceptuality of the film (which it didn't really had).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","It's a substantially weaker film than its two predecessors.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8442871/?ref_=tt_urv","filipemanuelneto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53053227/?ref_=tt_urv","14 August 2022","After two frankly good films, I was curious to see what this film would bring to the public, who immediately set out to fill the studio's coffers with their tickets money. Marvel has discovered an excellent financial lode by transposing most of its characters to the cinema, and this film is destined to be a box office success, although the quality is much more questionable.I'll start with what I usually leave for last: the technical aspects and production values are really excellent and constitute the strongest and most solid point of the film. Directed by Jon Favreau, who has held his chair since the first ""Iron Man"", the film has retained most of the crew and core cast, which helps give the trilogy the flavor of a unique work. With a solid bet on more flashy, loud and spectacular action, the film wants to appeal to a young audience that wants something big, where CGI and effects can create authenticity and a sense of danger. The quality of the effects is undeniable, but the excessive action takes a toll on the final set. It looks like a video game, a recurring mistake in these types of movies.In addition, the film has good cinematography, it was beautifully shot, it is sharp, and it has excellent colors and light. The work of the stuntmen is meritorious, yet regularly forgotten in the minds of viewers. The sets and costumes are very good, especially Tony Stark's house and the various armors from the movie. Another word for the soundtrack, by Dwight Yoakim, which proved to be up to the task without, however, proving to be memorable.The cast includes most of the names we already know from the previous two films, with Robert Downey Jr. The most relevant for maintaining the leading role. The actor is good, deserves our credit, and I recognize that he tried to give his character a greater maturity and sense of experience. In this film, Stark is a much more mature, traumatized, tired and even fragile man, and his relationship with Pots has become more formal and firm, causing the former playboy to settle down and carry on a serious love relationship. I understand that this may displease some, but the film seems to take place several years after its predecessor, ""Iron Man 2"", and makes mention of several events, in the meantime. With excellent technical work and the use of excellent makeup artists, Ben Kingsley shone in the role he was given and which is clearly one of the best of his recent career. Paltrow and Cheadle also leave us a positive record of his work, although it wasn't as intense as one would expect. Favreau, in addition to directing the film, has a brief funny cameo as Happy. But it's Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall we should be worried about: they do what they can, and yet the film didn't give them much of a chance to do more and better.The biggest problem with this movie is, of course, the plot and writing of the script, dialogues and scenes. Attempts at comedy are very unpleasant, and Stark, who once had almost a barrage of phrases and jokes for all occasions, is now a serious and weary man. The material given to the actors is scarce and does not bring anything really good. In addition, the film has almost no connection with the previous films, and especially ""Iron Man 2"", whose events are never really spoken by anyone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Iron Man 1 was funny and intelligent. It had action and a story line that any interested 12 year old could follow and maybe even learn a bit about how truly nasty evil can be. As an adult I found the arms dealer gets a conscience exploration compelling. But in 3 we get something that seems to want to insult adults that go and see ""childrens"" films, and which manages to insult the 12 years olds as well ! I remember being an intelligent 12 year old, looking back I knew and instinctively perceived much more than I was given credit for. 3 seems to revel in insulting anyone who even took a passing interest in reading a comic as if none of the material really matters. I know its ""just a film"", but this is a film that made millions upon millions ! Why ? I don't understand why it was not a huge financial flop.

They were flashy, techy, exciting and even funny at times. With Robert Downey Junior in the title role, the producers had the perfect fit for not only the Iron Man but also the wise-cracking playboy millionaire inventor behind the mask.This third outing though is a big let down. The plot is a mess, with Guy Pearce hamming it up as a sort of meta-human Terminator 2, out to humiliate the U.S. via the kidnap of their president, using another super-villain The Mandarin as the medium to initially spread fear and panic amongst the general public with various Bin Laden type terrorist actions. Unfortunately for America and naturally the free world, Iron Man is between costumes and not operating at full strength so that even with the assistance of the similarly-powered War Machine / Iron Patriot, he's pushed to his limits in the expected mayhem-inducing final battle between the two.So what has gone wrong? For one thing Iron Man doesn't appear in armour very much in the film (although his previous prototypes come to the rescue by the end) - I don't know, maybe Downie Junior wanted more face-time on screen. The suit-on, suit-off routine is greatly overdone and the in-suit commentaries, this time by two costumed heroes, grate too, while the climactic battle would be more properly termed an anti-climactic battle. The idea of Ben Kingsley's Wizard of Oz-like Mandarin doesn't serve the character well and by now Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts character is very irritating too. Worst of all there are two awkward and embarrassing condescensions to the comic-fan base and I guess target cinema-audience too as Downey Junior is forced into cringe-worthy, humourless scenes with a savvy pre-teen kid and later an adult nerd-fan in a van. With an incessant, booming, rock soundtrack just to round things off, I saw this in the end as a poorly written, routinely filmed and ultimately empty blockbuster which doesn't bode well for future entries in the franchise.Time to get out the WD40, methinks.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

When this film was first released, I was on the negative side. I was young and wanted action, action, and more action. But over time this film has grown for me, and on the positive side. This is a character piece and a strong one of that. It's a film that takes risks and a film where Downey is at his best as this iconic character within the MCU and comic book fandom.
POSITIVES
Something to admire about this plot is that it takes the character in a different and welcomed direction. Tony Stark is as important of a character as Iron Man and to have him and his powerful mind being the draw and the lead was very entertaining. This goes into the writing of this character and their story. The path the film takes is very interesting and faces the repercussions of the Battle of New York. This helps to maintain this shared universe and not have them be offbeat stories. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible in this role and he takes this character and performance to new heights. Yes, there is the sarcastic humour that the character is known for, but there is some real and powerful emotion that the actor develops in his face alone. Downey still maintains that incredible and natural chemistry with his co-stars and that elevates their performances as well. For what Ben Kingsley does in the role of The Mandarin, he is very entertaining. Shane Black takes over the director's chair and he does a very good job. The film has its different tone, but still has that ""realistic"" quality that Favreau set up in the first two films. Some very good visual effects that come with the Iron Man sequences. What they do with the multiple Iron Man suits in this film was so fun and helped ground the film in the comic book realm. Anyone that knows the character knows about the multiple armours that the character creates. The sound design that I've praised before is still present in this film. Along with new sounds that are strong. This is the first film, in the Iron Man franchise, that has a great and memorable score from Brian Tyler. And overall the film is fun. It has its humour and engaging action sequences, but also, a lot of heart.
NEGATIVES!
The main negatives I have with this film involve the villains. Even though this film was released in 2013, no spoilers. What the film does with the character of The Mandarin I am mixed on. It upsets comic book fans but makes sense in the narrative of the film. My main negative is the story of Aldrich Killian and Guy Pearce's performance. I mean, 1. it's Syndrome from Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles. 2. it's boring. Pearce gives a portrayal of a cynical villain that has been done before and all the ""humour"" that the character/actor tries to deliver falls flat. Not once is this villain threatening or memorable.
CONCLUSION!
So, Iron Man 3 gets a bad rep and it doesn't deserve it. I am kind of a hypocrite since I have ridiculed this film in the past, but I've grown and so has my appreciation for this film. If you are looking for an MCU film that is not-stop action, I can't see you enjoying this Iron Man instalment, but if you are looking for a superhero film that takes risks with its material and character, then I suggest you check out Iron Man 3.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 3 is a best comic adaptation worthy to follow the greatness known as The Avengers. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. The sequel advanced the character of Tony Stark while setting up Avengers quite nicely. Iron Man 3 goes beyond even that and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity, drama and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 3 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle's Rhodey was certainly an upgrade over his role in the second film. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner featuring the great dialogue that we all now expect from Marvel films. It's witty and uses the perfect use of humor yet again although this is by far the darkest film in the trilogy. The plot features advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style scenes and slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best number three movie ever made. Yes, better than Return of the King. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I consider this film the best of the series simply because it takes risks. Yes there are changes notable changes. That differ largely from the comics version. The Fact is the changes made in this film only serve to make it better. There were major changes in The Avengers film and Captain America and Thor. Yet those changes only served to make the film better. The story this time around is After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is falling apart. He can't sleep and suffers panic attacks. The Events of the battle of New York and his trip into the alien dimension and the fact that he died. All of these things weigh heavily on him. Tony spends his time making more Iron Man Armor. Pepper is still CEO of Stark industries and Tony's best friend and one time body guard Happy Hogan is now head of security. Happy is paranoid of every new face, When Aldrich Killian meets with Pepper to show off his company's new break through a virus he calls Extremis. Extremis can map the brain and fill in the gaps and improve on them. One of the ways Extremis works is it can take the body's healing process and magnify it by a hundred times making the body heal itself at a rapid pace. More then that there are other ways Extermis can make itself useful. The film after the introduction of Extremis and Killian goes into overdrive It has twists and turns and spectacular stunts. But most of all it has a story . One that leaves you guessing. Sure it's Not the comic book. But where does it say that it has to reproduce the comic book down to the last detail. The Character of the Mandarin is the biggest dividing factor here. At one point I could see why true fans are upset. and on the other side I was thinking what a original take on the character. Iron Man 3 won't win any Oscars. but in the entertainment side of things it does that wonderfully. the one thing that surprised me and made me enjoy it more was more Tony Stark and less Iron Man. This film puts Tony Stark into a James Bond type of adventure. Shane Black breathes new life into the Golden Avenger. And while I loved Faverou's take on Iron Man. I didn't miss his touch on this one at all. that doesn't mean I didn't like Faverou that's far from the truth I loved his Faverou's take on Iron Man very much. Iron Man 3 has a different tone and a different feel to it making it the best in the series. And that's not bad. It makes me want to see how Iron Man 4 and Avengers II are going to turn out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes, it's past time for a mere ""comic book movie"" to be taken seriously. I know it's May but the Academy has to recognize this remarkable movie. If LOTR: Return of the King can win, so can this film. The action/fantasy bigotry from the Academy may be at an end.Honestly, Iron Man 3 is ten times a better all around film than something like District 9 or Life of Pi. When Roger Ebert called for Spider-Man 2 to be nominated for best picture no one listened. Well, times are a changing. Iron Man 3 is the kind of movie that delivers both quality and entertainment. Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see Robert Downey Jr. nominated again this time for Tony Stark. He deserved the honor back in 2008. Great performances by some of Oscar's old guard (RDJr, Gwenyth, Cheadle, Kingsley) plus an intelligent and thrilling movie with a mix of complex character strife equals gold in my book and most people's book. Hopefully, Oscar gold as well.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The links to the mastermind points back to the white-house in the movie, so the movie is sorta telling you that. It also hints that you should research Wernher Von Braun and you will find his warnings to his assistant Carol Rosin about the false alien Invasion threat to be used as excuse to weaponize space. Let's face it, 9 out of 10 people are going to compare the Mandarin to Osama. By such simple correlation, you must be daft not to see that the movie is trying to tell you who the real 911 culprits are.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Unique, Interesting and Entertaining to the MAX","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2788254/?ref_=tt_urv","Kia00","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6143489/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2013","I really love this movie because it's so unique. The ""cool"" factor is still there but there's a twist and depth I didn't see coming. How Tony deals with his form of post-traumatic stress after the events of Avengers is actually dealing with it in a way you've never seen from a superhero. Tony is motivated to do better when he realizes that he's not a god; just a genius in a suit, trying to up his game. He has always thought of himself as top dog and knew he was a narcissist. Now, the notion that he has encountered beings and situations that make him feel small plays big as the movie starts. He has been to space/another dimension, nearly gotten killed by crazed aliens, met a god that can throw lightning bolts and smash him across the forest with a hammer, has encountered a legend that his father used to talk about that lives up to the legend. His confidence is shaken and has diminished. He knows true fear and he feels like, unless he can build the perfect man through armor and technology, he's going to be outdone and overwhelmed. Fury perfectly pointed it out in Avengers when he said, ""We are hilariously, hopelessly outgunned."" This is where the movie gets really interesting. There's a reason why he's building armor and why he's much more comfortable when he's in the suit. Those suits are taken away from him. He's just a man and he can't possibly compete at the level the world and events in this movie now demand. That is the impetus for the entire story. Strip down the character, rip everything off him and leave him ""naked"" against these incredible forces. Without the armor, The Avengers or his resources, the man must find the strength from within himself, especially within his mind. A lot of this exceptional journey is Tony learning to become Tony Stark again outside the armor. It's an amazing and refreshing direction they choose to take. His emotional response is believable and is appropriate. Sure the action is as good as it gets but that character depth and grounded behavior is the heart of this film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Iron Man 3 = movie of the year !","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2798581/?ref_=tt_urv","scotts863","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5327796/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2013","As this century started, who would have thought that a comic book film would be the best movie produced in its first two dozen years or so??? A serious case could be made that Iron Man 3 is one of three or four comic based films that now hold the title of best film of the new millennium. After everyone sees it, those with an open mind will acknowledge that Iron Man 3 can seriously claim a stake to owning that title for now. What has to be the movie of the year, Iron Man 3 will be considered the best of the ""third"" films by a large margin. Good luck to other films releasing this summer as they try and match the quality of Iron Man 3, they'll need it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","A Welcome Improvement Over Its Predecessor!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3209758/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","28 March 2015","Marking the commencement of the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe after the first one culminated with The Avengers, Iron Man 3 presents a definite improvement over its insufferably boring predecessor but it still falls short of the magical experience that was the first Iron Man film. However, it does carry a new energy & has a refreshing vibe to it, thanks to the new director at helm.Iron Man 3 continues the story of Tony Stark who's recovering from post-traumatic stress caused by the events of The Avengers. Unable to sleep & genuinely afraid of losing what he loves, Stark's life is turned upside down after he issues a threat to a radical terrorist who retaliates by destroying his personal world, leaving him far more vulnerable than ever before & forcing him to rebuild from the scratch.Co-written & directed by Shane Black, Iron Man 3 really benefits from a fresh perspective & is an enjoyable ride for the most part but it is also marred by its attempt to try out way too many things at once, out of which only a few work out in a convincing manner. Technical aspects are finely executed for its Cinematography favours a slightly darker tone, Editing steadily paces its narrative while Brian Tyler's adds more vibrancy to it.Coming to the performances, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley & Rebecca Hall join the reprising cast & ably fill up their given roles while Robert Downey Jr. once again manages to impress the most. The best thing about this sequel is the position it puts Tony Stark in & Downey Jr. does a terrific job in bringing that vulnerability on the screen. Also, while I was a bit furious at what they did with Iron Man's arch-nemesis, I did later warm up to what their intent was here.On an overall scale, Iron Man 3 is a solid follow up to Iron Man & you don't even have to go through the crap that was Iron Man 2 to get to this one. The film's intent to cover the darker issues at hand while keeping itself light-hearted & plenty of fun is a combination that never gels so well, is at friction on many occasions & is bound to divide its viewers, but its improvement over everything that was so wrong with its predecessor nevertheless makes it a welcome chapter, if not a worthy one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
