"7","/10","Good conclusion to the series, same problems as the 2nd","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1663767/?ref_=tt_urv","tough_guy007","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3411445/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2007","AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.Just my thoughts ...","183 out of 256 found this helpful.

Gore Verbinski)After losing Jack Sparrow to the locker of Davy Jones, the team of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Barbossa make their final alliances with the pirate world to take on the forces of Lord Cutler Beckett and his crew, including Davy Jones, who he now has control over. It's not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.It's often a sad time for me, when i see a trilogy come to an end. There are so many great characters that you really do start to miss them. Unfortunately, trilogies always seem to have the problem are living up to the previous movies. 'At World's End' falls into this category. The characters are great as always with Geoffrey Rush bringing Barbossa back to life as much as he did in the first movie. The special effects are amazing again, with some beautiful crafted fight sequences and Davy Jones looking even more realistic. The music is fun again but disappointing compared to the first two films. The main problem with this film is the story. It's not the most easy to follow story and can really make you think for a bit. Still, the third 'Pirates' movie is a roller-coaster of a movie.""Do you fear death?"" - Davy Jones (Bill Nighy)","12 out of 14 found this helpful.

The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique.","263 out of 423 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1662318/?ref_=tt_urv","andydreamseeker","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14903565/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2007","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the third and last of the money spinning trilogy, or so they say. Everything has led to this, or so they say again and I kept my mind opened. The first of the Pirates series, The Curse of the Black Pearl was good. It was a movie out of nothing or more correctly a movie inspired by nothing more than a Disney theme park ride. Having said that however the creation of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of inspirational. Captain Jack played by the charismatic Johnny Depp became the talisman of Pirates of the Caribbean. Thought to be dead when we saw him charging into the jaws of monster octopus Kraken toward the end of Dead Man's Chest (the sequel), he is to be brought back from the dead in this latest film.I have to be honest; I hated Dead Man's Chest. Its various plots and subplots were terribly tangled and confusing. It was hard to follow what sort of story or motives the movie wants to say. I blamed my lack of understanding for not comprehending Dead Man's Chest. That was summer of last year but since then I have done my research, for the billion dollars making movie was to have a third installment. Having seen one and two, I have to see three. But if I do not understand two then how can I go ahead with three. And so after a better understanding of two I saw three. You should know this. For all my efforts I was still robbed by the pirates.I was led happily out into the open sea before being robbed. I was enjoying the first third of the 168 minutes film. Captain Jack's crew arrived in Singapore to look for Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fatt), pirate lord of the South China Sea for a ship and a map, so they could sail to world's end and rescue our favourite captain from Davy Jones's Locker. Davy Jones's Locker is a ghost realm of the netherworld where the dead Captain Jack Sparrow is being kept for eternity.There appears to be some oriental influence in At World's End. Firstly of course we are introduced to a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng. Secondly, the costumes and all were very well designed in an exquisite oriental fashion. And there was Singapore, a South East Asian country where Captain Sao Feng can be found.The Singapore set features a bathhouse and I couldn't help relating it to Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. The popular animated film, released by Disney in the west has a bathhouse theme. The relation did not stop there, and I wondered if the scene where Captain Jack Sparrow is isolated in Davy Jones's Locker was inspired too by Hayao Miyazaki's work. The part where thousands of strange and curious yet harmless rounded stone-like crab helping Jack move his ship, The Black Pearl across a desert aroused my attention to this perspective. It was through the hands, eyes and imagination of the acclaimed animation master, Hayao Miyazaki that made famous the approach of detailing stories with thousands of mini little intriguing creatures. And it was fun to watch.I was enjoying At World's End, laughing merrily at all the pirate jokes that the characters are lashing out at one another, feeling the thrill of the sword-fights and of course attracted to the sometimes witty, looney and mad character of Captain Jack Sparrow. That scene of him engaging himself to his many different personalities while alone in the deserted Davy Jones's Locker is a real gem.But with all the oriental influences, the filmmakers probably did not take note of the teachings of Zen, where less is truly more. For when after the crew rescued Captain Jack Sparrow and brought him back to the mortal world, it all happened again. The tangling and confusing plots and subplots manifested once more and killed whatever is good about the film. In my opinion, if At World's End had ended after rescuing Captain Jack and had a straight approach in the gathering of forces to deal with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with a fitting spectacle of a finale fight, the film would have been great.I was trying to understand the story. In reflection I probably should not for it amounted to nothing. It just isn't worth it. It would be tiring for me just to list them all out. So just be warned that in the film, every character have their own personal agenda. It is ""me"" first and ""you"" later if ""you"" are still there. If that is the purpose of the story-writers to represent the meaning of how pirates are, then they have succeeded. In fact it was so successful that they lost me.It bored me so much I no longer laughed at the jokes. It dragged on so long I no longer felt compelled to see the ending. I just want the film to end there and then. Enough was enough.""Take whatever you can and give nothing back."" Thanks a billion, filmmakers, or is it thanks me instead?This entire Pirate series is like a ride on a pirate ship in a theme park, it was thrilling for a start but as it swing back and forth too many times the nauseas will come and when it stops you find yourself displaced nowhere.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a fine example of a good film gone bad because it had too many tangling tales to tell. I maintain that it is worth watching for the first third of the film but save yourself from seasickness in the middle just so you can enjoy the spectacular fight sequence toward the end.","175 out of 324 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant...

So to apply this metaphor to the world of cinema, once a film franchise delivers a poor entry, it's almost impossible to not deliver poor ones from then on out. So, imagine the surprise when, after the lackluster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, that screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio and director Gore Verbinski are able to deliver a superior third entry in the Pirates series with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It is hardly perfect, still far too long and lacking in emotional depth, but for a summer spectacle, it still manages to deliver the goods to a degree.At World's End opens not long after Dead Man's Chest, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) joining forces with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' locker, where he was dragged to by the Kraken at the conclusion of the last film. While they are on their way to the afterlife, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), has exerted his influence over Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and is using him to bring the pirates of the world to their knees. With their very existence on the line, the pirate lords meet to discuss the possibility of joining forces to combat Beckett, but since these are pirates, there is a wide variety of skullduggery and backstabbing to be had.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is rife with dazzling visuals. As with both previous films, At World's End has spent it's almost-certainly astronomical budget on what actually goes on the screen. The sets, costumes, and stunning visual effects are impressive, to say the least. You might be excused for actually believing that what you are seeing is real at times, not just movie trickery. The make-up artists have also once again proved that they can be the go to guys for the creation of unappealing looking characters, as almost no one in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End looks like they have taken a bath or brushed their teeth, well, ever, which, in this case, seems to work for the film. If you want to see a visually spectacular motion picture, especially on the big screen, you need look no further than At World's End.On the other hand, if you are interested in depth to go along with the glittery outside, then At World's End will prove to be somewhat lacking, although not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. The key problem to this film is that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of what makes them up is played out again without much added to the proceedings from the previous entries: Jack wants everything for himself, Barbossa wants what Jacks wants also, Will wants Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants, seemingly, to be a pirate. Frankly, it's a bit sad that the character with one of the best emotional arcs in the film is one of its villains, Davy Jones, who has an almost touching degree of pathos added to him thanks to a scene about halfway through the film. Perhaps it is the film's never ending attempt to keep the audience uncertain where the various characters loyalties lie that also works against the audiences' identification with almost anyone. When it seems that everyone is out only for themselves, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for them.The film's cardinal sin, as has been the case with every Pirates entry thus far, is its bloated length. At World's End does not have nearly the lopsided running time to substance ratio that Dead Man's Chest did, but it still overstays it's welcome. Much like fellow summer blockbuster Spider-Man 3, the filmmakers seem to believe that bigger is better, and that is sometimes just not the case. In the film's defense, there is quite of bit of plot to fill the minutes, but it could have still been trimmed back to some degree while maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, the entertainment value.That being said, At World's End still manages a few surprises, and the ending does pay off much of what has gone before, and even though the ""love"" between Elizabeth and Will seems almost non-existent, a key scene at the end on a beach does manage to be effective. The actors also generally deliver once again. Johnny Depp is entertaining as ever as Jack Sparrow, although he finds the screen time a bit split amongst the various other characters this outing. Depp seems to be having a good time in the role, and it's hard to not understand his public statements that he would be willing to go more rounds as the character. Rush is also effective as Barbossa and Keira Knightley shows a bit more energy than in the last entry, as does Orlando Bloom in the part of Will.So, what began as a seemingly bad idea (a Disney theme park ride turned into a summer film) has concluded three films later with one of biggest displays of blockbuster film-making, in terms of scope, as has been seen in recent years. That the spectacle isn't quite in service of an appropriate amount of core material is disappointing, but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is hardly a loss. It provides a decent amount of entertainment, buckets of eye candy and a good laugh here and there. While filmmakers should perhaps aspire to more, what they manage deliver isn't half bad. I suppose that might sound like damning with faint praise, but you just have to call them as you see them.","115 out of 213 found this helpful.

Now so far this May, the sequels have been disappointing, excluding 28 Weeks Later, they're just not as good as the originals or their sequels. When I asked my friend how Pirates 3 was, she said it was a major disappointment, oh, man, that got me nervous, since her and I have virtually the same taste in movies. But my mom and I wanted to see this film still, just see what it was about, and I have to say that I actually enjoyed this film more that what I was lead to believe it was.OK, I'm not sure how to explain the plot, since there is so much to say, but I'm going to give it a shot. Will and Elizabeth's relationship is on the rocks since Elizabeth has not told anyone that she was the cause of Jack's death. Jack is needed to help Will get his father back, so he and the crew bring back Jack from Davy Jone's locker. The English Command has hung everyone in the town who has done anything to do with pirates, and are out to kill every last one of the pirates. Captain Barbossa is back and he is in a fight with Jack on who is captain of the ship. Traitors reveal themselves into the biggest pirate battle you'll ever see! I hope that helps somewhat, there are a lot of stories to follow in this film. But it has great acting, superb effects, and terrific stories. There are a few ridicules moments that are unbelievable, but I think that if you just relax and give the movie a break, you may find yourself having a lot of fun in this great sequel. It was a great ending to the story, the only story I didn't like how they ended it was the story between Will and Elizabeth, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. But please just give this movie a break, it's really great when you give it a chance.9/10","29 out of 34 found this helpful.

Dead Mens Chest was enjoyable and lively, if overlong. At World's End is certainly not a terrible film, far from it, I just found it rather disappointing that's all, plot-wise being the least remarkable of the three films. I will say there is a lot to recommend it, namely the art direction, and the special effects weren't too bad either. The cinematography was impressive, there is some lovely period detail and I thought there were some very well staged battle sequences. The music by Hans Zimmer, one of my favourite film composers, was outstanding, very rousing and dramatic. And the performances weren't so bad either- Jack Sparrow is still the lovable rogue we have come to know and love, and Johnny Depp played him marvellously. A very talented actor, Geoffrey Rush, sinks his teeth into the part of Captain Barbosa, I particularly loved the line, ""I'm a bit busy at the moment."" And Bill Nighy was delightfully villainous as Davy Jones. However, the film does have flaws that prevents it from being the rollicking film it had the potential of being. The plot did take a while to get going, and sometimes became unfocused and convoluted, like Elizabeth and Will declaring their wedding vows in the middle of a big fight. Also there are a lot of characters, and one or two of them served no real purpose to the plot, and a lot was crammed into the long running time, so at the end of the day, it felt a bit bloated. The script was full of existing jokes, not necessarily a bad thing, but overall it lacked freshness, and the humour and fun, that made me love the first film so much. Overall, it is certain performances, fantastic music and some well-staged battles that salvage an otherwise bloated and disappointing second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

As far as the final battle rivaling that of the LOTR trilogy, I would say no. This trilogy will go down as one of the great trilogies. Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better.

I own the DVD and regularly play it on movie nights with my friends. It's great unexpected fun, quotable, and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.The problem with the third movie (as well as the second) is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie, while heavy with the supernatural stuff, was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top, yes, but still believable, and above all, relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense (i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will, Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse, Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom). Unfortunately, in the new movies, the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher, much less remember, a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good, solid story.I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the ""grand spectacle"" stuff which really dominated the movies.","578 out of 949 found this helpful.

You're going to love for its special effects better and better from the first chapter of the trilogy (the final battle is a masterpiece!), and because in this movie there's fun, a lot of fun: jack/johnny is irresistible, Barbossa is a great pirate and all the crew (pintel and ragetti over every other one) is hilarious.

I might have ranked this higher, but it's too long at 169 minutes (almost three hours) .....way too long. Two hours would have been more than enough for this fantasy-adventure film. After that, I found myself getting bored with too much action and much of the same things I had already seen for two hours.What I really appreciated in this movie was all the humor. I expected decent special-effects and diverse characters. There are a number of good laughs in here and they are provided by a variety of people, not just Johnny Depp as ""Capt. Jack Sparrow."" Even the parrot gets several laughs in here.Since the entire cast was still intact, I was more interested in seeing some new faces and I really enjoyed Chow Yun-Fat whose major contributions came in the beginning of the film. Why he basically left after the opening part, I don't know, and the movie suffered for it. Mostly the film features a bunch of familiar people, none of whom we can predict what they'll do next. One minute they are good guys; the next minute, the bad guys. Unfortunately, that makes the story confusing in parts. So - if you got lost a few times, don't feel bad. It's understandable.The only character who rubbed me the wrong way was the too politically-correct and almost insulting role of ""Elizabeth Swann,"" played by Keira Knightley. Why do filmmakers insist on giving us the pretty girls-who-beat up-all-the-men roles? It's so stupid. Overnight she becomes a super-skilled swordsman? Please, movie makers: stop giving us Rambo with makeup and cleavage! Let women be women and men be men!Also, I wanted a high seas pirate adventure story, not some voodoo theology mumbo-jumbo, which took up too much of this story. What was this: Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter? At times, it resembled more of the latter.Geoffrey Rush as ""Captain Barbossa"" was the most interesting person in the film, in my opinion. He was terrific in every scene. Depp is always good, but I missed hearing him say, ""Savvy?"" He didn't say it once!Overall, fun but overdone. Savvy?","16 out of 26 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Despite its many flaws, the movie still left me hungry for more.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1661128/?ref_=tt_urv","Boba_Fett1138","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1416505/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2007","The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch. It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best because of the reason that it's simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie. The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it's CGI. Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn't bother most people, unless you're a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.Still, I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","433 out of 715 found this helpful.

"7","/10","More enjoyable than I imagined, but still not as fun as the first film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1662351/?ref_=tt_urv","DonFishies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1622466/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2007","As much as I was hyped up for it last summer, I am still in disbelief over how disappointed I was when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I had bought advanced tickets, was in a packed and cheering theatre, and still managed to fall asleep from boredom. It was so disheartening, but I still enjoyed it for the most part. Unfortunately, on repeat viewings, I cannot say I have been so generous, but nonetheless, looked forward to the next film, At World's End anyway. And while it does the job a lot better than Chest, I cannot help but think that they really dropped the ball hard after the first film.End picks up a short while after Chest with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and the rest of the usual crew in Singapore. They meet with the revered pirate lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), in an attempt to acquire the maps to Davy Jones' locker, where they hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is planning the extinction of all pirates, and is using Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) to help with the job.Of course, anyone who has seen the trailer or know anything about the movie can predict what comes from here, and sadly, this is where the film loses a lot of steam. Running just short of three hours, the film packs a lot in, and pads a lot of itself out. Whereas Chest was just a whole lot of build up to nothing, End does build to something, but that something just does not feel as well planned out as it wants to be. Through all of the action, double, triple and quadruple crossings, and all of the laughs, the film just feels very drawn out for no reason but to stretch itself out longer. With the number one complaint of the series thus far being the length of the films, you would have thought a real editor would have come along and chopped out the useless stuff and left just the meaty bits. But unfortunately, this is not the case, and yet again, the viewer has to sift through a vast amount of material where a lot of nonsensical drivel (like numerous useless scenes featuring copies of Jack Sparrow) overtakes actually useful elements.Where the film does do much better than Chest, is in its focus. While the latter was jumping all over the place, this film actually stays on course for the most part. It is a lot easier to follow, and despite some of the already listed issues, feels like a stronger film. But this comes at the price of basically throwing out almost everything that Chest brought to the franchise. All of those numerous subplots? Only a few are answered, and are answered in such simplistic fashion that they should not have even been questions in the first place. All the ones that are not? They are basically left to rot, and in a way, make Chest feel like a totally useless experience minus the final five minutes. It feels like a total cheat, and while it does not effect this film (in fact, it really enriches what is here), it totally kills anything the previous film had left going for it.And with the subplots getting underused, so too are the new characters. The mysterious Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) does next to nothing, and when the big reveal as to the purpose of her character comes, she ends up feeling like a waste of time (if you can even understand what she is saying). Much the same goes for 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), Hollander's Cutler Beckett, and Yun-Fat's Sao Feng. They clearly had something to offer the last film (and Yun-Fat in this film), but here, do a few things, and then not much else. Even the astonishing performance from Nighy as Davy Jones is neglected here, taking away much of what made him such a great character in Chest. Even older characters like Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Swann are pointless, as they get next to no screen time at all.Thankfully, Depp is even better than he was in Chest. He feels a bit overshadowed again, but his role is still as amusing and often bizarre as ever. At least here he actually seems like he is trying to do something new, instead of just aping his original performance. Bloom and Knightley are strong, and much more independent this go around, adding a great deal of needed emotion to their roles. Rush however, comes out on top of everyone. His over-the-top performance of Barbossa proves to be exactly what Chest was sorely missing. He steals every scene he is in, and breathes new life into the demented character. The rest of the crew, in all of their tiny roles, all help with some much needed humour to help liven up how dark it becomes at times (as a small cameo by a very make-up heavy Keith Richards).But for all of what it does so much better (the special effects are just as great in this film, looking rather breathtaking in some sequences), the film still does not capture the fun and greatness of the first film. Yes, there is the humour and the action, but it just feels forced. It never feels as genuine or as well captured as it was in the first film (in fact, it teeters on passing ridiculous and becoming absurd, in a bad way). While the first one may have been thought of as a throw away at first, these films just stink of being pumped out just to capitalize on a wildly random success. It may be enjoyable, but for anyone looking for anything but an explanation for how shoddy Chest was, you will be looking in the wrong place.7.5/10.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

I went in to this movie, the last of three, with the belief it would be great. I loved the first and was excited to see that the second was even better. Now I have seen the third and have to say again that I loved it even more than the others. Many times you go in to a movie with high hopes only to walk out disappointed and angry. This is not the case with the new ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" I was lucky enough to get a pass to an exclusive Pre-Screening here in Jacksonville, Fl. I was planning on staying up to see it Thursday night as soon as the first movie hit the screens and am happy for the chance I received. Upon entering the theatre I was excited, especially after waiting in line for two hours. As soon as the movie started my excitement grew to colossus levels. The movie starts with a good old fashion pirates Yo Ho. It continued to surprise me and enthrall me in its wondrous beauty and imaginative world of pirating and swashbuckling. Pirates 3 evokes many responses from its crowd including excitement, laughter and tears. There are parts that make you sit on the edge of your seat while other times you sit back enthralled in the romance.This movie brings you in, warms you up, coddles you, and lets you go with the knowledge you have been part of something great.","28 out of 39 found this helpful.

The answer is...well, something in between, with, I'm happy to say, a shift towards the former. True, the plot makes even less sense than ever, (and Chow Yun-Fat's much-hyped role as pirate lord Sao-Feng largely unnecessary) with its twists and turns of bargaining till it is no longer easy to remember who is allied with whom- and the various betrayals and double-crossings are still likely to make you groan rather than smile. And there is a great deal, frankly, in this film that Verbinski should not be forgiven for. The now wearied running slapstick gags. A peculiarly out-of-place, indulgent (yet undeniably beautiful) scene set in a bleached, computer-screensaver Underworld populated entirely by crabs. Pretty much everything that Orlando Bloom says or does during the film's duration.But the movie comes through for us in grand style, and in this manner, riding roughshod over its many flaws, it is truly a triumph. The climactic battle, taking place on board the Pearl and the Dutchman as their crews fight in the midst of a whirlpool (thanks to the superb visual effects the scene manages to somehow be thrilling rather than ridiculous) is fittingly superb- after all, it's what the entirety of this film and Dead Man's Chest have been building up to. There are still some truly enjoyable performances amongst the cast: Depp, despite the new fad amongst critics for playing down his part, is clearly having the time of his life, as is Geoffrey Rush, equally delightful as Hector Barbossa, and getting plenty of opportunities for comic back-and-forth with his co-star. Keith Richards lurks in the background strumming guitars and rasping piratical nonsense. And, perhaps best of all, Verbinski seems to have remembered how to direct. Gone are the dodgy, panicked-looking visuals of Dead Man's Chest, replaced by some scenes of truly startling beauty. There's a surprisingly quiet moment in the film where the Pearl drifts through waters so clear that the stars reflect in them, giving it the appearance of simply floating through the night sky. That was worth the price of an entrance ticket for me alone.I'd recommend the film, then: pretty much everyone in the world will go and see it regardless. But no matter how sceptical you go in, (and I will repeat that whatever your opinion of the rambling middle section, only a churl could fail to enjoy the final half-hour), it is highly likely that you will come out much as you did after watching the original film: surprised that so much time has passed so quickly, with serious doubts to raise, certainly, but at the same time feeling a little thrilled, a little exhilarated from the experience.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

They screwed it up. ""At world's end"" is not able to continue the trilogy. The movie did one thing: Putting random scenes together.But let me explain it.First of all: The movie was made for people to laugh. There were so many ""You have to laugh"" scenes, that I got sick of it after 30 minutes. The humor was not like it has been in the other parts, it was a forced and boring kind of humor.Second thing: They had such a great plot and base. The cliffhanger of the second part was amazing and had so much potential what they did not use.Third thing: Characters. They tried to develop characters, great - but they screwed it up. I don't want to spoiler anything, so you have to see it on your own. Just one note: Character development is only good, when it's logically and there was nothing about logic in ""at world's end"".Fourth problem: Love story. I hate love stories when they totally miss the point. Yes we know, that Elizabeth and Will are in love. But why do they have to put that in an action scene where they fight for their life? This were just four things I hated about the movie. 3/10 points is a very, very kind rating. If you want to see a pirate movie with a special kind of humor do not watch the movie and save the money. If you want to know how it's possible to mess a great cliffhanger and plot up watch it.","79 out of 178 found this helpful.

Its lengthier, and not in a slowed-down way. Longer meaning more action, more characters (Chow Yun Fat and Keith Richards are awesome), and a final battle so enriched with awesome design, careful choreography and stunning visual effects it will blow your mind.The cast is great, the thrills all first-rate.

As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!","40 out of 61 found this helpful.

Still, the overall movie was dark and brooding. The subject can be blamed for much of this, but the humor was only an occasional quip or minor sight gag. It lacked the redeeming humor from the first show, but was not so slap-stick outrageous as the second. The length is not as much a problem as the last, but the fight scenes do tend to drag and Depp's sanity bogs down and is tedious almost from the onset. In all, it is worth a look, though many will find the convoluted plot mismanaged and hard to follow.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's Absolutely Fun.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1663880/?ref_=tt_urv","jzappa","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8625456/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2007","I was a complete sucker for the effects this time. I have grown to dislike franchise films based on the starving and then desperately feeding sweets to mainstream American audiences, the sweets being computer-generated visual effects. Well, this one got me. Gore Verbinski, the director of all three films in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, has a deep, intuitive understanding of the fear, drama, and peace that can be derived from water. The film may not have the brilliantly elaborate sword fights that its predecessors had, but there are many unbelievably dazzling sequences involving pirate ships and the effects the gargantuan ocean has upon them. Horizons, whirlpools, the deep, reflections of the starry night sky, and waterfalls all have their heydays in this epic pleasure of a glossy Hollywood film.The story is an extensive, elaborate, complicated, extremely verbose one, and most adolescents and children prone to Disney films will often find themselves lost. That is no judgment on their intelligence, only on the expectations the writers have of their target audience. I, however, thought the story hardly left anything to be desired. The fantasy elements of the series are induced with great creativity, as opposed to many fantasy films, which usually tend to have stories that center around incidentally fantastical worlds, with invented creatures, completely objective goals like finding a ring that controls the fate of a race of beings. The Pirates films are actually heavy on plot, and in this third installment, the travel between this world and the afterlife in Davy Jones's Locker is cleverly done. The humor is also becoming more daring, with cynicism, and extreme dryness that is not R-rated, but gives off vibes as though it is.Johnny Depp has become such a sizzling hot property, and since his nuclear burst of popularity in 2003 has widdled to a universal liking by all and a box office fueled by a stalker's obsession among angsty 13-year-old girls, that the filmmakers have become extremely self-conscious in their handling of Captain Jack Sparrow. I was impressed very much by his introduction in At World's End, which was very fresh and not so corny emerging from a coffin with his guns in his hands across his chest so that the audience can cheer. It brims with happy-go-lucky creativity, but the gimmick is carried too far by being continued and built upon in several scenes throughout the rest of the movie. But I won't deny that there are points where it gets interesting. If I'm being vague, it's because I don't want to spoil it.One thing I'm definitely becoming concerned about is the amount of violence that's being allowed in Disney films. Smokin' Aces was released in January, and it was a mêlée of grinding, shrieking action violence complete with several gruesome shootouts and a couple of snippets of torture. It was rated R, and no, it was not released by Walt Disney Pictures, but by the standards being set by this film, which opens with a child amongst a line of condemned being prepared for hanging and has a surprisingly disturbing scene wherein Davy Jones's tentacles impale a single man's head through each orifice, it very well could be. During Smokin' Aces, or any other R-rated action film recently, I was not disturbed, and did not make an irksome face, at any violent scene, though several are shown and the body counts are high. In this PG-13-rated film, there were three sequences where I grimaced. Why would the violence be harder in a film designed for kids that is given a much more generous rating than a film designed for older people that is given a very standard rating that is given away like confetti at a parade? Anyway, the verdict is that it is one vastly entertaining epic ride where the characters, as they always are in the Pirates films, maintain an interesting and hairpin-turning arch throughout the series, and the performances by Depp and Geoffrey Rush are as charming as ever. This is coming from a film buff who begrudges billion-dollar franchises founded upon treating audiences like junkies who are so numb and disabled that all they are able to eat now is ice cream.","29 out of 44 found this helpful.

I like number 2 although it's not nearly as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but the delicacy of Captain Sparrow and his adventures are beginning to be so extreme that the story being told is forgotten. That's a shame cause the writers have really made something original here. As for At World's End I think that the tone of the Curse of the Black Pearl has been completely lost. Not that the third movie is bad or anything but the artistic link between the first and the third movie has disappeared. The characters have went from original but still likely to highly unlikely people destined to be something greater than we got the impression of in the first movie (especially Will Turner whose fate has just gone so unrealistic - still love him though). That annoys me a bit. The greatness of the first one was that it was so down to earth in an elegant way. The second and the third has lost that.With all that said I quite enjoyed At World's End as a movie although there has been put a lot of more simple comic in it which (I'm sorry) makes the mood of the movie pretty ordinary and unoriginal. The spirit of Curse of the Black Pearl has disappeared.But it was great to see all the characters again after all. The verbal fights between Captain Jack and Barbossa was just great.All together the third movie doesn't top the first but is still entertaining although in a more ordinary way. Captain Jack will live forever ;)","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

"","","28 Rides Later","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1662745/?ref_=tt_urv","tedg","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0643062/?ref_=tt_urv","26 May 2007","The politics of summer movies is strange indeed. Critics seem particularly out of tune of viewers excepting for gross ranking. After the second weekend, word of mouth trumps advertising, so it will be interesting to see how this current crop is rated by IMDb viewers after that. As action movies go, what matters to me first is the cinematic experience. Story, characters and such need only be sufficient to give an excuse for optical adventure. That's why I like Stephen Sommers and Peter Jackson. They understand dimension, and provide it to me in ways that are new and exciting.""Spiderman"" in all three episodes should have been at least as good as the best. Instead, as with all the Marvel productions, it was far less rewarding than average. They are boring if you can't get excited about the characters; I just can't imagine anyone who could. We need a ""Doctor Strange"" movie. And we need some other filmmakers than have been seen in the Marvel corral.For that Doctor Strange movie, we could do a lot, lot worse than go with Verbinski. I'm impressed by this movie. It's not of the ""King King"" class, but it has quite a few interesting elements.What most people will remark on is the characters, led by Depp. They are good enough excepting the ""girl"" pirate who is so far below the others in charisma it will set female imagination back a couple decades. It was a mistake made in the original, a soccer snooker that we got stuck with. We needed Geena Davis, or her successor. If Geena was the new Sigourney, who's the new Geena?The story is very well tuned to my mind. Every major character has some duplicity, not all of which we can guess or even understand after we get the whole movie. I believe they did this to give the movie legs, so that it will be watched over and over again after the opening honeymoon is over. But it has an effect that I appreciate: the narrative is sliced and diced as we jump from story to story and shifting intents. Its by some otherwise crass writers, but in this context doesn't seem overlarge.What's nice are two cinematic effects.The first I have remarked on before. The intent of the film is to merge cinema with theme park, a unified monetizing strategy with two different media. That means the film is more extremely architectural and spatial than usual. A reward for those of us who appreciate space. As with the two previous films, each episode on a ship establishes the ship first as a space, and then the characters within. Its rare; its hard; its effective; it empowers imagination and lucid dreaming. And probably sells Disneyland ride tickets as well.The second cinematic value I appreciated was the variety of styles and effects. Usually a summer blockbuster is pretty much the same noise from beginning to end, with the only variety coming from the different tools used by the effects subcontractors who lead different action scenes. But there was so much design here as we moved from one storyline to another, it made the thing seem as if we were visiting different rooms, each with its own world dynamics. Its most obvious when we first see Sparrow in his limbo, a ship frozen Shackleton- wise in a smooth surface of ice. This, by the way really does quote the amazing Hurley photos of this very real episode in history. Somebody knew their history of cinema and pushed that perceptron button.That business about crab-stones is inspired. (Oddly the paired effect  when Kalipso is ""unleashed""  is the least memorable in the film.) The idea of having Depp encounter versions of himself is extremely clever and I know of no one else who could have pulled it off. Its what he does in his mind when acting anyway. These scenes justify the ticket price.This isn't the best adventure film, but surely the best of the season, and definitely worth watching.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Not great, barely even not good, just okay. I mean, it definitely fixed some of the problems of DMC; there's definitely more plot and less action. But that becomes a problem all by itself: there's TOO MUCH plot now. And it really makes this already long movie feel even LONGER than it already is because of bad pacing on the parts of the director and editor. At one point there's even about five, long, awkward seconds of blackness for no good reason. Also, I hope you enjoy wide shots of ships sailing, because there's plenty of it here! But enough about the pacing, let's talk about the characters. Well, the whole crew's still here, and Depp, Bloom, and Knightly all pull off generally good performances, if not their best in the series. Barbosa's back, which is welcome, and makes for some great Jack/Barbosa arguments over the ownership of the Black Pearl, but most of the other characters are lacking in all fields. Even the two big new characters, played by Chow Yung Fat and Keith Richards, feel like pointless add-ons, added for more star power and no more. Fat's character barely has a distinctive personality, and is killed off way too quickly to make much of an impact, and Richards is in it for all of one really quick scene. And, although Sparrow is up to his usual antics in this one, including a very surreal scene in Hell that'll make you go ""What the hell?"", there's no really good ""Jack-Escape"" scene, like in the other two.One really big complaint I had with film is, admittedly, of no consequence to the actual quality of the film, but it still bugged me. After all of the set-up of DMC for a big, climactic clash involving the awesome Krakken, the only time we see the giant beast is when our heroes stop on an island and find it dead on a beach. I mean, WTF! Couldn't we at least see it get killed? But I suppose it doesn't matter too much.After all of my complaints, you're probably reconsidering going out to see this movie. However, with all of it's flaws, remember I still gave it a 6. That's because, even after it's flaws, it is still a fairly fun movie to watch, if not a bit confusing at times. And the finale, though not as cool as DMC's three-way water-wheel sword fight, is very satisfying, and is fittingly epic. If you go get a refill on your popcorn and/or use the bathroom during the slow parts, and skip straight to the action, then this isn't a bad way to spend about three hours of your summer. Just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

All in all, the third movie is really, really good (8 out of 10 for me) but part of me says the first of the trilogy was the best of all.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Again, Disney can wow an audience with believable effects, especially the grand finale and final battle. Hint: Better than the Battle of Gondor in LOTR: Return of the King. Johnny Depp is, as usual, fantastic as Jack Sparrow with the rest of the backstabbing cast members. Which brings us to one of the most complex and bizarre plot lines I've seen, but at the same time, very imaginative and entertaining. Also, for those of you that hear others complaining about the ending, please wait until the END of the film to see what really happens.","30 out of 48 found this helpful.

I heard it was going to be gory, especially the beginning, and I am one who does not prefer those types of movies. However, after the first minute or so, I started to really enjoy the movie. It felt darker than the first two, and the acting was sensational. I didn't actually think that the acting would be that great, for the trailers seemed to say otherwise, but some VERY good performances were performed in this movie. Without spoiling anything, a lot of secrets are revealed and a lot of twists and turns take place. I actually had no idea how the film would end, and I find it a very, very enjoyable ending. I hope there isn't a fourth movie, actually, because I don't think they can beat this. It was incredible. Especially the special effects. They literally will shock you on how great they really are. While a lot of reviews tell the story of the movie, I actually don't want to say anything, for I knew almost nothing about what would happen in this movie and I think it is better that way. This is definitely a film I will be buying on DVD and seeing more than once!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, this time the plot is more complex (and confusing in the beginning). New characters are introduced, thus new plots. The characters who had smaller roles in the previous films, like Tia Dalma, the parrot and Jack the monkey, have more to do here. Unfortunately, some likable characters have been killed off such as Davenport's Norrington and the Kraken. I also did not like how they concluded Tia Dalma's story. She just becomes a giant, then bursts into crabs and becomes a storm? The action sequences are cool to watch even though they are a little over the top. I still preferred the ones that were more creatively executed in the second one. I think the main problem with this one was that it was much more over the top than the first two.Yet, it's still a fun flick even though it doesn't live up to the first movie. The humour is definitely there and it still works great thanks to the hilarious dialogues like in the scenes where Jack talks to his conscience and the one where they all come to get him from 'purgatory'. The cinematography is spacious and the performances are consistent. As always, it's a Jack Sparrow show and of course, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' is unimaginable without Depp. Geoffrey Rush gets scope to display a lot more comedy and the actor is exceptional. Keira Knightley has a lot more action and she's probably furthest away from the feminine princess in the first movie. Orlando Bloom is mostly overshadowed by his co-stars as he's often relegated to the background but he has his few shining moments. Chow Yun Fat managess to kiss Knightley before getting killed off. Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy are good.The ending does leave space for more and I wonder what a fourth movie would be like. I wouldn't mind seeing more. If the makers do decide to end it here then that's not so bad either. It's a decent conclusion, one that could have been fantastic but remained entertaining and adventurous nonetheless.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Filmed around the same time as the first sequel, the plot here follows on from that set out in Dead Man's Chest, and there are a number of surprises stemming from said film's ending. While the base plot itself is rather thin considering the amount of characters and vast running time, once again director Gore Verbinski decks the film out with a barrage of action sequences and Johnny Depp's Captain Jack is always on hand if things start to get a bit boring. The film begins with the main characters travelling to Davey Jones' Locker to rescue the doomed Captain Jack who died at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After getting the map from Captain Sao Feng, the crew sail to ends of the Earth to rescue Captain Jack. But there's more at stake as The East India Trading Company are now in control of Davey Jones, and are using him to get rid of the remaining pirates.This film is decidedly weirder than the previous instalments and most of the strangeness comes from deluded Captain Jack, who seems to have been affected by his time in the locker. Although he doesn't have the most screen time here, it is, of course, Johnny Depp's maniacal portrayal of the despicable pirate that is the film's centrepiece. Depp clearly enjoys playing this role, and his quips are always a major highlight. There seems to be more of a focus on character building and plot in this film than there was in the last one, but there's still room for plenty of stunts and sword fights  unfortunately, however, there's nothing to rival the hilarious wheel scene in the first sequel. The main reason this sequel is so much fun it down to the diverse and interesting set of characters (which seem to take a fair bit of influence from Star Wars). All the returning characters still work well together and as was the case with the last film, the new ones fit in well too. Overall, this might not be life-affirming stuff - but its lots of fun and this film ensures that the Pirates series ends on a high.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Everyone has their own agenda, yet they fight for a common purpose: To defeat Beckett and Davy Jones.Make no mistake, they do so in a thrilling final battle that puts war movies to shame. Those who complain of the lack of Jack in the 2nd one will not be disappointed. In fact, they might find there's a little too much of him! Keira Knightley has brilliant moments, and looks even more beautiful than before. And as always, Barbosa and Jack make the perfect duo. The ending has great twists and are unlike a Disney film. They really do an excellent job of avoiding any clichés. The visual effects are stunning, the acting is superb, and once more the final battle, as well as the score, is godly. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed for this truly is the finest of the trilogy.

The problem with the movie is that it has far too many supernatural elements: different kinds of immortality, many possibilities of eternal or semi-eternal damnation, several different magical gimmickries with very weird rules, the ship that's faster than any other for no obvious reason (the black pearl), a very supernatural ship (the Dutchman), and other things I won't mention not to spoil the plot.If you have one supernatural force, there's no problem: for example the first movie worked just fine, as do Star Wars movies with their ""force"". But the second and especially the third film in the Pirates series just mix too many elements, and that's why nothing seems to matter any more. Luckily the movie has humour and even ironizes its weird characters and multiple cases of supernaturality. Still, although entertaining, the whole experience seems somewhat hollow.Jack Sparrow is still fun, but the first sequel was more funny and less of a mess than this one, and the first pirates film had a far more coherent plot. Still, if you like adventure films spiced up with humour, and don't care about getting that deep into the characters you'll probably love this. And even if you aren't a friend of these types of films, chances are you'll still like it for its entertainment value.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Dead Man's Chest was buried under it's own mythology and ambition. Not to mention the fact that the first movie wasn't made to be easily sequelized. But At World's End corrects a few of the second movies mistakes, and is a better movie as a result. The first half was a nonsensical mess, and really had me wondering if this was just going to be three more hours of an empty plot that served only to carry the viewer from mindless action scene to mindless action scene. But the last hour and a half grabbed my attention again, and I actually ended up liking the way that the story ended. Sure the action scenes are still too long and the story was as disposable as they come, but I still ended up having fun watching the movie. It's nice to finally have an end to the stories of Will and Elisabeth (though I will miss Keira's gorgeous face, I admit), because the best hope of the next movie being good is to have Jack Sparrow as the main focus, without all the story baggage of Pirates 1-3.Anyway, At World's End left me hopefully for the future of the franchise, which is more than I expected from it. It's not quite as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it easily surpasses Dead Man's Chest.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If the previous one took everything from the first one and turned it up a notch, well, this one took everything from both of them and turned that up a notch. It's bigger and longer, more complicated than it needs to be, but it's also tremendously entertaining.At World's End is an interesting film in that it feels like a mix between the two previous films. A lot of the lightheartedness and comedy that was ever-present in The Curse of the Black Pearl makes a return, after the second instalment, which was much heavier in tone. But, many of the darker themes of Dead Man's Chest are also present, creating a film that feels exactly how you'd imagine a Pirates of the Caribbean film to feel. When the going gets heavy, there is always a fun punchline or gag at ready, to lighten the mood, often provided by, you guessed it, Jack Sparrow. But thankfully, when the film needs to feel dark, it isn't afraid to do so. There are plenty of tough themes that are touched upon, and they do carry their weight plentifully. The result, then, ends up feeling wonderfully balanced, at least as far as the tone goes.The story, however, ends up being the weight dragging this film down. It takes off directly from where the second film ended, and while that does provide a clean bridge from one film to the other, the story here lacks impact. It's not that the story isn't fun or entertaining, it's just that it often feels overly long and complicated. Indeed, this one is even longer than it's predecessors which were long, to begin with. And as was the case with them, At World's End suffers from the same faith, trying to cram every good idea into it, even when it isn't called for. All of these Pirates films have been full of wonderful ideas, for the most part, but they have also had plenty of ideas in them, that simply shouldn't be there. While they are often fun and add more flavour to the experience, they, conversely, end up excessively bloating the runtime. And to be completely honest, these films don't need any more flavour than they already have at their core. But, regardless, there is no denying the entertainment these films, this one included, provide. At World's End, despite its problems, provides a satisfying conclusion to the story that began at The Curse of the Black Pearl.Which brings me to the next point. While it's easy to say now that there was a fourth film and even a fifth film, it was also evidently clear that there would be more after the way this one ended. At World's End, much like the previous one, makes it clear that the story isn't over yet. And while it makes sense for Disney to continue printing money with the series, I would've really liked to have seen it all end here. At World's End ends in a great place. It ties every character arc together and answers all the questions that I might've had. Will and Elizabeth end up where everyone would've wanted them to end up in, and Jack sails off into the sunset, just like he arrived at the beginning of The Curse of the Black Pearl. Story-wise, it's obvious that there was no need for more. It seems to have been quite evident considering that two of the biggest stars left and the director was changed. And while I wish that this had indeed been the end, a part of me is also excited to join Jack Sparrow once more on his adventures. And therein, lies the charm and power of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. They are wonderfully stupid and over-the-top but, at the same time, they come with a promise of adventure and undeniable fun. While it's clear that they are anything but masterpieces, they are some of the most entertaining films I have ever watched.So here we are, at the end of what I would describe as the Black Pearl trilogy. While I'm perfectly aware that there is more to come, I can't help but consider these three films as their own thing. They encompass a certain childlike charm that I doubt will be present in the newer films. And while I do look forward to watching them, these three original, The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, will always be what I think of when someone mentions the Pirates of the Caribbean.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Setting up the mythology, background, characters and gags. This is the big payoff. And it works so well.There are oft repeated complaints about the movie  too much stuff/plot/characters, a lot of talk and repetition of things already done in the previous movies. Actually, these are the movies strengths.It's a movie by fans, for fans. Well, I'm not sure if these are the proper terms it's a movie by someone who loves the setting and characters, for people who love the setting and characters. It rewards you for paying attention to minute details, including those from the last movies, as well as character motivation and mythology. It does not reward ignoring the ""talky"" parts while waiting for the next action sequence and then getting confused about the ""overtly intricate"" plot.Yes, nearly every plot hook, character, and plenty of gags from the last movies are brought up again. The plot threads are more or less neatly tied together, each character gets the fate s/he deserves and the gags ah, those, are where the movie really inherits a great boon from the last two films. Each gag is used once or twice, to the fullest potential, and then dismissed before it overstays its welcome, or taken into an entirely new context. Only with that kind of legacy can a movie send an audience into fits of laughter merely by having a character beckon a dog to him and say ""Sea Turtles"".Every element has been fine tuned to near perfection. There's only one full blown swashbuckling/naval combat scene  at the climax, where it belongs. And having waited an entire movie for it, I find it hard to imagine an audience member that would not be overwhelmed and swept along. All the double, triple and quadruple crosses are in place, and they are fascinating. Not only are you always unsure of just which side each character is playing, but the negotiation and parlay scenes are filmed in the same manner as the action scenes  and it WORKS.Comparisons to Return of the King are nearly inevitable, regarding various aspects of the film, but the most pretient, in my opinion is that this is the first movie in the series which actually creates the feeling that the heroes and the action are in another world, one of swashbuckling myth and wonder - the sort of feeling you got from any given LoTR movie. Another RotK comparison (as well as a favorable comparison to the first two Pirate movies) - the movie is long. Some scenes could have been shorter. But there are absolutely no scenes that feel as though they are going on too long. There are no ""fight on the wheel"" or ""drowning Will"" scenes that go ""meanwhile, are heroes are doing the exact same thing they've been doing for the last 5 minutes"".Shortcomings? The huge chunk of unwieldy exposition shoved into the beginning of the movie, a bit of overacting from Rush, and Chow Yun-Fat's characters should have been given more to do, or cut out altogether. Other than that, this film is excellent, and a fitting end to the trilogy, right down to the humorous/bittersweet/ the road goes ever on and on, ending.","96 out of 174 found this helpful.

I had been looking forward to this film ever since I had seen the first showing of ""Dead Man's Chest"". I felt like with Barbossa's cliffhanging return, the creators of the ""POTC"" films were promising their beloved fans something truly fantastic in the third film. Personally, I feel that they delivered on this promise. As I do not want to put any spoilers in my comments I will simply just say that all of the major questions are answered in a most satisfying and creative manner. There are, however, a crop of new questions that have been left for audience members to figure out on their own. I don't believe like these questions were left open for a possible fourth film (lets not all beat a dead horse), but I think they serve as a delightful ""fill in the blanks"" situation for viewers. Its almost as if one leaves the theater feeling like our beloved pirate friends are still out at sea, having the most marvelous of adventures.As always, this film boasts an impressive lineup of performers. There is always the ever brilliant Johnny Depp who is as fantastic as ever in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow, the handsome Orlando Bloom who showed some great progress and confidence in his delivery of the role of young William Turner and the feisty and adventurous Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. Other notable performances in the film can be found with Geoffrey Rush's crazed Captain Barbossa, a particular favorite of mine and a touching performance my Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma. Add a splash of Keith Richards in an unforgettable cameo, Chow Yun Fat, and some Murtog and Mulroy and there you have it.As a compliment to this constantly high-energy cast we have the usual full blown sets and computer graphics as can be expected in any Disney film. I truly reveled in the sets, stunts, and costumes as well as a stunning musical score composed by Hans Zimmer.All of these wonderful elements come together in the final 40 minutes of the film. Again, I don't want to put any spoilers in this commentary, but I assure you, this film really does not disappoint.","76 out of 136 found this helpful.

At the End of the World, the Adventure Begins ,Yet another swahbuckler adventure in which our starring embarking in another maritime escapade to avoid enslaving his soul to Jones' service, and the protagonists will have to confront ominous villains and his henchmen. The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , adding lots of state-of-art computer generator special effects. The motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels and betrayals . This time Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, and crew must call the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe, including the infamous Sao Feng, to gathering. The Pirate Lords want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy Jones's damned lover, from the trap he sent her . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy providing the necessary hilarious touches . Along with habitual roles : Kiera Knightley, Orlando Bloom , they're well accompanied by a good support cast , such as : Jack Davenport , Bill Nighy , Jonathan Pryce, Kevin McNally , Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Stellan Skarsgård, David Bailie , Tom Hollander , Naomie Harris , Martin Klebba , David Schofield and Geoffrey Rush.It displays colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer .

The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple.","26 out of 42 found this helpful.

Among the plusse...(read more) s, the films camera-work is stunning, among the highlights is the scenes showing Johnny Depp in Davy Jones locker. You wont see anything that strange and imaginative in a mainstream summer blockbuster this year. The sparse action scenes before the climax are well done, but boring. The cast does a commendable job as a whole, but they don't bring anything new that we haven't seen in the last two movies. Johnny Depp carries the film on his shoulders whenever he appears, too bad he doesn't garner much screen time in the film. Overall, the film is too complicated and takes its self too seriously for its own good. It seemed half-baked compared to the first two's strong story lines, and contained too many characters and subplots. While the 2nd film had some pirate mythology in the form of Davy Jones weaved nicely into the storyline, the third relies far too much on far-fetched pirate history and mythology to carry the plot...so much so that the world the characters inhabit looses its believability as taking place in our world, and the films endless backstories and subplots carried out for the first 2 hours becomes so tedious and boring that you just don't care anymore. The conclusion of the majority of the trilogy's main story lines did not receive enough screen time, and became lost in a pile of underdeveloped subplots. Disappointing...catch it on DVD.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was released and against all odds became a success that surpassed all the expectations. The movie, a tale of fantasy, romance and swashbuckling adventures that chronicled the escapades of a group of 18th Century pirates, earned both critical and commercial praise due to its fresh take on the genre. Due to its success, two back-to-back sequels were announced, both with the same cast and crew of the first film. The first of those sequels was ""Dead Man's Chest"", a film that while certainly lacked a lot of the original's power, started a new and interesting story arc that has its grand finale in ""At World's End"".""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" continues where the second part ended: with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) making an uneasy alliance with former foe Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in order to find a way to bring Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) back from ""Davy Jones' Locker"" the supernatural purgatory for those indentured to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). The urgency of their mission comes from the fact that Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company, has begun to purge pirates from the sea, organizing massive executions in an attempt to control worldwide sea trade. To face Beckett, the nine pirate lords must make up the Brethren Court, but since Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean, was unable to appoint a successor, our friends must bring him back before its too late.Once again, the film was written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who continue the story arc that began in the previous film with an extremely detailed script that gives closure to many of the plots that were started by the previous two films. To do this, the writers employ a series of convoluted twists and turns that further explore the now complicated relationships between our heroes, who not only must survive Beckett's attacks, but also the consequences of their own choices and betrayals. Unlike the second film, this film is more focused on the characters than on the action scenes, in an obvious attempt to add more character development this time; however, this doesn't mean that the movie lacks in the action department, as there is plenty of it through the film. Of course, the movie keeps good doses of that special touch of humor that has given the franchise a lot of its charm.As in the previous two installments, director Gore Verbinski takes the helm again and brings this adventure come to life in a very visually appealing way. With an extreme care for details and a great eye for visual compositions, Verbinski creates a sequel that manages to overcome the disappointment of the previous film, returns the story to its roots and concludes the series on a high note. Keeping a good pace despite the long runtime, Verbinski adequately handles the dialog based scenes and the action sequences in a well balanced way (with much better results than in Part 2) that even his extensive use of the remarkable special effects doesn't come off as over the top. It is clear in this film that while a mostly visual director, Verbinski knows a thing or two about film history, as at times he manages to capture the feeling of those classics about pirates with Errol Flynn or Charles Laughton in the main roles.By now it is more than clear that Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow, is the driving force of the film. Once again Depp becomes the quirky yet charming pirate with great ease and talent, delivering a terrific comedic performance that still remains fun after all those years. Orlando Bloom isn't that lucky, as while he has improved as an actor, the writers have left his character in a third position after Keira Knightley, who in this chapter gets a lot of screen time and carries a considerable part of the film alone. This would be good if it wasn't for the fact that Knightley isn't as accomplished as an actress as those around her, as not only Depp manages to overshadow her, but the combined presences of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy and Yun-Fat Chow prove to be too much a challenge for her. Among the cast Rush is a real joy to watch, as he steals every scene he is in.Sadly, despite the many improvements that ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" has over its predecessor, it is also plagued by some of the flaws that brought down ""Dead Man's Chest"". It's main flaw is probably the enormous dependence the film has on the charm that the character of Jack Sparrow has over the audience. The writers know that Sparrow is a fan favorite, so they put a lot of the film over his shoulders, which results in many great scenes with him, but also in the belittling of the rest of the characters. The convoluted plot will definitely turn some off, but I think that the complex storyline added a lot of much needed character development to the film, specially as it allowed some characters a small chance to shine. Finally, I will only add that the script gets corny and silly at times, but not too much to be a real bother.While not exactly a great artistic accomplishment, ""At World's End"" is a roller-coaster of fun that despite its long runtime never fails to be entertaining. It is unknown what is ahead for the successful ""Pirates"" franchise, but one thing is clear for me: the story arc that began in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has a most satisfying finale in ""At World's End"". Fans of this series will be pleased. 8/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I went to see it with several of my friends and we all had a great time. Captain Jack had us laughing all through the ride and the effects were absolutely amazing. The supporting roles were all cast brilliantly and added flavor to the movie. The locations and set pieces were like real and were mind blowing. Yes, the plot was overloaded and a little hard to follow, but I still left the theater with a satisfied feeling. As for some people who said the movie was long, I thought it went by pretty quickly even though there were a few parts that dragged a little bit. The final battle in the whirlpool can be argued as the one of the best ever in cinema history, and the story does a nice job of closing the movie out, but seems to leave things open for another movie. All in all, it was a pleasure to watch this movie in theaters.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Most trilogies have one film that is way below par (Indiana Jones for example). Others begin sucking after the first (Smokey & The Bandit). Very few trilogies keep the same quality throughout, although it has happened occasionally (Star Wars; Lord of The Rings). Perhaps the rarest of all is when the third film of a trilogy surpasses the previous two. In fact, it has only happened twice in the history of film. The first time was The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly in 1966. Forty-one years later, it happened again. This is the 2nd time.Not only is this the best film of the year, it's the best Disney film ever. In addition, it is the greatest film in the (WARNING: I DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND ANYBODY SO IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN STOP READING THIS NOW) greatest film trilogy of all time.Perhaps the most special thing about this film is the fact that it manages to be both the darkest and the funniest film of the series. The opening scene was so grim that I thought I had gone into the wrong movie. The opening is the last thing you would expect from Disney (for that matter, so is the closing, but I won't ruin that for you). However, it is also the hardest I've laughed during a movie since Borat.I won't give away any of the plot, but I will praise some of the performances. Johnny Depp (the greatest actor of his generation) is great as always. Orlando Bloom has came a long way since the first film and he gives a terrific performance. Keira is as hot as always and this is also her best performance to date. It was a real joy to see Geoffrey Rush back in the series. Chow Yun-Fat was great as the villain and Keith Richards' cameo was one of the funniest moments in the film.One of the biggest criticisms I've heard is that the film is hard to follow. I don't understand this. It took me two viewings to figure out Dead Man's Chest, but I found this one very easy to follow.I'll close by making one final point. This film deserves every Oscar available, with Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush sharing the honor for Best Supporting Actor.Will it win any Oscars? Maybe a few technical awards and possibly Best Score. However, the major awards are all going to go to smaller films that nobody will see until after they win.And why is this? Well, to paraphrase Stephen King, ""The critic's definition of over-rated is: something that too many people have enjoyed"".Enjoy the film.","31 out of 53 found this helpful.

Without Johnny this franchise wouldn't have any legs to stand on and in this movie, similar to the previous two, Depp carries the torch across the finish line. The movie is bigger and larger. It has a longer running time, there's more action, more plot and more battles.The gang travels to Asia and then to the End of the World to rescue Jack Sparrow from the afterlife. There were some avant-garde and experimental scenes in the afterlife which was unlike a summer blockbuster to contain (Think of the scene in ""Being John Malkovich"" where every character is John Malkovich.)I felt the screen writing was more witty and flowed more effortlessly than in the second installment. And even though the ending was not what I was expecting, I was certainly surprised with it, and with that it gained my respect.the only thing I didn't enjoy was how it opened it up for a fourth movie. However despite its length and the superfluous monologues from Keira Knightley...did we really need to give her that many speeches, this is a good movie.

Some of the resolutions are better than others, and the film has rigorous action sequences making it a good ride, but sometimes the numerous sub plots can be overwhelming. For example, you'll need to keep a scorecard on how many dead characters have been resurrected from the beyond, as well as to keep track of the endless alliance realignments and double crosses.Since sword duels and buried treasure motifs become redundant and routine, the dimensions of the story expand to include metaphysical creatures with their own agendas and sub plots. However, some are not utilized to their potential, such as Davy Jones's crew and the Kraken.All the major characters of the previous two films return, and their entanglements drive the plot pretty well. However, few of them grow or change much in this movie; what you've already seen them do in the past is what you get this time around. The movie tries to do too much in places, leaving some of it loosely constructed. The final battle engagement throws a lot of stuff at you all at once, some of which will seem sublimely ridiculous, yet at the same time mixed with some violent imagery. Some clever sight gags are sprinkled throughout the movie and usually get the laughs.Although nobody says, ""Luke, I am your father,"" the story opens a few new plot issues to explore should Captain Sparrow and the others return to once again plunder the Caribbean in any future movies. In the meantime, this one is good popcorn entertainment.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

All of this probably because they hoped that this way we wouldn't notice that pirates III actually has... well... no story to it.The same thing we saw happening with The Matrix: first movie is new, original and has a little something for everyone, in the second one they re-use the story, but add just a little twist and cover it all up with good visual effects. And come the third one, they've got no story left to tell and set the bar so high for themselves it's nearly impossible to reach it anymore, so they just fall back on the old reliable 'success of the other two movies'.One thing I actually did like were the visual effects, and the amount of detail found in every single scene. That obviously took a lot of time and effort. Too bad that after seeing an army of undead pirates walking on the bottom of the ocean in the first movie, and a whole crew of half-man-half-sea-creatures in the second one, expectations were so high I was bound to being disappointed.Yeah, nice locations too, again very detailed and everything, but I'm almost sorry I even noticed that, for my intentions were actually to follow the story (you know, tie all those loose ends Pirates I and II left us with) but all I heard coming out of the actor's mouths was ""blablabla *insert typical Jack Sparrow quote here* blabla"" As for the action scenes I can be quite brief: the first two movies they almost had me believing it just might even be possible (the three-man-fight on the big wheel in Pirates II not included), but this time they obviously got carried away. Even a child who 'wants to be a pirate when he grows up, just like captain Sparrow' will go out to find a more credible role model after seeing this movie.All in all, I rated the movie 5 out of 10. They put a lot of work into the visual aspect of it all, but failed to live up to all the rest of my expectations.","173 out of 333 found this helpful.

The third installment in ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series sees a whole wide range of characters from the first two films linking up once again in a crazed and whacked ""Around the World in 80 Days""-styled saga where seemingly every player is not quite what they seem and all have their own individual motives. A dark alliance between the British (led by Tom Hollander) and ghost ship captain Bill Nighy has joined together to try to rid the globe of pirates forever. Orlando Bloom is still trying to save his father (Stellen Skarsgard), while Keira Knightley's own father (Jonathan Pryce) may be in danger. And of course there is Johnny Depp, the straw that stirs the entire series. In a wild and somewhat schizophrenic role, Depp dominates once again playing arguably the greatest cinematic character since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Former Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush is back well-deservedly as the prototypical pirate captain, one of seemingly dozens from around the world that show up here (Chow Yun Fat is particularly memorable as an oceanic boss from Singapore). Even Keith Richards, who Depp's Jack Sparrow has always been said to be based upon, shines as the superstar's father who holds secrets for all pirates within. Once again, the screenplay is window-dressing to give all performers their moment in the sun. The film is nearly three hours long, but it still sails effortlessly through potentially dangerous movie-making waters to be a highly fun and entertaining crowd pleaser. Director Gore Verbinski deserves a standing ovation tackling a concept which has always had somewhat primitive beginnings (being based on a thrill ride at a theme park) and sometimes even more primitive story advancements. Technologically superior and just plain fun, ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is a roller coaster ride of epic summer proportions. 4 stars out of 5.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Much can be said about the bulk of (or maybe just all) of the third and possibly final installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The script, in actuality, wasn't finished before filming started, and it shows: the screenwriters, or Verbinski, or Bruckheimer or whomever it was, have here a picture where pretty much not one character of significant note doesn't have some sort of personal vendetta, or double-cross, or triple cross, or some kind of love interest that has to be existent only through massive circumstances of trouble and fate, or that they're just one-note argh pirates or corrupt British officers. At the same time, there are nuggets here that mark as being sublime and utterly riotously funny, and even mark as being some of the best scenes that the series has to offer. But there's so much to get through to get to the worthwhile bits that it's not worth it- not for the 11 bucks for a ticket anyway.It will be a subjective thing of note on whether or not the movie will work based on the universe that the POTC movies rest in- which is when 'up is down', and the Pirates vs British dynamics. But it ends up being, for me anyway, having to find the scenes and moments that do work versus what doesn't, which are the weighty scenes of exposition (eg characters stand around explaining the plot, which maybe is part of the ironic twist from the filmmakers), set-up, re-set-up, and still MORE exposition during what should be the most intense sequences. Basically, we get introduced to Calypso- a much frightened myth of Pirate lore who once had a love, or maybe not totally a love per-say, and is locked away in someone's soul by Pirate mandate. There's also Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat, who actually doesn't show much here except for the excess grimacing and gestures proclaiming ""I'm a bad-ass Asian dude too good to stroke his beard), and his floggle of Singapore pirates. Then there's the whole committee of pirates. Then the dynamics of Barbosa vs Sparrow, Sparrow and Barbosa vs Davy Jones, Will Turner vs Davy Jones (to get to his father, who is 'part of the ship'). Then Elizabeth becomes a pirate captain and Calypso is released, and so on and so forth.The idea of charting the course of action leading to war between the royal British fleet and the league of extraordinary pirates sounds interesting, but it doesn't come off that way. Even when the climax comes, there's still goofy and corny bits thrown in (and not of the good kind ala 'oh, a monkey shot out of a cannon, so rich'), including marriage during a big battle scene (not as bad as the monkey, but the kiss between Turner and Swann is a true Bruckheimer cringe moment). Now, this all being said, it isn't necessarily a completely worthless enterprise. Far from it, there is a chunk of the near three hour running time- say, 15 to 20 minutes- that are near perfect and actually unconventional without trying to go out of its way to mask its shallowness. Jack Sparrow, as played by the ever so versatile, crafty and wackily engaging Johnny Depp, is stuck in Davy Jones's locker when he first appears, and it's something that one might expect out of Jodorowsky as opposed to a huge summer blockbuster: multiple Sparrows going nutty, rocks turning into crabs, Sparrow trying to pull the ship, which starts to move on its own, all starting with a peanut. It's a sheer act of surrealistic bravura film-making, aside from Depp's comedic brilliance, and it's maybe my favorite single sequence from any of the Pirates movies (at least a contender with the best skeleton pirates from the first film). When Sparrow ends up seeing his fellow 'selves', at one point coming out of his ear, it's equally uproarious, if still a little shallow, and it leads up to the exceptional appearance of Keith Richards Sparrow's Pirate King father.This, plus the usual allotment of visually eye-catching visual effects, albeit with not much new that wasn't seen character-wise in the second entry (and all the big energy in that department is saved for the big climax in the ocean, which goes on for almost half an hour more or less), do mark At Worlds End at containing the inspired craziness and exciting pleasures of the first film. But all the same, as it goes on and on, and on, you almost need a chart to count down who betrays who or who does what to the other; this would be all well and good if one could give a darn about the emotional stakes at hand, but it's a case of not a lot of 'there' being there, not assisted by (aside from Depp, Rush and sometimes Nighy) one-note performances and even wooden turns (Tom Hollander).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The story includes so much more, which really can't be explained shortly, as there is just so much twists and tweaks in the plot. I wouldn't even have to describe the plot more specifically as everyone has probably seen the movie already, so I just get the to review itself already..The final part of the trilogy is pretty satisfying. I just don't like the way they've overdone the humour; They did it with the second part and now they've done it with the third part. The first movie, to me at least, was more like a serious movie and it had its humour, not being overdone or not playing a major role in the movie itself. The character of Jack Sparrow was hilarious in the way it was and that was it, they didn't overdo it. When the second part came out, they had pretty much overdone it all, there were punchlines and other humour just trickling all over the place and the character of Jack Sparrow didn't have that depth like it used to. It's like they dragged the movie down one level and to children it was a pleasant surprise but for us more mature viewers it was a disappointment, although the humour was actually funny, but I was just hoping for a more serious movie. The third part of the trilogy continues the same joking as the second movie did, although being funny it also leaves the whole depth of the story in a minor role, which is pretty disappointing after all. It sadly turns the movie to a hollywoodised sequel.Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is great, but it's pretty much on the same level as the second part was, so I still think the first one is the best one of the trilogy. The things which make these movies so magnificent is the original characters and the story, not forgetting the spectacular visual effects. The character of Jack Sparrow, played superbly by Johnny Depp, is without a doubt one of the best characters ever written on paper and ever seen on screen. He is amiable, so sympathetic in a way and the audience favourite, the definite crowd pleaser. He is so original, being a hilarious swashbuckler who definitely knows his things, though being somewhat mentally unstable. To me the character is just so ideal and in all of these three movies Johnny Depp does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's William Turner, the golden boy played by Orlando Bloom. Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful girlfriend of Turner, played by Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush as the fierce Captain Barbossa, you can't really choose a better actor for the role, as he is just so perfect in it. The always enjoyable Bill Nighy as the evil Davy Jones is just top notch in the role. The whole cast is simply amazing and in the third movie we see such actors as Chow Yun-Fat, Stellan Skarsgård and also Keith Richards in supporting roles. The character of Keith Richards was hilarious, though he only had a few lines and didn't play any major role in the movie. What made it hilarious was that it actually was Keith Richards and when both me and my brother saw him the first time on the screen we both laughed, just because it was Keith Richards.""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is, like already mentioned, visually spectacular. There were running all kinds of visual effects on the screen throughout the movie which made the movie a masterpiece in entertainment. Explosions, sword fights, rain and tornadoes, all this junk just flying all over the place, quality stuff indeed. The third movie is all in all what I expected, though some of the things being silly it's still that quality entertainment you want and it won't be a disappointment in the department to anyone. The story does get a bit messy, everyone is cheating everyone and there are so many twists that it's sometimes really hard to keep up with the plot. The movie is also a little bit too long, or at least for me it was. Especially when there wasn't any breaks in the theatre, you just had to sit there nearly 3 hours. Anyway, if you want to see entertainment then this is what you want to see, as you just won't be disappointed like mentioned earlier. This is a trilogy which is a must-have for every action fan there is, I'm probably going to buy the trilogy-DVD-box when it comes out. Who wouldn't like pirates, eh? Arrrrr matey!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was average to the point of tedium. There is really only one battle scene in the entire film. Most of the time, the viewer is ""treated"" to a dark pondering but purely preposterous film. The set up was dull and so very uninteresting. It was the equivalent of filming someone tying their shoes very slowly but doing it with quirky slurred speech. YAWN. Keira Knightly fans will be disappointed. She's as anorexic as ever. This cast gets lost in the CGI action this time around. It overwhelms the acting and the story and seems even more silly then the last movie and I never thought that would be even possible.The second movie was bas but this one is even worse. This franchise sure went down hill after the fun first film. That's the only reason I've now wasted money on two more tickets to this trash.","28 out of 72 found this helpful.

Like I was expecting Davy Jones' locker to be under water or something in a dark, under-the-water feel, but instead it was like beneath the earth with a sky and sun, etc. Was kind of confusing on that part, but passable! The part where they had to rock the ship was worth it! Those who think this was a bad film are simply blind and don't know how to pay attention to a movie and let it be good when it deserves to be. And if it's too long for you, watch King Kong, would you? Same with Dead Man's Chest...it don't have as much flaws as some people say it does when you accept the movie for what it delivers and what it is about. Each of the three film had different tastes, which is something that I wouldn't have done if I was making the film and other people seam to have problems accepting it, as it seams, but I accepted it and they all came together as a enjoyable trilogy. After I watched the third, I watched the first and second one and loved them even better because of the third, which summed everything up for me. It's just awesome. Once you watch all three films, it comes together as a masterpiece of a trilogy and it's just fun to watch. GREAT entertainment! Just be sure you watch it with some acceptation and not be too critical, cause that will leave you not enjoying the film very well.What I liked about the third is that it's dark, gritty and fairly violent. But you got to accept that as for being this big war between the EITC and the Pirate lords, etc. And at the end of the battle was victory and success. As when it first begun it was almost like: ""holy crap! how are they going to make it?"". The outcome is basically flawless! Oh, and Keith Richards' Pirate as Jack's father was my favorite! I wish there were more of him! Like in a R rated Pirate movie...lol.Please do yourself a favor and make sure you've seen the first and second and watch the third! I really have to watch the third again myself, since I had gotten a seat very close to the screen and I had this massive headache which bothered me during the movie, so I couldn't keep up with it as much as I could have. But this is a movie/trilogy NOT to be missed! 8/10Oh, and make sure you stay till the end of the credits! Don't worry it's no more than 5 minutes of credits, I believe, and it is worth it if you care about Keira and Bloom's characters (which Bloom is getting somewhat better with his believability, btw). I saw too many people get up and leave at the end of the film and probably had no clue of the last scene after the credits...lol.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I saw Pirates 3 last night as a premiere and the place was completely packed. It just goes to show what a classic and a cultural phenomenon this movie has become. Once again, the action, the characters, the storyline and the special effects have outdone themselves.You cannot go to this movie without the pure excitement and anticipation for what is to come. Funny, exhilarating, heartrenching and suspenseful this movie is the perfect summer blockbuster. Many did not enjoy the second part last summer but this one is a definite must-see. It brings us back to the joy of the first movie with all the laughs and action every kid in us loves to watch. I'll definitely miss Jack Sparrow, he has become one of the best Disney characters since Peter Pan. Someone who will never grow up, someone who always gets away with everything but someone we have come to love and someone we always root for to win.Enjoy the movie not for the script or acting but for the way it makes you feel. 10/10 BRAVO ... absolutely SAVVY!","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

It seems that everyone has a personal history or agenda that's the exact opposite of the other, so at times the confusion is mind-numbing if you pay too much attention to the plot line.But it's sheer fun as a summer blockbuster with the further exploits of Jack Sparrow, played to the hilt by JOHNNY DEPP with a devilish gleam in his eye-linered eyes. And the rest of the cast is perfect, all of them fully a part of the scheme of things by now and knowing exactly what their function is--or so it seems. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY is more beautiful than ever as the feisty heroine Elizabeth Swann and is given much more to do. ORLANDO BLOOM is back as Will Turner with significantly less to do but he looks good doing it.And you can't find better character acting than that provided by CHOW YUN FAT as Captain Sao Feng, brilliant in the Singapore scenes, STELLAN SKARSGARD as Bill Turner, KEVIN R. McNALLY as Gibbs--and most particularly BILL NIGHY as Davey Jones, hidden facially by gigantic tentacles that are just one of the many CGI ingredients. Still, behind all that make-up, he does a fantastic job.I enjoyed it twice as much as the second installment although it is quite a bit lengthier. But there's so much to see, so much action and so many strikingly beautiful visual scenes to gaze at that it's hard to take it all in at one sitting.If you're in the mood for a tale with plenty of swashbuckling adventures told with quirky originality, this is it. And once again, JOHNNY DEPP gets all of the humor and eccentricities out of Jack Sparrow that he possibly can. He's terrific.Summing up: Cap it all up with Hans Zimmer's glorious score and you have a real good summer blockbuster.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not a very satisfying ending to Will and Elizabeth's sub-story, which ends in this movie, and their absence from the fourth and the fifth movies makes those considerably less appealing.I should also say that my kiddos love (and are terrified by) the talking skull and crossbones at the main menu of the first three pirates movies - it addresses the audience directly, which is a nice touch. It's things like these that give these movies their overall sense of adventure.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

With its huge curved screen and superior stereo, this is the place where World Premiers are held and the best place to enjoy an over-sized epic movie.With low expectations set by the limp and lame Pirates 2 - Dead Man's Chest, we found Pirates 3 to be amazing and imaginative, keeping the viewer's interest from start to finish. However, there is absolutely no coherent plot, no character development, nothing but action and stunning scenes. Like almost all Jerry Bruckheimer films, you watch it and toss it away like a fast food wrapper. The filmmakers change the rules every few seconds: One minute a character is dead, the next he isn't; therefore suspense is eradicated. Any fair-minded person would rate this picture from 1 through 7. The large number of 10 ratings might be studio feed, as there is no way to prevent dishonest input and studios have been buying good reviews from newspapers for decades.This picture played some of the finest remaining single-screen houses in America: Washington's Uptown, Baltimore's Senator, New York's Zergfeld, Akron's Highland, LA's El Capitan. When the next big picture comes out (Harry Potter) do yourself a favor and see it in a good theater if your city still has one.

The fact that they shot it back-to-back with the second movie, and started filming without a script, made me twitch a little....and then, there was the fact that the second movie was just lacking. ""Dead Man's Chest"" came across as very labored and formulaic, whereas the first movie came across as ""This probably won't go anywhere, but let's make a fun pirate film and have a good time doing it."" After the success of the first movie, it seemed like Verbinski and his cast started taking the franchise seriously. Way too seriously. We had very formulaic, heavy-handed references to the first film, we had about a dozen too many rum jokes.But then...a miracle occurred. It's as if, by the time they got done filming the second movie, the cast and crew were so burned out that they said, ""Heck with it, let's just make a fun pirate movie"" once again.I, for one, am pleased with the results.Oh, it's not perfect. It's a little too long, and the Calypso subplot really doesn't seem to go anywhere, given the amount of screen time dedicated to it. The focus of the film is much more divided than the first two, and some fans may be annoyed that Barbossa gets most of the best lines.And in the end, none of that matters; it's fun, it's entertaining, it's crammed so full of clever little details and homages to other films (I particularly like the nod to Sergio Leone with the two musical lockets) that you can watch it over and over and see something new each time.If you want Deep And Serious Film-making, avoid this like the plague. If you want to kick back and wish you were a pirate for three hours, go see it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The script was all over the place and very little was explained. It was pretty strange. First of all, the introduction in Singapore held no value whatsoever. I have a strong feeling it was simply to put Chow Yung Phat in the movie. Naturally, he was great, but the first 30 minutes is pretty useless. They also never fully explain the opening sequence about the song and pieces of 8. Why is a child singing the song? What song is it - why exactly is it being sung? But I was writing to say that there will likely be a 4th - something about the Fountain of Youth, in which Will Turner can become mortal again so that he and Elizabeth Swann can actually be together. I have no actual proof of this, but it is rather the opinion of a film maker I know.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The setting ranges from Singapore to the ends of the earth and beyond. The actors include pirates from every conceivable sea-faring country in the world and every accent from London Cockney to Valley Girl California.Orlando Bloom, whether dead or alive, stirs the female heart to romance, even as cannonballs fly by enraptured faces amid pirate mayhem. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp rises from the dead to lead the Black Pearl to new miracles of bravery in the face of overwhelming forces, whether the English Navy out to stretch Johnny's neck or rival pirates, who want to merely eliminate the business competition.This is the latest of the trilogy of films called Pirates of the Caribbean, and it sustains all the energy of its predecessors in its battle scenes and with the originality of the dialog. In addition, the score for this film features splendidly performed and stirring orchestral music.Of course, the plot is murky, much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, with lots of fantastical creatures and situations. So, this film might be even better at the second viewing, as somewhat puzzling dialog and motifs begin to resolve.Ahoy and smartly there, me hearties, mates, and sea dogs. Don't miss boarding for this pirate voyage, and learn something at each new turn of the helm wheel at your favorite theater.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I love Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and addition of Keith Richards made the movie even funnier. There was an interesting plot and everything, but the problem of these sequels is that the whole crew is trying to make the movie bigger in every way. And that's almost never good. Huge battles between Good and Bad, big ships fighting against each other, in fact, everyone against the other ones. That makes the movie just megalomaniac. And then phrases like:'Oh, pirates, today, you're fighting for your freedom' are weird. On the other hand I have to admit, I always laughed at Davy Jones when he asked each dying person:'Do you fear death???.' That was great. I've said that the plot was good, but it was too full also. It was almost hard to concentrate on each fact. I don't blame Gore Verbinski for making the end not ""too sweet"". I think Johnny Depp kept the movie in the line of the first 2 movies. I consider the character of Jack Sparrow the best of all. Nevertheless, The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains for me as the best one...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The problem is that he alone couldn't make the whole movie, for such a Walt Disney epic needs a ""real"" hero : that's why we also have to bare the brave Will Turner and the beauty Elisabeth Swann that spoil a great part of the movie in order to bring back some morale and virtue into it. I have to say that it really bothered me in the second part, with all those unnecessary sub plots and this stupid story between Turner and his molusqued father. But, whereas I've heard the worst about the World End, I have to admit I was quite satisfied with the movie, at the condition to think at something else during at least one hour on the three the movie has to offer.First of all, Sparrow has an equal in this movie, lost in the second episode : the captain Barbosa, and all the scenes between Depp and Geoffrey Rush are hilarious. I don't know witch one of them is the meaner and carelessness character, but it's really fun to see such anti-heroes in a family feature. Plus, the movie is full of funny little details or sentences, that kept my attention awake during the all movie and make me spend a pleasant evening (Sparrow asking to his dad ""How's Mum ?"" or a poor pirate playing with his frozen toes for instance). Well, then, there's also big action scenes, stupid and countless sub plots, but the all thing stays pretty fun 'till the end, and even manage to give a enjoyable conclusion to the adventures of the Captain Jack Sparrow.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is the very definition of big-time Summer blockbuster fun, just as POTC 2 was. The pacing is excellent, the effects, sets, and costumes are spectacular, and the acting is good to very good. I just did not see the point of the opening scene, which is quite grim, compared to just about everything else in the movie.It was great to see Keith Richards finally make his appearance. I am of an age where I know very well who he is, and I thought he did a good job in his role. Of course, Johnny Depp was brilliant once again. I have been a fan of his for 15+ years, and it is gratifying to me to see him receive all of these accolades. The rest of the cast was fine, and I am a big Stellan Skarsgard fan, so it is always fun to see him.I felt that the early part of the film was quite daring in its imagery. The scenes of Capt. Jack in the featureless landscape were truly intriguing, and not something one sees in the usual popcorn movie. I loved the crabs, the 'Up is Down' scene, all of it. The transformation scenes later on were excellent, and the vortex was pretty darn cool. I was so busy enjoying the visuals and the sheer exuberance of the set-pieces, I did not even care that, most of the time, I had no idea what was going on, plot-wise. These POTC movies are just huge pinatas of movie fun, and I could not ask for more from a Summer franchise flick.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is all you could ask for in a pirate film.Entertaining for children yes, with all the action and funny moments, but it's only now as an adult I appreciated how much depth there was to the story. The narrative can be complex and at times you need to do a mental check to make sure you know where everyone's allegiances lay and who's motive is what, but it all comes together so nicely.Although technically playing 'secondary' characters, Rush and Nighy are the real stars of the film, playing Barbossa and Davy Jones, respectively. Given apt dialogue their characters shine. Bloom and Knightley can perhaps grate you with their interactions, through no fault of their own. The love interest would have been sufficiently encapsulated with the connection between Jones and Calypso, a beautiful bond being shown, and so the Swann-Turner dynamic, although relevant to the previous films, was just a touch too 'Disney'.The story is brilliant, script perfect, acting done well, visually superb, soundtrack on good form, and overall an excellent end to the 'original' trilogy. Can't ask for too much more.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Already we have seen ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Shrek the Third"" hit the theaters and do quite well. Now it time for a new one in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Does this movie have a chance at succeeding at the box office? Will it be a success or a failure? Read this review and find out for yourself.""At World's End"" takes place shortly after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" The crew members of the Black Pearl, with the help of Captain Barbossa and Tia Dalma, must set out to ""Davy Jones' Locker"" in order to save Jack Sparrow. In the mean time, Lord Cutler Beckett and the East India Trading Company has teamed up with Davy Jones to destroy every man, woman and child that has ever had anything to do with piracy. Now these pirates are forced to unite in order to keep living the way they do.If you are a fan of the first two, you will dig this movie. All of the great elements on the series are still here. The action scenes and special effects were even better this time around. The fantasy elements are still present. Jack Sparrow steals the show with every scene he is in, which is a big sign that his antics have not gone tiresome. Han Zimmer has another brilliant film score. This all means that if you liked the others, you will enjoy this.The acting was acceptable. Of course, Johnny Depp can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep. It was very nice to see Geoffrey Rush back in action as Caption Barbossa. Keira Knightley has improved a lot since the first film as Elizabeth Swann. Bill Nighy is wonderful as Davy Jones, even with all the CG. Newcomers Chow Yun-Fat (Captain Sao Feng) and Keith Richards (Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague) gave great contributions to the movie.A note to parents: this movie is the darkest and most adult of the series. There are a few scenes, biggest one in the first scene, which seemed strangely placed in a Disney flick. There are also some sexual innuendos in there as well. It definitely deserves the PG-13 rating. This film did not feel like a Disney movie, but then again, none of them do anyway. Nonetheless, if your kids can handle it take them because it is a great family flick.Overall, if you a fan of the first two, you will love these. This is just as enjoyable as the first two. This is one of the must-see movies on the big screen. If you did not like the other two, do not see it because you will not like it. One small plot hole was brought to this reviewer's attention after the movie ended but it is neither big nor noticeable so it is not a big deal. At the end of the movie, there was a lot of applause from the audience and it truly deserved it. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is extremely recommended! Don't forget to stay for the credits.","72 out of 139 found this helpful.

They seem to have made up for this by swamping us this time around with a variety of plot threads, none of which is remotely interesting, but the result is an inflated running-time of almost 3 hours! The multiple clashes, double-crosses, schemes, incarcerations – to say nothing of the myriad factions (and monsters) involved – necessitate an excessive amount of exposition, which I could feel made the audience I saw it with quite restless! Besides, its incongruous smattering of intellectual elements – multiple Johnny Depps, Stellan Skarskard’s repeated greeting – must have gone over the heads of most of its intended audience!! Still, I think that the lengthy surrealist sequence which belatedly introduces the Jack Sparrow character here is a very surprising highlight for a blockbuster film in this day and age.Even so, Depp and Orlando Bloom merely sleepwalk through their roles – but the film does make better use of Keira Knightley this time around. There‘s also the welcome (if hammy) return of Geoffrey Rush, while Chow-Yun-Fat’s Asian pirate gang adds a nice exotic touch (if little else). The repellent special effects aren’t as prominent as in the previous entry – but the black witch’s role (whose dialogue is largely unintelligible) is regrettably elevated to a major supporting one! The best moment is probably the 360-degree turn the ship makes, and the original wedding ceremony its most inventive bit. Overall, the film results in being more enjoyable than DEAD MAN’S CHEST – but the formula is clearly over-baked and, therefore, unpalatable in the long run…","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Dead Man's Chest, on the other hand, was a mild disappointment. It had many flaws and left you wondering what you just watched.At World's End is a great movie all-around. From the heart-wrenching opening scene, to the heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat sea battle, and of course the final scene before the credits (and don't forget the scene after the credits are over), AWE takes what was great of the first movie and takes it even further.The action is awesome in this film. Cannons, muskets, and the clang of swords are everywhere, but it doesn't go overboard, nor does it seem out of place (like that wheel-balancing sword-fight in Dead Man's Chest). It just seems right.But then there's the humor, that was ever-present in the Black Pearl, but seriously lacking in Dead Man's Chest. It's back, and boy is it great. Black Pearl became known for doing a great job at intertwining action and comedy, and At World's End brings it back and does a great job. Again, the comedy is no where out of place, and the timing is perfect.Those in the press who gave this movie a disappointing rating need to see it again, and actually pay attention. Those who go into this movie with the predisposition that it'll be disappointing will only find disappointment, and thus will miss the great experience that At World's End is. The storyline is beautifully done and leaves you wanting more.And to those who call this a finale, not so fast. There is plenty left open, plenty of questions to be answered, and the ending scene following the credits, along with the last scene before the credits is proof of this. Will they make a fourth Pirates? Who knows, but I'm hoping so, and that fourth Pirates would easily make a finale.With the resurrection of the comedy and action found in Curse of the Black Pearl and the elimination of many of the problems with Dead Man's Chest, At World's End is a great film that is going to be on my buy list when it hits store shelves (Blu-Ray, of course). I highly recommend this film for those who loved the first movie and either loved or even felt disappointed by the second.I give this film, its actors, actresses and crew, a 10 out of 10. Anything less would be piracy.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

Originally based on the Disney's ride by the same name, this movie franchise became lot more successful than its namesake amusement ride.The story seems to jump from the Dead Man's Chest. There's this alliances that's formed between Davy Jones, and Lord Beckett - what ? A strait man and a ghost forming alliance ? Kraken is dead, for no good reason. Jack Sparrow is in the nether land, but come back to life with all his flesh and bones glory. Capt. Barbossa also comes back to life for no apparent reason. This story is a veritable free for all in taking artistic license with its own material.When the story is so poorly disciplined, we lose focus, and start to care less about what happens. Because anything can happen by miracle in this story. The first Pirates of Caribbean was good, second was okay, but this one - I'm not sure - maybe so so ? It does maintain fun element that runs through this series, and that IMO is the best part of this movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The characters have been neutered, except for Elizabeth and the plot never really seems to know where it's going or even what it's doing in the present. Instead of high adventure we get a story that plays out like the actors all got together and wrote it by committee. The movie does have it's high points, most of which revolve around Jack Sparrow but unfortunately, Depp is lost in the maelstrom of the plot. The ending is silly and in my mind, Lord Beckett's behavior is contrary to his nature. If they do make a fourth film, hopefully they keep Jack and Barbosa and drop most of the rest.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Director Gore Verbinski and the bloated cast headed up by a hilarious Johnny Depp are all back for the rollicking ""closing"" of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy.Following the mantra of its predecessor (bigger, better, more), everything here attempts to one-up what has been seen before. With the exception of the sight gags (which are smaller and more plentiful in ""At World's End"" but nothing like the mind-boggling giant wheel or log-rolling scenes from ""Dead Man's Chest""), everything else is more, more, more. There's more characters (most notably Chow Yun Fat as the leader of a Singapore pirate gang), more plot (the double-crossings are so numerous as to make your head spin), more elaborate and wildly imaginative action set pieces and special effects (the boat flipping scene is especially good), more monkey and midget action, more jokes, more cameos (witness a seemingly un-made-up Keith Richards as Captain Teague), and most thankfully more macabre gallows humor and absurdity.Gore Verbinski has become a master of the modern action-adventure movie, finely tuning his skills here to rival an early era Steven Spielberg in his sense of visual scope. With these three films he is now an expert in the cadence of integrating computer effects with massive live stunts across sprawling set pieces. He truly deserves accolades for managing to get every character in on the action in the dazzling climactic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman in the middle of a giant maelstrom. There's also one amazing scene of the British Captain going down with his ship as it is cannon-balled into oblivion that in a more serious film would seem quite epic, but in the refreshing silliness of this series is just one more over-the-top element subverting the traditional tone of the Hollywood spectacle.""At World's End"" provides more fun bang for your buck than any ""third"" in a series since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" It made me feel like a kid again, but being so insanely indebted to the concept of ""MORE"" imagining the series continuing into a fourth installment would be truly gluttonous.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

Otherwise, borrow the DVD.

To see it twice would be an insult to any great film ever made. To see it a third time would most likely induce an uncontrollable fit of vomiting. This film is disgustingly, uproariously bad.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End stands as a stoic testament to the fact the millions of dollars worth of CGI B.S. doesn't equate to a worthwhile film. The plot of this film becomes so uselessly and uninterestingly convoluted that I wished my seat at the cinema had an ejector button. It isn't wonderfully convoluted like ""The Big Sleep"" or any other noted Film Noir, but rather the twisted, intangible web of double crosses and love dodecagons drags the film along tediously until its undeniably bathetic ending.The acting in this film is, at times, laughably terrible. Depp, as usual, is able to carry the weight of his role as is a competent Rush. Keira Knightly's acting is painfully bad. This is as simply as I can put it. Orlando Bloom does his darnedest to make everything sound dramatic and manages to maintain a squint for approximately 80% of the film's arduous duration so I have to give him an E for effort. It's a sad day in film-land when two day-players acting as 'wenches' give a more memorable performance than two of the main characters.If one were to make a documentary that drew attention to this film's every flat joke, empty promise and dismal piece of acting, it would be longer than the film itself, impossible as this may sound.","27 out of 45 found this helpful.

In this final installment, there are two tasks that the ""sort of"" good guys must tackle: rescue the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from ""Davy Jones Locker"" and fight the powerful British East India Trading Company (who are controlling the seas and forcing the Pirates out).I wish I had understood the above basic elements of the plot while actually watching the movie. It was really hard to understand what was going on and ""why"". I saw the previous two movies, but couldn't remember all the intricacies of what happened - nor remember the names of so many people and things that were referenced in this movie.However, like a ride at Disneyland, you can have a good time even if you don't quite get the background context. While much of the plot was confusing, the numerous little sub-plots were a little easier to understand - and a lot of fun to watch. There was never a still moment in the movie and many of the scenes were visually spectacular.If you're a big fan of the previous movies with a strong memory - you'll definitely get more out of it than the rest of us. For everyone else, don't try too hard to understand the ""big picture"" -- just sit back and enjoy the ride.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Plots and sub-plots come thick and fast and are discarded in a thrice. Maybe I am asking too much, decent script, prudent editing and a less buttock numbing running time would be nice. The story is very loosely based around rescuing Jack from Davey Jones locker and waging a war for Pirates rights (I think). The humour from the first of the franchise is largely absent, the much publicised cameo by Keith Richards cruelly squandered for want of a script and its chief villain Davy Jones(and the best thing in 2nd movie) hobbled by a lack of accompanying Kraken and being under the thumb of the Brits. What you are left with is a CGI spectacle which has its moments for sure, but leaves the movie a bit like Mr D. Jones himself, without a heart.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact, I'd give ""At World's End"" 9 stars, being every bit as entertaining as it was often overwhelming.It's quite an age we live in that visual effects have become so believable, as long as they're done correctly. Pirates 3 is no exception, it looks and **sounds** absolutely fantastic and makes it a superbly thrilling jaunt to view on the big screen with the big speakers.I braved Towson Commons to see it. Towson Commons has a bathroom with an inch of urine, a carpet eternally soaked in popcorn topping and coke, no legroom, often forgets to turn out the lights, and usually hosts people who wave their glowing camera-phones around or converse with characters on the screen as if they could hear them. (I saw it again tonight at the Senator. It stood up quite well to a second viewing, especially since there's so much to take in.) But I'll tell you something: this new Pirates film sucked me in so far, I forgot what theater I was in, and for a moment, that I was even in a theater, but in Davy Jone's Locker. ""2001″ is clearly an inspiration in Jack's purgatory, which isn't a bad thing. There's a later scene that pays homage to ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Very nice.The quirks of Sparrow's character are often amplified to ridiculousness, yet still stays absolutely true to the character. Depp deserves another Oscar nomination for his performance here, which in the trilogy as a whole has to go down as one of the finest comedic roles ever undertaken.The cinematography, production design, music, story continuity, and huge cast of characters who all work perfectly in concert with one another to create an engrossing escapade. That, and the pacing is excellent...this is a long movie but is so jam packed with forward-moving story and spectacle that you dread having to dip out to visit the men's room and even wish many of the story lines were continued a little further. Hopefully the DVD will have some deleted scenes of interest.I enjoyed this movie more than Spider-Man-3, while also offering a far grander scale of wonder and adventure To be fair, Spider-Man basically stayed on Manhattan island for the whole three hours, which is nice and all, I've just seen new york before. I know it exists. I haven't seen the (geographic) end of the world, or have any idea what ""Davy Jone's Locker"" looks like...now I know. This movie has a lot of creativity, and isn't afraid to do a lot of weird, almost art-house-y stuff.I also enjoyed all of the new characters and the development of the familiar ones - too many to mention - especially Chow's character. This is a dedicated actor who you can tell just by watching him that he is having a gas, while simultaneously totally believing he's a pirate lord (well, not totally, but well enough.) And then there's Captain Teague...well, he must be seen - not described. Please, don't listen to the critics who panned it or the people who were too lazy to follow the plot or connect the dots. This is what summer entertainment is all about.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

She was the center of almost the entire film, with the whole universe spinning around her. Personally, I think she was THE WEAKEST and MOST UNINTERESTING of every single character ever introduced since the opening credits of Pirates 1. She appears to have as much face time and lines as Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's character was too few and too far between. The film makers tried to make up lost time by ""duplicating"" a technique ripped from the pages of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.It is a very, very long movie with a great deal of talk and serious discussion of pirate politics that was near NPR quality. Keira Knightley was wonderful to look at despite of her ""Braveheart"" moment. The plot was incoherent with a great deal of emphasis extracting sympathy of piracy as a respectable, productive profession out of the audience.Still, it was not a miserable movie and any who enjoyed the first two will not regret watching the 3rd. With high production values, there was a lot to look at. Other supplemental characters truly pulled their weight and made Pirates 3 enjoyable.Highs: Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Yun-Fat Chow, and most supporting characters, production values.Lows: Talk, talk, talk.

Great action, if that's all you're into. And a continuing main plot from the others.The side plots were, however, kind of 'meh' in my opinion. Mainly my beef is with the Calypso plot. I'm not one to complain about a movie's length, but this plot would have cut down on movie length, and, considering the target audience was EVERYONE a shorter movie length would have been more fitting for the youngsters. It was still a good flick. Just that Calypso was kind of a lame side plot. Any other thoughts on this? I don't want to reveal thing for people who haven't seen the movie yet.Another thing that I found was for the amount of sword fights in the movie, there was a complete lack of blood. Even after impaling people, there is no blood, and Jack Sparrow still wipes his sword clean. I'm assuming it was for the PG-13 rating? Although, I would have thought PG-13 allowed for some blood.Overall, a good watch. A must watch for those who have seen the other two. Not sure that I'll be rushing to the stores to buy the trilogy when it comes out, since I don't own the other two on DVD. The best movie of the summer? Probably not.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The starting scene under the gallops and the brethren song chills you to the marrow and continues where the second Pirates part raised your hopes. And even to the middle of the movie you are fevering every second when you sail to Singapore, the World's End and see the piracy's end dawn under contracts and conspiracies. But then something strange happens: amid action and progressing story more and more scenes of ridicule start to show up and impede the flow of the story. I can understand the idea of picturing Jack Sparrow's lunacy, but as much as I like to see the two British deserters switch into pirates, this just kills the momentum. By the time, we witness the 20th gag in the middle of deaths and relationship dramas, you just can't help but roll your eyes and hope for some surprise in the end (well, no). We hit the (anti)climax when Will and Elizabeth get married in between killing half an army of pirates. Fortunately, they find time for the bride's kiss after stabbing two foes. Folks, THIS IS NOT A FUNNY PIRATE MOVIE, IT IS MAKING FUN OF PIRATE MOVIES! Probably I should have known better since Disney produced it, but the second part really raised my hopes for more. And catering the humor to kids does not really make sense in a PG13 rated movie, does it?Compared to the second part At World's End does not feel too long, just a little annoying, and you will find an alright ending, but it never reaches the originality and coherence of a story as Part I. Yes, the special effects are amazing, the locations stunning and the actors do a good job. They make up some deal for the -I say it again- INCOHERENCE of the story, but not enough: 6 out of 10I just wonder what this movie could have been..","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is mundane, unimaginative and basically a rehash of what we have already learned from 'Dead Man's Chest'. For a family adventure movie it is unforgivably boring, with long sections of humming & hawing punctuated only by brief action sequences that look like they've been shot by the 2nd Unit director in a couple of hours.The humor has been reduced to catchphrases, the script forcing Johnny Depp grind a likable character into the dust until it's nothing more than tiresome. The special effects while still excellent (notably Davy Jones' tentacles) offer nothing more than what we have already seen in the first two movies, and certainly nothing with even half the imagination of the original's moonlight skeletons. In a 3 hour 'event' movie it's shocking that not a single set-piece was in anyway noteworthy, from stunted opener to fizzling finale.Geoffrey Rush deserves an honorable mention for keeping me in my seat during what has to be one of the most contrived love scenes I've ever witnessed. His performance as Barbossa, the quintessential pirate is deserving of a far better movie. This alone will earn 'At World's End' its one star, but yet I still can't help feeling like I'm being ripped off.","21 out of 34 found this helpful.

The plot is all over the place, and the ships seem to travel the oceans faster than a modern speedboat, but it remains a daftly enjoyable romp, and worth the entry fee just to see Cap'n Jack Sparrow doing what he does. I was disappointed that, following all the hype, Chow Yun Fat's Singaporean pirate lord Sao Feng is actually little more than a cameo, and offers little to the actual action. Other than Sparrow, the star of the film is actually the monkey, whose misadventures are genuinely excellent. The film ends with a couple of surprises (always nice, considering how predictable most films are) and certainly puts all the bits in place for a fourth film, but if this is actually the end I think we can all say thanks for the ride and agree we had a good time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The initially negative reviews of At World's End had however, started to take its toll on me, I began to fear I was letting myself in for a huge letdown. What an absolute relief it is to say that At World's End is not only a great successor to the past two Pirates movie, but also a movie that I might eventually be able to consider the best in the series! Its an action packed, story stuffed, character motivated piece of cinema, it won't win Oscars (well apart from for Effects) but it know that. The biggest misunderstanding people have about the Pirates series is that it is aware its not the most amazing series ever. Its a series designed for pure popcorn entertainment. It doesn't bother being artsy fartsy, it just tells a damn good story with plenty of swash-buckle and comedy as well. Its a mixture of genres that makes this series work, and At World's End manages to masterfully pull it off again. Although I shall confess that the movie is a lot darker than the previous two entries, a fact made noticeably by the surprisingly nasty opening. Anyway At World's End is a truly brilliant movie, and the first great Blockbuster of the Summer so far.The characters of this movie have really developed now. And the cast itself have become so perfect in the roles. Johnny Depp once again is absolutely brilliant, he is the best pirate there has ever been in a movie. I suppose one moan from Dead Man's Chest is that Sparrow was often used purely for comedic effect. He was still absolutely brilliant, but he became a bit of a clown. Here he is much more as he was in Curse of the Black Pearl. He's clearly a genius, he's still absolutely barking mad, but the man is as clever and witty as ever. In Dead Man's Chest he showed this talent rarely, here he shows it all the time. Some of the best sequences of this movie have to be the ones in Davey Jones Locker, I won't spoil the sequence for anyone but that scene is hilarious and so odd it was amazing. One person who surprised me most in this movie was Keira Knightly, I've always found her passable in these movies, but never amazing. Here she does absolutely brilliant, I suppose its her character who has been on the biggest journey since the original movie. Her character is now fifty times better, her scenes towards the end are very well acted. Orlando Bloom has improved, his character seems wasted at some points in the movie, but towards the end I also realised how well he was actually doing. I was glad to see Geoffrey Rush back as Captain Barbossa, so many people have overlooked him in the original movie. Here he is almost as brilliant as Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy continues to be a menacing villain as Davey Jones, except here he has some genuine character moments that worked well. Oh hell the cast were perfect, no one lets the side down at all. The inclusion of Chow Yun Fat is a brilliant one, but my moan is that Jack Davenport features too little as Norrington. A shame as his character was perfect in Dead Man's Chest.The action sequences also impress mightily in this movie. The end action sequence will blow you away, its hinted at in the trailer, but you will never understand how amazing it is until you watch it. I won't go on too much about that since its best you see it for yourself. Instead I will talk about the opening sequence, yes it is reminiscent of the Jabba the Hutt sequence from Return of the Jedi, but its well done. For sequence not featuring Jack Sparrow it still stands out as one of the highlights in the movie. Some people might moan there is a lack of action until the finale, but its this lack of action that still manages to impress. The talkey sequences the critics have complained about are never, ever dull. The Davey Jones Locker sequence is priceless, Beckett's mission to exterminate the pirates is engaging, all the back stabbings entertain, and everything just pieces together nicely. Its been well planned out and the movie shows this. The plot concludes perfectly here, there is a little bit after the credits that adds another layer to it, its not necessary to stay and watch it but I would recommend it. So any negatives then? Well one might argue that the movie is a bit long at nearly three hours, others might moan about the dialogue not being the most incredible stuff in the entire world. My response to people who moan about stuff like that is that they would never have liked the movie anyway if they went in looking for flaws like that. This movie has flaws, but the epics scale, the humour and the action overshadow the flaws. This is a perfect ending for an almost perfect series. I'm certain we'll be seeing Pirates of the Caribbean 4 some time in the future, but if they did end it here then they will have gone out with a huge bang rather than a whimper like a lot of other series.","30 out of 58 found this helpful.

Once that is over, the entire movie is taken over by a theme never as strong in the series as now- Every man for himself. Every main character in this film has his/her own agenda and will stop at nothing to reach their goal. By the climactic scene, you don't know what the heck's going on. One of the funniest scenes is right after they rescue Jack: Will, Elizabeth, Barbosa, and Jack all instantly point their guns at each other. After a moment, they laugh and let them down- then they all aim at each other suspiciously once more. In this simple scene, we find the heart of the movie.Everyone is back for this final installment. Orlando Bloom plays a rather selfish Will Turner. Kiera Knightly plays a much more stand out of an Elizabeth. Then of course, there's the infallible Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa, and the now-legendary performance of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy, Naomie Harris, and Kevin McNally all contribute nicely as well. Truly, the cast is never a problem at all. This films main problem is that it is so damn confusing! Throughout, there are about twelve hundred different stories involved, and by the end we just have to assume that it is all resolved. We can't really tell what exactly happened.But....The movie does not fail for this. It's hard to dislike the movie, for the same reason (in my opinion) that the series has been saved all along: It's a pirates movie with probably the best actor's who could possibly bring it to screen. What more do you want? It's the kind of fun film-making that in this day and age has mostly disappeared from the theaters. So, despite plot holes galore, hard to follow story lines, and more, we still like this movie. And we'll still continue to like it. There's probably not too much they could have done to make people dislike this movie. Honestly, I enjoy loving it for no real reason. They're just fun to watch! So, the Pirates of the Caribbean comes to an end with a final film that stays true what has been the creedo of the films all along: We're here to have fun. That's why we love these movies. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Was it fun? Yes. Was it something I would watch again? Sure.It was however, much like most 3rd films in trilogies these days, and that is one word.....disappointing.Part of the disappointment lies in the fact that this movie was drawn out so much longer than it had to be. It was as if they put some parts in there just to fill time. Seriously, had they cut it down 30-40 minutes this movie would have been much much better.The acting from Johnny Depp was even a bit bizarre at times.

I think they actually did a good job creating a mythos almost entirely out of whole cloth, while remaining true to the feel of the children's' tales that inspired the trilogy in the first place. Some people walking out of the theater complained that the story was random but what they really meant was ""complex"" -- you have to dive into the mythos for it to work and you have to connect some dots yourself.Those who compare this to Matrix:Revolutions are off base. There is one thread that is not tied as well as might be hoped, but most of the important ones are drawn tight. Like any good epic, the Pirates trilogy started local and small and evolved to more grand stages as it progressed. Meanwhile the characters did flesh out somewhat -- everyone at least and at last seems to have a real motivation -- and the sense of Something Big Changing comes through clearly.Pulling off a third movie is always hard, but I think the producers came through on this one. It's no Return of the King but it does a nice job nonetheless.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

After Spider-Man and Shrek, it is time to say goodbye to Pirates of the Caribbean (and Jason Bourne will follow in a few months), although, like many other number 3s, At World's End vaguely suggests a fourth movie would not be impossible to make (and we will see what Bruckheimer thinks about it once the cash starts rolling in). Still, should this be the last Pirates, it isn't a bad epilogue, though not a truly brilliant one either.Picking up about a month after the events of Dead Man's Chest, the third episode opens on a surprisingly dark note: with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) ""dead"" (actually, he's stuck in some sort of Purgatory) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) working for Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), piracy is facing extinction, as shown in the prologue, where dozens of people, including a young boy, are hung without a fair trial. All hope is not lost, though, as a small group of rebels, led by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is reuniting pirate leaders from all over the world to come up with a plan to get back their control over the sea. The only problem is, one player is missing: time to bring Jack back...That is when the film really starts: no offense to the rest of the cast, but POTC's success depends entirely on Johnny Depp, and so it is slightly frustrating to have to wait half an hour for his entrance. But once he arrives, it was completely worth the wait: adding new nuances and quirks to the character, Depp is shamelessly entertaining from start to finish, whether he is talking to himself (the ""multiple Jacks"" scenes are hilarious) or interacting with others (especially Rush and Knightley). His charisma is what keeps the movie on track, especially in the third act, where it is all too obvious writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio finished the script when filming had already begun: some inconsistencies are given a rushed (and a little pompous) explanation (e.g. how come Jack's resurrection was much more complicated than Barbossa's ?), others are not explained at all, and while it is a joy to see the balance between action (Black Pearl vs. Flying Dutchman: a visual treat) and laughs (the two moronic soldiers from the first film finally return after an inexplicable absence in Dead Man's Chest, and Keith Richards' cameo is comedy gold as expected) is intact, the story's complexity seems to slip out of control in places, probably because unlike Sam Raimi, who constructed the similarly flawed Spider-Man 3 starting from elements he had introduced in the first two films, the writing duo behind Pirates created a huge mythology almost separately from the first installment. Whereas Curse of the Black Pearl featured only one ambiguous character (Captain Sparrow) in an otherwise linear series of events, this time everyone betrays everyone, making At World's End move from twist to twist, even after the climactic showdown, providing an extra fifteen minutes (and the entire film lasts almost three hours) that are, for the most part, skippable.And yet I liked the movie, and I am willing to forgive those missteps. Why? Because at the end of this overblown, but spectacular and tremendously fun ride, everyone realizes what Pirates of the Caribbean was about in the first place: the trilogy started with Jack, and it ends (?) with Jack. And that, my friends, is good enough to justify the excessive running time.6,5/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The acting of all actors seems to have increased in power by a tenfold and unlike PotC2:DMC you've always got the feeling the story is going somewhere. The plot involves brilliant turns and switches of loyalty, a powerful - extremely striking range of moments and an overwhelming ending.The movie does what PotC2 failed to give: It gives a real story, new jokes (some rather good ones at that too) and an ending.Although they open a door for a fourth movie a bit weakly, hey, such a successful franchise, come on, of course they kick in a door for part four.Oh yes, the stories of Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones, Tia Dalma, Will Turner and his father, James Norrington and Elizabeth Swann continue in a way we might not have predicted in part two. The story continues at the journey to and beyond World's End to return 'witty Jack' to life, and then continues on with the pirates uniting to save pirates life as a whole from Lord Becketts 'good intentions'. Since Lord Beckett holds the Dead Mans Chest, he also holds the Flying Dutchmans' captain under his command. Jack, Will and Elizabeth thus find themselves sometimes united, but usually betraying each other - and however always friends - facing troubles that are beyond their solving.The story this time also is far more complicated (according to a lot of people even too complicated) - but it gives a more than satisfactory closing for the stories we've witnessed up till now. The movie is dark, darker even than PotC2:DMZ - but having the pirates as a source of light is always fun to watch.The sea- and sword battles, loyalty issues and 'pirates life' are brought into view brilliantly under a beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. A recommendation to anyone who wants to see a entertaining movie, Jack Sparrow fans, Orlando Bloom fans (you did't think the girls really went to see something else?), Pirates fans and cinema fans.The film is a satisfactory conclusion to all the story lines and I, too, can do nothing but praise the design, cinematography, visual effects and music. The best Pirates movie ever? In my opinion: Definitely.","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

I would love to see pirates open to a weekend tally that makes spider man look like the little spider it should because i mean yes don't get me wrong the movie was OK good but the first at and second were done so much better and had a more interesting plot. Another thing is why do the critics always kill a movie and give it 2 stars and see the only people in the world who can't follow and a movie but a 5 year old can?

Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is stuck in Davy Jones' Locker, located somewhere off the map, for eternity. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightingly), and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) must travel to this location and save our favorite pirate, in a plot that is somewhat overblown with too many characters, plot twists, and impulses of randomness. Besides being overloaded with just a little too much of everything, 'Pirates' is also much longer than necessary at a running time of nearly three hours. What powers 'Pirates' is not the plot, but the visuals. What's really amazing about the movie is use of special effects. From a ship full of Johnny Depp's to a climactic battle literally at the world's end, 'Pirates' never fails from continuously dropping the jaws of moviegoers. Though for me, the whole 'Pirates' idea is a little old, and with an ending implying a forth, it seems like money is all the franchise has in mind, I still enjoyed the movie thoroughly. The movie will make you want to doze off during any inaction, and want to wait for the action to start up again, but make sure that you don't doze off during the sessions of dialog, for you will find yourself quite lost. So pay attention, or after the movie you'll say to yourself, ""Wait...what just happened!?"" The bottom line is: 'At World's End' is better that 'Dead Man's Chest', but not as good as 'The Curse of the Black Pearl.' ***1/2 of *****","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because that's what you have in 'Pirates 3'. The graphics were definitely superb, a lot better than those in Spider-Man 3, as well lots of action to keep you on the edge of your seat.Another interesting thing in this movie is that it has a lot more innovation than the previous film in the series. There are a lot of new camera tricks that they do that could be described as quite abstract yet artistic, which contributes greatly to the film's cinematography, which is another thing I found to be quite well done. Not only that, but the funny moments in this one are quite original, unlike those in 'Dead Man's Chest' which were recycled from the first film.Despite the great CGI, action, cinematography...and even acting, this movie did not live up to my expectations in terms of the story. I personally think that they went totally overboard with the complexity of the story that it just became too confusing and too hard to follow. At the end of the movie, you're bound to have a discussion with your friends about why some of the events in the movie actually happened. I also didn't like certain story elements, like Calypso for example, which seemed to not have any use in the story.Lastly, the film was just too darn long! There were a lot of very long and slow scenes, as well as useless scenes that do nothing more than add to the complexity of the movie, which it definitely doesn't need. If some of those were a bit trimmed and made the movie simpler for audiences, I'd give it a higher rating.All in all, I'm giving it a 7.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But after that, the movie goes down. Way down. There's all these little things flying around that try to come together, but most of the time I was scratching my head, despite having seen the previous two movies.There is, of course, bright spots. When Johnny Depp FINALLY comes back, the movie becomes more interesting. The English antagonist is decidedly evil and plotting, and there are back stabs throughout the movie.Really, it aspires to be an epic pirate movie, but there's too much wind for its sails.There are some awe-inspiring and epic scenes, no doubt, but the movie as a whole will leave anyone but the most die-hard fans (which by from the ratings are many) wanting to walk this Pirate's plank.","24 out of 40 found this helpful.

The first movie is still one of my all-time favorites. It had everything -- suspense, romance, action, fantasy, comedy, special effects, great characters, hot actors and actresses, etc. I jumped on the pirate bandwagon instantly and still love the first as much as I did back in the day. The second one was OK. It had too many subplots, but it was still kind of enjoyable. The third? Terrible. Atrocious. A monstrosity. I kid you not, it was that bad. I was so excited to see it that I stayed up all night and fought intense pirate-garbed traffic to see it at midnight on Thursday. Words can not express how disappointed I was in this movie and how disgusted I was after seeing it. I had to take a shower to cleanse myself of this filth.There were just too many subplots that honestly made no sense whatsoever. The second one had a lot, but at least the rest of the movie was slightly enjoyable. Now I've watched deep movies like ""The Departed"" or ""Crash"" with no problem, but this one was impossible to follow. I am not an idiot, but this movie gave me an enormous headache. This guy's bad, no, he isn't, he is, no, he pretended, he pretended to pretend, she found out, they're mad, he's good, maybe, they'll make up, maybe, no, bomb falls, what? Maybe he is, I guess not, yes, no. She loves him, no wait, he loves her, no wait, this happened and made it crazy, never mind, OK, yes, no, maybe........ HUH?! Turns out that everyone else I've talked to about this movie was also confused. It had no coherence, much less a point. Stuff came out of nowhere and random things popped up that made no sense. Seriously.The only redeeming qualities about this movie were the Johnny Depp comedy scenes and the fact that Kiera gets a bigger part than just sitting there and screaming. That's it.From one pirate fan to another (perhaps), only see this movie if you're a die-hard fan, and I mean a DIE-HARD FAN. If you're only a semi-fan, wait for the DVD. It really is not worth going to the theater unless you'll die if you don't see this movie. Personally, I saw it because I wanted to see it before some idiot had the chance to spoil anything for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Me 11-year-old daughter did think that this movie was ""awesome,"" me buckos, but even she thought it was too long, just shy of three hours, and both of us had trouble following the plot. After about half an hour, I lost track of the dizzying succession of moves and countermoves, plots and counterplots, crosses and double-crosses. And it turns out that there was a post-credits scene that we missed, so ready were we to get out of there after the film ended. Unfortunately, constructing a comprehensible plot line seems to have been a lower priority---and got less of the budget---than the costumes, sets, special effects, and score, all of which seemed intended to assault the senses. I was disappointed to see that for all the effort at creating ""realistic"" visuals, the movie starts out with an anachronism: It opens in a Chinese bath house in Singapore, and soon after, British soldiers in the employ of the East India Company attack. Now, everything about the ""Pirates"" films---the clothing styles, the ships, the technology, the historical references---places them squarely in the much-romanticized Golden Age of Piracy. But owing to a major crackdown by Britain and the other European powers, this period was pretty much over by the 1720s. The British colony of Singapore would not be established by the British East India Company for another century (1819). Before that, it was an undistinguished fishing village inhabited by native Malays, not by the Chinese, who came in after the British.But no matter: ""At World's End"" fairly drips (and I mean drips) with atmosphere, me hearties. There are more than enough pirate ships, creaking decks, steam-filled bath houses, stormy seas, long hair, shaven heads, leather, bad teeth, sweat, scarred, craggy faces, false eyeballs, powdered wigs, scimitars and sabers, whizzing cannon and pistol balls, splintering wood, fantastic monsters, and heathen spirits to go around. Great sea battles are fought in which ships are blown up with such frequency and regularity that you wonder that anything is left afloat, yet the characters hardly seem to notice. You can tell when the big action scenes are beginning, because when they do, it always starts to rain.Johnny Depp's semi-dandified portrayal of Jack Sparrow, and his faux British accent, are definitely wearing thin. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, by playing it straight, are much more enjoyable. But to have their characters marry each other in the middle of an all-out sea battle (in the rain, of course) stretches credulity way past the snapping point. Yo ho ho, lots of exasperated scoffing from the audience we were among here, cap'n. Geoffrey Rush is essentially doing a modified Long John Silver impersonation as Captain Barbossa. Keith Richards plays Captain Teague, Jack Sparrow's father and the keeper of the Pirates' Code for the Brethren Court. It is shocking to see his old, lined, craggy face; he has a ""smoker's face"" and a ""smoker's voice."" I have always figured that it would not be the drugs of his youth that would kill him, but rather his tobacco abuse. Chow Yun-Fat, who despite his history of acting in extremely violent films is a very likable actor, mugs so outrageously for the camera in his role as Sao Feng that it reminded me of James Finlayson in the old Laurel and Hardy movies. And half a century of BBC costume dramas notwithstanding, nobody really sounded like that, mateys; the familiar ""standard"" British accent, with its dropped R's and its forward-shifted vowels, did not gain any general currency in Britain until the 19th century; before that, it was actually considered vulgar.This film definitely looks and sounds impressive on the big screen, but if you wait till it comes out on video, you'll be able to take breaks when it all gets to be too much, and you'll also be able to run it back and watch parts again when you are trying to figure out what on earth is going on. (Maybe they planned it that way.) What really depresses me is that for most of the prodigiously ignorant American children of the past few generations, this is as close as they will ever get to Robert Louis Stevenson, Herman Melville, or Daniel Defoe.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Beckett is now in control of Jones' heart and they form a dark alliance to rule the sea and destroying every pirate in sight. Now Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma (Noamie Harris) and the crew call go see the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the world. Including the infamous Soa Fong (Chow-Yun Fat) for help. The pirate lords wants to release the goddess Calypso, Danny Jones' damned lover. Which they wants to trip her out of fear and Pirate Lords needs to combine the nine special pieces to release her by starting a ritual. With the power of Calyspo, the pirates all stand together to face a final showdown with their powerful enemies.Directed by Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt, The Ring ""2002"", The Weather Man) made an amusing, fantasy, action-adventure with plenty of humour and excitement. Deep is amusing as ever in the lead role. Oscar-Winner:Rush is a nice return as Captain Barbossa also. Chow-Yun Fat is good in a small supporting role. This has excellent production designs, spectacular visual effects and an enchaining cast. This film is an improvement over the complicated second film and Probably even better than the first film. The movie is long to be sure but entertaining just the same with an eye-popping climax. Keith Richards from ""The Rolling Stones"" appears in a fun cameo as Jack Sparrow's father.

The good news is that if you go in not expecting much, it actually is not a bad movie. It is quite long - almost 3 hours. It's probably an hour too long, and I am still not sure why they had to go to Singapore in the first place (could have rewritten that part to cut 50 minutes off). However, the special effects are spectacular, all the favorite characters looked great. And of course, Jack Sparrow gets extra screen time. The problem is that they tried to have too many stories weaving in and out of the main plot. There was multiple events happening at once, and I am not sure if that's a good thing in an action flick like this. Also, there was more action and not as much light-hearted humor as compared to the original, which made the movie felt even longer. Overall, it's not a must-see movie if you haven't watched the previous Pirates. However, it's good eye candy for 3 hours if you've seen them or just like the main characters. Just sit back and enjoy, and not worry about too much about the plot. P.S. There is a little clip at the end if you sit past the looong credit list. And yes, Keith Richard really looks like Jack's father, hehe (they must have used tons of makeup on him b/c he actually look pretty OK).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Depp is good, Kiera Knightley useless because she gets too much screen time, plus she doesn't ever look very hot. Orlando Bloom is confused and confusing. Finale disappointing, ending is confused. Action disappointing (way too OTT, and not in a fun way like the spinning wheel in II). Also whatever military strategy is involved is hopeless, but I suppose that is to be expected. Locations and foreigners all a bit pointless. Too much talk of ""true love"" and ""freedom"" as a way to pad length. Secondary characters also get way too much screen time, revealing their flatness.However, many moments are stirring (beginning is wild) and Pirates remains a fantastic franchise.

Excellent acting performances were delivered in the leading roles, and the cinematography was very impressive. CGI seamlessly blended in with reality throughout this impressive film, and it is hard to distinguish reality from the pirate world we are swept into during the course of this movie.I absolutely loved the 1st Pirates, but the second one was a bit overdone and just didn't work for me; there were dull moments and weaknesses in the story line of #2. This third installment, however, was quite possibly the best of the three. The first was hard to compare with, because it was something entirely new, yet this one takes the series to an entirely different level. At World's End is among the best movies to come out in modern times with respect to musical score, special effects, and creativity of story line. Jonny Depp also delivers one of his best performances 'till date in this one.The level of imagination went into the story was remarkable, and what great promise has been established for future sequels! I was especially impressed to see how well the various qualities of this production were seamlessly intertwined to deliver an exhilarating, uplifting, and awe-inspiring journey from beginning to end. Don't hesitate going to see this one on the BIG SCREEN. It is one to remember.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), Captain Barbossa (Rush) and Will Turner (Bloom) are back in what amounts to a series of adventures, misadventures and somewhat confusing double-crosses. Basically, Lord Beckett now controls the seas having Davy Jones (Nighy) and the powerful ship The Flying Dutchman under his control. The film basically follows the Swann, Turner and Barbossa as they try and save Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and stop Beckett and Jones from ending piracy and sea freedom forever.The strong points of the film by far are Depp's performance and the visuals. The photography, art and set direction are all terrific combining picturesque ocean scenes with detailed seeded locales (Shanghai and the pirate hangout) that look like they are out of ""Blade Runner"" or ""Star Wars"" only on the seven seas. Then, Johnny Depp does a great job once again as the goofy and eccentric Jack Sparrow. Depp adds some needed humor and lightheartedness to what is a bit overlong affair.The weaknesses of the film, in my opinion, are that because it has several story lines going at once and it needs to combine them altogether by the end into fitting denouement, the film ultimately gets a bit muddled and confusing. Some of the stories and characters end abruptly and other scenes seemed rushed or done as plot devices rather than anything else. As just one example, Swann's escape off of the Flying Dutchman is beyond making any bit of sense. Other than Bootstrap, where is anybody??? Plus, a few of the scenes near the conclusion are a bit heavy-handed and sometimes tacky.All these complaints aside though, everything you expect and want from your comedy/adventure movies are here, some solid action, funny characters and scenes and at least one great performance (Depp). While the film is a bit too long at 2 hours and 47 minutes, it doesn't always feel that long, during the action and comedy sequences the film moves at a steady pace, it's only in some of the dialogue heavy moments that the film really slows. Ultimately, I give ""Pirates 3"" a somewhat generous 7 out of 10, it is a bit slow and heavy-handed, but you certainly get your money's worth.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well let me be the first to say that if you found this trilogy at all confusing, you need to take an IQ test and review your life, not to mention your lack of credibility for being a critic. This movie was absolutely fantastic, and like the second one, which I thought was the greatest action/adventure movie of all time, this delivers everything you could expect from a fitting end, and more. As much as I thought the second one was superior to part 1, I think this might have been as good as part 2, if not better. This is due largely to the fact that Barbossa was in this one and he was tremendous. Furthermore, to the people that think episode one was the best. It was great and fun, but they went miles above and beyond expectations when they created a deeper, darker storyline that turned this into an epic action/adventure trilogy. I saw At World's end at the 8 oclock showing and I was blown away. This may be have been the best trilogy ever made, with the exception of Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars.

At first this seemed a highly inappropriate image to impose on the viewers of this third (and possibly final) ""Pirates"" film. However, upon further thought, it seems Gore Verbinski, the helmer of all three films, has brought into the spotlight a theme shrouded in the background of the previous two films: hanging, gallows, and general death. In the first film, Jack Sparrow paddles by an area near the port, where a small clan of pirates (they are now skeletons) are hung, with a sign across all of them: PIRATES, YE BE WARNED. And since that, there have been encounters, and near interaction with the gallows and the nooses, but none have proved fatal just yet. In showing us the stark image of a noose, Mr. Verbinski also mentally prepares us for a heady film, full of swords, brine, and a surprising amount of pathos.At the end of ""Dead Man's Chest"", Jack Sparrow dives into the awaiting mouth of the Kraken, sacrificing himself for his fellow pirates. We then learn that it is the mission and determination of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and the apparently-undead Captain Barbosa, to rescue Jack, and in doing so, the world. This is a brilliant set up for the next film, but it is not used in ""At World's End"" as well as it could have been. And the film's producers are not trying to convince you otherwise; in trailers for the film Jack Sparrow is heavily featured. This is understandable, as he is rescued (by his cohorts and by himself) within the first hour of the film, of which there are nearly three. From then on, it is the mission of Jack and his crew to find Davy Jones (the always-awesome Bill Nighy) and set his record straight with the man; however, it is Will's determination to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) from Davy Jones' locker. Those are the two main plot lines, and they are constantly intertwined with the other more diminutive ones, like those involving the elusive East India Trading Company.As was proved in the first two films, Mr. Verbinski has an adept hand with CGI effects; his combination of live-action photography and computer animation is seamless, to say the least. I mean, a major character's face is completely computer-rendered, and yet that character is the most emotionally readable of them all! However, Mr. Verbinski's talent is not equaled within the writing staff. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who co-wrote the first film with two others, and co-wrote the second picture themselves have penned this most recent script, which is long, contrived, and generally unfunny. The plot takes the first hour of the film to really kick into gear (it is supported mostly by a long action sequence in Singapore to jumpstart the film) and even when it does start to move, the film always seems tired and deflated. The ""Pirates"" series has evolved much like the Kraken monster: in the second film, it was smooth, intense and supremely entertaining, and the third film is a dieing pile of skin and suckers lieing on an empty beach somewhere outside of Aruba; the breathtaking visuals are still intact, but, thanks to the actors and screenwriters, there is no spirit behind them, and the film is just a gaseous treatise, exhaling its final guttural moans, giving the world a few final toots of its horn, before its penultimate extinction.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Regrettably, tho, the third installment is not up to the first two. That's possibly because the writers attempt to squeeze too much into the finale. The complex intertwining of plots in this concluding part makes the story hard to follow; the viewer has to work. The sub-plots carry some degree of contradiction to earlier established/implied story lines. Other sub-plots go beyond the movie's (until now) acceptable ""over the top"" style, creates a performance that will leave some viewers ""jaded.""

I did somewhat enjoy this film but I only enjoyed the imagery and practically nothing else. The characters of the first film were hardly recognizable in this and it was not a good thing. Jack Sparrow just didn't seem to have that comedic attitude as before and the parts were suppose to be funny just weren't. The character of Elizabeth seemed to be mostly out for herself and nothing more. I will say that Will was mostly the same, an idiot, but at least before his idiocy was charming and entertaining. In this film I did not really care whether he was there or not. Davey Jones was better than before but, I still didn't find him all that great. I will say that the only character that I felt stayed rather awesome was Barbosa, he was cool. Overall I just wanted the movie to end after about 2 hours, and whenever there was a lame attempt at something funny I just had to think back to the times of the first to keep me from falling asleep. I also thought the first movie was great for young and old alike because of the cheesy but still fun battles. The battles in this movie were all huge spectacles, which are cool, but I wanted another Jack/Will sword fight in the blacksmith shop. I am not going to get into the plot because it has been done in all the other comments, but I will say it was way to complicated especially when thinking of the younger audience members.I really wanted to like this movie, and tried again and again throughout the film to like it but just couldn't. I think the only part that I really liked was when Jack was back on the sunny port being himself and not being pulled into the boring Gray abyss of Davey Jones locker.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I know, because I'm one of them.And good or bad, it was never going to benefit from the sheer surprise factor of the original smash hit -- like it or not, ""Pirates"" is a franchise now, and the public knows what to expect. Bigger-better-badder: a sequel has nowhere to go but to up the ante, with more ships, more characters and more supernatural spookery.The good news is -- this time round, it works, more or less.Ten minutes in, and I was thinking 'they've blown it again'; flashy camera-work, showy stunts, suspect history, pieces of eight -- but not an ounce of magic. The film appeared to be going through the motions of a standard Hollywood blockbuster, but it was just too crowded, loud and perfunctory to raise a smile, let alone to raise hearts.Cut to desolation. Cut to empty salt. Cut to one man -- however many of him there are -- and with room to expand and to breathe, the film finally finds its feet, and its salvation. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised; after all, the first film was little more than historical pastiche.... until it hit upon Captain Jack Sparrow.Jack's back, and this time the writers seem to have got a grip on what makes the character effective. In ""Dead Man's Chest"", too often he came across as a caricature, trying too hard to recapture the accidental appeal of the first film. Here, by luck or judgement, he pulls it off as of old. Playing it solo in his first scene here -- given time for action, reaction and disgusted response -- Johnny Depp turns in one of the best sequences in the whole film.Escalation is always a risky business, and ""At World's End"" undoubtedly suffers from too much plot. (Ironically, it also has large holes; Cutler Beckett remains a cipher throughout, with no clue as to his history and actions save his apparent incarnation of ""good business"". His end is as blank and unexplained as his origins.) However, the film gets away with escalating its supernatural element still further, with a trip past the end of the world and the invocation of the goddess who first set Davy Jones on his grisly path. It even manages to establish Elizabeth Swann in an improbable ascendancy via a series of plausible explanations, rather than by straining the feminist superhero line too far -- although I still find her sudden acquisition of two-handed swordsmanship from the second film a trifle hard to swallow! Unlike its immediate predecessor, the picture generally avoids the gratuitous set-piece sequences that produced the impression that we were watching the game of the film: no pirate kebab, three-way duel or water-wheel balancing here. There is some rather over-the-top flying around the rigging, but at least there's some swashbuckling precedent to that -- although not quite to this (computer-generated?) extreme...The body-count is lavish, mainly of the usual anonymous extras of whom every ship seems to carry an enormous number... but named characters are not immune either, and the film isn't afraid to deliver one or two real jolts which considerably raise its impact. About halfway through we think we know what's going to happen (it's been pretty plainly telegraphed, and neatly ties up the ends): well, it doesn't.This film isn't as confused as ""Dead Man's Chest"" and I'd say that it has better dialogue, although most of the resonant lines go to Barbossa and Tia Dalma. Due to the vast cast list (frankly, too large) most of the characters get relatively little time on-screen, their motivations being assumed to have been set up in the previous film; and since most of the motivation-setting was fairly turgid stuff, this is an improvement. The major disappointment is Keira Knightley, who has a fairly major role and produces a number of dismally flat line readings at various points in the process: her hoydenish Elizabeth in the first film was more credible than her pirate part here.Overall, I think this was a project too ambitious, and if there are more spin-offs to come, as I dare say there will be, the producers would do well to learn the lesson and stick to one treasure, one curse, and one adversary at a time.

Those films that are so highly anticipated all winter long that millions of people around the world flock to cinemas and spend millions and millions of dollars just to see what all the buzz is about. Fortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is worth the price of admission. Director Gore Verbinski did the right thing in holding true to the story, bringing back all of the characters and not introducing too many new ones.When we last left our band of pirates, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was eat by the Cracken, a giant squid that terrorizes sea-faring vessels, and was sent to Davey Jones Locker. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and the rest of their pirate brigade, must bring together all of the pirate lords from the four corners of the world and try to combat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company for control over the seas. There is one problem; Depp is one of the pirate lords and all nine are needed.The crew must travel to the end of the world to get Depp and bring him back to complete the Pirate counsel and make a decision on what to do about Davey Jones. They all band together along with Chow-Yun Fat as Captain Sao Feng whose pirates derive from Singapore.The first half of the film is dry in parts, but with Depp and Rush back at the helm, it is hard to go wrong. There are some very interesting scenes with Depp battling his own conscience and trying to stay ""sane"". The second half really picks up and erupts into a climactic battle of epic proportions on the open sea.The flow of the film is steady and twists and turns enough to slightly confuse you, but in the end it all makes sense and that feeling of being lost is gone. Alliances are broken and new ones are formed as the final showdown gathers into a fantastic storm of edge of your seat action.Verbinski finishes off the trilogy using the same techniques that worked on the two previous films; a hefty dose of computer effects and witty one liners. Additional swooping shots showcase the grand scale of the film and how far Verbinski and Disney Pctures goes to bring this world to life.The one downside like the second film in the series had was the running time. This one goes for a whopping 168 minutes and it hits you. After the final frame, a feeling of exhaustion sweeps over you. DON'T LEAVE AFTER THE CREDITS! Stay for the bonus scene. It gives the series a nice wrap up.No, there shouldn't be a Pirates of the Caribbean 4. Like all blockbuster hits, there is a limit to how far you can go (i.e. Jurassic Park. Love the first, not the rest). At World's End is a solid finale to one of the most successful trilogies of all time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film could be drastically improved--but not saved--by cutting out an hour. Or maybe even an hour and a half. And that is not a complaint that I have too often. I don't mind long movies. But this one just drags and drags and drags. And I don't mind slow movies either. But the ""plot""--if you can even call it that--is much too convoluted. There are too many things going on at any given time for you too actually care what happens to any of the characters.And if you haven't seen the first two films, do not see this one. You will have no idea what is going on. You would think that with 3 hours the writers could properly introduce you to all of the characters. But you would be wrong.Obviously, this movie will have a huge opening weekend. But look for it to drastically drop off on its second weekend as word of mouth spreads. Just like Spider-Man 3.This movie epitomizes everything wrong with Hollywood today. There is way too much time spent on over-the-top action. And almost no time spent on characterization. Every year movie theater attendance goes down, and every year ticket prices go up. And this film will only worsen that problem. There will be tons of people who walk out of the theater and say ""That definitely wasn't worth my time or money."" And it will probably be a while before they make a trip to the theater again.If the major studios would concentrate on making quality films, every thing else would take care of itself.","47 out of 86 found this helpful.

They just had to write a solid and simple plot line, keep the movie to under two hours, then let the great cast and special effects have some fun. To screw it up as badly as this, well that really must have taken some effort. How can you walk in to the production phase of a hundred million dollar movie with that script in your back pocket? With that amount of money on the table why doesn't somebody say ""i'm sorry but that script just isn't good enough, in fact its awful, do it again."" It happens in business every day with budgets a thousand times smaller than this. Then during production why doesn't somebody say to Yun-fat chow ""I respect that you are an amazing actor and have been the backbone of the HongKong film industry for over 20 years but right now we can't understand a bloody word you're saying"". Really how can you shoot a movie on this scale and not point out to one of your actors than his entire dialogue is incomprehensible. The final thing is that this film really saddens me.

At least not as good as its predecors. At Worlds End is no exception. Don't get me wrong, I love pirates of the Caribbean. I love them because each movie adds very interesting stories, characters and situations that are both original and entertaining. At the end of dead man's chest I was so thrilled, Jack was dead, Barbossa was back, Elizabeth seemed to love Jack, Beckett had the hearth, Norrington was now a bad guy and Davy Jones was now under the control of the East India Trading Company. All this came to one question: What's next? I was so impatient to see the third part that I almost thought that world's end was even going to be better than Pirates 1 and 2 all combined. I was wrong.Gore Verbinski did a brilliant job directing this film, the battles where much better than any of Pirates 1 or 2. The scene of the multiples Jacks was brilliant, but the crabs scene is even better. If you are not dying to see some action then I bet you will enjoy these scenes. The special effects where great, once again ILM did a masterpiece with Davy Jones and his crew and the final battle is impressive. Even I laugh more in Dead Man's Chest the humor in this one was really good, quite the top with the humor of Pirates 1. What disappoint me was that at the end only the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl fight, the other pirates act like if they were going to fight but finally they stayed behind and just watched. The scene where Calipso is freed from her human form is totally stupid and ridiculous. Anyway the direction was very good.Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio did another heck of a ride with the script of pirates 3. Although there where many wholes like in any other pirate movie, the plot was interesting and capturing. Although the main story lost its originality, I mean: ""we must get ready for the final battle that will end all wars"" is a very used concept and I didn't expected to be used in a pirates movie. As much as I love the movie ending I must say that not all the characters had a fine ending. One of the most pathetic roles is Norrington. I really hated that he had no role in this movie. He just disappeared, and it was like ""ja! One down!"" His appearance was totally unnecessary. Tia Dalma's character develop is good until the half of the film where suddenly she looses her meaning when you are not quite sure what does she want and what is her point. She disappears, likes Norrington, and the writers just leave you with the question and no answer. Besides its many, many flaws the script has its originality and is entertaining. It is regular.Johnny Depp once again returns as Captain Jack Sparrow and it seems you can never get tired of watching him. In this movie Jack Sparrow is too much. He talks too much, he does too many things and there are too many much of his. Nevertheless he is still charming and entertaining. The best performance in the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is excellent, even better than the first, he is like the bad Jack Sparrow, with its own originality. Jack and Barbossa will be enemies for ever. Orlando Bloom performance has not changed from the second film, the one that has changed its Keira Knightley, that girl just keeps better and better. In this film she is much more real and believable and she is not as dull as the second. All the actors show their quality in Pirates 3 specially Depp and Rush. If all the other aspects of the movie were bad, it would still be worth of checking it out, just to see how those two fight over the command of the Black Pearl. Very Good acting.It is not as good as the first two, but it has fine ending and some amazing battles. It is a definitely yes for all fans and non-fans. 6.6","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In my opinion the ending is great and it really works well. It has conclusion while yet leaving it open for another one (once you see it you'll know what I'm talking about). The only complaints I have is mostly the same as everyone else's, the plot has a lot of twists and turns thats really hard to follow, and it did seem to run a tad long but like I said these are only minor.If you want a movie with action, humor, and all around fun go see this movie you'll have a good time and won't be disappointed :)","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

By the time the third film roles around, there is a great deal to be expected: plot lines must be resolved, visuals must be on par with previous films...indeed, there is far less wiggle room available for a third installment than in any other. And, in addition to all of these pre-requisites, the film itself must stand as a separate work- it cannot be simply ""Part 2 (cont.)"". At World's End tries to reconcile these two aspects-tying up plot lines with introducing new stuff so the film doesn't seem old. The problem, though, is not that the plot lines are not interesting or poorly done, but rather not expanded on enough.For example, Chow Yun-Fat's character, Sao Feng, is, at first, a simplistic, shallow, and over all unpleasant pirate lord, but as the film progresses we see some interesting sides to his character. These, however, are never expanded on. Captain Feng had the possibility of becoming just as recognizable and memorable as Depp's or Bloom's characters, albeit for different reasons. Instead, this plot line is thrown to the side.The other pirate lords are also interesting, or at least comedic, and yet they too are brushed aside. Norington had a lot of promise, yet he too is not expanded on. His mini-plot is given closure in the most remote sense of the word. We never really get to know Cutler: sure he's nasty, but WHY is he nasty? Even Davy Jones, ripe as he is for character development, doesn't feel properly expanded on.Indeed, so much new material was presented, and so much time was spent closing the stories of the 4 main characters, that the possibilities of the new material were forsaken, making much of the movie seem like little more than filler.It is my opinion that a Pirates 4 ought to have been planned, given the new material in this movie. I would gladly wait another year or two for closure if it meant that the new characters and plots were given the time they deserve. A great film tomorrow is better than a good film today.The ending, however, is perhaps the most appropriate one for the series. It is not a fairy tale ending, as this has not been a fairy tale. Fairy tales have shining, glorious champions of good astride noble steeds, where the lines between good and evil are clearly drawn.The Pirates of the Caribbean are a band of daredevil thieves and rogues; their foes are clearly evil, but that doesn't make them good. The values of a knight- justice and honor and a pretty girl- are different from those of a pirate- freedom, wealth, and fame- and therefore their ideal endings are going to be different.While many will say that the ending is a cop out and meant to allow for a fourth film (which is a understandable conclusion to draw), I also believe that is the ideal situation for them- they all love freedom and adventure, and the most thrilling thing in the world to them is the sight of adventure on the horizon- and that is what they get.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I enjoyed part three every bit as much as parts one and two, although it may have been a bit longer than desirable. The characters seem true to their previous behavior, there are enough twists and turns to keep one guessing about the plot, and the film is visually very beautiful. I am still amazed that the computer effects can be inserted so seamlessly into the live action, and the cinematography is just beautiful. I really enjoyed the adventures of Jack Sparrow and his conscience or should it be consciences? I didn't think that the plot was predictable and I enjoyed the squabbling between the pirate kings. All I had read were negative comments about Keith Richards' performance as Jack Sparrow's father, and I thought he did a good job. The comic touch about Jack's mother was definitely unexpected. This movie is certainly a great way to spend a hot summer afternoon with friends who know the tale, a packet of popcorn and a cold pop.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Also, the cinematography offered a variety of angles which truly showed off the artistic value of the film.Although I loved the music in the first film it seems they repeated most of the soundtrack in the third pirates. I understand theme songs for characters but it simply got repetitive.In addition, it is obvious that the writers were pushed for a story that was getting thin quickly in a very short amount of time. This combination is very unhealthy for an already diseased plot from the second pirates. A lot of unnecessary scenes were written into the storyline for the sake of humor which made them awkward (not to say that i did not laugh at some of them). Unlike the first pirates which was so well integrated with humor and action and story, At World's End gave the same humor repeated without the seamlessness.Even a few characters (which i will not mention to avoid spoiling) were given scenes (and a place in the movie) which was completely pointless and led to nothing but a dead end.Conclusion: Fantastic visuals, like always good acting, Same soundtrack, same humor,most importantly--thin and unenlightening plot. (something i do not think Hollywood should get away with too often)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But like the other two films in this series, it sure is a lot of fun. These Pirates movies are the closest thing to kids movies The Hound will subject himself to in a theater. And indeed there is something prophetic about that final line that Lord Beckett keeps repeating as his ship is blown to bits around him. These films are all about $$$$$$$, but as long as they entertain, is that such a terrible thing? Though this film is currently under performing in terms of meeting its financial expectations, one wonders if there will in fact be another one in the future. And just which of these cast members will sign on for another voyage?The plot by now has wound itself around in knots more complex than any sailor has ever tied. The early parts of this film deal with the cast members trying to rescue Capt. Jack Sparrow from his virtual prison in Davey Jones's Locker. Once this feat is accomplished, (of course it would be!) the ultimate aim seems to be for all pirates left on Earth to band together to defeat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. It looks like there will be an epic battle staged with hundreds of ships, however the final battle seems to consist of only the Black Pearl battling the Flying Dutchman. Each cast member seems to switch alliances with every other cast member at least twice before this 2 hour and 48 minute film finally comes to an end. Muskets are fired, swords are thrust, goddesses are captured then released, destinies are fulfilled, and about 1,000 blue-coated East India Trading Company members are killed.The film has some funny moments, but neither sequel had as many as part one in terms of laughs. Maybe the funniest thing I saw in part 3 was Davey Jones standing in a rotten old tub of water on a tiny island since he cannot touch dry land but once every ten years. With so many little rules and alliances, I'd hate to have to be a script supervisor on a set like this! How do they keep track of all these things?? Was it great cinema? Well... no, but I got what I paid for. By now most people know what these films are all about, and I really can't see how someone who liked parts 1 or 2 would not enjoy this one. What better way could I have spent $6.50 on a rainy Friday afternoon? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The special effects are magnificently superb, leaving the viewer to almost wonder if Davy Jones just might really be a lovelorn, scoundrel squid-man. This plot line is distinctly more complex than that of the first two, and rightfully so. The locations and costumes are enough to leave one basking in the glory of the blissful feast for the eyes. In this trilogy, the creativity and artistry are often overlooked because of its star-studded cast and its brilliant script. This film is heavier on the comedy, conjuring larger participation by Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), Jack the monkey, and Cotton's parrot. A more sizeable appearance of Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) is also a welcomed addition to the plot line and astounding performances of her co-stars. As expected, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is fantastically witty and amusing and heavily contributed to the movie?s multiple facets. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is especially captivating in this third installment, revealing yet another part of her once-buried personality. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) no longer takes a backseat to the novelty of Jack Sparrow and has his chance to shine as the strong, surprising pirate rival to his big-name co-stars. He is given ample opportunities to showcase his complexity as an actor and a character. As always, Geoffrey Rush projects the perfect, stereotypically delicious pirate visage as Captain Barbossa. This well-thought-out, staggeringly impressive silver screen knockout is just what popular cinema has been begging for: a phenomenal blend of laughs, artistic genius, and depth.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It totally looks it. The production design is out of this world, and there are a handful of moments of such visual beauty that take my breath away. The confidence Disney had in these movies shows in every aspect of the production. There's a long stretch where Jack Sparrow occupies a deserted purgatory, conversing only with multiple versions of himself and a large group of crabs, which happen to be made of rocks. It's an audacious sequence for a family blockbuster.There's also new locales, new characters, a mythical pirate lore introduced, and backstabbing and twists aplenty. It's all very complicated, so much so that the story is hardly worth following. You know what you're in for when you watch this; everything else is just a means to an end.I do wish that with all of the attention paid to the complicated story and the production design that they had focused on making this at least a little bit fun.

It's been almost a year since the previous movie, after all. It would have been nice of them to make some sort of an introduction to remind the viewer who the new characters were and what they all were doing there. But maybe it's a good thing? Makes you watch the movie with attention, trying to figure it all out :) But towards the end of that first our I, for one, stopped trying and just watched.The humor is still there. On-going gag with the monkey, the two dumb pirate friends, the fake eye, the two dumb soldier friends. Jack Sparrow is of course priceless, though at times just a wee bit overacting. My favorite moment was when he and Barbossa argue who's the captain. Will Turner is totally in the background. I feels like he said just a couple of words over the whole movie, mostly just hovering in the background looking pretty. Much attention is given to Elizabeth Swann whose beauty is, in my humble opinion, grossly overrated.The movie is very dynamic, it's never boring and pleasantly unusual, with all the twists and turns. Interesting twist with Elizabeth and Will's relationship.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

POTC2 was pretty good, though with some reservations. POTC3 is by far one of the worst. I wish I hadn't watched it. I feel like ripped off -- not only did I lose three hours of my life for this crap, but it also successfully killed all of the enjoyment I had for the first movie.As it's already been said here by other reviewers, I attribute all its crappiness to the writers/producers team. The plot is as stupid and pointless and plot less as it gets. They killed all the lightweight enjoyable humor and spirit and feel of POTC1. They completely lost touch with reality. They even managed to spoil the Jack Sparrow character, first by not showing enough of him, and second by giving him such horrible lines and actions and behavior that made me wish they'd better not showed him at all. They... basically, everything that could be done wrong they did even worse than that.To be fair, there are some good things about the movie. Sometimes good features can save an otherwise not-so-great movie; alas, that's not the case here -- on the contrary, it just makes me feel sorry for the effort wasted on this crap. E.g., although I have a problem with the whole resurrecting Barbossa idea, I enjoyed very much Geoffrey Rush's work in POTC3, he's just a brilliant actor and did a brilliant work, best in this movie.I don't know what exactly they were thinking after the well-deserved success of the first movie, but turning into a trilogy (G-d forbid they decide to go on!) was a great marketing idea whose sole purpose obviously was to rip the world public for lots of money. This has nothing to do with movie-making. Can we sue them??","19 out of 31 found this helpful.

Those of you who can remember my lengthy rant/essay about the Matrix films on GD will know that's an ominous sign. The chief similarity is that the first film was essentially stand-alone (and also the best), while the second and third films were essentially one large plot-arc chopped in two, complete with tantalising cliff-hanger ending. Both also involved characters returning from the dead, new villains being introduced, an avalanche of special-effects, and... importantly... a ridiculously large amount of plot, none of it particularly sophisticated.The Pirates films are not subtle in how they appeal to their core demographic. Unfortunately, when you make sequels you need to keep upping the ante, and when your product isn't subtle or intricate that seems to involve making everything ridiculously excessive. At least in Hollywood it does. The excess is everywhere: the film is ridiculously long, with many completely needless sections; there's a huge roster of characters, including endless side-kicks and sub-plots; the star cameos are endless and the plot is needlessly convoluted and over-cooked, with a seemingly endless series of betrayals as everyone double-crosses everyone else, and then reverts back again. We're not talking about Where Eagles Dare (surely the daddy of ridiculous double-cross plot lines) either, as few of the double-crosses seem necessary. I'm not even sure why half of the plot was needed at all beyond providing an excuse for the set-pieces. There are also countless moments where plausibility is bent to fracture-point in order to make sure the good guys won through.Of course, when you cut past all that, there's a lot of fun to be had in the film. What particularly struck me is how it provided such a sharp contrast between humour and darkness, with both pervading every scene in an almost Oscar Wildean absurdist inversion of values. Comic interludes were often jet-black in their humour: the frost-bite scene is the kind of visual gag you'd expect from George Romero, not a Disney film. Meanwhile, moments of life and death and key plot progression are shot through with tongue-in-cheek comic touches, even when you'd expect all emphasis to be on the plot. There were also moments of gruesome brutality that made this film dark enough to separate it from the saccharine fluff you associate with family films.And really, it's the humour that carries the film, far more than the action, which is as frequently as over-cooked as the film's plot. Johnny Depp chews up the scenery as much as he ever did as Jack Sparrow, while his motley crew also chip in lots of good laughs. The film was also capable of being at its most clever with the humour: the post-modernism that was evident in POTC2 gets stronger than ever here. Keith Richards' cameo was a good moment of self-awareness, while I appreciated the running sea-turtles gag, which is thinly-veiled metafiction at its daftest.Oh, and the music. Hans Zimmer is rapidly elbowing in on John Williams' territory as Hollywood's premier composer of crowd friendly and versatile scores. The main themes are as epic as ever, while this time round there's an infusion of Oriental influences and some more modern touches. It also, bizarrely, channels Ennio Morricone in Spaghetti Western mode at several moments: the parlay scene's music was surely a homage to Once Upon A Time In The West. Good stuff.So it's far from perfect and no classic, but it's still worth seeing, particularly if you're a fan of the series.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's fun nonsense worthy of Robert Howard or H. Ryder Haggard, with deft comic timing, death-defying stunts and a literal boatload of roguish supporting characters. The final movie is an improvement over the second one, which I nonetheless enjoyed. Like any good adventure flick, this one takes the audience to places only imagined. The trailer hinted at this, showing previews of the Black Pearl making its way to end of the world and going over the edge! Although quite long at almost three hours, the viewer is taken to the end of our world and into the next, to Davy Jones' Locker, to the Singapore fortress of Asia's most dangerous pirate, to Shipwreck Cove and its town built entirely from the hulks of wrecked ships (!), to a final showdown with the British Navy at the edge of a maelstrom that threatens to sink both fleets. Money and technology were well used here to give color and flesh to what is essentially a very tall tale. A legend of the sea. A fish story. Blu-Ray takes great advantage of this, bringing out the high end effects with eye-popping clarity.Some reviewers have complained that it is 'unrealistic'. Tosh. Realism is for weepy dramas. The characters are sometimes dwarfed by the scale of things, but then again Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are supposedly playing ordinary people following extraordinary destinies. And anyway, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush can steal any scene, even one with a kraken in it. The script is a little thin, but at least workable and again an improvement over Pirates #2, albeit a slight one. Neither really has dialogue worthy of its sweeping story line.The ending, BTW, is perfectly suited to such a legendary tale, bringing characters together and sending others on their way as the saga continues.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my opinion, this is a big surprise. I like the first one the least out the trilogy, and absolutely LOVE the third one. It is funny, emotional, tense, with great characters and production design, action, music, and visual effects. Basically it is doing everything right for being entertaining. Is it perfect? No, but no movie is.Acting:
Johnny Depp as Jack was here at the top of his game as usual. By now, you are pretty used to the ticks and routines of the character, but he still makes you hold your sides with laughter and baffles you with his scheming skills and mastery of improvisation. It saddens me that he completely lost this in Dead Men Tell no Tales. Jack's arc is surprisingly well fleshed out in the overblown screenplay, and Johnny sells it excellently.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both doing great, with each character having their own personal stakes in this, that extracts a heavy toll on them. It is mostly through body language however, since their line delivery is not that smoot a lot of time.Bill Neighy is back as Davy Jones and BOY is he good! To this day this is a mo-cap performance that impresses me even more than Gollum sometimes. The character is very deep and considering how cruel he is, you actually sympathize with him a lot of times. Bill delivered a fantastic villainous performance that will always be remembered.Tom Hollander as Beckett gets a larger role here than in Dead Men's Chest, and this gives him the opportunity to flesh out the cold and calculating persona a lot more. He is perfect as the slimy, cruel, yet very smart and composed little man, and although he has very little character he is really fun to watch.Geoffry Rush as Barbossa is absolutely gold. Seeing him actually play the good guy here gives great opportunities to play off with Johnny Depp, and the scenes that they share are absolutely hilarious and full of character. Geoffry fully embraces the wacky and ragged pirate that Barbossa is, and gives his most enjoyable performance to date.Chow-Yun Fat as Sao Feng is a bit of a missed opportunity: the guy is a great actor and absolutely nails the creepy yet noble pirate lord that Sao Feng is. He gets really too small of a role in this movie, unfortunately, and could have been utilized better.Jack Davenport as Norrington is also kind of wasted potential here. His character in the first movie was actually pretty likable, and in the second movie he was pretty great because of the new place his character was in. In this movie, he still has an arc, but it is one that is very quickly resolved and Norrington doesn't really play a further significant part, which feels again like a missed chance.The rest of the cast is absolutely great as all different types of pirates and scoundrels, including the mo-cap cast for Davy Jone's crew, and a testament how much effort was stuck in this movie to make the world feel alive.Direction:
Gore Verbinski has been the director for all the three movies, and he once again delivers on both emotional and spectacle level. Not all of the scenes feel as realistic as they should be, with too much of the wackiness taking over, but overall Gore can be proud of this.Cinematography:
Darius Wolzki, who shot Dead Men's Chest as well, holds nothing back in this movie, with great use of color filters, shot positioning and lighting. This might be his best looking movie yet.Plot:
This is were most of the complaining comes in. This movie is VERY long, and even with all that runtime, a ton of story and character arcs are crammed in. The movies is way more complicated than it needs to be, and although I could follow it pretty easily, I can imagine that a lot of people don't like how much they need to think with this type of blockbuster. That being said, a lot still falls into place pretty neatly, and the dialogue is often hilarious and entertaining to listen to.Music: Hans Zimmer, who is great at delivering truly spectacular scores that sound both exhilarating and emotional, has given us his best Pirates score yet, elaborating his previous themes and giving new pieces that are great to listen to even when you are not watching the movie.Production Design:
This is in my eyes the very best part about this movie: every set and location feels handmade, even when it's obviously digital. It is full of props and the decoration looks stunning on the ships and on-land locations.Costumes and Make-Up:
Just like the production design, a ton of work was put into this to make every actor look exactly like what he is supposed to be. This deserves an academy award for sure.Sound:
Not much to say on this, I think that the music is more important overall, but there are nice unique sounds sprinkled throughout with the ""weirder"" scenes(one full of little crabs in particular)VFX:
Just like Dead Men's Chest and Curse of the Black Pearl, this movie reaches to new heights in the digital department, with incredible motion capture and scenery that makes your jaw drop in the massive action sequences and other locations.Editing:
This movie efficiently hops between a LOT of characters and plot lines while still making it feel like a smooth and coherent ride(at least for me). Particulary the cutting between big action and small comedic/character moments are great to watch.Tone:
This movie strikes a great balance between grim drama and hilarious comedy, in addition to having big tense action inbetween. Pretty much everything that needs to hit the mark, does so.General Concensus:
While the story really didn't need to be that stuffed and difficult, pretty much everything else about this movie is great, and an absolute blast from start to finish.(Don't forget the beautiful post-credit scene)","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bring back the good old days when a third sequel managed to rock the boat (no pun intended) Oh 'Return of the Jedi' we love you :)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wonder why....Anyway, the 3rd installment starts with a bit of chilling likes where people that involves in any pirates related were to sentence to death. In which I view it as the power of marines started to shine.Following more deeply into the movie, various hilarious acts together with astounding acting crews liven up the storyline which was also adapted from the previous movies. I found that this last piece of work (from what I heard) venturing more into wider part of pirates world. Though I was a bit disappointed of the roles of other pirate lords. The most they've shown up is in the meetings.Overall, great casting fabulous work especially the new imaginary duplications of Jack Sparrow. They even talk among themselves without the guy himself.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

That is probably the strongest criticism one can level against ""At World's End,"" an otherwise reasonably entertaining addition to the phenomenally lucrative ""Pirates"" franchise.Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and directed by Gore Verbinski, ""At World's End"" picks up where ""Dead Man's Chest"" left off, with Elizabeth, Will and the recently resurrected Barbossa going in search of Jack Sparrow, who has been consigned to a watery grave courtesy of the Kraken, a sea creature who serves at the behest of the notorious Davy Jones. In this episode, Beckett, the Chairman of the East India Trading Company, has begun to hang any individual even remotely suspected of partaking in piracy, forcing the nine Pirate Lords - including Barbossa and the re-resurrected Sparrow - to band together in armed opposition to Beckett's forces.Like the previous two ""Pirates"" films, ""At World's End"" is immensely entertaining for the first forty-five minutes or so until the seemingly inevitable tedium begins to set in, caused in large part by the fact that we tend to get lost in the mind-boggling shuffling of characters and plot points. It gets so bad at times that we often aren't entirely sure who's aligned with whom, whose ship we're on, which characters are alive or dead at any given moment, and what ""being dead"" actually means in a scenario where the rules on that score seem as variable as a gentle sea breeze on a balmy summer afternoon. Moreover, any action film that runs an exhausting two hours and forty-eight minutes is bound to falter in its pacing and to sag in places, and ""At World's End"" is no exception in that respect. Doesn't anyone toiling in the blockbuster-producing factories of Hollywood know how to use an editing machine anymore? Nevertheless, this latest episode does a nice job keeping all its main characters together in the same geographical locale for the most part, so that the actors don't get as lost on the vast narrative canvas as they did in the previous versions. As a result, even the usually bland Keira Knightely manages to step out of the shadows and deliver something of an actual performance in this film. The movie also gives an impressive amount of screen time to the marvelous Geoffrey Rush as the scalawag Barbossa. But the best news is that Johnny Depp returns to the glorious form he displayed in ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" which, for some reason, got a bit tamped down in the second installment The only real disappointment on the acting front is the much ballyhooed appearance of Keith Richards in the cameo role of Jack Sparrow's dad (Depp has confessed to modeling his original performance on Richards). Although the casting of Richards is rife with possibilities, for some reason the performer has chosen to underplay the part rather than to go wild with it. It would have been so much fun to see him hamming it up alongside Depp; instead, Richards drains the life out of the father/son encounter, utterly muffing this golden opportunity for a truly classic scene.The special effects and makeup are typically spectacular, and the director keeps the action percolating along at a reasonably ramped-up pace, give or take the yawn-inducing longueur or two that occasionally come our way.This particular pirate's tale has probably run its course at this point, but ""At World's End"" isn't a bad way for it to go out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Disney pirates film may be, in fact, the best. Defying the idea that sequels are often weaker, this one has plenty of plot, action and even romantic twists to keep the fans interested.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) doesn't make an appearance until thirty-three minutes into the film. I think this is a great thing for the film -- while Depp may bring the crowds, having a film rely on him is largely a gimmick. Having to rely on the plot, or acting of Orlando Bloom is a much better way to go. If you can succeed on that, you have a great film -- and they do! I should also point out the soundtrack. All three films have a decent score which is very unique and also listenable outside of the movie (though maybe not appropriate for night driving if you want to stay awake).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was only about 9 or 10 when the 'Curse Of The Black Pearl' was released,so that is why it is my least favourite, which is strange because everyone thinks the first one is the best. I saw 'Dead Mans Chest' in the cinema 3 times because I thought it was totally awesome. Then, just 1 year later, the 3rd Pirates movie is made, and this is what I thought of that; I was HUGELY excited about seeing this film. I saw it on May 25th 2007. But I have to admit, when I first saw 'At Worlds End', I didn't exactly like it that much. It was only when I re-watched it on DVD today when I realised how amazing it really is. Captain Jack Sparrow is back and it seems he is here to stay, as this movie contains a HUGE battle at the end. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are back, which it a great exception. It was great to see Barbossa is no longer evil but is now on the good side. I am loving Davey Jones, just like I did in the previous movie. Bill Nighy is perfect for the role!!! The evil Lord Cutler Beckett had a much bigger role in this, which was great, as he is plays SOOOOO well. The new characters, like Captain Sao Feng were well done, too.This movie really sucks you into it. The action is completely awesome and the humour, the fighting and everything else makes this movie a definete must-see!!!!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Throw a lot of special effects, big stars, and some clout produced by the first movie and what do you have? Well... not a whole hell of a lot. The plot is convoluted from the get go, the story lines become inane, and the special effects - actually those are pretty good. Let's just say that in three hours time a person could nearly make a trip from London to New York and they would still see more entertainment were they to look out their window. Half way through the film I asked those sitting to my left if they were as confused and disappointed as I was. They were and so I was somewhat vindicated in my response. Among my points of contention are these:I have not seen such a complicated and unbelievable love story since Pearl Harbor. Davy Jones is suddenly not the scary sea monster/pirate but more of a cuckolded seafaring diplomat. Captain Jack Sparrow, who nearly carried the first film, is reduced to a supporting character. Why are we suddenly learning that all of these pirates to whom we were introduced in the first movie are part of a Lord Council?","45 out of 83 found this helpful.

""Dead Man's Chest"", I felt was OK. But rather than learning from its predecessor's flaws, this film expands on them, and ends up being decidedly average.I agree with other reviewers who say that the plot is far too complicated. Everything's fine until the second act of the film, and then it all goes off in different directions, with too many side stories crammed in (some of which didn't really need to be there), and becomes extremely hard to follow if you're not paying attention. ""Who's working for who?"" ""Who's betraying who?"" ""What arrangement have those characters got again?"" ""How did he end up on that ship?"" The other problem with betrayals occurring left, right and centre is that it gets a little hard to sympathise with any of the characters, even Will and Elizabeth  even though they're supposed to be the romantic leads, they don't display much affection for each other for most of the film.Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow hasn't changed, but somehow he's not as much fun as he was in the last two films  maybe he's just best in smaller doses. It's nice to see Geoffrey Rush return as Barbossa, as well as a cameo by Keith Richards, but nobody else in the cast gives a performance that's worth mentioning.For all its faults, I don't hate At World's End. While you may be confused by the story, you shouldn't be bored at least. The fun, not-so-serious atmosphere that was present in the first film has diminished somewhat, but comes through in some scenes. And the final battle scene is high quality, almost making up for the flaws that preceded it.At World's End is not a bad film, but with some editing and better writing, it could have been a lot better. I won't be happy if they do make a fourth film: based on how the quality has degenerated through this trilogy, three is enough.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Pirates Should Be Pirates!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1750573/?ref_=tt_urv","actorlink","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17116884/?ref_=tt_urv","21 October 2007","I am unable to understand the need to overcomplicate plots in Hollywood these days. It seems to be the trend of the contemporary film but I think it's a disease and an urgent cure is needed! It's either too many twists, often boring the viewer instead of working to grab his interest, or too many generic patterns! The first of this trilogy held my attention well and offered a welcome surprise. I had grown nostalgic for the classic adventure genre and reminisced my days as a youth when films like Indiana Jones added excitement to the realms of the big screen. Curse Of The Black Pearl was in my view a pleasant deviation from the wannabe quick thrill action flick of the current day.Captain Sparrow offered a hero female audiences could swoon over for good reason. Let's face it we all fantasized defiant pirates during some stage of our childhood! They certainly held my fascination when I was a little girl.Unlike the initial movie though, Dead Man's Chest had disappointed me because it played too much on certain aspects of the rebel captain's character that were off-putting. He appeared far too effeminate, cowardly and comical. I believe his humorous punch lines were enough for the comedy element and his character didn't need to be degraded to a farce through baby jargon and girly flee from the scene to survive tactics! The drunkenness and eccentricity of Sparrow in part one of the trilogy were enough to maintain the mystery that infatuates audiences with lead roles.Thankfully World's End is closer to Curse Of The Black Pearl in the sense that it doesn't present as cowardly a Sparrow as Dead Man's Chest but although I will contradict my comment on the generic style of action movies nowadays, some things should remain as they were in older eras for a reason. We all seek escapism through a hero who toys with death and isn't afraid to embrace danger. Pirates should be pirates: rough cut, rope-swinging, free spirits.Which brings me to the excellent portrayal given by Geoffrey Rush and Keith Richards. Rush as Barbossa is every bit the outlaw of the high seas, embodying thrills and territory that shouldn't be trespassed without thought. Richards creates mystery and an aura of fear. His presence spells danger, exactly the way an exciting pirate's should.World's End runs too long. After the awe of part 1 was spoiled for me with the way Depp's character was written, I haven't been able to feel the same way. What the actor did with the role was magic. The sexy grungy appearance of Sparrow and hints at an eccentric rum-drinking sea master with many legends backing his reputation were all part of the enchantment for viewers. But the director and script writers should have drawn the line when it came to the motives of the Black Pearl's captain. ""Save my own butt"" and that's all that matters isn't really turn on material. Neither is the new age effeminacy. We want our leading men strong and larger than life! That will never change! We love pirates because they defy, challenge, test, roam free, put up with hardships and risk death. World's End is better than Dead Man's Chest but movie makers should pay attention to the main principles that made the 80s adventure genre work: simplicity. Keeping the plot simple does not always mean resorting to pedestrian role portrayals. It just means allowing the opportunity for audiences to escape to a new world and dream for a while that they are swinging from mast to mast with the heroes without having to ponder for too long how something happened and why it did.Films like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone/Jewel Of The Nile and for a more recent example The Mummy, worked because they had simple elements: fun, adventure, handsome/masculine heroes, gorgeous/thrill-seeking heroines, comical/greedy/cowardly little antagonists and scary villains for contrast. If you're gonna return to the adventure genre you must do it right. Times have changed but human instinct and what appeals to us has remained the same. We're still primitive inside. At least the film ended in a true pirate way: ""Drink up me mateys!""","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

And do view, At World's End is slightly less silly and slightly more cohesive than Dead Man's Chest, though still not nearly as enjoyable as Curse of the Black Pearl, nor as satisfying overall (story and characters and visuals.) If you haven't see Pirates 1 or 2, don't bother with 3. The thin plot of At World's End will still leave you confused.The special effects are highly detailed and make for some impressive scenes, though some of the fighting is too improbable and so more like a cartoon than live action (a pet peeve of mine.) Regardless, worthy of the theater's big screen, or a really impressive television. Good fun and humor with Jack Sparrow (and a touch of Keith Richards) oddness, but for my audience it was the Jack the monkey (and the midget) who stole the laughter. See it without high expectations and enjoy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love the first pirates and like the second, to say honestly I was a bit afraid that the third movie will be spoiled. But it's not!!! It's a great ending to the trilogy. I really like it very much - although someone may think it's too long, I say - you won't need to check the time because what's going on on the screen will keep you interested until the end. I think all three parts of Pirates are a little bit different and make different impression. The third movie is more serious, dark and huge. The story is good, actors are brilliant. There's everything you need - story, humor, drama, adventures, atmosphere... The music is very good! But what make a surprise is an ending. I didn't think it may turn out this way, but I love it. So if you're asking yourself ""Should I see it? » just stop. Go and enjoy this adventure, I'm sure you won't regret a minute!","20 out of 42 found this helpful.

It wasn’t bad just not as I was hoping it to be.Synopsis: After eaten alive by the Kraken the crew set out on the journey the save Jack Sparrow from the land of dead before battle with Davy Jones and Lord Beckett once and for all as they tried to demolished all the pirates out of the sea.I thought the movie started out really slow and to the certain extent --- boring. The fact that the film is shot on half written screenplay taking its toll could be easily seen on the screen as from point to point there are major setback and complete silliness that is too hard to believe that it don’t even feel like pirates movie anymore, and also it was ways too complicated.There are many things that annoy like the fact that Jack Sparrow disappear half of the movie and when he is on screen, there are only Jack Sparrow. Most of the time there is only Elizabeth and Will. And also in this movie out of sudden they make Capt. Davy Jones and Mr. Norrington so incompetence when in Curse of black pearl and Dead Man Chest they are so good. Even though there are loads of characters increase and uneven distribution of screen time I thought it still work out pretty alright.The good part of the movie got to be the special effect and CGI which is awesomely done. It looks absolute stunning with lots of great detail from the beginning to the end of the movie (Specially the battle scene between Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman). In addition the score is also pretty awesome add the great mood to the movie.In the end the movie has it’s up and down. Ask if it was entertaining, yes it was but the land of the dead part was absolute boring. The jokes in this movie seem force. The end of the East India Trading Company is way too easy. It did wrap up most of the thing for the trilogy but it happen too easily.Recommendation: Prepare for some confusing story, still is very entertaining but sometime can be boring.Reason To Watch: Because The Second Left You Open Ending That You Have To Watch This.Reason Not To: Things Happen To Brief At The End.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: C+)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It does not fit even to the other two parts of the ""Pirates"".Still there are great actors, the special effects are incredible ( the scene of the battle between ships), nevertheless, the general impression is poor, mainly because of the script.It is simply worse than previous parts.

Well tonight I was shut up, speechless, and left baffled as I took my seat at the 7:00 showing of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End."" I will honestly tell you I only saw the first two hours of the film. At 9:00 I grabbed my value Pepsi and practically ran out the theater door, eager to escape the hell I had so innocently trapped myself in on a valuable Friday night.There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know where to start. Just like the third Shrek installment, POTC 3 has lost all--and I mean all--of its charm and has now turned into a 3 hour soul-less bloodthirsty action movie with no character development, horrible acting, very few charming Jack Sparrow moments, and just a bunch of angry sea creature pirates eating each other's heads and stabbing swords through other unlucky pirates' torsos.The acting was absolutely horrid. Orlando Bloom is in his worst role of his career and gives a painfully annoying performance as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley, an actress who I usually adore watching on screen, was also surprisingly below average and left me wondering what the hell went wrong on the set of this movie. Even veterans Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored by the whole thing, like they knew the movie sucked but also their contracts with their signatures on it kept them from ducking out of the project.There's too much CGI. WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much CGI. Part of the reason I loved the first film so much was because it was reasonably realistic, no huge sea creatures, no hammerhead shark pirates, no strange women growing 10000x their size, roaring like some guy from a death metal band, and then falling apart into crabs. There was no unnecessary CGI. The third film excels at this, and it almost felt like I was watching a Star Wars film. Unfortunately, the excess CGI takes away from the backbone of the film, and is obviously a huge weight on the film that only attributes to it's faceplant into the ground.Gore Verbinski really is starting to lose his magic as well. He did an EXCELLENT job directing the first film, and did a pretty good job with the direction of the second film. Why, now, does he deliver a terribly amateurish directing job in the third film? It was almost as bad as the direction in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of our Fathers."" The storyline is ridiculously stupid and stupidly hollow, incredibly and overly complex for a fun popcorn movie like this, and Verbinski tries to balance three separate story lines on one plate and ends up dropping the dishes, spoiling the food, and leaving the viewer hungry.I could really go on and on about what a gigantic waste of time and money this film is, but a movie like this doesn't deserve such a long review. Really, it's a shame Hollywood relies on sequels to big moneymaking blockbusters to rake in the cash these days. Thank God for indie cinema. Save your money and rent the first instead, which is actually a 9 or 10 in my book.","30 out of 53 found this helpful.

These are all true, and it is commonly the case when a director has a billion dollar grossing film under his belt which then allows him or her more creative freedom from their commercially minded producers and studios (remember PJs King Kong?). We all know when watching it that there will be that great action sequence at the end, and it is great, yes, but the potentially confusing, backstabbing and treacherous plot line preceding it, in my mind could have been toned down a notch so more epic-like action could be fitted in earlier on in the film as well as at the end.However, with all this in mind, the film still manages, somehow, to keep your attention for its nearly 3 hour entirety. And its a keen, engrossed and excited attention that it gets from its audience, too. One of its greatest appeals is its unique and appealing style which we are rarely given the pleasure to witness. The style arises out of that largely unexplored area somewhere between 'artsy' films, fantasy films, commercial films and of course, comedies. You can't help but think that in 20 years time, people will watch this again for the first time since when they were kids and revere in the nostalgia (and finally get the story line), like we did with Indiana Jones and Star Wars amongst others.It will be very interesting to see if this film, with its Luke warm reception from critics and its massive momentum from 'Pirates 2', will beat out the Spidey to regain its opening weekend records, and whether it can carry through to earn more than 'Pirates 2's $1 billion Worldwide BO taking. If it does, I think we'll be seeing wicked Jack a couple more times.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It had everything; a great plot, terrific characters, clever action, and dialog that reeked of both classic filmography and modern wit. To be honest, I really didn't expect a sequel, and if there was one, I truly didn't think it would be nearly as good as the original.Wow. Was I wrong. Pirates 2, Dead Mans chest, came like a mighty wind, building wonderfully on past material and introducing some fantastic new faces to the cast, including the stunningly animated squid faced maw of the unforgettable Captain Davy Jones. Many people bash the sequel, saying it doesn't live up to the first, but that's likely because the first was so memorable that the second just seems to be caught in the shadow of it's greatness. I took Dead Mans Chest in context with the first as an extension of the story, and for that reason, I enjoyed it immensely, and in some areas I actually feel that its BETTER than the original. I figured it out pretty quick that if there was an out of nowhere sequel that there would probably be a threequel, ala-""Back to the Future."" I wasn't expecting the dark cliffhanger that ""Dead Mans Chest"" provided, but it certainly kept me in suspense about the third, and I was eager to see how the story would wrap up all the loose ends.Finally, Summer of 2007, it came. Pirates of the Caribbean, At Worlds End.And, Wow...it was...pretty good.I wanted you to read my history with this series so you can better understand my feelings about the third installment. Perhaps with all the backtracking you can fully understand why I feel that pirates 3 is a good movie...but falls flat in the face of its predecessors. The hardest part of writing this review is that its difficult to pinpoint what's specifically wrong with this movie. Really, in terms of writing and acting, there's nothing fundamentally bad about it. But at the same time, there's nothing fundamentally GREAT about it either, and I think therein lies the rub.As you watch this film, the first thing that might make you raise an eyebrow is the VERY abrupt and VERY dark opening. It's probably this, more than anything else, that damages the movie as a whole. You may remember with the first two movies the mysterious and intriguing openings that led you into the story, (No opening credits. YAY!) like in COTBP where you see young Elizebith singing a pirate song and in DMC with older Elizebeth alone at an empty, rained out wedding ceremony. In AWE, however, we're treated with something remarkably different. A bunch of men, women, and children getting hung mechanically by the British army for ""consorting with pirates."" I'm sorry, but this just struck me as a terrible way to begin the movie, especially one with such a wide audience age range. Plus, it just felt out of spirit with the series, which always had a sort of swashbuckling, light-hearted charm about it.The entire script feels conflicted within itself. You get the distinct impression that there was some brilliant talent behind the keyboard, but they were working within a confined plot that was constantly holding them back. One can't help but wonder if they wrote all the cliffhangers in Pirates 2 without fully thinking out how they would work in the third. (I later found out on the internet that they didn't. The script wasn't even fully written before the filming started.)Some stuff just feels pulled out of thin air, like the ""Ten Pieces of Eight"" malarkey or the idea that the extremely memorable voodoo witch from 2 is really the sea-goddess calypso in disguise. True, there was a super-hidden connection between Davy Jones and the witch in the sequel movie, and if you looked up the Davy Jones legend in literature you'd find out that Calypso was indeed the classic characters heart-breaking love, but the structure of this movie that leads to this discovery is shaky, to say the least.There are some blazing moments of greatness in this film, most of them involving, you guessed it, Jack Sparrow. His dramatic return on a wave of netherworld crabs is truly awesome. And the ending battle is equally incredible, resulting in the most beautiful marriage of CGI and real-life combat animation you may see for a long time. Also, the dialog, while somewhat hindered by the confines of finally ending the series, is just as quirky and funny as before, with classic stooges like Jack, the two pirate guys, and those chumly soldiers from COTBP all returning in top form. The ending, if you haven't seen it by now, is surprising. Very surprising. So surprising that many would say it sucks. I don't hold this opinion, but I will admit it irked me. I'll leave the final verdict on this little subject to you, the viewer.Pirates 3 is probably the best threequel to come out of Summer of 2007, and that's a good thing. But at the same time, it takes some major risks with the franchise, and not all of them pay off. Pirates 1 still stands as a modern classic, if there is such a term, and its sequel is terrific as well. Unfortunately for Dead Mans Chest, its plot is irrevocable tied to its controversial prodigy, which I fear may drag it down to the depths of ""meh"" ness like a kracken dragging down a frigate. Pirates 3 is a worthy addition to the franchise, but I can easily live with it not being added to my movie collection. But that's just me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Loved him in Edward Scissorhands, Chocolat and, of course, POTC 1. (Not in Fear and Loathing, but it's hard to blame him for that mess.) And, who doesn't like Keira Knightley? Unfortunately, POTC 3 is exactly the same as POTC 2 which is exactly the same as POTC 1. After a while, the same ole' half-drunken, slurry swagger just gets tiresome. Any Depp scene in this movie is interchangeable with any other.This movie goes on for much too long. (Think ""Far From the Madding Crowd"".) And, I can only speak for the part that I didn't sleep through. I'm glad that I woke up because the special effects near the end were awesome.Overall, POTC 2 and 3 lack any creativity and exist only to milk the franchise. Thankfully, POTC 4 should be out of the question and the great talent in this movie can go on to more entertaining fare.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This was really good, after part two, which I found disappointing, I wasn't sure about ""At World's End"", boy did they do great! OK, the embarrassing cameo by Keith Richards was pretty awful, but other than that this was a great pirates movie!To pick up Captain Jack Sparrow is lost in Davy Jones' locker and its up to Barbosa, Elizabeth and Will to rescue him, this is handled well as they travel to Singapore to enlist help from Chow Yun-Fat. Cool sets, the movie didn't stint on the seedy feel of southeast Asia and some of the humor was spot-on here! After Jack's rescue they journey to Pirate's Cove on Shipwreck island for a final showdown with the English, Davy Jones, et al. The effects are marvelous and the action first-rate. Johnny was terrific, even though we've seen this trick performance before it was still fun. Keira Knightley never looked lovelier and Bill Nighy managed to give some heart to the squid-faced Davy Jones, no easy feat. There were plenty of plot twists and surprises and the movie moved well considering its 3 hours long!Please note they didn't take the easy way out with Will Turner and his doomed Dad Bootstrap Bill. This was heart-breaking but very good and totally in character for Jack. Stay tuned after the credits for a lovely final scene with Will and Elizabeth. This was excellent and well done. I'll probably buy this one, it was fun from start to finish!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The finishing of the story lines was very satisfying with no real cliffhanger. The action was fun and the cheesy fun was entertaining. 2 of my 3 kids liked it better than Spidey 3.No blood at all even with all the sword play. The only improvement in story is they could have done more with Calypso.As good as it is, 3 isn't as good as the 1st(but what film is), but much more satisfying than 2.

I give all 3 pirate movies a 10 out of 10 but that is just my opinion. We are all individuals so therefore we have own thoughts about certain things, especially movies. Every movie that ever comes out will either be loved or hated by people and that will never change. Pirates has a fantastic cast who are all very talented and the people behind the scenes on movies like these should be admired for their dedication for brilliance even if you did not like the movie.

And well Keyra is just beautiful and also she's an excellent actress.Is this film the best of the trilogy??? for me maybe, because i also love the first one but this is very close.As a Conclusion: if your are not yet a fan of this films well i hope you can watch it since the first one and enjoy it like i did.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Too serious, but still fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7667714/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","21 December 2021","This is the least of the three original Pirates of the Caribbean movies, more overstuffed, unfocused, and all over the place tonally than the previous two films. However, it still has that overarching and earnest desire to entertain, this time on a larger scale, with a solid balance of emotional catharsis and spectacle, concluding what has to be the weirdest trilogy of big budget films ever made. It also has my favorite moment in the whole franchise as well. It's a bloated, unwieldy film, but at least it ultimately just wants its audience to have a good time.With Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) dead and trapped in Davey Jones' locker, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) head to Singapore in an effort to bring the nine pirate lords together in order to find a way to counter Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who is using Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) as a tool against all who would stand against the East India Trading Company. Times are desperate for pirates (ugh...I wish this franchise had started with merchantmen who had to resort to piracy because of mercantile overbearing rather than just pirates who were...you know...awful people), and they must do something, even if that means finding a way to cross over into Davey Jones' locker to bring Jack, one of the pirate lords, back to help. So, yeah, death doesn't seem to mean much, especially since Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) pretty much says she can bring anyone back from the dead when explaining the difference in process between bringing Barbossa back and Jack. There's no real reason to get terribly emotionally invested in any of this, not that I ever did.After a series of double crosses and new deals struck with dubious meaning, our main characters take a Chinese ship to the edge of the world, fall off, and end up in Davey Jones' locker. I do have to say that the fantasy elements are some of the reasons why I enjoy these movies as much as I do, and the implication that they live on a flat Earth tickles me. Anyway, Jack is there, going mad with the Black Pearl in a desert when a host of crabs made from rocks sweep the ship to the waterline where the rest of the crew wash up. Taking them along after an entertaining bit where he tells everyone what he thinks of them, they have to figure out a way back, and the nonsense logic of needing to turn the ship upside down at the precise moment of sunset doesn't make a whole lot of sense. However, it tickles me nonetheless.Back, the movie gets into gear proper and heads towards the final big confrontation against Lord Beckett and Davey Jones. More reveals (in particular that Tia Dalma is the heathen god Calypso trapped in human form by the Brethren Court of pirates by the advice of the lovesick Davey Jones) and double crosses occur. The plot mechanics can be difficult to follow at times, there being so many double crosses, plans within plans, and hidden agendas for so many characters, but we never really move away from the idea that Will and Elizabeth are our heroes, Beckett and Jones are our villains, and that Jack is the entertaining wildcard.This is the one movie I'd say that fully embraces the idea that it's an ensemble piece without anyone really rising to the level of main character. I maintain that it's Will in the first and most likely the second, but he's definitely not the main character here. He shares that with Elizabeth (who has an arc) and Jack (who has something like an arc that I can't quite figure out) while the host of supporting characters from Barbossa to Jones to Tia Dalma to Norrington to even the minor characters like Pintel and Ragetti as well as Will's father Bootstrap (Stellan Skarsgard) all get their due. This movie is big, and it's not just big in terms of spectacle. It does try to invest in our panoply of characters to some decent degree.And I think that's why I can keep returning to these films despite the fact that they are mostly spectacle. The characters are well written enough that I can enjoy their presence amidst the loud noises and strange sights.Those strange sights are back from the second film with a vengeance as well, expanding on Jones' crew with new members based on sea creatures. There's also the surreal sights of Davey Jones' locker that probably could have used more time (an odd thing to say in a movie that's honestly overlong to begin with). The maelstrom that the final concentrated battle takes place in is the exact kind of exaggerated nonsense I expect from my movies about pirates battling the East India Trading Company's agent, the tentacle-faced Davey Jones, captain of the Flying Dutchman.And my favorite moment of the series? The wedding between Will and Elizabeth. After most of a movie where they have a strained relationship because Will did not understand the kiss Elizabeth gave to Jack at the end of the previous film that ultimately saved them all, Will throws himself at his bride to be in the middle of the big fight and Barbossa presides over the nuptials, all while everyone continues to swash those buckles with Hans Zimmer's score playing playfully and bombastically in the background. It's the exact kind of silliness, earnestness, and extravagance I expect from this kind of stuff, and I love it.The plot is overcomplicated, the first third is dedicated to undoing the last moments of the previous film, and the tone, especially in the beginning, is too serious for its own good. And yet, it still wants desperately to entertain me at a cost of $300 million, and I keep being entertained by the excessiveness of it all. It doesn't reach the tonal heights of the first, but I can easily imagine worse ways to finishing out this kind of trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One thing without question or debate, is that the first is still miles ahead of all the sequels.The biggest reason being, a coherent, non-confusing story. And just the right amount of supernatural. The second and third are notorious for being difficult to follow. You're almost expected to keep notes to try and keep tabs on alliances, deals, and betrayals. The supernatural also just becomes common place after the first and to the extreme.The conclusion to the original trilogy is still incredibly entertaining, as it is stunning.

There's no denying that. It's hard to hate Jack Sparrow with his flamboyant charm and his funny dialogue. He's just a lovable character, and many others than myself agree to that definitely. As the third film in this series, it's definitely a great stand out compared to most ""threequels"". Like the Ocean's movie series, the 1st one still stands out as the best, the 2nd one sort of disappoints, while the 3rd one lives up to it's expectations, even if it doesn't surpass the 1st one. I'm very glad that we didn't have to wait another three years to watch this movie just like we did with Dead Man's Chest, which left me dissatisfied with the results, but Jack Sparrow was great as usual.Awaiting for this movie, I didn't know what to expect. Now that I have seen it, it was definitely more violent, and pretty much so for a Disney movie. But it still maintained that feeling of what Pirates of the Caribbean is all about. I was also intrigued by Keira Knightley's performance, as she stands out quite a bit more here. The return of Geoffrey Rush is also a great treat. Finally, the intense battles sum up the pure entertainment of this film. This is why we go to the movies, to enjoy ourselves, and Pirates 3 gave us that enjoyment.All in all, this movie will not disappoint fans of the Pirates series at all. Like I said, while the 1st one still maintains the height of all three, this one comes closer than the 2nd one. Go watch it now while it's still in theaters! By the way, make sure you stay after the credits to watch an extra scene.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

No argue with that. But why? Was it because it had great battle scenes with massive and expensive computer generated elements. No. Apart from Barbossa's crew the whole film is generally computer free (compared to many other films). Then was it because it had incredibly complicated story lines with many entwined fates and characters? No. It was all rather simple. So why was it that Pirates 1 became a hit? Comedy. It's because Captain Jack Sparrow is a spontaneous drunken comedian.The second installment didn't play to much on this bit, so I hoped that the third would see where the second went wrong and correct that. It is such a shame it didn't.I'm not saying that ""Witty Jack"" didn't have any funny or clever lines. He had some good bits in both the second and third movies, but never enough. It's like he's grown away from the silliness and spontaneity. Not entirely of course, but enough to make you miss it. Pirates 3 left me hungry for more, but knowing that there wasn't anything more.7 out of 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Confusing and muddled third part loses its sense of fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1660547/?ref_=tt_urv","soxlade","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2589201/?ref_=tt_urv","23 May 2007","Saw a spanking digital print of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End last night and I came away puzzled, confused and disappointed. The entire franchise, which was heading for the rocks with middle sequel Dead Man's Chest, has finally sunk to the bottom with this third installment. Firstly, the plot. Well, I'm not entirely sure there was one amongst the crosses, double crosses and triple crosses that pretty much every character inflicts on every other character. Add in occult mystics, a goddess of the sea, a love struck villain (aha motivation! - oh no, it's another double cross), pirate councils, nine pieces of eight (huh?), hundreds of crabs, four lead ships, three separate crews, a wedding, several battles/swordfights and you can't complain that Pirates 3 doesn't offer lot for your entry fee. It's just a shame that it doesn't make any actual sense. The trouble is that every now and again, almost hidden beneath tons of turgid exposition dialogue, bizarre hallucination sequences, and loud, confusing action, lie some real gems of comedy - mostly involving Depp and Kevin McNally. Keith Richards is also excellent, though his scenes are much less fun than they should have been. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is still a fun character and the two pirates Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg have much more to do than in the second movie and are a good watch. In virtually every scene is Knightley, who does a good job of developing Elizabeth Swann and actually acts a couple of times, but basically spends her time looking extremely pretty. However Chow Yun Fat, Orlando Bloom and Tom Hollander are bland, dull characters who are paper thin. Biggest crime of the two sequels is the treatment of Jack Davenport's character Norrington, who could have been interesting to watch develop, but was abandoned in favour of Hollander's. Ultimately the characters, the plot, the script and the fun are all overwhelmed by the (admittedly fantastic) CGI. Though Depp pretty much saves every scene he's in, he can't save the full three hours. Pirates 3 has its moments, and at times is really great fun, but it is too long, too confusing, and too dull to be really worth the price of admission - though I suppose a feeling of being robbed could add to the pirate experience. Shame.","58 out of 113 found this helpful.

"","","Really....Three Hours???","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2432802/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","23 May 2011","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) ** (out of 4) The third film in the (then) trilogy has Turner, Swann and Captain Barbossa (Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush) going to Singapore to steal a ship and crew but are captured and forced to make a deal with Captain Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat). The new crew must then rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the ""Land of the Dead"" where we then get nearly three-hours of double crossings in order to get the goddess Calypso released. As I made my way through this original trilogy it became quite clear after the first movie that I certainly wasn't seeing what so many others were. I must admit that I'm rather shocked either of the sequels made any money because it's typically hard to get people's attention for such a long period of time and after the previous 151-minute running time the producers decided to go even further and making this third entry just ten-minutes shy of three hours. If you read my thoughts on the first two movies then this here is going to come off as a broken record but for the life of me I can't see why a ""B"" movie has to clock in at such a running time. I had heard many negative things about this third film but I really found myself enjoying the first hour. I thought all of the characters made a grand entrance and I thought there were some terrific visuals including a rather breath-taking sequence in the ice. Then, sadly, the film decided to throw one plot device after another until the point where the film just comes to a crashing halt and then things are made worse because you realize that you've still got 90-minutes to go. Needless to say I put the full blame of this film on the filmmakers for trying to be so ""epic"" but failing to remember that it's also important to keep your viewers entertained. I thought the dialogue was all poorly written, the story was all over the map and whenever something interesting would happen the movie would then just take off in another direction. As usual, the performance by Depp is the main reason to watch this thing as he clearly has this role down and could probably play it in his sleep. He's certainly lively enough to help keep the movie going but even a master such as himself can't overcome the various flaws. Bloom once again sleepwalks through his part and Knightly appears bored with the material as well. Rush comes out good once again as does Chow-Yun Fat in his part. Keith Richards makes an appearance and his cameo is certainly one of the highlights in the film but at the same time this too is rather disappointing because it's clear that he and Depp are not doing the scene together but instead editing is being used to cover that up. I'm sure fans of the series will find something more entertaining than I did but for me this entire series has been full of ups and downs. There's no question that there's enough material for a good movie but the producers and filmmakers went overboard and in the end none of the films are worth revisiting.","1 out of 14 found this helpful.

Amidst all of the nonsensical humor and action, I don't know how you wouldn't at least be entertained by what Johnny Depp & company had to offer.At World's End once again doubles down on everything that made the second film ridiculously fun. Except this time the film is a solid 2 hours and 48 minutes long. I guess if you're going to spend 300 million dollars on a film might as well make it lengthy, right? The length and it's convoluted and wandering plot are sure to annoy some viewers (it certainly annoyed me), but there's more than enough to make this another worthy entry in Disney's bankable series.After Beckett and the Navy managed to steal Davy Jones' heart and impose a ban on pirates across the seas, Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa must form an alliance to find Jack Sparrow and come together for one final battle. There's a lot to like here, including some of the best choreographed and shot action of the entire series. Merely analyzing the final 35 minutes was enough to get my blood flowing. This series has never shied away from going all out with action and escapades, and At World's End is no different. I'm not even sure 50 percent of the films made today look half as good as this film does. However, there are always downsides to relying heavily on the spectacle.As I mentioned with Dead Man's Chest, the spectacle overtook any sort of uniqueness or cleverness to the script that made the first adventure so fresh. Johnny Depp is way past the point of over-the- top, and so is the film. You feel like there's real danger in the first film, but most of that is gone by the supernatural and fantastical elements they bring in here. Nobody expected to see Sparrow sit an entire film out after being eaten by the Kraken last film, but it sure seemed pretty easy to get him back. And when we do get him back, he spends most of his time talking to hallucinated versions of himself that refuse to go away. The plot also tends to always fall back on one member of the crew being either 'missing' or 'captured' by another ship/crew. It gets tiring after a while.I think they set out to make the biggest adventure possible, and you have to give the people involved credit for truly bringing it. But I can completely understand where people get tired of mindless action without much wit and far less charm than the first film had. But hey, I'm still having a blast going back and re-watching some of my childhood favorites.+Spectacle is unmatched+Zimmer's score is epic+Jaw-dropping action-Plot wanders-Lengthy7.8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think.Just like the prequels, I had trouble understanding what was happening, what needed to happen and what just happened. From something simple like how most of dialog is spoken in Old English, to the fact the movie uses artsy, obscure scenes to explain a plot portion. For example, the rescue attempt on Jack. I had no idea where Jack was, how the crew got there and how they left until after all was said and done. This has been my biggest problem with the entire trilogy. I realize the that director wanted to avoid clichés as most as possible and thought that this would increase the quality, but sometimes simplicity is just as good.No knock on the acting or special effects here. Johnny Depp once again shows that why he's once of the greatest actors of our generations...he makes this film and without him this trilogy would not have survived. Knightly and company provide a nice supporting cast and even cover up Orlando Bloom's bumbling. And for the most part it's another visual masterpiece.So basically, if you enjoyed or even understood the first two you'll enjoy this one as well. If your like me and don't find this series at all interesting...stay at home and wait for Pay-Per-View.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Had it not been of the presence of Johnny Depp, I would never have seen it.Having said that, it's a rousing adventure with lots of action, special effects, and Depp. After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the the land of the dead, they must face Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms an alliance with Jones so that he can take over the seas and destroy the Pirates. Jack, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma, and crew summon the Pirate Lords from around the world. They want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy Jones's lover, from the trap they put her in; to do that, they have to combine the 9 sovereigns that will set her free so that she can help them fight. Depp and the rest of the cast are terrific - Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Pryce, etc. Keith Richards, Depp's inspiration for his characterization of Jack Sparrow, makes a brief appearance as Jack's father - he apparently was so drunk he needed to be propped up.Though this is a fabulous-looking movie, I doubt without the Depp characterization of Jack Sparrow that there would have been subsequent Pirates films. He is outrageous and fabulous with brilliant comic timing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After the movie was over i really wanted more, so i stayed after to see the little clip those movies always have at the end of the credits. If you didn't stay after you missed out.

I mean, sure, everybody loves a little swashbuckling action, wisecracks, and stunning special effects...but neither the second nor the third had nearly as much character development, plot material, or ingenuity as the first one.Now, granted, it was decent. Notice the 7 I gave it despite what it falls short of. But even then, I can't help but feel that this film is overrated. The action sequences were amazing, and yet tiresome at the same time. The first one kept you on the edge of your seat to see who would fall off of a wooden cart...and the third one had me yawning through exploding ships twirling down a maelstrom during a storm.It's almost as if the director and producers played with action figures to plot the entire course of the film. Watch it again and you'll notice how things fly freely to and fro without much thought. Granted, certain areas of the scenes are quite eye-popping. But it still seems somewhat...tasteless.Then there's the ridiculous way the characters bounce about and crack half-witted jokes (most of the time, some had me laughing). I noticed this beginning in the second one too. In the first one, people were dramatic and focused. The shots and angles were nothing short of poetic. In this one, it almost looks like a bunch of circus clowns (dressed up as pirates, of course) swinging across ropes and acting like eight-year-olds.Long review, eh? Well, long movie. Peter Jackson's King Kong was about as long as this, yet it held my interest until credits rolled. This was a tedious voyage with some interesting elements, but over all poorly executed. And you have to admit, the voodoo woman was nothing short of ridiculous. I've never heard a less convincing accent in my entire life. The Pillsbury Doughboy can be more ominous than her.So drink up, me hearties, yo ho! And hope to God there isn't a fourth one...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Short of the few odd adult males attending in full pirate gear though, I am pretty sure most viewers ended up feeling At World's End's excessive running time. Appeasing die-hard fans (apparently there are more then we think) of the franchise to an exhausting degree, the film lumbers back and forth between various back-stabbings and double-crossings going on in Jack Sparrow's crew, all to tediously apathetic results. Likewise, the unnecessarily dense script tries too earnestly to explain all the hackneyed mythology brought up in the first two films and instead makes viewers care even less.As as result, At World's End is not nearly as pleasurable as the first two's narrative arc would indicate. Bogged down by the detail-oriented plot, casual moviegoers will hardly get most details introduced previously in the series, let alone retain interest in these relatively obscure elements. It seems as if scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (both having written all three), realized the huge phenomenon Pirates had become, and spent their last screenplay vainly trying to justify all of the minor plot devices they thought viewers were interested in. They overvalued the specifics of this plot and in turn robbed the film of the one thing everybody loves; personality. Instead of letting characters breathe a little more on screen to make a lasting impression, At World's End spends a three hour run time ensuring viewers that every trite plot element from all three films will be given adequate closure.Faulting the cast and crew would be wrong; At World's End continues the impeccable production values and credible performances that initially set this ship off into our collective wallets. Here though, the over-bloated script just makes the over-boated set design even more frustrating. Once the film's obnoxiously extended and over-the-top finale is underway, the excitement leading up to that perilous showdown has all but been extinguished. The film will still do well in theaters and rightfully so; there is enough big-budget mayhem intercut throughout the epic bore to ensure seats will be filled. But Pirates 3 will remain in my eyes a quintessential warning to all potential popcorn franchises as to not take themselves too seriously, despite any success hinting to the contrary.","55 out of 111 found this helpful.

At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully, Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save ""Jack"" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable ""Lord Beckett"" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded ""Sao Feng"" (Chow Yun-Fat), ""Capt. Teague"" (the one and only Keith Richards) and a consortium of the most corrupt, venal and treacherous folks ever put on Earth. This time, though, it is ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) who steps up to the plate and demonstrates that she has come a long way since she was kidnapped from her father's home just a few short years ago to become a true kick-ass captain in her own right. This has much less of a story than the first two films; it sort of rehashes the tail end of the story from ""Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) just a bit too much and although the visual effects are superb, as usual, the whole thing just looked more like a victory for the marketing executives than the creative ones at Disney. The last half hour is all good fun, though, with a denouement that we could have had half an hour earlier and that would have served as a fitting conclusion to the adventures of this disparate band of pirates, lovers and scaly monsters. It's still watchable, but I fear this is all a bit tired and Verbinski et al are really struggling for that innovation that we have seen before.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It´s a very eventful movie with, maybe, a bit too many moving parts but at the same time it can feel empty and eventless at times. It can gloss over important aspects, yet still be 2 and a half hours long. I don´t know why I still like it as much as I do, but I see it as an ending to a franchise I enjoy and no more pirates movies came out after this right?Lord Beckett has made piracy nearly impossible to do and anyone associated with pirates are executed. Beckett also has the Flying Dutchman, and all hope seems lost. Captain Barbossa has a plan to free the sea goddess Kalypso but he needs all the 9 pirate lords to do so, and one of them is the dead Jack Sparrow. But how do you make the dead come back?I love the scale and execution of the adventure. This feels like the epic finally no doubt and so many ideas and set pieces are all great on paper. The movie has a lot it wants to do though and it can make iconic moments seem less epic when it only has a few minutes of screentime. But the worldbuilding and lore is what draws me in with the movie. It´s so fun to explore the pirate lore and all the different magical places.'I think the humor is hit or miss. There is a lot of random equals funny humor and that personally don't land with me. There are also gags that are drawn out a bit too long such as the beginning joke of Elizabeth Swann taking out her weapons. But the humor is good most of the time and I laughed on multiple occasions. It´s just a charming and fun cast that, with their characters, can sell the reactions they do as humor.The most misplaced trust the movie gave me is that it thinks I care about every character and their relations. I don´t believe all the romance going on as it seems added just because and so many character deaths means nothing to me, but the characters are crying and screaming. I´m personally here for the fun adventure and humor, not for the romance and character drama.But you have to love the expanded cast here. Even the small characters has their moments and for a deep fan there is a lot of fanservice going on here. Of course, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow disappear into the role and delivers iconic line after iconic line. He is the heart and soul of the movie but he doesn't seem to be the center of the movie. No character really doses and it can seem very main character-less and therefore all the character drama doesn't land that well. But other highlights are no doubt Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, a fun and interesting villain, Tom Hollanders as lord Beckett and his amazing deadpan and my favorite character Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He really gives his all as always and every line, face and jokes work so well coming from him. 'The dialogue doesn't always land for me. It can be a bit over explaining with the lore and over dramatic. It can work for a universe like this and when a character like Barbossa or Tia Dalma say the dialogue it works. It´s worse when normal people try to make it work and Elizabeth and Will just don't make the dialogue work for me. They sound so unnatural and like they have no idea what they are saying.There are some added plot elements from the previous movie that seems a bit out there and like they don't belong In my opinion. The focus on Kalypso all of a sudden and the identity seems a bit too convenient, even though it makes sense from a plot standpoint.Some of the CGI still looks amazing and some look less polished from even the previous movies standards. Davy Jones still looks good, but his crew looks fake. Some ship scenes looks incredible some look fake. The final battle is a huge mess if it looks good or not. I think they should have focused more on simpler assignments and maybe not have the movie take such a long time which adds extra work.The costumes and makeup are pretty good though. Every pirate lord looks distinct and are instantly recognizable and the locations are cool and well done.The score is also really good. The use of quire works so well to make a beautiful score and the song in the beginning is iconic. In general, the movie has those iconic scenes that really sticks with you like the destruction of a ship towards the end.The action is fine, but it really wants me to feel it´s more epic than it actually is. It can seem a bit anticlimactic in hindsight. I don't feel a lot during the acting and while there of course are moments I liked and remember; the movie clearly didn't quite know what to do with all its set pieces at times. Here are like a million ships, 2 fight. Here is the end of the world, its nothing. Jack is crazy now which doesn't really add much other than literally telling you what the character is thinking. The movie has so many things going on that don't do much. They are fun on paper but adds nothing to the plot.At worlds end seem like a grand blockbuster no doubt. The runtime is longer, the fights bigger, the world expanding but I don't know if the movie could carry it. It becomes a bit too grand for it´s own good, taking itself a bit too seriously at times, and leaves you with a fun and entertaining movie but not with the epic grandness it clearly aimed for.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They look really good, but try taking a bite out of it and all you get is a mouth full of wax. That's how Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End made me feel. It has amazing visuals. Duh. Every special effects movie made from here to the end of eternity is going to have amazing visuals. If you haven't noticed by now nerds with computers can do some really cool stuff if you throw enough money at them. Back in the 90's good visuals could carry a movie, like say, Independence Day, but they can't do it any more. In the past 10 years we've seen people fly and dodge bullets in slow motion, we've seen New York City destroyed in a disturbingly large variety of ways, we've seen the armies of Rohan ride to the rescue of Gondor crushing orcs under foot, we've seen every imaginable object or animal anthropomorphized from toys, to cars, to penguins several times over. All that to say you can't just impress me with visuals anymore. I demand a story I can follow and enjoy; is that too much to ask of a good movie? I'm not asking for Dickens, not even Tom Clancy, just a passable story that an intelligent person can follow. Pirates doesn't give me this. And more than that, it takes lovable characters and diminishes them by placing them into this joke of a script. You know why the first Pirates movie was good? I didn't know a person who sat down to watch it who didn't like it. Now 90% of the audience is walking out of the theaters scratching their heads.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

I thought it rounded things off well, The ending is gutting mainly because i know there isn't a 4th one, but i'm hoping and praying there's another!! I could keep watching them!! I don't get why everyone that watches POC becomes a critic!! At the end of the day it has a fantastic cast and amazing characters, the storyline must be entertaining otherwise people wouldn't want to watch them. Also its supposed to be a film suitable for children AND adults, there for the story has to be simple and entertaining, in a way that both can enjoy together! I don't know if its just because I have become sensitive but my emotions were running high i was on the edge of my seat, i laughed like a little girls again and almost cried,although I missed parts, never drink a litre of pop/soda the films too good to waste time in the loos!! oh and girls!! Johnny and Orlando WOW!! I mean never really been an Orlando fan but he gets better with each film i think its a mix of rough looking pirate with a tan. well i didn't think i could write so much i know this isn't the most useful review but this is a true fans opinion!I loved it and i think if you haven't seen the other two films you must watch BOTH of the first to get the full feel, its worth it!!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Every character has their own agenda to carry out. Worse yet, most of their agendas are 'hidden' in the sense that their true motives only become known through minor plot twists. Eventually, there comes a point when the viewer simply stops caring.On a more positive note, though, once one stops caring about the loosely-threaded narrative, one can truly enjoy the movie. Even if you stop listening to any of the babble that relates to the plot, the movie 's still fun to watch, what with all the pirates, the sword fighting, the ship battles, etc. With the exception of a few characters, the cast proves to be very entertaining, especially Depp's wonderfully acted Jack Sparrow, of course. Orlando Bloom's Turner and Keira Knightly's Elizabeth Swann felt, more or less, thrown into the story more as eye candy rather than genuine plot elements. Both of them did serve a purpose in that mess of a plot, but neither were the least bit memorable. Perhaps that was more thanks to their acting rather than their characters. Arguably, had the two been taken out, the movie would have been much better.Lastly, the visual effects are top-notch. The phrase 'very damn impressive' sums up my thoughts on the special effects.Part of me wants to delve deeper into the film and discuss some of its finer details, but honestly, I would recommend not expecting much out of the movie upon paying for a ticket. As long as you go into the film without having any lofty expectations, you'll enjoy the experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I knew a third one would shortly follow it, so I was hoping that it could make up for all that was bad in Dead Man's Chest and hopefully wrap up the story properly. However, after seeing both Shrek 3 and Spiderman 3, I was feeling very apprehensive that POTC 3 would do much better. (Shrek 3 is not terrible, but save your money and don't see Spiderman 3, rent it when it comes out on DVD and as soon as Tobey starts dressing in all black, looking emo, and dancing, just skip the scene, and maybe the movie will seem alright to you.) The movie however starts out with a very serious hanging scene and some child singing...mirroring the opening of the first movie. I was like ""yes! it might actually be good!"" And it was.Johnny Depp was brilliant, adding a whole new layer to the crazy Jack Sparrow and even showing a more serious layer behind the character who really hasn't been explored as much as the others. Geoffery Rush was awesome and is possibly the character that the Second movie needed because he brings the pirate spirit back to the pirate movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly's characters are fighting for a large part of the beginning, and although it is not fully explained why they work it out, just assume that true love conquers all, and let it go. Also, be sure to stay after the credits to learn more about their love relationship. Speaking of love, Davy Jones and his love get a more fleshed out story line, which was also not completely explained, but Davy Jones's story is at least finally explained. Keith Richards's character was not a huge roll, but was much more than just a cameo, so I was happy. The character Tia Dalma was excellent! As for everyone else that I haven't mentioned, they were all very good--I have no complaints.As for the plot, well it is filled with back to back betrayals and the switching of sides happens possibly more often than Dead Man's Chest, only it isn't as hard to follow. The only part that gets a little confusing is the nine pieces of eight...because the line explaining it properly is delivered too suddenly. The main reason the plot is less confusing is because the majority of the plot just adds to the characters' stories, which is a good thing for me.The couple of things that were probably over done was the over stereotyping of the other pirates from the other countries. Captain Sao Feng was the only character that was not completely a terrible stereotype, and that is only because the character is given a more detailed story in the film. There were also a ridiculous amount of lines referring back to past movie jokes. The first few were fine...but they manage to cross the limit on how many times you can do it before it takes away from the movie.Basically: Pirates is funny and entertaining. I still cared about the characters and enjoyed the new ones as well. It was much better than Dead Man's Chest and a good addition to the series. It was a feast for the eyes and was action packed. I liked, I loved it, I saw it twice, I'll probably see it again and I'm going to buy the DVD.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Second part had it's moments. So I was anxious for number three. First off, this is visually spectacular movie. I watched it twice and I'm bound to buy a DVD. It's adventurous and long, as I like it. But besides that it doesn't deliver too much. As for cast, Yun-Fat Chow is a great addition, Kevin McNally gives his standard enchanting side-kick part, and Geoffrey Rush is simply BRILLIANT, I'm really glad this sequel returns masterful captain Barbossa into play. On the other side Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are leading in their horrendous acting that's getting worse from sequel to sequel. My favorite Johnny Depp with the help of the script slowly but surely crosses the line in overacting his Jack Sparrow making it less and less attractive. Keith Richards role is superfluous although acceptable. As for the story, it repeats the standard mistake of sequels, trying to tie up all loose ends and reveal everything mentioned in all other parts. We all saw that before with Star Wars and dissection of Anakin Skywalker mystery, but obviously makers thought why not, it brings good money. Eternal love, eternal suffer, some story concepts sound good but are laid down too weekly and they miss the spot. Big adventure, but if I ask you who, where, why, what at the end of this movie, I doubt you could give me a coherent answer. So if you like pirate stories like I do, watch this movie for it's brilliant sets, costumes, photography and effects. What we could yearn for is masterpiece that this kind of visuals could bring if coupled with a better, more daring script. This could be a cult movie, forging and crafting peoples taste instead of blockbuster conforming to the bland average taste of masses. Well, let's wait for number 4 (pirates and the fountain of life as we learn), this movie is just good enough to make you crave for more...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even that was a disappointment as his role was minimal and lines few.Keira Knightly's costumes were absurd. Where on earth would she have picked up those outfits and managed as many changes as she did in the mêlée? Not to mention the stupid hat she wore throughout most of the movie. I loved the first movie in the Trilogy, but I have to say that the second and third were progressively more disappointing than the last.

Plot is strictly secondary to showcasing the talents of Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast. In this film the creators seemed to have lost sight of the main strength of their franchise, namely,it is fun to watch. They have attempted to create a mythology and give texture and history to their franchise. Unfortunately for them they are not dealing with Lord of the Rings but a film created from a theme park ride. Too much of the film is wasted by trying to give what is and should be a popcorn film depth through an intricate plot. I would much have preferred a few more cheap laughs rather than being insulted with such a ludicrous plot. In the rare moments when Pirates is allowed to be Pirates in the movie it still puts a smile on my face. However, in my opinion this film is not effective as the two earlier installments because it is strangled by an overcomplicated plot which is out of place for such a film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sure, the movie is probably 45 minutes longer than it should have been. And yes, there are a multitude of details that don't add up or are just left dangling. And granted, the franchise drifted away from the stellar humor on display in the classic first installment. But, if you see a lot of movies, you have to admit that the visual feast provided here by director Gore Verbinski is a fitting send off (hopefully) for these beloved Pirates! The usual suspects are all back ... Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. For some reason, Depp's screen time is again limited and Knightley's is expanded. She doesn't have the chops to pull off ""King of the Pirates"", but Verbinski obviously enjoys seeing her face (and weak voice) on screen. Rush sparkles as Barbossa and Bill Nighy actually gets to show a glimpse of the face behind the tentacles! Naomie Harris has much more to do in this one as the pivotal Calypso character ... with some spectacular powers. And the always excellent Stellan Skaarsgard provides a touch of class as Bootstrap Bill. Joining the cast are Chow Yun-Fat as a powerful Singapore pirate and, of course, the much anticipated appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad.The story itself is a bit messy and convoluted, but again, this is about the visuals. The battle scenes are overwhelming and the ships are very impressive. For special effects, few, if any, have ever been better. The disappointment stems from what is a near waste of one of the most interesting and entertaining characters in film history, Jack Sparrow. The second and third films just didn't allow Depp to do much with Sparrow. When he does have screen time, the theatre comes alive with anticipation. Sparrow is who most of us have come to see. It could have been so much more.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's also rather messy. There are so many backstabs and underhanded deals that it's actually confusing at times: who's double-crossing who while protecting someone else? The thing also suffers from a bit of a villain problem; it severely neuters Davy Jones, taking his presence from threatening to almost comedic, and attempts to replace him with the smarmy Beckett and his East India Company, who make compelling side villains but can't hold a candle to their more memorable pirate counterparts. After the first hour, which is spent mopping up the mess left by the sequel-bait ending of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)', the film starts to pick up the pace and move towards its genuinely thrilling finale with increasing vigour. Indeed, it feels distinct from its predecessor despite the fact it was filmed back-to-back with it as, for all intents and purposes, a 'part two'. It has its own, increasingly 'epic' aesthetic and it's really rather visually impressive. The VFX team clearly made good use of the time between this film and the last, as the CGI has improved greatly. The aforementioned finale is amazing, with sea-weary ships entwining over a maelstrom as pirates lock swords on their masts. This leads into a satisfying ending that ties up all the trilogy's arcs rather well, while still leaving things 'open' for potential sequels. Overall, the movie has its issues but its climax is fantastic and, even at its worst, it's always entertaining. It isn't the best of the series but it isn't the worst, either. It's a solid, swashbuckling adventure. 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Instead, the film expanded upon everything that I detested in the sequel. I squirmed in my seat for nearly three hours, desperately clinging to every mildly funny one-linerthe only source of relief from the torturous boredom.The fact that I say ""boredom"" is rather ironic considering Pirates 3 is nothing but frenetic stimulation. But my senses took in all they could handle in the first hour before they just seemed to shut off involuntarily.One perpetrator is the bombastic scoreunyielding, and punctuating absolutely every dramatic moment with piercing, orchestral emphasis.While the acting is at least competent, the script dictated that almost every moment of dialogue be treated as a revelation of the highest order. Characters rattled on with grave seriousness about mystical secrets, fearful creatures, and budding betrayals. It seemed inspired by The Lord of the Rings, minus universal themes, a moral compass, and a plot that anyone cares about.I might have cared about plot if it wasn't so overly complex and often incomprehensible. Part of the problem, not unlike X-Men 3, was the juggling of too many characters. Even with a running time approaching three hours, there is no time for real character development. With so many talented actors fighting for screen time, Gore Verbinski continually bounces from one to the next just so we remember who's in the film.On the upside are the fantastic special effects, meticulous and impressive art direction, and well-crafted (albeit totally unrealistic) action pieces. But the story problems simply sucked out the joy from any of these cinematic pleasures. After about the fifteenth double-cross (and having lost track of allegiances in the first place) I felt like screaming ""I don't care!"" and running out of the theater like a deranged 8 year-old girl.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

But aside from a few good CGI effects, this one seems like a different film altogether which is really quite jarring.I didn't like the opening scenes, it didn't fit with the other two films at all and was quite violent for a Disney.The rather pointless host of new characters introduced at the beginning were wholly unlikable and really seemed to detract from the pirate theme, and the story line wasn't as easy to follow as it should've been.I liked that the director experimented with Jack's subconsciousness and the Locker scenes are just wonderfully bizarre, but aside from that, the acting throughout was lacklustre.Keira Knightly, who I loved in The Curse of the Black Pearl, seemed especially annoying in this and spends the ENTIRE film with her mouth wide agape, for reasons that elude me completely. Even Naomi Harris's mysterious Tia Dora character, who seemed so enchanting in Dead Mans Chest, completely lost her shine in this film.There was, however, one saving grace - the unsurpassable acting talent of Geoffrey Rush as the roguish, twinkly-eyed Captain Barbosa, who kept the narrative sailing along and single handedly made a valiant attempt to keep the magic of the first film alive.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are many plot points and many new characters. These new characters are trying to find room on the screen amidst all of the returning old characters. Take a bathroom break before the film, and don't blink for the rest of it, or you will miss something. ;o) Seriously though, it does move very quickly.I think this film would have been better if they had trimmed some of the unnecessary stuff. There were more than a couple of occasions where I distinctly said, ""EWWWW! That was SO totally unnecessary!"" Most of you will know one of these scenes as soon as you see it.I really missed Jack's quirky lines in this one. There weren't as many as I have come to expect. Some of the special effects were unbelievable...absolutely amazing! Then again, some were incredibly cheesy. One in particular, when one character's size increased dramatically in a short span of time, looked like it had been created in the 70's rather than with today's amazing technology.My main complaint though was that this was a long film, and there were parts that could have been cut or edited that would have helped the film along.On the other hand though, there were many parts that were what we have come to love about these films. There was a lot of humor, there were some excellent action sequences and some of the visuals were awesome. The music, as always, was phenomenal.I think I would like to see it again so that I can watch for little things that I missed. The film moved so fast that it was difficult to focus on small details...I was afraid that I would miss something.I actually was not expecting that ending at all. I may be in the minority, but I was really surprised. They did leave an opening for another, and from what I have read, Johnny Depp is not ruling out another one.All in all, it was good, but not fabulous. My husband didn't like it that much. Some people, like my hubby, will think that there is too much going on and not enough time devoted to getting to know any of the new characters.It's definitely an escape from reality. Enjoy that, if nothing else. :o)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a million dollar (okay, a $400 million) question, one that should be aimed at now uber-successful director Gore Verbinski. At World's End really doesn't seem to have any sort of real script, presumably cobbled hastily by excitable Hollywood executives in an urge to please every demographic.The result is a tremendous mishmash, a hideous blend of cliché and hammy acting, with a few tiny slivers of wit.But then, of course, there's Johnny Depp.It's painfully ironic to consider that Depp -- that quirkiest of the super-talented leading men, the man behind films of groundbreaking ingenuity and insane characters -- seems to have sold his soul to Davy Jones' Dollar. As a result, the films are now designed around clever Jack one-liners, the bloated plot and thick character stew serving only as backdrop for moments Jack mercifully chooses to come on screen and seduce us, instantly. Except, alas, he doesn't do that enough. It's as if the old sea dog knows the film is tripe, and couldn't be bothered to help it along more. The plot has an interesting premise,with gallows and song. The East India Company is taking over the high seas (the world, pretty much) and the only form of rebellion is coming from the Pirates. It's a great concept for the world today, spanners thrown into the corporate machinery by swashbuckling purveyors of piracy, freeing up expression and sticking it to the man. The film, of course, chooses to ignore this entirely, getting tangled up in a ridiculous story instead.And what a messy yarn it is, chock-full of curses, goddesses, alter egos, clones and crabs. And a slew of characters. Figuratively, that is; Chow Yun-Fat's Sao Feng is admittedly blessed with pretty scars, but that's pretty much it. A bad French pirate and a squeaky Sikh? How's that for wealth of character.And Knightley is particularly painful, the pouty anorexic expression doing little for the stunner as she overacts her way, chewing up scenery.Of course, this is way, way larger than life. The budget is massive, and so there is much detailing. The art direction is excellent, as are the costumes, and some special effects set-pieces are simply stellar. It's just that in a film stretching to almost three hours (and feeling close to four), after a point it just all seems like one big wet sword-fight.This one -- save for the incredible screen moment of seeing Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards play dad to Jack Sparrow, the character modeled loosely on himself -- has nothing, really. And is much, much longer.The first Pirates Of The Caribbean was an absolute corker, a film that made you switch to rum and sport an eyepatch. This new film requires you wear two.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

(Pardon me with using the abbreviations, but I guess you know exactly what they stand for.) Funny how the 2-disc DVD of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END which I got for Christmas included a list of the many questions asked by fans about this third, possibly the biggest, chapter in the highly successful, wildly excessive yet strongly executed series. But after seeing the film (having overlooked it for a very long time since its release), I realized what the list was for exactly. For, while the biggest most elaborate 'Pirates' of them all, it was also the longest and most confusing. While the first and the second film in the series had their own shares of overlong and muddled moments, POTC: AWE has probably the most confusing plot, not just of the series, but probably for any summer-action 'event' blockbuster for a very long time.The new adventure, still penned by the originals' Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, tries to tie up the loose ends from the previous chapter, DEAD MAN'S CHEST, and putting the big-budget series to a complete close (reminding me much of what George Lucas did with RETURN OF THE JEDI). But before the curtains drop, POTC: AWE packs in as much twists, unlikely conclusions and other goodies that the film is either too big to fit in the package, or the package is just too big to fit in to everyone's heads. Too much details, too much characters and too much conclusions make for one confusing escapade that's a bit too hard to follow. By this time, POTC: AWE would seem to drown its own vessel with its own cargo, but in comes Johnny Depp's hilarious Jack Sparrow, in comes the elaborate special effects and in comes are favorite characters which we all loved from the series. When they do, the show gives us exactly what we came for.POTC: AWE may be too hard to follow, but it is exactly what we came for: A big-budget, go-for-broke action adventure that takes us on a roller-coaster ride that doesn't have a seat belt to keep you from falling from the edge of your seat. The 'Pirates' series has certainly evolved form the enjoyable, if somewhat overrated, CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. And while this one isn't as good as POTC: DMC, arguably the best in the series, it's still the biggest and most elaborate. In this third (and probably final) chapter, The gang of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and back-from-the-dead Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is off to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, still in perfect shape) from the legendary Davey Jones' locker, then do battle with their angry-as-hell foes including the corrupt Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), the slimy Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and an entire armada of battleships, leading to a 1-hour climax that only a talented action director and a team of creative special effects wizards can create, and the team behind this, and the rest of the film, is just that.Director Gore Verbinski is a top-flight action director, here showing his best in the film's most action-packed sequences. On the other hand, he also shows his talents in humor in the film's funnier sequences, joined by Depp and Rush's hilarious performances (but I guess that goes to everyone). The special effects are still astonishing, the action is one thrill after another and the comedy is still sharp and hilarious. For pure action and comedy, trust this pirate!

From the beginning we are thrown into interesting confrontions, progressing to some decent early battle scenes'. Also, from the outset we had elements of humour put into the film, which I thought made it all the more entertaining. As the film progressed though, I found that it was ultimately covering a lot of the same ground that the two previous films had.I would definitely say that this part of the Pirates saga was, overall, a success (I enjoyed this more than Dead Man's Chest but not as much as the original, as I feel that the Curse Of The Black Pearl is still by far the most superior of the three). There also looks like there will be another which I will most probably go and see, and hope to be up to the standard of this one.However, for me these sequels have lost the depth to be called 'great films'. On the surface they are entertaining, funny, and can be watched across the board by almost anyone. But when I finished watching this film it didn't leave me with any lasting feeling. These types' of films are what I like to call 'Fast Food Films'. What I mean by this is that when you go to a film like this you know exactly what your getting. It stays with you whilst your watching it and then as soon as you've finished it you don't think about it again, because ultimately there's nothing really to think about. Very similar to a fast food restaurant, you eat, your fairly satisfied and then you leave.To conclude, I have given this a 7/10. It was entertaining and I will go and see the next installment of Pirates, this is not that great a film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This third part is usually remembered as the weakest of the initial three films in the franchise, something that is even unfair, considering the way The Chest of Death was finished. That said, it is undeniable that this final chapter has numerous defects, one of them being the prolonged duration, a characteristic inherited from its predecessors. Yes, there are missed opportunities and poorly taken advantage of, but that does not mean that this is not a worthy closure for this first part of the adventures of Jack Sparrow and his troupe.In ""At the End of the World,"" Lord Cuttler Beckett (Tom Hollander), of the East India Company, takes command of the ghost ship Flying Dutchman. The ship, now under the command of Admiral James Norrington (Jack Davenport), has the mission to roam the seven seas in search of pirates and kill them without mercy. In order to arrest Beckett, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) need to reunite the Nine Lords of the Brotherhood Court. However, one of the Lords is missing, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). The trio leaves for Singapore, intending to get the map that will lead them to the end of the world, which will allow Jack to be rescued. However, to get the map they will need to face a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat).This is a work that invariably needs to be watched right after O Baú da Morte. Many of the events that take place here continue those we saw in the predecessor and the script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is not at all concerned with reminding us of what had happened, except, of course, of Sparrow's death. The whole dynamic involving Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) or even Davy Jones will sound extremely confusing to those who do not remember the previous feature film, and as a result, it is safe to say that this third installment of the franchise does not hold up at all by itself.The highlight, obviously, goes to the final battle, which is something complex and fun, with countless actions being carried out by the most diverse characters. Gore Verbinski really shines in the direction, hitting the scope of this duel between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, with Stephen Rivkin's montage making everything extremely dynamic, while we jump from pirate to pirate, everyone fighting for something specific, be it Barbossa trying to keep Pearl in an advantageous position, or Jack dueling against Davy at the top of the mast. Even an impromptu wedding we have a chance to see. It is an impressive sequence, which does not sound as drawn as the climax of the previous two. Despite this, the script simply ignores all the pirate lords, who only watch the entire combat, as well as the British East India Company fleet, something that makes no sense. The worst thing is that it ends up making almost all interaction in the pirates' stronghold unnecessary, since the alliance signed there does not bring any results, besides giving Elizabeth ""powers"". The same goes for Calypso, although some tips about it were given in The Chest of Death.As we discussed above, this third part ends up wasting many of the cards at its disposal, not doing justice to the two fleets that face each other in this final battle. There are countless points to be tied, so many subplots developing at the same time, an enormous amount of characters with little enough time on the scene to awaken empathy in the viewer. Almost three hours long, the script goes around so many times that we are asking ourselves: ""But what are they really doing? What do they want? Where are they going? What are they looking for? Who needs to be saved?"" There are so many exaggerations that we are anesthetized, amortized, and we don't even pay attention, inert with the twists and turns, just when the opposite should be happening.
Here, Captain Jack Sparrow has a good time, but ends up sharing the screen with countless characters that fill the screen. Geoffrey Rush, the scary Captain Barbossa, became a mere supporting character, almost without purpose - all the uproar caused by his appearance at the end of the second film vanishes in the air. The same is true of Bill Nighy's terrible Davy Jones, who had caused so much fear and disgust previously, but which now resembles a tormented puppet. But really bad are the two great additions to the cast: Chow Yun-Fat (The Tiger and the Dragon, 2000), as vaunted as the most dangerous pirate in the east, dies before the middle of the film, while the long-awaited and commented participation by rocker Keith Richards (member of the band Rolling Stones), as Sparrow's father, besides being insignificant, it takes more than two hours to happen. With Tom Hollander gaining more prominence in this film, the graphic narrative takes new directions. Jones leaves the antagonism a little aside and is replaced by Beckett. Hollander delivers a good villain, of those that we feel hatred just by hearing his name, but it falls short of the prominence that Bill Nighy gives the captain of the Flying Dutchman.On the technical side, there is no doubt about the spectacular work. Dariusz Wolski's photography remains one of the points that make this series a success. As dark as the scene is and with a lot of rain, we can see the richness of details that the production team managed to put in the scenarios that comprised the two ships. Not to mention that, throughout the film, we have numerous scenes of destruction of vessels and locations made without the help of CGI, such as Singapore and the island where the Pirate Brotherhood Court meeting takes place. The soundtrack is again splendid, once again featuring compositions by the genius Hans Zimmer. Tracks like ""The Brethren Court"", ""Calypso"", ""What Shall We Die for"" and ""One Day"" enrich the story of the plot and make it even more epic.Some of the characteristics of pirate films were lost, but it made up for the new characters, the action scenes with masterfully choreographed fights and the creation of new scenarios and conflicts. The problem is that everything was left to be solved in a third part. And it is a lot. A lot of things. As if the complicated plot weren't enough, with the appearance of new characters, the humor was lost. And it is precisely this obligation to tie up all the stories and close the cycle that ends up being too big a load for the old Caribbean ships. With a darker plot, and that consequently has less funny situations, time never seems to run. The long explanations of the inexplicable tie not only the heads of first-time sailors, not to mention the countless twists and betrayals so meaningless that in the end all that remains for the viewer is to let the story go and look at the horizon, waiting for the final battle that is approaching and the end that never comes - there is a 2h48 projection until that hidden scene after the credits.With a very closed ending, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At the End of the World"" fulfills, very well, the duty of giving all characters their respective happy endings and leads some others to find their cruel destinies. Without a doubt, this is the most epic Pirates of the Caribbean film. However, the film sins in rhythm, with inappropriate timing and showing an empty profusion of meaningless special effects, as if they were there just to justify the $ 300 million spent on the budget. Despite all the problems, it is a film made with absolute care and that provides several striking scenes. It is a guaranteed fun that is worth embarking on.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Pirates was a great film, and the second was a letdown, and I was hoping this would live up to the expectations of the first...and it didn't. But it came really close, and it was enjoyable. In this installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", all the chaos from the second film unfurls and the gang gets Captain Jack Sparrow back. If you thought Johnny Depp was strange in the first film, you should see him here playing numerous hallucinations of himself. The main problem with this movie was it didn't quite know what it was. One second it was slapstick comedy, where next it was drama. For the most part they switched back and forth pretty well, but sometimes it just felt odd. Another problem was too much fantasy and unexplained pirate lore, like tipping the ship to make them get to where they were before. But for the most part, this was not a letdown and Prates fans will be pleased.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 164 mins. PG-13 for strong violence.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Firstly, they came up with the idea based on a ride in a theme park... There wasn't much material to begin with, so they padded it, and then the scriptwriters got confused. Secondly, they've been stretching the length of the movies, now it's almost 3 hours long. This leads me to my advice on the show: Don't drink too much water before viewing (for obvious reasons) and get plenty of rest the night before. I say that because the guy next to me actually fell asleep and started to snore midway through the movie.It starts with a bang, slows in the middle and gets ridiculous at the end. If you like your movies without a shred of realism, watch this. If you look for plot, look elsewhere. Part 1 was good, 2 left me wanting more, 3 killed the franchise for me. Let's just hope Disney doesn't produce Part 4.

Summer action films consist of no plot, to much visual effects, bad dialog, and moments of just pure cheese. Understanding this can make or brake your viewing experience.This is one of the first summer action films I have enjoyed in a long long time. I don't know why, but for some reason I had a total blast watching this movie, and its strange because I have not been impressed by a summer action film since 1998.Hans Zimmer's score really stood out. It just worked for me. Even the electric guitar crap worked. The score was my favorite part of the film.I thought the visual effects looked better then Dead Man's Chest. Though it looks like they had trouble (or did not have time) with some of the compositing. I noticed bad green screen keys every so often.The Acting was strong overall, even when a character had to give a corn ball speech. Orlando Bloom normally can't act, but I though this was one of his stronger performances. Also the love story worked better then expected, I was worried to would be as retard as the new Star Wars love story. In Pirates however I actually felt some sort of chemistry between the two.Critics have not been so nice to this franchise, but they forget what type of film this is. Its not art, its great trash! Besides I'm sure not a single critic could direct trash this well. Critics are kind of lame, they attempt to appear intelligent by throwing down big words (all of which the average person wont understand) in abstract and empty points that don't really even apply to the actual viewing experience of the film.Overall At World's End was great entertainment.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End""  If Only That Were True","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1662088/?ref_=tt_urv","frankwhat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3927011/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2007","The third installment of the ""Pirates"" saga kicked off and I got to screen it a day early. I really enjoyed the first entry and thought the second one was over-budgeted and ended up taking the series in a direction that I didn't like. ""At World's End"" wouldn't be much different. It ironically turned out to be similar in structure to the third ""Spider-Man"" movie which opened up only a couple weeks earlier being that it was a little too long, had corny love scenes, and was extremely confusing to a majority of the viewers. However I think that ""Spider-Man 3"" was the better film as this one exceeded to excess on all those factors. While there was action aplenty and even scenes I liked, when I left the theater I harbored an empty feeling.It was evident that while the action was there, a really satisfying concrete story wasn't. For example a new type of all-powerful character was introduced and built up for the first two-thirds of the movie, but when they finally do come to fruition it's an extreme letdown. In fact many new elements were introduced that weren't fully explained that just left me wondering why they even needed to throw these in the script in the first place. It was if they were more concerned about creating a long running time than an understandable story.The swashbuckling was decent and there were many fights, however not as many important ones as there were in the first twowhere it had more one-on-one duels. Here there were many every person for themselves free for all's. Another problem was the blur of succeeding betrayals. This made it hard to distinguish who was who. I like knowing whom to root for, or at least thinking I know who to root for. The special effects were amazing and the actual production itself was pretty flawless but it was a clear case of all style and no substance. Well maybe not no substance, but very little.Johnny Depp while having some funny moments didn't build on his character whatsoever and didn't even have the most comical parts this time around. They seemed to have gone to the parrot and the monkey. At least half of Sparrow's humor fell flat, as they were just rehashed jokes and retorts that I heard back in elementary school. Orlando Bloom's acting was safely bad as usual in his case. Keira Knightley was okay, but she's more there as a pretty face than a legitimate thespian. The supporting cast was exceptional though just as they had been in the first two movies, and luckily for the ticket buyer they had a lot of screen time. So between the good and the bad here it about evened out.At least all the open-ended conflicts were resolved at the end and there weren't anymore real cliffhangers. However it's appearing pretty favorable that there's going to be another trilogy on top of this which I'm not looking forward to as the series quality has declined steadily with each film. It's basically one big money making scheme now by just throwing a bunch of special effects on the screen along with a few cute people and have the young masses come teeming in spending their parents not so hard-earned dough. This is why I wish they just ended everything here while there was still a shred of dignity left, but Hollywood can't seem to let anything be if there's a shred of money to be made lately.Even though this was a long movie it actually goes by somewhat quickly which was especially surprisingly given how slow moving some of the scenes are and the fact that a lot of inane dialog is thrown into the mix. It actually is worth watching and is probably even above average but falls far short of what it could've been. I also predict that this will break box office records without a doubt, as a film doesn't have to be good to achieve that anymore. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" was decent but didn't live up to the anticipation that was generated and if these epics are continued to be made like this I'll certainly be at wit's end!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is slightly confusing on which side they chose, they seem to be cheating each other or either feel that the side is bad, they chose another. Basically the sides are will's, Davy Jones' and Lord Cutler Beckett's. I have to admit that it is fun to watch the three sides clash together and you get a pretty intense war. The story is Elizabeth Swann and Barbossa going to Singapore to get Will and get help from captain Sao feng to get Jack sparrow back. It continues from where it last stop in Pirates of the Caribbean 2. You get more answers to your questions like the curse gold. With special effects that are realistic, what could go wrong. The director had the story entertaining as to keep people glued to the screen, making it suspense at times. They went to islands with perils, they sail in the sea with perils, everywhere they go, there is perils, that is why it is entertaining. Yes, it is long but it has cool action to keep you entertain, the last battle will blow you off.It is packed with action with loud music blaring in your ears, it has humour too. I can probably say that this is the best of Pirates of the Caribbean movies. You want cool action together with loud music, catch this. The price of the ticket is worth. I like it, may be one of the best part 3 movies, but this ending is somehow disappointing. Never mind that, you watch for the action or for the funny jack sparrow.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Employing the same approach as the previous film, it is in no two minds of what kind of world it is set in. The original may have been grounded in reality despite its plethora of undead pirates, but At World's End is rooted firmly in a fantastical universe where normal rules do not apply and by the time a woman grows to nearly forty feet tall then turns into thousands upon thousands of crabs in the final third, there is no question that Pirates 3 is totally and utterly bonkers. It's also the most fun you can have while sitting in a darkened room with total strangers, shovelling popcorn into your mouth.Beginning with a deceptively dark introduction where several dozen people are led to the gallows by the fascist East India Trading Company, Pirates rattles on rather quickly to Singapore, where Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) and co are set for a meeting with Chow Yun-Fat's Fu Manchu-style Pirate Lord, Sao Feng. One explosive brawl with a battalion of English marines later and the cast are off on a do-or-die mission to return Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to the world of the living, unite the Pirate Lords and fight back against the tyrannical villains who are taking over the high seas.Needless to say, not everything makes sense. Quite exactly how being eaten by a giant squid monster can send you to an otherworldly desert is never fully explained. Neither is how an entire ship can sail off the edge of the world and have everybody emerge unscathed. And with double crosses and triple crosses piling up in such a chaotic fashion that it becomes nigh on impossible to keep track of what exactly is going on, there'll be plenty of ammunition in the bag for anyone who hates this movie to fall back on. But it still doesn't detract from just how much fun this film is. It's a riotous blast through the high seas where a new set piece is always only a few minutes away and the closest a movie is ever likely to get to becoming a roller-coaster.Sure, the bit where Elizabeth makes a big pre-battle speech and prattles on about freedom is cringe-worthy and the scene where she and Will get married in the midst of an apocalyptic battle is relentlessly stupid, but there's a very simple solution: just turn your brain off. That's right, turn it off. Don't worry about cohesion, character motives, emotional development or sub-textual references and just get caught up in it. After all, nobody who goes to Disneyland to ride Thunder Mountain is likely to sit there complaining about historical inaccuracies with the plastic mining equipment.At World's End is naturally, a film that will divide audiences. There are already plenty of critics lining up to poke holes in it but there are just as likely to be those who revel in it as pure chaos gets played out on screen. Geoffrey Rush is clearly having a whale of a time, Johnny Depp is as charismatic as ever, Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a formidable villain and by the time the blistering climactic ship battle has subsided, you'll likely be wondering if you'll see a more insane film all year.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I braced myself for the 3 hour running time and got excited...First of all the introduction of Chow Yun Fat as the Singapore Pirate lord, he was great although I would of loved to of seen him do more fighting as he was very cool. Captain Jack was fantastic as always, although a smaller role I feel. (I could watch Captain Jack all day and be entertained!) Also the appearance of Jack's dad (Keith Richards) was very funny. And Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barrbosa was simply superb.Both Orlando and Kiera should have had smaller roles, it seemed like Capt. Jack was playing second to them. Their love story was the usual ""love story's don't belong in action movies"" rubbish. (I personally feel their characters should have been left behind at the end of the first film.) Orlando Bloom as 'Will' was the worst part for me. I couldn't keep up with whose side he was on, and his storyline at the end was the biggest pile of c*** I've ever seen, it really put a downer on the whole film for me. But I see why it was done to finish their two's story. So in a sense if there was more POTC Orlando & Kiera wouldn't be in it. (I hope!) Basically there was too much cramming of story trying to finish everyone's personal journeys, some characters just seemed to disappear at the end. I also wished Jack Davenport as 'Norrington' had been given the staring role he had in the second film, as I think he's fantastic. Plus the whole Pirates of the Caribbean thing, I don't think we even visited the Caribbean for more then 5 minutes! The films feet weren't that firmly planted in anything or anywhere.The first film was the best, second one was pure popcorn fun and I loved it, the third fun, entertaining, great action but just a little weak for me. I will go see it again, I really did enjoy it, just the few bits that let it down were dreadfully obvious!Go see it, Enjoy!Captain Jack rocks!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As anticipated it made millions in its first weekend at the box office, showing the modern power of franchises.The first film gave audiences excitement and a new look toward pirate life with an energetic tale about Aztec gold and myths. The second introduced more characters and gave us a wider scale of pirate life with a more fantasy approach to pirate life. And this third is all about settling the issues opened up, with a more political and personal approach to issues. As good as the first film is, the last 2 have been below par with average plots, over the top graphics and silly humour. But then again, the first film was such a high standard for the sequels to live up to.Depp is on top form again as the quirky and brilliant Jack Sparrow. The character has changed from being smart and initiative to more silly and predictable. Depp does his best to make use of some poor dialogue. Bloom and Knightley are more effect than usual in their loved up roles. Another downfall is there are too many characters. The first film worked well, focusing specifically on about 5 or 6, but this is too diverse. It's the plot that lets the film down though. There is too much going on, there is no real believability in context and all ideas appear far fetched. Interestingly, it has a political agenda encoded, perhaps to give audiences a taste of the pirate community as a whole. The ending is very tense and very engaging, and funny at occasions I may add. The rivalries between characters are portrayed well, although exaggerated at some turns but enough to keep viewers entertained. The lighting and direction are good; giving the film a dark feel to it helps it justify the mood and situations characters face. its one of those films thats either all about the stars, or all about the graphics.watch the Curse of the Black Pearl, forget the sequels","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Where Spiderman, Batman and other franchises failed in wowing critics (maybe not so much the eager escapist audiences) with a third installment of a popular series, director Gore Verbinski succeeds in showing just how to stretch the excitement and enthusiasm even further.Yes, the movie was long, but you wouldn't feel it so much with all the swashbuckling action going on, the subplots that hint at more important things to come, and the witty repartee (although some might need subtitles to decipher dialogue spoken with thick accents).It would be helpful to review the two previous Pirates movies to appreciate the characters and the story more, and so would an ample background on popular mythology (I had to keep explaining to my moviemates what happened in the past two flicks).Sure, as the plot unravels, things get more obvious but you don't mind this because the movie unfolds exactly as you would've pictured it. The sets, the costumes, the attention to detail are all impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 was definitely entertaining.The cast looks as if they were all just having fun: Johnny Depp reprises his role as the oddball Captain Jack Sparrow and shows once more what a wonderful physical comedic actor he is; Orlando Bloom as Will Turner finally looks more manly than the scrappy metrosexual he's always playing; Keira Knightley could have used better dialogue but at least she's finally put on just a little bit more weight to make her look healthier and more convincing as the strong-willed Elizabeth Swann. Watch out for the much celebrated Pinoy Reggie Lee (from Prison Break, Fast and the Furious) as Chow Yun-Fat's main man, as well as Keith Richards, who makes a satisfyingly quirky cameo as Sparrow's dad.Oh, and stay till the last of the looong credits roll for a sneak peek at a possible fourth movie, but Pirates 3 can honestly already stand on its own ending with this flick.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

""At World's End"" benefits from being the destination and not the bridge that was ""Dead Man's Chest,"" but both films have too many sub-plots and arcs connecting them. The flavor and fun of the characters and acting simply cannot keep up with how quickly the story expands the ""Pirates"" world.It takes a good half an hour to understand at all what's going on if you're not familiar with the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" Jack Sparrow (Depp) is ""dead,"" stuck in Davy Jones' Locker lest he and his beloved Black Pearl be retrieved by friends Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Rush), who makes a triumphant return back from the dead himself. The film's first main sequence takes place in Singapore with Swann and Barbossa trying to enlist the help of Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to man a crew to find Jack.But that's not even the half of it. Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has made a pact with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and crew of The Flying Dutchman to track down Sparrow and eradicate all pirates period. Will also has his own plans, to get the Pearl for himself so he can free his father, Bootstraps Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgaard) from the Dutchman.I'm skipping a few sub-plots, but you should get the gist of it by now: too much going on, too many scenes of dialogue involving one character making a deal with another only to break it later in the film. It's almost impossible to catch up, but you can just as easily focus on the caricatures and determine for yourself who's mean and who's likable. All the cast members add something unique, although the relationship between Will and Elizabeth grows weaker seeing as their characters have become so run-of-the-mill. Will's darker side intrigues a bit throughout, but bottom line is that Jack Sparrow doesn't get enough of a spotlight. He's merely one on a list of a dozen characters who get special attention. Whereas the original film had two clear sides, this film has four or five.Sure, the teasing of the greater pirate world out there excites one's imagination a bit. When the pirate brethren come together for their meeting in Shipwreck Cove, we see pirates from all over the world and all the fun the costume and make up departments got to have. The extensive lore that writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio developed begins to take more shape and you start to think that a prequel showing the early pirate years would be a cool thing to see. Then you realize they're talking too much again and they should just fight if that's what they say they're going to do.Upping the stakes in a sequel to bring the world that has been created and embraced by a global audience to such a large scale does seem exciting, but boiled down, ""At World's End"" could be called a gigantic mess as much as it could be labeled an expansive epic. There's plenty of adventure to be had and some fun, memorable scenes, but these sequels don't take you on a journey in the emotional sense like the first one did. In terms of characters, that's what keeps the quality of these films higher than average. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of those once-in-blue-moon heroes that simply never gets old. Depp continues to be terrific, even though he's subservient to the plot here. Barbossa was a welcome return because Rush handles him so perfectly. Even Nighy, behind all the make up and CGI tentacles, turns Davy Jones into a character we'd like to really know more about.It all really comes down to the mistake of creating back-to-back films with a common thread and feeling this need to flesh out all elements of the film and all characters with sub-plots and back stories and such. It's blender filmmaking. Gore Verbinski probably had a lot of fun with ""At World's End,"" but it turns out to be a super-sized macro version of the original concept rather than another skillfully crafted story set in the same universe.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The stage of the movie is 18th century in the Caribbean Sea. It has very famous character whose name is ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. Although it is not known well, he is not main character, but sub character. The main character is a blacksmith named William Turner. The main subject of the movie is William's love. However, the movie has a lot of other stories, for example, ship battle, adventure, mythology, comedy, love of family and something. This thick story catches audience's hearts. 
 Especially, the movie's back ground music is amazing. Each music has each meaning. For example, when ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow appears, the same music is always being played. The music sounds cool, and makes audience get a sense of expectation. On the other hand, each evil character has each music. What another fantastic point is that the music is made from modern music and traditional music. It makes us think that audience is in a magical space between the past and the present.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That's POTC 3 in a nutshell.The film is not bad, but it really doesn't hold a candle to the first film, or even the second. It is extremely confusing and convoluted. At some points I wondered whether the scriptwriters even had a clue what was going on. The dialogue is self-referential garbage most of the time, playing up the first film's catch phrases etc. POTC 3 indulges itself so much in how great it thinks it is, that eventually one lands up getting bored. The mere scale of the film is enormous, so the plot and one-liners fall flat in the midst of some of the most amazing CGI sequences you will ever see.See the film if only for the final 45 minute battle. It's an amazing achievement in special effects, highly entertaining and almost redeems the film for the first 2 dreary, empty hours of thinking ""What the hell is going on?"" The film is much more surreal than the first two and you often think to yourself, ""Is this really happening?"". Jack's schizophrenia is elaborated on to the point where it is way to obvious to be entertaining.Ultimately, the characters seem less complex then we originally thought, and the plot is to complex to keep up with, as very little is explained.168 minutes is long, and you do feel it, but do stay around for the last hour. It's spectacular, surreal and spellbinding.All in all, POTC 3 is a satisfying film which eventually does messily manage to draw conclusions, even though you really don't know how the film arrived at them. It's not brilliant, it's no ""Return Of the King"" finisher (although no one thought it would), but at least it's satisfying enough, if a little forgettable. Just thank goodness they didn't mess it up as badly as ""The Matrix Revolutions"".6/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But, like all things of unnecessary grandeur, the effects are compensating for something... the absence of which detracted significantly from the movie experience. A purpose. True, entertainment can be considered a purpose, and it is here for the finding, but entertainment need not be as painfully drawn out as this.So, if not entertainment, what is the point? Certainly not to tell a unique or provocative story. It's absolutely baffling how a film with a stomach-churning number of plot twists can still be predictable.The final result is that neither casting, (the inclusion of Keith Richards while unnecessary, was inspired) expensive effects, nor a plot as twisted as the tentacles of the Kraken can rescue these Pirates from utter vacuousness.Yet it doesn't seem to matter, Pirates 3 is an inevitable blockbuster. This Pirates owes its predestined box office success to 2003's ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", an exceptional film, easily eclipsing its counterparts in quality, entertainment, and does so in less time. Perhaps guaranteed success will assuage the guilt on the part of the filmmakers for inflicting this film upon audiences worldwide. Or perhaps audiences are simply foolish to expect anything of substance from pirates such as these.","32 out of 64 found this helpful.

Sometimes they're minor quibbles that can be forgiven. But sometimes they're too glaringly obvious to ignore.When it comes to the final hour, the movie delivers. Unfortunately, that doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this bloated and uneven movie. It's far too long and needlessly complex!! The majority of the movie is dull, slow-moving and uninvolving. The main quality of the first movie was that it was fun. There is little fun to be had in the first 90 minutes of this movie. Too many deals and too much double crossing. It's like the film makers forgot what made the first one so much fun. The Kieth Richards cameo is lame. Tia Dalma/ Calypso was absolutely pointless. All she did was create an abyss and make it rain for a while. So much time was devoted to this character and that was it. As was Norington. He was pointless in the second movie, and now they try and give him some redemption!! Nah just pointless. Is Mr.Gibbs sole purpose in these movies just to explain things to the viewers?? The final hour is almost enough to make you forget how much of a labor it is to sit through the first two-thirds - almost!! It doesn't blend the humor as well, the jokes are lazy and Captain Jack Sparrow finds his screen time limited. A late entrance and too many side-stories take the focus from the best thing in the movies. He is not in the opening half hour. When Mackenzie Crook says ""There must be a good reason for our suffering"" I feel like he is speaking for the audience. Sadly when he turns up, it is Johnny Depp acting like he was still in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas.the next ten minutes is a waste of time as 20 Jack Sparrows run amock. The irony is not lost when Jack says ""We have lost time. Valuable time. Time we cannot get back!!"" or maybe it was lost on the filmmakers after all. Kiera Knightley continues to evolve from damsel in distress to full-fledged pirate. Sadly, her chemistry with Depp is absent this time around. Orlando Bloom has a bit more to do this time around. Finally, Will Turner has becomes something a little more interesting than a one-dimensional hero. Sadly their wedding is pathetic and The less said about Elizabeth's freedom speach the better!! Considering it is a Disney movie there is a lot of adult humour about Elizabeth. She is asked to remove her clothes, she has a weapon in a seriously private place (Good luck in the bedroom Will Turner) there is a joke about one of the pirates looking up her shirt, that she is wearing as a dress!! Sao Fenn forcibly kisses her. Seriously where the hell did she have that last gun hidden?? POTC: At Worlds End grossed $309 million at the domestic box office, to end 2007 as the 4th highest grossing movie of the year.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The month of May at the movies this year does nothing to answer that question but it does take the entire superstition that much further, by making it so when things, good or bad, come in three's, nothing else comes at all. The big commercial theatre where I saw PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END was playing only three films on its dozen or so screens. This summer's other high profile third chapters, SPIDERMAN 3 and SHREK 3, joined it. With these three films monopolizing every screen, how can any other film come to matter or register a dent in the consciousness of filmgoers? One could conclude that the theatre is just giving the people what they want but how accurate is that? By the time the third part in a series rolls around, people seem to be tired of the whole thing and just ready for it to be over. Given how much bile has been spilled over all three of the aforementioned films, it appears as though it has become cool to turn on those that have provided so much entertainment in the past. Luckily for Hollywood, the trend has done nothing to stop the money from rolling in.I didn't care for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST. I found it to have had its comic moments but to be overdrawn and tedious at times, lacking the spontaneity and energy of the first film, THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. As a result, I didn't have much of an interest in AT WORLD'S END. The PIRATES series falls into a category of trilogy where the second and third installments were not specifically intended when the first was conceived. What was once a complete story must be expanded into a longer series. Some story lines are given back-story while others are stretched so thin that it becomes distracting to actually grasp how everything is connected. In AT WORLD'S END, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) needs to be brought back from the dead, known here as Davy Jones' Locker. With a variety of selfish motivations, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) make the dangerous journey along with their regular crew. Once back, Jack and company must defeat Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and his fleet, who intend to rid the world of all pirates. Along the way, a number of other sub plots find some screen time but find themselves ultimately left ashore. Having already seen the first two films, I found it somewhat difficult to piece the muddled puzzle together at times so I can only imagine how lost one would be coming into this film without any previous pirate experience. Overly complex stories are almost inevitable though when you expand a story that was never intended to be expanded to begin with.The PIRATES series has relied increasingly on visual effects as the series has progressed. While the transitions between pirates and the undead in the first film were sleek and engrossing, the film itself struck with viewers thanks primarily to the wild and unpredictable performance of Johnny Depp. Depp has been just as consistent at being inconsistent in the two latter films but there's only so much further the character can go. Subsequently, the visual aspects needed to step it up to deliver that which a summer blockbuster is expected to deliver. Back for a third time is director Gore Verbinski, taking a decidedly darker, more surreal approach to the pirates he made famous. When a film opens with mass hangings and the announcement that a number of citizens are being robbed of their fundamental rights, you know that fluff is not about to follow. Only here, it does. What ensues is a ride that bounces back and forth between varying visual motifs that leave the viewer lost at sea. That being said, I don't think I will forget that close-up of Depp's nose traveling along the screen, sniffing for a peanut, for a very long time.It's hard to say goodbye to anything that has been with you for so long. It's even harder for studios to imagine never seeing the size of treasure that Jack and crew haul in with each of their adventures. Hence, even as this trilogy comes to its intended close, further pirate plots are being cooked up by studio heads that will likely plow ahead with them with or without their regular cast. That doesn't stop AT WORLD'S END from ensuring that every possible audience satisfaction is met before the credits role. Characters say their goodbye's almost as if they were the actors themselves saddened by the end of their own experiences together. The film suddenly seems to be fully aware of its own significance in the pop culture fabric. The problem here is the film is giving itself more credit than it likely deserves as it seems these days that more people flock to trilogy closers out of obligation and not anticipation.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The pirates, led by Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), will have to travel to the other side of the world in order to seek an unlikely alliance to stop the ambitious Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who wants to use Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) to dominate the seas. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.The release of this film was expected given the previous film need a conclusion. However, the film didn't bring anything surprising, nor could surprise a lot. The differentiating factor of the previous film was, clearly, how the central characters have changed throughout the film and the way the plot takes advantage of that to become more complex and interesting. In this case we have the closing of a cycle, not its development. Perhaps the biggest surprises are the return of Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush), this time in the ""good side"", the unexpected importance that Naomie Harris's character will have at the end and the conclusion, a bit disappointing, of the love story between Will and Elizabeth. The moments of humor remained the main dish of Jhonnie Depp, but the film also has a certain dramatic tension than the previous two had not. At least not so as present and ravishing.This film was designed to end the most popular pirate's saga that cinema has ever seen, but the demands of the film industry, eager to make more money with the public's wishes, will give rise to a fourth film. Dramatic, tense, interesting but far from being surprising or inventive, this movie deserves congratulations by the way that, supposedly, would have ended to that story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Certainly better than Spider-Man 3. But that ain't saying much, now is it? Basically, At World's End carries over Dead Man's Chest's major problem of too much plot, but loses its virtue of breathless pacing. At World's End is far too slow at times, and it can be easy to get bored between setpieces. Which aren't, I should say, as good as those in either of the first two films. But, all in all, it isn't bad and it's still a lot of fun. Johnny Depp is as great as ever, and he, Geoffrey Rush, Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy's CGI face take part in an enormous ham-off. Personally, I think Rush won. As for the setpieces, the surreal, Being John Malkovich-inspired sequence in Davy Jones's locker is a lot of fun, and the climactic battle aboard the Flying Dutchman, though definitely a little too busy, is cracking.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Pirates 2 was the best of the trilogy, where Pirates 1 was a very good introduction to the series, Pirates 2 stole the show. Johnny Depp truly carried the first one as Captain Jack Sparrow. I remember saying to someone I just love this goofy pirate. Johnny is just great as Captain Jack Sparrow. Will played a great sidekick or should I say apprentice to Jack.Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl was the best written and acted. Pirates 3 was just too much. Too much as too many story lines, too much action where the previous storyline could have been explained. Too many villains to the point I could not follow the story. Jack's part was great, but Elizabeth was blown up so much she almost outweighed Jack. I loved the explanation of Tia Dalma, but it was just a bit too much. I can't wait for Pirates 3 to go to DVD so I can make sense of many of the parts and players. I did not like the ending with Will dying, but since he is immortal now, he can make an appearance in other installations of the movie.Many people seem to think Jack and Elizabeth blended well together, but I don't. Jack was not the type Elizabeth would be satisfied with. She would always try to change him which is a big no-no. She was better with Will, he was a pirate through and through, but honest enough to satisfy her varying taste in men. Secondly, even though Jack has this youthful appearance, he seemed a bit too old for Elizabeth. I have never liked the way Hollywood put together romances with men to old for the female. It would never work in real life, not unless the man was extremely rich and the female is a good pretender. Jack is better off with the hookers, I just love the character, but he is a bit sleezy. One big hurrah for Disney, Jack's character is goofy, but extremely intelligent, handsome and witty. Perfect blend.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After the mild disappointment I was left with after Dead Man's Chest, I was willing to accept that this trilogy was going the way of the Matrix films, an incredible first film, and then two rather bland sequels. And I was partially right.Johnny Depp seems to be back at the forefront of this film, and the camera is focused on his antics throughout. Although, in my opinion, they're starting to become a bit...repetitive? Although he shows a few scenes of compassion, he's still the same bumbling pirate we've watched for 6 hours prior, and the current 3 hours start to leave him a bit stale.Many of the action sequences feel very sloppy. You can never really tell what's going on. If a group of pirates board a ship, the camera is either so far pulled out, or so zoomed in that you can't really tell who's whooping up on who. You just kind of assume. The fight sequences in general are just sort of sloppy.The story lines are all tied up in a nice little bow by the end, and for that I commend Gore Verbinski. Every character's story follows it's course, and we get to see where everyone winds up, and why. My only problem with the plot would have to go to a scene involving a lot of crabs and an intense storm, but these scenes take place near the end of the movie, when the viewer is too busy trying to piece together the action to be distracted.Oh, and Johnny Depp's trippy hallucinations are pretty awesome.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their characters, well put into picture and with plenty of surprises, are determined to achieve their goals, no matter the methods. Thus, it manages to keep the viewer interested, in part thanks to its story. Speaking of which, it isn't anything brilliant or something, but it's good enough to keep it all together. In terms of action, you get some intense fighting scenes from time to time, culminating with an epic naval fight, but it also leaves quite a lot of time with more to be desired. They've made a lengthy movie, with more than two and a half hours of screen time, fact which doesn't do it a great favor. It seems over prolonged, having plenty of scenes which present something irrelevant, which could have easily been skipped, just to try and add some more amusement, but often failing in this aspect. It terms of laughter, this third installment leaves plenty of room for improvement. It does manage to make you laugh from time to time but nothing spectacular. Just some random irony or gags which seem quite forced. In terms of visuals though, everything it top notch. The CGI is very good, managing to amaze with every chance it gets, and it really has time to do it. As an overall impression, I saw an entertaining movie, which could have been a lot better if it had a shorter length, a better story or a better comical side. As a plus, you get intense fighting scenes, great CGI and an epic final battle.

That first half is pretty rough; scenes tend to drag a fair amount. Too many characters and MacGuffins are introduced that should really have been hinted at in Dead Man's Chest (they were filmed together, no excuse). But the climax is truly epic. Silly and over-the-top of course, but when were these movies ever not?It's easy to see how this was the most expensive film ever at the time, to be topped 4 years later by On Stranger Tides (proof that more money doesn't always ensure greater happiness).I do feel like the plot centers a bit too much on Jack Sparrow here. He works as part of the stories, not the whole. He's still mostly a delight at least, and having Keith Richards play his father was brilliant.I did actually enjoy the interactions between Davy Jones and the British Empire a lot more as an adult. As a kid I think I regarded it more as parts-to-daydream-during but now the clash of order and chaos is quite enticing. I like that the film only shows parts of events sometimes as well, it makes the world feel more alive.And this has my favourite soundtrack in the whole trilogy. 'Up is Down' in particular is excellent, Hans Zimmer did a wonderful job here.So it's the worst film of the three, but the final half is a very satisfying end to the story. I was anxious before I saw this, I didn't actually remember half of the film from when I was a child. It holds up, I wish Disney still put out stuff as gritty and grounded (poor choice of word) as this trilogy was.Now I sail onto On Stranger Tides, of which I saw once in theatres in 2011 and decided it wasn't worth rewatching. Of course, I've remembered the decision not to rewatch, but not any of the film itself. The completionist part of my brain is clashing with 15-year-old me, and I suspect the latter might be more prudent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first movie was spectacular, and the second one was just alright. Not too bad, but not too good. On a one to ten scale, I gave the first movie a 9 and the second an 8.I just came back from seeing this, and must say I am disappointed. Pirates has a SOLID plot line. Very interesting, and fun to follow. But the movie was WAYY too long. There were scenes that were unnecessary, that could have been cut to fix this, but no, they kept them. Honestly, I think potc 3 was done lazily. Plus, they made a fool of jack. The jokes were dumb, not funny at all. Pure laziness. They missed adding in the pirate factor we love, and rushed things since they knew it'd be killer at the box office.I'm very disappointed. This had great potential...and it flopped. The beginning was solid, and the end was spectacular, but some parts in the middle made me want to fall asleep.6/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

And is a good 3rd movie when it comes to ending the trilogy, well that is until the 4th movie comes out in 2011. But overall when it comes down to it all, this trilogy is a amazing adventure that is worth seeing all the way through. This installment however seems pretty forced in some areas and although Capt. Jack was fresh and unique before, his character comes off slightly old in this. The plot comes off way more convoluted in this and yet not very memorable or stands out like the first movie in this franchise, while the supernatural aspects goes over the top. For a family movie, the convoluted plot gave the whole thing a negative direction instead of a positive one. It's good they tried to put more emphasis on the plot this time around, but the direction of it all wasn't crafted very well. However on a positive side the special effects are top notch in this and the visuals are really well done. The action sequences such as when the pirates are battling on land and on ships is amazing at times. Even if the creators of this flick tried a bit too hard to make it really epic since they though this is going to be the final installment and wanted to go for the grand finale direction. It's better than the 2nd film in the franchise and overall with all three movies together it was a spectacular adventure.7.6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Why are people calling Norrington EVIL?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1686154/?ref_=tt_urv","caseyplumber","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5134684/?ref_=tt_urv","3 July 2007","What is this? There is a difference between good and evil? Norrington is NOT evil, his is a noble Commodore of the fleet of Her Majesties Navy, protecting the waters of the Caribbean, making the seas safe for trade. He has the misfortune of falling for a flibbertigibbet girl with no life experience, who is looking for some adventure in her dull life as a pampered Governors daughter, with nothing to do but daydream. She is probably the only women on the island for the poor benighted Norrington to fall in love with. She ruins his life, and then proceeds to ruin it more and causes his ultimate demise. What is that rule about not ""crying out"" and taking a man's attention away from a villain when you are obviously flailing on the tow lines of a ship.... BACKWARDS????? Having been disgraced and losing his job as Commodore who could blame Norrington wanting to get back something of his former glory as the scourge of the seas against...oops...the BAD GUYS- PIRATES? The love of his life has turned pirate. Jack has slipped through his hands. Will Turner has been a thorn in his side. For a man with his training The Trading Company is making it possible for him to go out and clear the seas and get a bit of revenge at the same time. So far I can see no EVIL goings on from our Norrington, although quite a bit from Cutler. Then to add insult to injury, the writers have Norrington say"" that he is not absolved from his OTHER sins"". Which sins would they be referring, I saw not sin one in the entire trilogy. All I saw was an admirable officer of Her Majesties Navy performing the duties of his office with honor and dignity. What I am saying is there is a huge problem in the world today and the Trilogy if they see a man like Norrington as EVIL and fail to utilize the talents of Jack Davenport to better advantage with more screen time, in favor of miles and hours of superfluous pirate dreg that is a meandering and pointless as one could possibly expect. Why would anyone want to root for the guys who kill, rape, murder, and pillage, and who would slit your throat before looking you in the eye in reality? Not to mention the unwashed and smelly conditions of their apparel, not to mention, and heavens,...their teeth!!!. I doubt I would have been able to get within ten yards downwind from any of them. Where as the brave Norrington cut quite the dashing figure and no doubt had a nice scented hanky to protect him from the vagrant ethers of a scoundrelly mishap. To make matters worse most of the scoundrels in question have morphed into the vilest of skeletons, and slimiest of sea creatures. A clear and certain inference for me that these are NOT the GOOD GUYS. I am worried for the civilized nations of the earth if this is what is promulgated a GOOD. I clearly love watching pirates, but in reality they needed, as Norrington so eloquently pointed out in the first movie, "" a short drop and a sudden stop"". Give me a man like Norrington...you can keep the pirates, even the adorable Depp, who would have dropped our butts on a moments notice in preference to the call of the Pearl. After all he did not get all those whacks from all those surly misses for NADA. Thank God for those who made the seas safe from such men. Norrington RULES!! I had a great time with Pirates at World's End, but I am a continuity nut from my theatrical training and stuff like this grates my bones. And there were SO many continuity problems and story line issues. BUT if you are not a critic and you LOVE PIRATEmovies as I do...have fun!!!!! And remember who the bad guys really are.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is back in full form, Orlando Bloom is still obnoxious and lame but we forgive it, and Keira Knightly is still one sexy babe. the first act of the film is confusing and a little existential for a Disney movie, but serves for some funny moments and manages without much stumbling to pick up where the last film left off, the second act is the film's biggest problem, it's confusing, it's overconvoluted, and it's flabby. this movie's long running time wouldn't be a problem if they hadnt insisted on flushing out every backstory of every character and making sure that everybody was fit to doublecross everybody. and so we find the third act, this is what we all came to see, some bigtime swashbuckling. the naval battles are incredible, the sword fighting is intense, and there's no lack of Johnny Depp's quips or Geoffry Rush's insane character acting.bottom line, if you liked the first two, you're in for a treat, this has been one of the most consistent franchises since Star Wars, and it's mass appeal but refusal to placate to any specific demographic has garnered it respect as well as success. i love these movies, and can only hope future generations will as well. no film is without flaw, but in an era of Metachlorians and Rambo 4's, we take what we can get. i couldn't recommend this film more, not because it's the greatest film you'll see this year, because it isn't, but because so rarely do i have such a wonderful time at the movies, that i couldn't have at home.go see it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The good news is that Jack is back and the Black Pearl has him. There are a lot of funny bits, the action sequences are every bit as good as you have heard, and the pacing is just right. The nearly three hours zips right along. And the story resolution among Elizabeth, William, and his father works fine. Yes, do stay for the final scene after the credits. (And for those who hate Bloom & Knightly, go away. The actors are doing exactly what these movies ask of them and doing it very well.) And there truly is so much here to commend in this film, particularly as we follow our heroes to the ""haunted shores"" of the afterlife. Time after time you will be asking yourself: how did they do that? As a mythology, it never flags and the three movies taken together are a remarkable cinematic accomplishment which took increasing risks that paid off.So why am I sour on the screen play? Here's the problem. As is well known, when they started shooting the final film (Note: they only completed 40% of AWE when they were filming DMC), the screen play for the third was not yet finished. This is a bad thing. See this movie and you will understand why this is a bad thing. What happens when you do that is story holes open up. And what do I mean by holes? It means a given character acts as the screenplay demands he act -- forget about what the character has said/done prior or what we know about him or have seen him do. He/she has become a puppet to the screenplay. I could easily list three major instances where this happened and I am sure any fan going through the movie scene by scene could come up with many more.It did not have to be. The two screen writers are first rate as is the director. But once marketing and management got a hold of the thing, it became schedule-driven and I guess it couldn't be stopped. Certainly, Disney did not return my calls. To be fair, probably most viewers will not notice or will not care. But greatness beckoned, and they settled for okay and full-speed ahead for the effects.Oh well, I'll see it again anyway.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's also got dozens of plots going on at once, and extremely surprising twists to keep you guessing.It does get a little confusing, and some may think the ending somewhat tragic. But in the end, you just have a really good feeling. Everything seems to have worked out exactly as it should, though some losses need to balance it.To get to the more technical side of it, the special effects were once again amazing (the whirlpool battle, which was absolutely HUGE) and the action scenes really interesting.And there's a couple of other things I'm super happy about but can't tell you.This movie ROCKS.

The first two films in this series are truly excellent, and that is one of the various reasons I was so disappointed. I expected to be wowed and pulled into a fast-paced world of action as I was when viewing ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest,"" but I was bored.Before ever seeing AWE, I had heard there was too little action; not enough sword fights, exciting battles with strange creatures of the sea, etc. I had always thought of myself as one who disliked action in movies, and I just thought of it as filler. However, this series absolutely needs action and those famous sword battles on top of moving objects (like the giant wheel shown in the second film) that we have all come to know and love. Without that needed action, the film unfortunately became dull. And the numerous sappy plots of the film, such as Will's (Orlando Bloom) ordeal with his father as well as Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) situation with her father, were just not enough to keep the viewer entertained.And that brings me to my next point---all this boring talk about fathers. Nearly every other word out of both Bloom and Knightley's mouth was ""father."" To speak the truth, the movie was mainly about the character of Will Turner talking about his father, and Elizabeth Swann crying over hers.I have never been a Johnny Depp fan until seeing the first film in this series. Depp brings character, humor, and entertainment to the screen. A lot of critics are saying this and I must agree---there was not enough Johnny Depp. He made the first two movies such wonderful films, and with the third missing his presence in too much of the picture, it failed. Depp has a tendency in really any movie to spice things up. I looked forward to seeing Depp because I've noticed he makes otherwise boring scenes just fantastically entertaining. The movie missed a lot due to his lack of appearances.There were also a number of confusing scenes that left many questions unanswered. Instead of focusing on the film, I was stuck trying to determine whether ""it was real or just a dream."" These weirdly baffling scenes distract the viewer from any real significance they actually had. For instance, the first scene involving Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was incredibly strange, although I think the writers were going for more of a ""creative"" feel. It is wildly weird, and never explained. Perhaps if there was some sort of explanation, the importance of the scene would have been shown.Even after all the flaws AWE had, I did enjoy some aspects of the film. As always, composer Hans Zimmer brings a wonderful set of songs into the movie, including the easily recognizable ""He's a Pirate,"" the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme song. The appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father was quite interesting also. Richards had supposedly been asked to appear in the series for quite some time, and I am glad he took a part, in my opinion, the perfect part. I would have liked to see more of Richards though, because his part was rather small. The special effects were, as usual, great. With the potential for much more action that was never capitalized on, there could have been plenty more special effects though. But, what was included in the film was substantial.In conclusion, I guess I would say ""At World's End"" could have been much better, but we have to deal with what we are given.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's the smell of the greatest trilogy of my lifetime (I was born in 1990, so the original Star Wars and Back to the Future don't count) coming to a phenomenal end. Sad? No, actually. This trilogy was absolutely breathtaking in every way, shape, and form, and it's so comforting to know that Verbinski has tied it all up for good.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End literally picks up right where the cliffhanging Dead Man's Chest left off. Captain Barbossa (Rush) is alive again, Jack (Depp) is in Davey Jones's Locker, and Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightly) are trying to rescue him. All the while, the ruthless Lord Beckett (Hollander) has taken control over the Lord of the Sea Davey Jones (Nighy) and his almighty ship, the Flying Dutchman.This movie takes you all over the globe and beyond, opening up with a fantastically violent brawl in Singapore, where our crew meets up with the Pirate Lord Sao Feng (Yun-Fat). From there, Barbossa leads them to the ultra-trippy Locker, which will have you scratching your head, seeing quadruples, and wondering what the heck the writers were smoking when they wrote this. Still, really fun.Without giving away the plot, I will say that this movie goes back to the roots of the original in the sense of more fights, less land-locked scenes, and more cannon fire. Johnny Depp, obviously, delivers in a hilarious way, as usual. Kiera Knightly has a more emotional role this time around, something she pulls of beautifully. And Orlando Bloom has hit the target with Will Turner. Let's face it: nobody has ever liked Will. He's such a pansy compared to Jack or Norrington (in DMC anyway). But in AWE, Orlando delivers like he's never delivered before. I was actually amazed by his performance. I would say he was the best character development in this movie, if not for Geoffrey Rush. I don't think there is a fan out there that hasn't missed Barbossa. Seriously, that guy kicks so much, the Spartans would think twice before fighting him. He is a fantastic returning character that everyone will surely love to watch.Chow Yun-Fat has, actually, a somewhat smaller part in this movie, which is funny because he's been publicized to death in all the commercials and posters. Naomie Harris does a good job as the creepy voodoo chick, Tia Dalma, and Bill Nighy hits it out of the ballpark as the CGI Davey Jones. Angus Barnett and Giles New make their triumphant returns as Mullroy and Murtogg from the first movie, two characters that made me feel at home again. But the real applause roared when a certain rock star appears on the screen as Jack Sparrow's much-anticipated father The movie has no slow points, yet it is extremely long (nearly three hours!) but a true Pirate fan wouldn't be able to tell. There is one scene concerning Tia Dalma that really was justbadI'll let you watch the movie and, no doubt, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The end iswow. Unexpected, shocking, and amazing. I won't give anything away about the shocking ending, but the very end (like, right before the credits) goes back to the original humor that made everyone fall in love with the first movie.But, honestly, this month has just been conquered.

If you're looking to relax and not think about anything while looking at pretty moving pictures for three hours, I strongly advise against Pirates.But if you're looking for an engaging story that sends repeated chills down your spine, colorful characters who never let up, twists and betrayals at every corner, and all-out piraty fun, I recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.Ignore the complaints (they're mostly uneducated).Just...go see it.It's really good.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

About the plot, I think this was a good continuation to Dead Man's Chest, Davy Jones come back, and overall it was ok. Sometimes I feel it was too exaggerated, like the fighting scenes, the big monsters and the oversized people, I think that was too exaggerated, the movie was a bit too long, too, it could be 30 minutes shorter, the last act was really overloaded. But without that, I think this movie was very entertaining and fun, great expierence. The movie showed a different turn, were they introduced many new characters, what gave a nice spiece to the film, something new and different. Jack Sparrow was funny, but he was less funnier then from the other movies, what I think was bad. So overall, it was entertainig, could be better, Jack Sparrow could be better, so this was an ok movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It would have been so much better to create a more straightforward, fun pirate adventure that was more in the spirit of the first film; this version went so far astray that it has no redeeming qualities.With luck, Pirates #3 will be remembered as the ultimate film overindulgence -- a moment in film history when the studios finally realized that a $300 million, three-hour mess is not the direction that films should be reading.

Johnny Depp again succeeds to play the weirdly funny but brave captain Jack Sparrow, which is very entertaining. The rest of the actors/actresses, including Chow-Yun Fat, Keira Knightley Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush also played terrific roles. The plot of the film was qutie straight forward, except for some parts when it was strangely confusing. Apart from good acting, the film also has great cinematography, editing, sound effects and spectacular special effects, and of course the Disney effects which makes it a great action movie. The action and battles involved are even more intense and exciting than the two previous films, which suits the series finale. Although the two previous Caribbean movies are really good, i would say that this is the best out of the three.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film perfectly wraps up loose ends and hanging story lines. Although, the film is abundant with many confusing moments (alot), it gives the viewer breaks, unlike the second installment, to sort things out in your mind. Jack Sparrows are all over, with great scenes including very trippy ones with multiple Jacks. The cast is just great as well. The length? Maybe long but it is well worth it- it leads up to a truly EPIC final battle and an amazing ending. (Stay tuned after the credits!) And the mass of story lines is just what makes you want to see it again and again, which I truly recommend.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Any stone cold Pirates fan will most likely watch this more than once however the ones that don't watch it more then once might feel a bit skeptical about it; I know I was. I'm a Pirates fan so I watched it twice (not at the theaters) and I have to admit that on the second time I appreciated it a great deal more. It was a very satisfying end to the Pirates trilogy.When this movie starts out it has the usual touch to it that Pirates 1 and 2 had to them in that it is going to be awesome. However, as the movie drags on it begins to lose it's focus and just becomes a bit absurd with all the deceiving and different story lines going on at once - confusing. It get's sloppy with how many different things are going on all at once and has to make call-backs to the first two as comical reliefs to save itself. It worked a little bit. It worked just enough to get to the end of the film which seemed to be what most of the effort of the movie went to.I cannot even begin to explain the uniqueness and fantastic ending (including final battle) that it brings. Some say it ""left room for a fourth"" however I do not think that it did, it left us with a happy and touching feeling of hope that seemed to have been lost at world's end (no pun intended). The loss of hope seemed to also be a major theme throughout the film and it was restored at the end. At the end of this on my second viewing it literally brought a smile to my face; not because it was funny, but because it was so relieving (not in a bad way either).If anybody is a Pirates fan then this is surely NOT to be missed. However, I think to truly appreciate this movie it has to be watched more then once. Yeah, it get's a tad bit messy in the middle and confusing on the first view, but then the ending is very rewarding and very entertaining. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat and people who are suckers for happy ending may or may not be disappointed (I guess it is the way you look at it) And, that is also what makes this movie excellent - your options are open. Pirates 3 is not to be missed, the final and very rewarding ending to, probably, the greatest film trilogy of all time. So watch it, enjoy it, and, stick through it to the ending, you will not be disappointed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The audience participation definitely adds to the incredible movie. Though it is just under 3 hours, Pirates 3 is one of the most well done films I've seen recently, mixing almost every movie element into one amazing action adventure film.Picking up right where Dead Man's Chest left off, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is dead. Now our heroes (Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush) must stand together to retrieve him from Davy Jones' locker. Meanwhile, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is a reluctant servant to the will of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), whose vision is now clearer than ever. Every pirate must die. Each character also has personal motives in mind as well.As always the acting behind Pirates is nothing short of spectacular, the most spectacular being Johnny Depp as usual. This performance is a little different than the one's we're used to, as Jack is even crazier than before, having been lost to Davy Jones' locker at world's end. Depp is as crafty, charming, and absolutely hilarious as ever before as the most famous character of the 2000's. One thing that really stands out for AWE that makes it better than the other 2 is that the character development is top notch. We really see a lot more insight into the minds of our characters, especially Will Turner, Davy Jones, and Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris). The other actors are just as great as Depp. Orlando Bloom gives probably the best performance of his career as Will Turner changes greatly throughout the film. I really enjoyed Bloom for the first time, and I've seen about 9 or 10 of his movies. Keira Knightley lives up to her Oscar nominated expectations, giving her best performance of the series. I know it's hard to believe, but Knightley is the hero of the movie, not Depp or Bloom. She is believable and inspiring towards the end of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander excel as the central villains, Jones and Beckett. Chow Yun Fat plays a somewhat secondary villain, but it's hard to categorize. His Sao Feng is a bad man, there's no doubt about that, but at times he's a good guy, and at times he's a bad guy. Naomie Harris and Jack Davenport also deliver, and Harris really shines this time around after limited screen time in DMC. Rolling Stone Keith Richards gives a nice turn as Captain Teague in a brief 2 scenes.Enough about acting. Now to the technical aspects of AWE. The special effects will amaze you, especially the climactic battle sequence that occurs within a whirlpool (maelstrom, if you want to be scientific). How Gore Verbinski and his team created this movie is unthinkable. Every scene looks like it was worked on for weeks just to get the right mood and scenery going. The epic finale is absolutely breathtaking, not only in the action, but in the events that occur in it. The film is also well written by Disney vets Elliot and Rossio, doing exactly what Spider-Man 3 failed to do: effectively weave the main plot and sub plots together. The film is complex, the most complex of the 3. It has its twists and turns that will surprise most, making for an entertaining experience. There are also plenty of laughs, provided mostly by Depp and the crew. Everyone's favorite monkey is back as well, and he (well, it's a she playing Jack) is adorable as well. The film is an absolutely incredible adventure that should be seen in the theater. I recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to everyone.10/10 --spy","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is, as always, entertaining in this character, but playing off himself, literally, is something to watch! The movie had great fight scenes and a strange wandering plot line that ends with the open ended possibility that there will be a fourth installment!! Too many loose ends left dangling to just let this movie franchise keep us wondering!!!

The adventures, the creativity, and the battle scenes couldn't be more exciting and inspiring. The extra length of the film isn't noticeable because you won't want it to end. Wait until the very end of the credits for an excellent bonus! My heaven would be like this movie. There are a lot of twists and deal making which may make it hard to follow for those of under the age of 10. A new side of Jack Sparrow is seen during a deep scene with Barbossa and it is very sexy. All the new characters are worth meeting and really makes the plot world wide. I definitely enjoyed the Singapore pirates and their style.The filmography is so beautiful and creative. It's very moving and a definite masterpiece! Pirate for Life","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film picks up pretty much where 'Dead Man's Chest' finished off. Jack is lost to Davy Jones's locker. Will still assumes that Elizabeth wants to rescue Jack because she loves him. Will is still determined to save his father, Boot-strap Bill, from spending an eternity as apart of Jones's ship. Cutler Beckett has plans to blow all pirates out of the seven seas for good. Barbosa wants the black pearl back. And this is where 'At World's End' begins... well actually the journey starts off in Singapore, with the crew meeting pirate King Sao Feng (Yun-Fat Chow) and asking for his help in defeating Beckett....The beginning of the film is somewhat Sparrow-free, and therefore lacking. In fact, the first 2 hours are pretty lacking as there is a concentration on uninteresting subplots that have nothing to do with Jack Sparrow and everything to do with making the first half of the film a wee bit tedious. The first 2 hours covers a very complex sub-plot about Davy Jones and Calypso (Naomie Harris) that is very predictable and very badly wrapped up in the end, making the whole thing a bit pointless really. Then there is the other plot about the brethren of pirate lords who have to join forces to defeat Beckett, unleash Calypso..... and yeah, I really cant explain what those 2 sub-plots were about because I have positively no idea. You really get the sense that the writers were extremely rushed in churning out this final pirates (written, I assume, simultaneously with 'Dead Man's Chest') and as a result the first 2 hours are a convoluted mix-match of stories thrown together to thicken out the film. Let's be honest, the Pirates films are so beloved because of one man, Johnny Depp. This is no secret. When Jack Sparrow isn't on the screen you are wondering ""when is Jack coming back? Is he coming back soon?"". So it's a fair sure thing that any Pirates plot that isn't centered around Sparrow is not going to hold audience interest for too long. Essentially it is the last hour of the film that is really important. Forget the rest, sneak in after 2 hours and you are good to go. This is when all the action takes place, and it is brilliant. Verbinski is in his directorial element in the ship scenes; and the third installment does not leave the audience wanting in that department. A Western style show-down on the seven seas between Davy Jones's the flying Dutchman, Sparrow's Black Pearl and Beckett's Endeavor is brilliant, large-scale mastery. Boom goes the dynamite.The other big story that is wrapped up is that of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. Personally, a little too cheesy for my liking, made even cornier by the soap-opera acting style of Orlando Bloom, the quintessential buccaneer. Be sure to stay for the end credits, as there is a bonus scene tucked in for the Elizabeth/Will shippers. The Pirates movies have become to this Generation Y of movie-goers what 'The Godfather' trilogy was to Generation X  something we hold very close to our hearts. Repeating the lines again and again, 'Savvy' has pretty much become the 'I made him an offer he couldn't refuse' quint-essential quote. Johnny Depp's iconic Jack Sparrow sway is Marlon Brando's cotton-mouthed jowls  and everyone has an impersonation up their sleeve. So of course, the finale to the Pirates phenomenon is going to be a big deal. Unfortunately, the final installment doesn't really deliver the goods. Jack Sparrow has more slap-stick comedy moments than brilliant one-liners and Johnny Depp isn't really able to work any physical comedy routines, which is a shame, his human skewer in 'Dead Man's Chest' was brilliant. Clearly the third film is skating on thin ice, ideas are being stretched and the third script is no match for 'Curse of the Black Pearl's' concise story-telling, witty brilliance; 'At World's End' is far more convoluted and sloppy. Regardless, the Pirates films have become a real phenomenon; they will be on many people's 'favorite films of all time' list and there is no excuse if you have seen and enjoyed the first two to not see how it all ends in 'At World's End'. You just have to, savvy?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Mind-blowing for the unbelievably executed fight sequences and special effects along with an ensemble of brilliant actors or mind-blowing for some who couldn't follow the story line and were left wondering what was happening. Either ways, one word that describes the movie is Mind-blowing. Johnny Depp takes Sparrow a step-up, there is no point in describing his genius rather than just acknowledging that the guy IS pure genius. Bill Nighy and Geoffrey Rush are seasoned actors (more genius added to the film). We see the human side of Davy Jones, which makes you root for the character, wanting him to somehow turn good. Kiera Knightley shows a different side to her character and holds her own, Orlando Bloom's character is slightly more developed in comparison to the other two movies where his only aim was to fight blindly for his bonny lass. All the other characters, Norrington, Gibbs, Pintel-Ragetti,Beckett, Governor Swann, Mercer, Jack the monkey, Mr. Cotton and his parrot, Tia Dalma, Marty, Bootstrap and others play their part to perfection (I hope I haven't missed any). Those of you who are Rolling Stones fans or are familiar with Keith Richards would probably get excited by his cameo, and I have to admit, he is not bad at all. And now for the surprise package of the film, Captain Sao Feng. Brilliant choice of casting Chow Yun-Fat for the role, brilliant. Couldn't think of anyone else to play the part. Amazing screen presence, there is something about Chow Yun-Fat's screen presence which is mesmerizing. All you Chow Yun-Fat fans will know what I mean, the guy is the definition of cool. He portrays the character very effectively and left me wanting him to have more screen time. It is a pity that he had a small role. Even though his role was small, his character is very important. Norrington was another character whom I wished had more screen time. All in all a great movie, worth your money. And to those loyal POTC fans, don't miss the short scene after the credits. There might be those who will complain about the movie, but my suggestion for everybody would be to enjoy the ride, it is one hell of a roller-coaster.......Enjoy","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, the plot is a mess, and none of the character's motivations - save perhaps Cpt. Sparrow's - make any sense whatsoever. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but as you watch this film, pick any character and ask yourself, what is he or she after, what are their goals and why? Add to that a lot of ""boy that was convenient"" sort of moments, and you begin to ask yourself, how good a script was this to begin with? On the up side, the acting is decent, the effects are great, and there is even some humor. Just don't try to figure out why anything that happens matters.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dead Man's Chest was a little mindless for my tastes so my expectations were low here. Boy was I wrong.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End returns to its roots, remembering what made the first movie so great: the storytelling. Many have called the story confusing. It certainly is tricky to follow, but it's not any more convoluted that fits a finale that sets its sights as high as PotC has. A movie that calls itself ""At World's End"" simply has to be grand in scale.There is action, to be sure, with a grand final battle between the East India Trading Co and the pirates, and this time it's well done. While I found myself bored during Dead Man's Chest because the scenes dragged on, this film suffers no such problems aside from a rather unnecessary scene between Will and Elizabeth.Performance-wise, surprisingly, Jack Sparrow and his eccentricities aren't left to carry the film between action sequences. Geoffrey Rush's Barbosa becomes fantastic in a near-hero position, while Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom shine once again. Keith Richards also wins for the best cameo in my memory, making a memorable performance out of little screen time, one that is so good that his own celebrity has nothing to do with its quality. The movie is devoid of weak performances, even among minor characters.There are few flaws in this film, mostly little pieces that I felt were left unresolved but nothing crucial, likely passed over because the film is already nearing three hours. While I would have had no problems sitting through 180+ minutes, most likely wouldn't have.All in all I'm glad to hand At World's End a solid 9, a score I haven't felt a movie deserved in some time. After being disappointed by a string of films this year from the aforementioned sequels to renting Babel on DVD, a film like PotC:AWE is a true breath of fresh air. Looking forward to the DVD edition.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It runs about 20 minutes too long, and near the end, your on the edge of your seat ready to leave. Along with Spider-Man 3, this film has too much going on in it, and it feels as if the directors are trying to resolve too much at once.I would wait until this one came out on DVD to watch it, because you would may want to view some parts again, or pause it to catch your breath.-Tyler","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

POTC ATW is not complicated, or convoluted but rather a richly intricate movie that may rival that of the first in this series. Visually the movie is stunning! The whole movie is so vibrant, and has such presence that you may actually find yourself ducking and dodging the blows along with our lovable pirates. The cast did a fabulous job, and Johnny Depp as always was simply brilliant. True fans that loved the first one, and enjoyed the second, will not be disappointed. I will say if you did see this third installment and did not enjoy it, I truly do encourage you to see it just one more time, and you may be surprised. I personally have seen it four times and believe that it just continues to get better with each sitting. Simply put it was a magnificent and befitting end to the trilogy. Whether this is our last movie with Jack Sparrow has yet to be seen...we can only hope for more.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But because of the huge success, movie makers suddenly feel like they should make 2 more movies (similar to the Matrix, in which the first movie is a stand-alone, but then suddenly we get 2 more movies) Dead Man's Chest is the greatest of the 3 in my opinion (lots disagree with me), it simply added 2 great bad guys (Lord Beckett and Davy Jones) and a nice tale. The only thing Dead Man's Chest needed was captain Barbossa.now we get part 3, which could make a great end. but instead, they throw in about 10 new characters which get underdeveloped and their true goals are a mystery to us. if they had sticked to the original cast, and only added 1 or 2 characters, it would have been fine. but now it's all getting confusing.good movie, great special effects, great cast, great humor, great make-up, great music, great atmosphere altogether. but just BAD BAD BAD writing and BAD BAD BAD character development!!! and last of all: I MISSED THE KRAKEN!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's not a criticism, just a fact. They are silly and goofy and light. They utilize juvenile humour, harebrained gags and far-fetched scenarios and ideas. And the films are completely dripping with clichés and kitsch, especially the third installment. But all these elements  which I would consider glaring flaws in any other film  are forgiven simply because I wouldn't expect anything different from this genre. The key is that the trilogy never takes itself seriously. It basically announced, right off the top from the first film, that it would be a silly, light, wacky, action-packed action-adventure-comedy. So you're actually looking for the silliness, the lame gags, the juvenile humour. This is not a movie I would expect deep character development from, or even basic movie logic. I expect to have a swashbuckling, action-packed, light, entertaining and just plain fun and enjoyable time at the cinema when I see this  nothing more, nothing less.In most fields, At World's End delivers unquestionably. It contains action scenes and set pieces that completely dwarf those in the first two installments. The final showdown is worth the admission price alone. Because of the film's nature and edifice, which may be the loosest and broadest of any film, the creative team can essentially do whatever comes to their tremendously creative minds  in all the fields. Indeed just thinking of and constructing these set pieces requires an immense sense of creativity and a complete disregard of logic or physics.In actuality, the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a dream come true for the creative fields of film-making. Production designers and costume designers essentially have total and utter freedom; because the film is set in a pseudo-fantasy period setting, they basically can design whatever wacky ideas come to mind. Indeed the production and costume design in this film is second to none, completely incomparable and totally unconventional, but looks absolutely fantastic and is wildly creative. The designs of the Singapore city and especially of the Shipwreck Cove construct  entirely made of wrecked ships all stacked and piled up into these massive towers  are astonishing and dazzling. The same can be said of the costume design, which is just fantastic and incredibly imaginative.The film is also a complete masterwork in the technical fields, especially in the special effects sphere. The filmmakers spared no expense and hired the best effects team Industrial Light & Magic had to offer  and the result is more than obvious on screen. The practical and model effects are almost as impressive as the mind-blowing, completely unbelievable CGI work, which just looks completely realistic, absolutely convincing and is integrated perfectly into the actual footage more so than any other movie of this type in recent years. Even Spider-Man 3 had some dodgy and unconvincing CGI work  Sony's mistake was insisting on creating their own effects instead of hiring an external (and more experienced and professional) company to deliver the high-expectation goods. Well, At World's End more than delivers in this department, so much so that the effects that were so mind-blowing in the second installment, Dead Man's Chest (namely the fish-pirates and Davey Jones himself) are almost taken for granted in this film. If you think about it, these creations are nothing short of astonishing, but they're just so convincing and realistic, you don't even think about it. And that is the biggest and primary sign of good CGI work.That said, the film has one glaring flaw that really hampers the entire experience: the script. This is the usual result of starting to shoot a movie without a finished script, but the story just feels and unfolds as if it were made up as they went along, instead of actually planned ahead of time  even more so than Dead Man's Chest, which also suffered from this problem. But At World's End is so confusing and awkward, it makes the plot in Dead Man's Chest seem actually quite logical and clear. The film essentially has one basic story element: the pirates of the world are facing extinction and band together for one final showdown against the armada of the East India Trading Company. The problem is that everything leading up to this showdown is so unbelievably confusing; it's surprising to learn that only two screenwriters worked on the script. I didn't even bother trying to follow after a while, but I'm sure that if I had I would notice glaringly wide plot holes, and that most of the characters' motives have absolutely no continuity whatsoever. For instance  considering the new information we discover about Tia Dalma in At World's End, one begins to wonder why, at the end of Dead Man's Chest, she volunteered to help the gang rescue Jack Sparrow in the first place? Indeed this is a major problem in the film, not only because it's absolutely impossible to follow or understand just what is going on at any given moment, but also because it is so unbelievably easy to create a story that makes sense. They managed to do so in the first film, and I think that a little more ironing on the creases in this screenplay and they could have reached something truly excellent. Because the general concept is great; it's just everything in-between that makes no sense whatsoever.Despite this, the film does have some moments where it truly shines, and one scene in particular involving a certain cameo everyone had been talking about since the first film is worth all the confusion that is the film's plot and the frustration in trying to understand it and organize it in your head. Combine these immaculate scenes with the great set pieces, action sequences and amazing technical and creative work, and one is almost ready to forgive the total travesty that is the script. Almost.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ever more so than the final movie. It is certainly a dispatch from the previous films, where the theme becomes slightly abstract, and plot devices tend to muddle the overall story. The world is changing, and in it, there is no more room for piracy. Under rule of the King of England, the Caribbean islands have begun executing all known pirates, associates of pirates, and even surprisingly... the children of pirates. We enter the film at the gallows and witness hanging after hanging in a strongly dark montage of death. This certainly sets the tone for the remainder of the film. William, Elizabeth align themselves with Captain Hector Barbossa on a mission to find Jack who was 'lost at sea'. It's unknown how much time has passed since we last saw him, but it could be inferred that it is not too long after his meeting with the Kraken (a giant sea squid under the control of Davy Jones). Everyone has lost some part of their hopes, or has betrayed each other at this point and even Davy Jones is under the control of the East India Trading Company. This is perhaps the only movie where I really criticize the direction in the whole pirates film series. It is such a departure from the previous film, that perhaps it's even stranger than the following movie 'On Stranger Tides'. I thought that although there has always been a sense of the mystic in the Pirates movies, this one get's really abstract and convoluted. I understand that perhaps Gore Verbinsky, was trying to wrap up the original trilogy in this entry, but the writing and characterization really gets lost along the way. Johnny Depp changed the most, not physically mind you, but he really portrays Jack as an insane man. I'm not entirely sure why he's so nuts in this one, I but I think it takes away from the charm that is Captain Jack Sparrow. Other characters have become somewhat dulled, especially Orlando Bloom ask Will. He doesn't seem that interested in what's going on around him, even as he interacts with different people throughout the film, he and Keira Knightly seemed a little lackluster. Bill Nighy remains my favourite character in the series, and really excels as a somewhat deterred yet still delightfully aggressive Davy Jones. The real shame is the plot, as there are a couple of really big plot holes, especially when it comes to the use of Calypso. I thought that there was a reason she was there in the final battle, and that the pirates had a trump card up their sleeve, but she really didn't serve much of a purpose. In the end she was almost a non-event. If she was always this powerful, why didn't they just use her from the start? Perhaps that simpler idea is what they wanted to avoid, to push the plot along for almost 3 hours, which makes this movie the longest entry in the series. Overall it's not a bad ending to the original trilogy of films, but definitely the most perplexing and complicated of the series. 6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It takes the Pirates series to surprising new levels of the fantastic, supernatural, and weird. The setting, of course, is anywhere but the Caribbean. From the start, the theme is, well, death. There's more darkness and heartbreak in this episode, and British naval villainy was overboard this time. Barbossa is the action hero. It bears careful listening and watching, especially when trying to decode pirate jargon at a pace this fast.

But very enjoyable. I liked that there were stop-and-think moments for Jack and Will and Elizabeth. Johnny Depp may have made some questionable film choices recently. But no one can accuse him of indifference. He gives Captain Jack so many more faces than a comic pirate. He's an amazing actor. Conveys as much with expression as he does with words. That Jack Sparrow remains a hero despite his very obvious flaws is telling. At least for me, Will Turner and Elizabeth are rather self serving. Jack Sparrow will always be the great one. And comedy-wise there were some lines that were priceless such as the name given the crewman with""no arms and half an eye."" In 2015, it feels like Johnny Depp might be entering a new phase of his career. Hopefully, his film projects going forward will be true to his singular talent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous, but fun, action sequences and little or no plot line, and you can definitely tell which movies those are, but this one tried to have a decent plot, and failed miserably. Yes, the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable, but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development, far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been, the abandonment of the love triangle, the overly-dramatic attempt for an epic, and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct, the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.The first problem with the movie is that Jack Sparrow isn't seen for half an hour. Johnny Depp is pretty much what has made the Pirates films. And when you do finally get to see him, he has been downgraded to the status of comic relief, rather than the humorous hero he has played in the past. It is because of this that you actually start to wish that you see less of him. The corny, one-line jokes that just seem to perpetually flow forth from his mouth get old very, very quickly.The second problem is, of course, the total lack of true interaction between the characters. Most of their speech is devoted to furthering the already failing plot, and the little that is actual development of their relationships is poorly written. Though I hated the idea of the love triangle between Will, Elizabeth, and Jack introduced in Pirates II, I was sad to see them completely abandon that idea, acting almost as though it had never happened.The main problem that I had with the plot for this film is that it never really settled down. It was either moving forward far too fast for most of the audience to keep up with, or so dead still that half the audience was falling asleep (though the latter was far rarer). Plus the introduction of so many different plot devices and magic just made the story seem so implausible. I mean, I am a firm believer in the willing suspension of disbelief in small doses (such as the amount of disbelief I had to suspend in the first film), but if I was going to actually enjoy this movie, I would have had to have suspended it for almost the entire length of the film, and that's hard to do for near three hours.And finally, the first film, as far as I know, was pretty much on par in terms of historical accuracy and pirate mythology. That is, it was very true to the era it was based in, and didn't have to add in all sorts of fantastical, magical things to give the film a sense of adventure. The only magic involved was the curse of the medallions. Which, while it may have dominated most of the plot, was rooted in some history and was presented in a plausible way. For that, I can suspend my disbelief. But when they start giving physical manifestations to Davy Jones (granted that was introduced in the second film, but still) and start calling Greek sea-nymphs (Calypso) Pirate goddesses; I'm sorry but I just can't do that. Not to mention them trying to claim that the pirates, as treacherous and murderous as they were, were actually all united under one flag is just ridiculous. No historical value (and very weak story value) whatsoever.All in all, this film surpassed how terrible I expected it to be so horribly that I am honestly considering walking back to the theater and asking for compensation for the three wasted hours of my life.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""POTC: At World's End"" is a good movie, but lacking in some areas","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1793267/?ref_=tt_urv","RoninDeVamas","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3236569/?ref_=tt_urv","4 January 2008","""At World's End"" has a lot going on. A whole lot.The most confusing part of ""At World's End"" is that nearly every main character has a subplot. Normally, I wouldn't see that as a bad thing in a movie, since I believe highly in character motivation and development. The problem that occurs in ""At World's End"" is that the subplots of the main characters overlap so many times through constant bartering and twists that it takes away from character development. Whereas ""The Curse of The Black Pearl"" had nice moments where characters would intermingle and development would take place, ""At World's End"" suffers from having too many of those moments that are too brief and convoluted to see development. It is just too complicated, and even with repeated viewings, you will have trouble making sense of things.What ""At World's End"" does have going for it are the two key subplots to the overall story that work nicely into the climax of the film. Understanding what these subplots are helps to make some sense of where the film is going and actually highlights key characters. The trick to enjoying these subplots is in keeping track.What is disappointing for me is that there isn't much time for the actors to really bring their stuff in the movie. ""At World's End"" continues to have a great cast, but the convoluted story doesn't allow many opportunities for them to stand on their own and play their character to their greatest potential. But there is praise to be given: Bill Nighy and Naomie Harris flesh out their characters very well, and there is a definite chemistry between them that is one of the highlights of the film. It will be something to look forward to in seeing these actors play their part in ""At World's End"".Overall, this is a fairly good film. It suffers from being overly complicated, but there are nice moments between characters that can be looked forward to. I'd recommend watching it after seeing the first two films, as a lot of ""At World's End"" continues from them.Rating: ** 1/2 - Fairly Good","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Nonetheless, At World's End becomes one of those few exceptions to the rule. Combining an engrossing storyline, excellent visuals, brilliant cinematography, superb acting, plenty of action, plenty of thrills, a lot of humor, and a fitting ending to conclude the trilogy, At World's End is sure to entertain and satisfy the fans of the first two installments. Also adding to the nice package of entertainment lies plenty of references to the ride (yet again), a good soundtrack that actually borrows from the great Ennio Morricone, and a humorous cameo from Keith Richards. However, if you don't like the franchise as of now, there is absolutely no reason to see this one, since it uses the same film structure recipe of the first two. Unlike previous third installments, this one does not disappoint, and delivers.The final chapter (supposedly) of this franchise follows Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the recently revived Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew as they attempt to bring back Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) for multiple reasons. In fact, each of them has a different agenda with Sparrow in mind. In the meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett has control of Davy Jones' heart, which allows for him to command the most powerful ship in the seas, threatening piracy once and for all. It is up for the remaining species of piracy to save themselves and the career of being a pirate. Taking place directly after the ending of Dead Man's Chest, At World's End starts off very quickly, following the very grim introduction. The cast and crew are back, in terms of acting and characters; some minor characters with much more screen time than before, resulting in more humorous moments. Like Dead Man's Chest, Jack Sparrow runs the show but is not the only show going on; we see plenty of Will, Elizabeth, the villains, and Barbossa.At World's End does not hold any punches throughout the movie. There are plenty of deaths, gruesome moments, and the introduction sets the tone for some of the events that are about to unfold. Death is one of the prominent themes in the film, as well as love, trust, loyalty, and honor. While it is not as action-packed as the previous two, it more than makes up for it with the final battle, which is jaw-dropping entertainment that could have gone forever and nobody would notice. The special effects, without joking, are some of the best ever displayed on film; if this doesn't win an Academy Award of any sort, there should be very little reason to ever trust the Academy again. The cinematography actually kicked it up a notch, with some beautiful scenery. One particular scene has the ship looking like it is sailing over the stars--absolutely gorgeous. We also have a very nice-looking but rather trippy sequence involving Jack Sparrow and his fate after death.Helping the magnificent special effects is the acting, which is above average for a popcorn flick. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush rekindle their chemistry and tension shared in Curse of the Black Pearl, and their performances along with that of Bill Nighy remain the best of the trilogy and this movie. But, the others did well, most notably the varied and unique pirate crew, and Keira Knightley as she develops from damsel in distress to a true pirate right in front of our eyes. Director Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job keeping the movie entertaining even when the plots scattered all over the place crashes into each other. Verbinski also knows how to raise tension when the stakes are high, and handles the special effects shots well.The pacing and editing of At World's End is far superior to that of Dead Man's Chest, as despite it being a lengthier movie, it doesn't feel that way. There are very few moments of slowdown, and even within the moments of slowdown, there are humorous one-liners or acts of physical comedy to keep us awake and laughing, waiting for the next big plot turn. The relationship between Elizabeth and Will takes a step of importance forward here as the theme of love is in the air, and is the result for the rise and demise of the cast of characters in the film.The only problem with At World' End is that it does not offer anything different from the first two installments; in which it will not attract any haters of the previous two blockbuster hits. The formula remains the same as we see a slow build-up emerge into a powerhouse action flick. In terms of action trilogies, it resembles Indiana Jones the most because of its blend of action, adventure, humor, and romance. While it is no Indiana Jones, the Pirates trilogy easily is one of the best we've seen in decades. Consistently good and entertaining, this franchise is already and shall remain a staple of pop culture and 21st century cinema history.Bottom Line: Jack Sparrow and the rest are back, and in the final act maintain the entertainment value of the previous two, arguable even stepping it up a notch. The soundtrack, visual effects, special effects, and musical score are at its peak here, despite the storyline still paling in comparison to the original. The acting, pacing, editing and directing remain successful, even though it will not attract those disappointed or disgusted by Curse of the Black Pearl and/or Dead Man's Chest. There aren't enough popcorn flicks that deliver the complete package, and At World's End just leaves you thirsty for more, especially considering recent disappointments from other film franchises. It is a nice tale of the high seas full of action, suspense, comedy, drama, and romance. Highly recommend; grab some popcorn a huge soda, and sit down and enjoy the wild ride towards the end of the Earth.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Entertaining but collapses under its own weight: too many plots, sub-plots, characters, and over-long action sequences make it rather incomprehensible","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2151080/?ref_=tt_urv","classicalsteve","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7383416/?ref_=tt_urv","2 November 2009","This final installment of the ""Pirates of the Caribean"" film series suffers from the same ailment as the last ""Ocean's 13"" movie: too many sub-plots, too many characters, too many ships, and too many long action sequences. During the entire film, I kept getting confused regarding which ship I was in, which character was dealing with which problem, and how Captain Jack Sparrow fits into the whole bloody thing. The first film was at least relatively tight in terms of its focus on Davy Jones and his ship of un-dead in the ""Black Pearl"". However, these later installments added so many ingredients into the stew that it was hard to figure out what the main course was.The film begins with a bunch of poor sods being systematically executed by the baddie of the film, Lord Cutler Beckett. OK, fair enough. This story will be how these people are somehow avenged by the pirates, although I wasn't exactly clear who these people were or why they were being executed. (Maybe I'd forgotten from the second movie?) But then the film moves to Singapore. Apparently, Bootstrap Bill wants to solicit the help of an Asian pirate head-honcho played by Yun Fat-Chow who has some extra-special navigating maps. Out of nowhere, Orlando Bloom appears, apparently a prisoner of Fat-Chow. How did he get there? I guess I forgot what happened to him in the second movie. As the negotiations for the maps and Bloom are heating up, a bunch of European red coats appear out of nowhere and start shooting everything in sight, apparently at the orders of Lord Cutler Beckett. Exactly how they got there, why they were, there and what they were trying to accomplish eludes me, except we are supposed to know that riflemen with wigs in red coats are the baddies and do Lord Cutler Beckett's bidding.The film then becomes an almost-incoherent collage of interconnected episodes. Certainly, I didn't know where the film was going but I was equally unclear as to the goals/objectives of the characters at many times. Davy Jones and his band of un-dead crew are still sailing around the world but I wasn't sure how they now fit into everything. They were now on the ship ""The Flying Dutchman"". (In sea lore, the Flying Dutchman is not a ship, it's a person, a ghost trying to redeem himself who is condemned to wander on the high seas.) The good guys were now on the Black Pearl. They end up in Davy Jones' locker, literally the place for the dead who died at sea, to save Jack Sparrow. Then there's the character of Tia Dalma, aka Calypso, who gave Jack Sparrow the compass that will point toward anything that a person desires. I guess I had forgotten what Calypso wants out of all this. Maybe I should have taken notes during the second movie. And then we also allude to Orlando Bloom's father, Turner, who is a member of Davy Jones' crew of the un-dead. Now, how does this fit into everything? Finally, the crew arrives at the Pirate's Cove where they meet the council of pirates. Again, I wasn't sure what the objective was, but somehow it works out that the pirates agree to fight against Lord Beckett. So now, added to the mix are pirates from every corner of the earth: France, India, China, you name it. If there were some Eskimo pirates, I wouldn't be surprised. At some point, Lord Beckett is out on the high seas with an armada of ships. Why he was going out wasn't exactly clear to me except I guess to fight the pirates. And why is it in his best interest to fight the pirates personally? So the movie has a baddie? And of course, Captain Jack Sparrow is a part of everything but what that everything is is still a little blurry. Certainly, Sparrow is the most enjoyable character, and Johnny Depp plays him incredibly well, but I was unclear how Sparrow now fits into the story which really centers on Bloom and his love interest Elizabeth Swann, which are getting a little bit side-tracked by all the other stuff. Sparrow seems more about comic relief than an integral part of the conflict. But no question, his scenes are the best, particularly when he is by himself in Davy Jones' locker.Still, there are enough enjoyable scenes to make the experience fun entertainment but there was so much going on I couldn't make out the point of the film. And the action sequences only lasted about an hour each. I may have to go back and watch some of the second movie to remind myself of some of the things I was supposed to know coming into the third. Is it really worth all that trouble? Still the best story about pirates is Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" which took place at only three places: a tavern, a ship and an island. Limiting the scope actually reinforces the adage that less is often more. One pirate ship is quite scary. One hundred of them are kind of ridiculous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can see why it disappointed a lot of people. I don't blame them for being disappointed. But I sincerely enjoyed it.The film has a lot of flaws, the biggest being poor character development and an overly complex plot: the flaws it shared with the second film. However, unlike DMC's bloated (although enjoyable) plot, At World's End at least has a destination.The endless cycle of betrayals occurring between the characters makes it hard to sympathize with the characters. The different steps in the journey do not exhibit the best pacing. If there is one thing I could compliment on that others would agree with, it would be the action and special effects.Davy Jones was by far the most realistic character. His tormented soul is revealed to the audience as the film progresses, and honestly I enjoyed his scenes the most, even with his funny accent. While Davy Jones was realistically flawed, Jack Sparrow was the humorously insane star of the show. I thought that the hallucination aspect introduced in the film was very entertaining, although it contributed little to the plot. Kudos to Depp, who even though his performance has diminished from his debut in the first film, managed to keep the audience entertained.Geoffrey Rush as the fearsome Captain Barbossa did an outstanding job, and behind both Depp and Nighy one of the most entertaining characters in the film. Chow Yun-Fat as Sao Feng did a very good job, although for all the hype built up to him in trailers and material before the film, I was disappointed by his mere 20 minutes of show-time, compared to the main villains.The East India Trading Company has proved controversial among fans, but I really enjoyed it. For me, it represented that the freedom-loving way of Pirates was threatened, and the imposing shadow of Lord Cutler Beckett cracking down on piracy everywhere drove most of the central plot to gather the Pirate Lords (Richard's performance as Captain Teague was very highly praised, even by the negative critics, with good reason).This leads me to the last set of characters: Will and Elizabeth. The love-triangle between Will, Lizzie, and Jack is resolved in a much more satisfying way then, say, the Leia-Luke-Han triangle in Star Wars (although I enjoyed all six of the Star Wars films as well). However, Will's fate left much to be desired, and the betrayal cycle affected their characters the most, although I still sympathized with them for reasons unknown. :)I know you think I'm being too positive compared to critics' reviews. Apart from the fact that critics are naturally more critical than the rest of the population, their main bone to pick with the film was the plot: not that it was a bad one, just that it was too complex and filled with needless distractions. And I agree, to an extent. It was very hard to follow for people who haven't seen the previous two films, and even for some who did. Of course, I see it as giving the film a re watch value. The one thing that I honestly didn't like was the Betrayal Cycle that occurred with both DMC and AWE; it was silly and often annoying. But when push-comes-to-shove, I'll buy this for five reasons:1. It is an enjoyable film that will keep you entertained. 2. Plot problems aside, the characters are very fun 3. the humor is great 4. the plot is satisfactory although complex 3. Davy JonesSo, do what sensible Americans (and people of other nationalities, I assume) do every time: Ignore the critics, watch the movie, and have a great experience at the movies with characters that we love with action we enjoy.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

No bad anythings about Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, not one single thing. If you are going to see a movie this summer make it Pirates. Also, if you are in the Seattle area go to AMC Cinerama 1 on 4th street. That theatre makes it that much better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The result was gobsmackingly incoherent. Random and contrived plots popping in and then fizzling out, which isn't helped by the terrible acting. Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly were so wooden I got splinters. Keira's method of acting seems to be reading from an autocue and then pouting.

I found it to be better than ""Dead Man's Chest"" in which everything went a bit special-effects-happy, but it still didn't manage to reach the brilliance of the first, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".It was pleasing to see humanity return after the creature-focused DMC and battle sequences were quite enjoyable and thrilling. Locations were very interesting as well. Once again, Zimmer's score was brilliant and complemented the visual experience well.The plot, while a little convoluted, intrigued me - I personally enjoyed the plot twists and ambiguity of where each character sat. However, even this began to wear on me, and viewers with less interest in these plot devices are likely to find the film confusing and dissatisfying.While the execution of special effects was great, it is the creative force behind the decisions that grated against me. The Davy Jones Locker sequence was enjoyable, but after the departure from the barren landscape, the multiple Jacks were distracting and jarring for the progression of the plot. The Calypso scene was similarly disappointing. For a sea goddess to simply be a giant version of her human form was a let-down - where is the fire and water? Overall, it was enjoyable film, but it's hard to beat the surprising wit and simple adventure the first Pirates had to offer.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In fact, I find that many of the critics' reviews are immature and baby-ish. The primary complaint I came across was that there was ""too much going on"" or that ""it is too difficult to follow the multiple plot lines"". Grow up! So many movies nowadays are extremely watered-down. Adaptations are stripped to their bare bones, and oftentimes plots are simplified for the sake of a disengaged modern audience. I found this intense and winding thriller a breath of fresh air. I agree that it is difficult to follow, but I enjoy the way I, as a viewer, must be completely absorbed in every moment. I realize that intense movies like this are not for everyone, but it is the perfect ending for this trilogy. The past 2 have been dominated by increasingly intricate stories, making this climax no surprise.If you do not like intense, twisting, and intricate plots, this movie is definitely not for you. But if you would rather see the movie 5 times and catch every word rather than be insulted by watered down trash, then go see it!On other notes, the screenplay is an incredible balance between comedy and drama. The acting is very impressive, and the visual effects are stunning. While it is definitely heavy watching, the only thing I was left wanting as I walked out of the theater was to see it again!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Lord Cutler Beckett is killing everybody using Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman. James Norrington (Jack Davenport) had given him Davy Jones' heart and is promoted to Admiral.

Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) come to get him back as well as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the locker. Sparrow has one of the nine pieces of eight. In Shipwreck Cove, the nine captains vote to declare war.This movie really needs an opening 'previously' segment. It dives right in without explaining which makes it tough to get going. It's pure chaos while trying to remember what came before. Davy Jones' Locker is a weird fascinating world. I really like the surrealism. It's funny and a break from the Pirates world. The idea of a landlocked ship and the stone crabs are imaginative. The problem is that the movie keeps piling on revelations. I don't really understand all the Calypso stuff.

This is not to say that the film shouldn't do that, no rather I'm arguing that the film needs a bit more of a bridge between this one and the last one. Sue me, for what ever reason I felt like I was reading a book and that some one ripped out two chapters in the middle and that while you can follow what was going on you'd be better off had you read what was missing.That said, I really loved this movie. Packed to the rafters with plots and ideas and action this is the film that the last film should have been. This is a solid 2 hours 45 minutes that never lets up-even as it confuses you. What can I say this film proves what a mistake the last one was and how you really shouldn't take a 90 minute movie and blow it up another hour. But enough complaining about the last film, lets talk about this one.A great thrill ride where characters shift and grow and things move along. I loved it. I loved much of the small stuff-The Bootstap Bill stuff, the broken hearted lovers, the romance and everything else. If there is any real flaw to the film its that the villains-the East India trading company don't really make sense are not menacing enough especially compared to Davy Jones and Captain Barbosa (also some of what they do makes no logical sense whats so ever). Caught on the ride I didn't care I just went with it all (though I still wish they weren't so whimpy.)

Of course, it was 9:45 pm, on a school night and this was the last day of its 3-week run at the Garland. But when such a paltry crowd shows up, it makes for a bad omen of things to come. Unfortunately, my fears were realized. This is not to say that this latest epic is a bad picture. It's just not up to the standards of the first two, although many of my fellow commentators rate the third PIRATES ahead of the second. For one thing, the whole story in this series has taken a decidedly darker turn from the first film, which was suitable for younger children without being dumbed down for their elders. The sequel, with its Kraken and bloodthirsty squid crew, was not at all suitable for younger folks, and the most recent work has a much darker tone, with very little of the warmth and humor that the characters brought to life in CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, and to a lesser extent, DEAD MEN'S CHEST. AT WORLD'S END manages to bring in some intriguing characters, but never really develops them. The Oriental captain, played by Chow Yun-Fat, never gets to do much and his back story with Jack Sparrow should have been filled in with some flashbacks. The same can be said for Jack's father. After so much hype about Keith Richards coming aboard the PIRATES franchise, he has few lines and little contact with Jack. On the other hand, the witch plays what I call a ""Mary Potter"" character, who's there to bring Jack back from the dead, but performs no magic, and instead wanders around mumbling mostly unintelligible dialogue. Her character and the evil Lord Beckett and his henchmen, which later includes the disgraced commodore, serve to bog the narrative down, and their villainy lacks the spirit that Barbossa and Davy Jones gave the first two films. All in all, my main gripes here are that this sequel is much too long, leans too much to the dark side, and it fails to develop some of its more interesting new characters, although I really liked the scenes with the one-eyed pirate and his bald buddy, not to mention the funny bits with the monkey and parrot. Will Turner also gets short shrift in the plot, but the actors playing Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa and Davy Jones make up for the deficit with outstanding performances. And the visuals, action and rousing score make this a worthy film to see and to own. It's just not up to par with the first two in the series, and if the Disney people can't do any better than this, it's time for the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN to walk the plank when it comes to further sequels.

The movie is too much plot and not enough action. I'm not saying it was a bad flick, but compared to its predecessors, it's weak. The characters are hard to follow sometimes, and sometimes easy to predict. I can honestly say I was bored in the theater until the end battle scenes, but even the way they did it was kind of puzzling. The CGI effects were incredible and probably rival lord of the ring's, but the fact that they have huge breaks in-between fights confused me. Still, a must see movie because of the cliffhangers from POTC 2, and a better summer flick than Spider-man 3, but if you are expecting what the first two had, don't!

Where was the light take on things, why Jack was like the guy in the red shirt in every other scene looking like his mother just died, and the next scene he talks like never before..deep and serious, why? Where was the sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth...you do remember that from the second one, right? Why was the storyline more important than the story itself?

But when I saw the second one, at first I liked it, but when I saw it again it was horrible and made no sense. I am not trying to put the people who work on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies down but they are not really caring about putting a story with a beginning, middle, and end in the movies. All it is, is a bunch of action scenes put together to sell to people who pay to see the movies.

It was absolutely something I will treasure forever. This entire trilogy is something I'll never forget. I've never had another set of movies do to me what this one has done.When I was little I always had a thing for movies. I always loved them more than most people. But when in 2003 the first Pirates came out I became addicted to them. It was the first time that I couldn't explain how I felt about a movie, because it moved me that much. Then when the second Pirates came out I had my ticket for opening day days in advance & I even dressed up for the showing. I was amazed how once again I was just blown away by a movie. Now 4 years since the first film I am a 16 year old sophomore in high school, my ticket was bought weeks in advance & again I was dressed up. Sitting there watching it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like magic. To this day I can't explain what this trilogy means to me to other people. It honestly changed my life. When I think of certain quotes from the three films tears come to my eyes because they have such meaning for me. This is a trilogy that I know I will watch hundreds of times, I'll be able to share it with my children, & my grandchildren. I'll be able to grow up with it, just like a whole other generation before me has grown up with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, & The Godfather trilogies. I'll never be able to put a price on how much this set of films means to me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

At a runtime of 168 minutes, that's not a lot, but they are, indeed, excellent scenes. Magical even. The first is set in an otherworldly state of limbo. Captain Sparrow's ship is stranded in a featureless white nowhere halfway between the moon and Utah, without a drop of water in sight. Sparrow is not technically alone, but except for a few shape-shifting crustaceans, all the other inhabitants of the otherworldly plain are nothing but copies of himself. Small surprise Sparrow is continuously on the brink of madness. True, it's a dual rip-off: Vincenzo Natali's ""Nothing"" meets Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"". But the cinematic craftsmanship is magnificent, and the madman is, after all, Johnny Depp. He's been a safe bet as the offbeat nut-case ever since ""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas"". The second scene features a weathered Englishman as the Keeper of the Pirate Code. Any more, I won't say.

Both films were long and loaded with special effects, and all the same characters, including one from the first film, return for the third chapter in the Pirate series. Black Pearl was still my favorite of the three, but Worlds End and Dead Man's Chest were fitting sequels in their own right.Both Will and Elizabeth, with the help of Barbarossa from the first film, must travel to the ends of the world to release Jack Sparrow from his death and captivity in Davey Jones Locker. They must do this so they can bring Jack back because he holds one of the pieces of eight of the pirate kings. This is needed in order for the pirates to convene to a meeting in which they will decide if they should go to battle with Lord Beckett who has taken control of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchmen. You see Lord Beckett wants to rule the seas, and in order to do this he must wipe out all the pirates. Of course the pirates don't want this, but they must find a way to get past all their backstabbing and work together. They must also decide if they want to release the water goddess Calypso from her human bonds and hope she helps them with beating Lord Beckett and Davey Jones. Of course the pirates have betrayed her just as Davey Jones has. So will she help them or just let them all try and kill each other?Confusing isn't it. I know, but Dead Mans Chest was pretty convoluted as well. There are so many plots and subplots with this third film, that it is hard to see everything clearly. Still the acting by the cast was well done, and the story, as confusing as it was, was still interesting for summer action fare. Add to this top notch special effects, and a final battle scene that was incredible, and you get a decent third film to one of the most famous trilogies ever.I must also remind you to stay after the credits have rolled because like the second film, this movie has a final scene which is a lot more interesting, and this one scene may just lead to a new chapter in the Pirate series. Oh I almost forgot, their is also a certain Rolling Stone that makes a cameo appearance. Watch out for that one as well.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

At 2 hours and 50 minutes you need some food with you to keep you going. None of the film is particularly boring but the time doesn't just speed by like it does in other long movies.

It's not that bad. There's the basic summary. Now for the long version....I walked into this film worried about it. Would it sink to the unbelievable low of 'Spider-Man 3', or would it be a fine, flavorful piece of entertainemnt, ala 'Shrek the Third'? It turns out this threequel winds up somewhere in between those two films on my list. 'At World's End' is not nearly as cringeworthy as Spidey, but it lacks the special sauce that make the Shrek threequel such a great summer surprise. The main problem is the plot. This film picks up where the last one left off, with the crew of the Black Pearl hunting for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, carrying the film as usual), who is trapped in a strange purgatory full of crabs (hey, I don't make this stuff up). It's an interesting idea that gives FX greats ILM plenty opportunity to dream up plenty of eye candy, but the fact that Depp doesn't appear for the entire first quarter of the film hurts the story's momentum greatly. Instead, we are treated to more of the semi-romance between Keira Knightley and Orblando-scuse me, Orlando Bloom, and the introduction of a disappointing new baddie, Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat, whose spiritual demeanor does not lend itself to roles of mustache twirling villainy). When we finally do pick up with Captain Jack, it's a breath of cinematic fresh air, and, for a while, the film returns to the anything-goes, tossed-in-the-air style that made parts 1 and 2 of the series great marvels of escapism. But than, as the film reaches its final stages, it becomes a cluttered, dull heap of subplots. So much time is spent on the needless backstories of characters like Tia Dalma (an obnoxious role played with Rasta-esquire fervor by Naomi Harris) and James Norrington (Jack Davenport does what he can), that the script begins to kill of characters at random in a sloppy attempt to divert back to the main plot without leaving the many smaller stories open-ended. But for all it's storyline complexities, the film's ending practically screams ""Pirates 4!"". If one can ignore the story long enough to appreciate the other aspects of the film, they will find imaginative visuals, some strong performances, and a final action setpiece among the best ever committed to celluloid. But in a film that is part of a trilogy promising escapism, a convoluted plot shouldn't be a problem.

"1","/10","The only piracy was committed by the producers","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1673121/?ref_=tt_urv","peter-liddle-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15679019/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2007","I'm writing this review for two reasons: first, to serve as a warning; and second, as a form of therapy for what was a shockingly horrific experience. If you enjoy movies in any way, avoid this one. Here be monsters.I really enjoyed 'Dead Man's Chest', which, to say it was based on a theme park ride, had a real swashbuckling feel to it. The second movie was disappointing, but 'World's End' was insulting. One character mentions that ""its only business"" and you get the distinct feeling that it was an often repeated line by those making the movie. The only form of piracy was the fact that people had to pay to see this movie.To criticise the plot seems a little pointless because there really isn't one. The movie stumbles like a senile blind-man from one character to another as we are supposed to be convinced that everyone is out for themselves, but they're all lovable rogues really. You soon come to hate each character for wasting your time before the plot kicks in (which it doesn't). It truly proves that a mass of characters does not in itself make a movie.The outstanding thing about this movie is how you are constantly surprised. After a scene that leaves you feeling that that must be the lowest point, another pops up that's even worse. When one of the characters attempts a rousing speech the collective sigh of the movie watchers was very impressive. The speech itself was as shrill as it was clichéd.To all the movie-goers out there I say: avoid this movie or simple post in your money to the producers and save yourself a couple of hours. To the makers of this movie I recommend reading Capt. Charles Johnson's 'A general history of the robberies and murders of the most notorious pirates' either that or using a dictionary. P is for Pirate.How can you make a pirate movie without any piracy?","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Has bigger issues this time but is still fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3079071/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","1 September 2014","When a sequel performs just as well at the box office as its predecessor, viewers know that a third entry is already underway in hopes of making a trilogy. This was no shock at all to viewers when Pirates of Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) blew away the competition when released. In fact, the entire cast began preparing for the third, simultaneously while completing the first sequel. These particular preemptive steps are not uncommon, but risky if plans did not go accordingly. Thankfully for them, their hunch was right. As for this particular entry, it continues to maintain the fun factor in multiple aspects of the film. Yet, there are a few things that don't work this time.For one thing, the continuity remains faithful to the last two films. After Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) died and went to Davy Jones' Locker, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) join together to find a way to get Sparrow back. The catch, is that it requires more help than they think. Also returning is Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who make a temporary alliance to help get what they want as well. And as for every other character from the last two films, they appear too, plus a little extra. For example, Naomie Harris as the witch, Tia Dalma, returns for a larger role, Chow Yun-Fat plays a Pirate lord from Singapore and even Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones has a minor but entertaining role. The best part of these casting decisions is that the new and old characters have the right charisma for each role and are likable on screen.Unfortunately with this comes a price. The drawback being that there are too many individual character story lines. It's overwhelming and confusing at the same time. Will Turner, Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Capt. Barbossa, Cutler Beckett, and Elizabeth Swann all have their own agendas of which none agree with anybody else's goals. With this, the end results in quite a cluttered story with several subplots – it's not easy to follow. And the fact that its not easy to follow is the most surprising part. With a running time clocking in at almost 3 hours, one would think that there would be enough time to fully understand each character's plan, but only a few are actually understandable. Plus, not every viewer can sit through a movie close to 3 hours. The story telling has to be really focused and unfortunately Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot just put in too much all at once. I guess they forgot bigger isn't always better.The only other problem this film has is that again, with it having the longest running time thus far, it feels like it also contains less action sequences that the last two. Or at least the action feels more sporadic. It's disappointing because a 20-minute finale sometimes doesn't make up for lost time in-between. Thankfully, the special effects do mesh well with the live-action and when there is action, it does entertain. Sword fighting and cannon fire is exciting to watch at sea. So that's not to say that these two writers from the last two films didn't do anything else right. There are also several moments of comedy throughout and they all don't belong to Johnny Depp either. Mainly Geoffrey Rush has several comical lines but so do various shipmates as well.Cinematography as always looked great. Dariusz Wolski maintains his steady hand getting great shots of the sea and various islands. It should make viewers feel like that's where they should go for their next vacation. Lastly, the musical score was produced by ever-popular Hans Zimmer. For the most part, Zimmer continues to sustain his catchy pirate themes for Jack Sparrow and the franchise. But for this entry, Zimmer includes some new tunes of which some come across as more bizarre than engaging. An example would be when Sparrow is in Davy Jones' Locker. Zimmer just plays ""boing-boing"" sounds. It does represent the scene accurately because Jones' Locker is weird, but it feels like there could've been a better way to express it. It's not as strong as the last two but it still has a level of quality and entertainment.Its cast and crew preserve the traits of the last two movies with its set of likable characters, catchy music, energetic action and special effects. The biggest problem with this entry is that with too many smaller story lines cluttering the main plot, it can get tiring to follow with a clear understanding. Plus, with a running time close to 3 hours, it may lose its viewer's interest by then.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keep in mind the even JACKASS had a 8+ rating the first week on IMDb. The die-hards are the ones willing to stand in line to see this movie on opening weekend and will have a positively biased opinion when voting.I saw this movie with one of those die-hard friends last night who scored VIP tickets for a showing in Denver (I wouldn't have waited hours in line to see this movie). I thoroughly enjoyed part I, very entertaining. I waited for Part II to come out to video and it took me 4 nights to finish it  it was way too long and I had a hard time staying awake. Hollywood has a history of making Part III+ movies simply to make $$ but they are rarely intriguing endeavors (already we have seen mediocrity in Shrek III and Spiderman III). So I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got with Pirates III. It was just 'OK'. The special effects were quite amazing, saving a limited storyline and lack of originality. I predict the IMDb score will settle just below 8 in the next several months.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While other adventure movies of this fashion tend to settle slowly into well trodden tracks and increasingly predictable plots,Pirates of the Caribbean is a contrarian and proud of it. At World's End brings with it a plethora of new delights and surprises wrapped in the warm,familiar comic relief and idiosyncrasies of the preceding movies, reminding its ever growing audience that ol' witty Jack and his crew always deliver on their promises,pirate code or not.Although eyebrows were raised at the unusual runtime of the movie, the viewer shall find that every second of the journey (for it is truly a wonderful journey) is worth it.

It's about living with yourselfforever."" That is an awesome line and a touching moment, but like much of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" it is woefully out of context. Context is not the strong suit of Director's Gore Verbinski's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"". Admittedly, I did not see ""Pirates 2"", and ""Pirates 3"" is a mess. Granted it is visually spectacular and state-of-the-art stunning, but much like the other third legs of the other summer trilogies ""Pirates 3"" is running on vapors. Johnny Depp is great as Captain Jack Sparrow. Perhaps, he is the only reason to endure the movie's 2 hours and 47 minutes. The movie is way too long. Depp is supported by amazing actors in this marathon sequel. Keira Knightley is very strong and beautiful as Elizabeth Swann. I think that it is all right for Knightley to add some carbs back into her diet. She impressively pulls off the action hero role. Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush is at his treacherous best as Captain Barbossa. In comparison Orlando Bloom is weak as Will Turner. However, Bloom does muster enough charisma to salvage the love story with Knightley. Much of this shipwreck falls squarely on the army of writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert. The sheer mass of writers points to the lack of a single narrative voice, and patched work storytelling. ""Pirates 3"" will set box office records around the world, but it is disappointing given all the talent involved.As ""Pirates 3"" resumes from last time, Barbossa, Turner, and Swann are out to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker at World's End. They must also all face Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in a showdown, and the Flying Dutchman's armada commanded by Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander). Will Turner (Bloom) also seeks to free his father from Davy Jones. Davy Jones himself seeks justice from his scorned lover Calypso (Naomie Harris). The 9 pirate Captains reluctantly form an alliance to battle Lord Beckett. And finally, will Elizabeth marry Will before all this is done? Who cares? Even piecing storyline together, the movie is a wild ride and almost impossible to follow. ""Pirates 3"" also gets very weird. The whole 'stone crabs' indulgence in Davy Jones Locker is completely bizarre. Amidst all the inept chaos, Johnny Depp remains captivating as Jack. Depp masterfully switches between wacky and aloof to compelling hero. But even this grows weary, because ultimately there is no story to tell.""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" will do just fine in terms of box office and business. The movie is entertaining and fun, but it is way too long and really runs on fumes after the first half hour. What is disappointing is that ""Pirates 3"" wastes the talents of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The trilogy deserved a better finish. If you don't have a compelling need to see the movie wait for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" on DVD when you can view using appropriate refrigerator breaks.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Stating that, I say that At World's End is a fan's movie. I enjoyed virtually every second of it, I found it rich and layered and complex without becoming overly confusing. I was extremely satisfied with the experience and can't wait to watch it again. Its weakness is the fact that it's a fan's movie. If you aren't familiar with the events of Dead Man's Chest (and I think that means more than having seen it once last summer), odds are you'll be confused by what's happening - not a lot of time is spent re-establishing plot points to bring you up to speed. Dead Man's Chest got a lot of criticism for being somewhat disjointed and complicated - criticism I agree with. I feel that At World's End tells a much more coherent and well-paced story without sacrificing an intricate plot. DMC felt like a long movie; AWE is longer but I never once felt it. I also feel that AWE is much better written than DMC was. The dialogue isn't clumsy, and there's not a self-conscious effort to be funny. While there are humorous moments in the film, they never feel forced or obvious, as happened in DMC. References to the past movies are a joy to discover (there are some really subtle ones, and I have no doubt that there are many I didn't see on the first viewing). I feel like the writers concentrated on the plot and characters almost exclusively and let the humor occur naturally as opposed to the drawn-out, almost slapstick sequences that peppered DMC. The same is true for the effects - there's some gorgeous effects shots (and some gorgeous shots in general) but the filmmakers are no longer trying to best themselves in terms of effects. They simply serve their purpose unobtrusively, which is what effects are supposed to do. Only in one sequence did I feel the effects work wasn't up to par (and it involved models and forced perspective more than CGI). The only true quibble I have with the film, on first viewing, is a character plot line that I don't feel was fully resolved. Overall I enjoyed the character development immensely, and especially love the arc for Elizabeth. As with the preceding movies, it will require more than one viewing to really appreciate the journey each character takes, and I look forward to that experience!Overall, an excellent achievement, a fan's movie, one I enjoyed from start to finish and plan on enjoying many times in the future. I couldn't have expected more.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, others have criticized the movie for its jumbled nature, and lack of plot. Both accounts are right in their own regard.The movie begins with the hanging of all pirates by the Eastern Trading Company. The British have called a state emergency declaring the right to assembly, a trial by jury, the right to habeas corpus etc (think the Bill of the Right) in attempts to rid the land of pirates quicker. As a result, the remaining pirates (and this is where the Pirates cast comes in) must come up with a survival strategy. Without ruining any details, the explanation of this strategy, the history, the legacy, is not explained in the movie very well, some parts are revealed as you go along, but after you watch the movie, you'll have lots of questions of ""well, what was this for?""In that same regard, the poor explanation of the plot doesn't destroy the movie, it only detracts from the movie depending on your taste. If you have liked the humor in previous Pirates movies, then you will love this one. Many of the people in the theater were laughing numerous times. Likewise, the movie succeeds in its usual fashion in keeping the viewer guessing who is on whose side. And of course Pirates has great action sequences.I liked the movie because I never really watched Pirates for the plot. It was for the humor and action sequences. The first movie was great because the plot supported it. Make no mistake if Pirates I wasn't as great as it was, this movie wouldn't be rated as highly as it is. But the producers did well on expanding on the things that made Pirates I good. The only problem with this movie, is that this movie's magic doesn't sustain itself and depends on the first one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I didn't. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. It's hard not to write spoilers but I won't I will just say that I really hated Keirra's character in the second movie, in the first movie she made sense but in the second she didn't and in the third she doesn't until almost the end. If this movie is trying to show women in power, I say we just keep the men if Elizabeth Swann in the best we can do. Jack Sparrow continues to be Jack Sparrow just nuttier and the plots and double crosses just keep getting more stupid and confusing. In the end the plot itself only makes sense for Will and Boot strap Bill. Chow Yun-Fat and Keith Richards are wasted. Only Barbossa's characterization is worth watching, he and Jack Sparrow together are fun. Poor Norington, unlike in the second film, is also wasted. The Jamaican accented Naomi Harris' character is interesting for most of the film and then wasted in the end, as is Davey Jones. I did say I liked this film didn't I. The CGI got to be too much but the end was sweet and noble so 7/10 for that.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But since it was successful there was no doubt there would be sequels. Thats not to say that the sequels weren't good.Ever since Lord of the Rings it seems that every third film has be the longest. Pirates has followed. Running at a unnecessary 168 minutes. The whole Pirates politics bothered me. It made the pirates seem less dangerous. The movie could have done with a few scenes being cut.Again Johnny Depp stole the whole show. Without him this would be a 2/10 film. His hallucination scenes were hilarious. Also there wasn't a person who wasn't laughing when he had his scenes with Geoffrey Rush.A strong weakness in this movie is the Elizabeth and Will storyline. It drags and drags and are not believable as a couple at all. Curse of the black pearl is still #1. With Worlds End coming in 2nd place.The Ending was done pretty damn well. With a final fight that will definitely get you sitting up in your seat.The visual effects were top notch. I have to give mention to how realistic Davy Jones looked.I recommend it if you have seen the first two movies. It had it highs and it had its lows but this is still a satisfying movie.7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It completely sucked. Bottom line is that I have no idea what happened, and neither did my friend. But the bad thing is that I don't really care. I liked the first two, and I was pumped to get to see it before most people. Unfortunately, now I have the burden of shielding people from this piece of crap. The movie tackles too many character story lines, and falls flat on all of them. You might be thinking, ""Oh I love complicated movies because they are fun and intriguing!LOL!"". Think again. This isn't complicated in a good way like The Departed or Memento. No. No. No. This movie is complicated in a way that you assume that the writers just made stuff up as went along. Yeah the movie looks cool at times, and there are aerial shots of tropical islands and whatnot. But I'm sure there will be plenty of large budget movies with great CGI this summer that might actually have a decent and somewhat sensible plot.I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to spoil the film for those of you out there that like to be in suspense while watching sh*tty movies, but I will say that I hope you like terribly crafted jokes involving a monkey, and I hope you like them in mass quantities. If I were Johnny Depp I would try to get on board for a Stomp the Yard sequel before I signed on to a fourth Pirates movie.","39 out of 86 found this helpful.

There are precious few new characters, and director Gore Verbinski relies on Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his camp goofiness so heavily it should be called the Captain Jack Sparrow Show.As the plot builds towards a final showdown, the love story continues to revolve around William Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and their 'will they-won't they' merry-go-round. Snore.It's a similar story with At World's End's special effects. They're impressive, but it feels like we've seen them all before.The best are stolen from the far superior Dead Man's Chest, with only a short sequence featuring Sparrow hallucinating in Davy Jones' locker showing any signs of inspiration.Thankfully, the much-hyped appearance of Keith Richards as Sparrow's father is well worth the wait. Richards is brilliant, and if there were more of him he could have single-handedly saved the film.But it's a wasted opportunity, much like the rest of the film.To get to the climactic overblown whirlpool battle, you'll have to navigate a massively complicated plot that features more twists, turns and double-crosses than a con artist convention.You'll need more than a compass, an eyeglass and a map marked with 'X' to understand what the heck is going on. By the time you get to the end, you won't remember how you got there or why you're supposed to care.To make matters worse, the final scenes hint a fourth movie could be on the cards.Come on, guys. Successful movie quadralogies are even rarer than trilogies. Surely it's time to give Captain Jack Sparrow and his merry band of pirates a rest?

Eventually, all are reunited, and it's time to fight both Davy Jones and his ghostly crew as well as the British navy. Loads of CGI, with a computer rendering of Captain Jack standing in for the real thing in many of the action sequences. Of course, the kids won't mind, having been conditioned to this cartooniness by SPIDER-MAN flicks. Johnny Depp is funny as the seemingly endlessly inebriated Captain Jack, but the humor wears a bit thin this third time around. The ending may disappoint the adults. But again, the kiddies probably won't mind. Let's hope this is the end of the series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In my opinion it is the best of the trilogy hands down. I think I would be quite hard to find a movie as fun as this one this summer. Every scene is a blast to watch with the hilarious visuals or dialogue, or a great battle scene. Here's the downer though, the plot is so muddled, and confusing, there are so many times that you have no idea what's going on. Even director Gore Verbinski said he was confused at times. It's not a good sign when the maker doesn't even know what's going on. On top of that, half the time you have no idea who is on which side, as everyone backstabs each other at least once. So I won't even attempt to explain the plot, I would probably mess it up. But did I mention the movie is fun? Johnny Depp, as always, is spectacular as Captain Jack Sparrow. There were times in the second film when it seemed that the filmmakers were forcing the Sparrow humor, but he has found his niche in this film again. There are scenes, like one with fifty Jacks in Davy Jones Locker, where you'll bust a gut laughing. Keira Knightley actually stepped it up for this one. She no longer seems like just a pretty face, she actually does some serious acting, and has some hilarious scenes. Orlando Bloom, is, well, he's just Orlando Bloom. A huge 'welcome back' goes to Geoffrey Rush who returns as Captain Barbossa. He not only is extremely cool, but he also may have passed Jack Sparrow as my favorite character. He is that good and you'll see why. Let's see, there are so many new and old characters I could mention that were amazing, but that would take up the whole page. There is one more worthy of mention though, Keith Richards. Yep, the Keith Richards as Jack's father. It is only a brief scene, but it is certainly a scene-stealer. The C/G in ""Pirates"" has stepped it up even more than the amazing effects we saw in the first and second ""Pirates"". For example, the last battle takes place in a huge maelstrom, a battle scene that'll go down in movie history. Your jaw will be on the popcorn-covered floor of the theater. Just a word of warning though, This ""Pirates"" is the most brutal and violent of the three, with the body count innumerable. This is certainly not going to be the best film-making of the summer, but it will be the most fun and entertaining one. And clocking in at just under three hours; be prepared to spend lots of time with pirates. For me, I could watch 'Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies forever, so a three hour running time didn't hinder me, and it shouldn't hinder you. Everything is wrapped up nicely in the end, but you can tell they are hinting at many more stories for Captain Jack. Oh boy, I'm excited! And like every other blockbuster released so far, critics are roasting it. Don't they ever take a break? People watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" for fun, not for excellent film-making. Why can't they get that through their heads? Don't listen to them, see this film and have the time of your lives and be sort of confused.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He could be referring to the recent resurrection of the pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), flush with life and his expanded role in the trilogy. Or he could be speaking of his newfound dominion over the Flying Dutchman and its squid-faced captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), whose excavated heart is now in Beckett's possession. This third and perhaps final episode in the swishy, swashbuckling saga goes some way toward achieving that goal. The cannibals, coconuts and landlocked locations have been replaced by the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. And the palpable relief as the myriad plotlines rush toward some semblance of resolution has made everyone quite giddy; even our passion-deferred lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), appear marginally less bored with each other. Or at least less bored than we are with them. Filmed sequentially with its predecessor, ""At World's End"" is less concerned with ends than inversions, presenting a society where the lawless practice democracy and their rulers engage in tyranny. The crown has declared a state of emergency, civil rights have been suspended, and naysayers are lined up to be hanged. But what of Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow? Following his unfortunate encounter with a giant cephalopod at the end of the last movie, this one finds him trapped and hallucinating in Davy Jones's Locker, an arid limbo of rolling dunes and raging heat. Because he is Jack, Because of the abundance of unpleasant human characters, all of whom lie, cheat and betray one another at the drop of a flounder, the burden of creating an emotional connection with the audience must be borne, ironically, by characters whose humanity has long since evaporated. From the pathos of Davy - still playing the organ like an invertebrate Phantom of the Opera - to the tragic yearning in the barnacle-encrusted face of Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" reminds us that great acting can transcend even the most elaborate makeup.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I feel like I had a full frontal lobotomy after seeing this movie. I was nearly brought to tears by this film. Not from emotion, I don't think there's an actor in the film who could elicit that, but from how much money must have been spent on this travesty.From the ridiculous opening scene with the dubbed over song, to the utterly pointless end battle, this movie had more in common with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas than Pirates of the Caribbean. In fact, I've probably seen people on acid make more sense. Getting married in the middle of a battle? WHAT THE HELL?!?! And speak more clearly. The combination of mumbling and accents in this movie was a blessing in disguise to spare us from more trite and terrible dialog. Now put that to cannon fire and you have a truly unintelligible 3 hours of spoken line. And speaking of cannons, do they have any effect in this universe? 3 films, roughly 7 hours of film, each containing firefights and not one ship sinks, not one character apparently dies, from cannon fire! Until the very end, when it happens in about 2 seconds. I can't even form a coherent thought on this movie, that's how bad it, and the effect it had on me is. This is simply the worst movie I've seen since Ultraviolet. I wish there was a rating worse than 1 star.I firmly believe that with the exception of Lord of the Rings, and possibly X-Men, the 21st century is destroying trilogies and sequels as we know them. Pirates, Star Wars, Spiderman 3, The Matrix, all gone to hell. I only pray that the Bourne Ultimatum is spared.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

I couldn't wait to see it, and then when I entered the theater I was so happy. This movie is really good, despite some cheesy effects, and some mistakes. The storyline and everything is great, but if you are a very observant you can notice some flaws. This film is nice if you are a huge Pirates fan like me and has plenty to die for. Some particular parts of the storyline are boring, such as Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' Locker. It gets boring and takes so long to finally be done and you think how you ever survived that. But some other parts such as action and battle scenes are great, and Disney has always been known to be superior in that area. But in a nutshell, this movie is good, but if you notice the flaws, you may be disappointed.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And most movies, especially the big ones, tend to lean to the latter. They don't dare. They give you what you expect (and, in effect, thus always less). Most movies play it safe. 'At World's End,' on the other hand, doesn't. It dares. And in a big way too. In that respect it's just like it's two predecessors, where the constant charting of a new course was the order of the day  and in all respects  be it acting-wise, staging, plotting, what have you.  So, is this closing chapter of (this particular) trilogy a perfect film? Most likely not. Some of what's happening is beyond me, some seems missing on occasion, some too much. But, you know, that's just fine. To wind up at a dead-end or two (before picking up steam again) is what happens when you go where no one has gone before. And this particular journey is always fun. I cannot remember a movie where every  and I mean literally every  new frame holds a surprise, brings a new turn of events, offers up a new world. So some of it doesn't stick. Some doesn't work. Who cares? These are pirates for crying out loud! If they don't dare who would?  And the unpredictability of the characters featured in these tales is exactly the kind of unpredictability the artists make perfect use off in telling them. Here's form following function for you! To think now that this would entail just mere childish playing around, as some critics have suggested, would in my view be to seriously underestimate the cleverness (and the prowess!!) of those at the helm  be they the producers, the director or, in particular, the writers. They know their game, the stories of sea-faring men of yore, the tales told below deck, of the end of the world, where dragons live, of men who lose their hearts (and souls) to the sea, where the heaving of a hidden treasure might just bring about the resurrection of ones soul. Myths all of them are, sure. Just like Jack, Will, Liz, Davy and the lot of them  neither one of them really alive nor (for ever) dead. Present they may be but not tangible. To me, that's magic in it's purest form. Rarely have I been so entertained. Rarely have the years of my life been pealed off so perfectly back to the time when the world seemed endless to me, and full of adventure. When everything I could dream of was possible, at least in my mind. When I dared, too  even (or especially) if the sword I was fighting foes with was as imaginary as they were. If you're up for a trip into another world  and a trip in more ways then just one, this is the ticket to buy. That's if you dare.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This one in a way reminds you og the first movie in that it remains exciting from start to finish and never misses a beat. I loved that Barbossa returned at the end of the second movie and was a huge part of this one because I felt he was the epitome of a pirate (no offense to Jack Sparrow) as he was barking orders fighting muliple enemies i thought that only he came close to Davey Jones (in the climatic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flyind Dutchman in the whirlpool, which i thought was the best idea for a climax overall, as the two ships are descending into the whirlpool Barbossa says ""It would be far too late for us to alter course now maetys!"" and then laughs his trademark laugh to me summed up the movie in all). Only thing that I thought was a drag was the concept of Davey Jones LOcker as it was just an isolated island instead of a heavily guarded prison which was guarded by dead pirates or possibly Davey Jones himself (before I saw this movie that confused me how the Locker was some far off place and yet Davey Jones sailed around the seas forver). one thing that tripped me out the first time I saw it was when Beckett had Royal Navy soldiers stationed on the Flying Dutchman and the thought of soldiers on the same ship as the undead or ""fishpeople"" as one soldier in the movie implied (i still get a laugh out of that scene when the troops first arrive on the ship and one soldier trembles at the sight of Davey Jones' crew and Norrington walks up to him and says ""Easy now!""- how can you possibly remain calm when you're standing next to something that's not human). But overall I thought all of the chatacters did a good job except for Will (he complained too much and tried to be too much like Jack, in my opinion instead of Jones killing him I thought someone should have made him walk the plank because no one needed him for anything, Elizabeth didn't even need him!) and Gibbs (who I though went out like Jack's flunky), I thought it was funny how the Governor died as he was sailing to the LOcker as the crew was sailing from it, Norrington as well as he tried to be a semi-hero (too bad he was on the wrong ship!) and Jones got bad break by getting killed which was unfortunate since he was the villain.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The last time I waited in this much anticipation I was treated to a Muppet fest in RoTJ. Not this time. I have read some comparisons to the opening of RoTJ and this film and I have to say anyone making that connection is totally daffy! The film is daring in the opening scene before the title and continues forward with a great action packed introduction.The wait was worth it. The film is darker than the previous films and lighter at the same time. It does a great job of throwing you an emotional fastball and then the next minute you get a lighter curve ball. I loved how Jack's sanity or lack of it, is explained and shown. The effects are beyond anything that has come out this year. At times you can't help but wonder if what you are seeing is practical or special effect.There are a few story elements that are not followed through with, such as the calling by the pirate brotherhood of a certain ""beasty"" which in the end really never seems to play out just right. But in the end, you don't really care. These characters that we have grown to love are in full on action and it is great to see.Stay around for the final scene that is shown at the end of the credits, unlike the previous two films that had more or less throwaway scenes at the end, this go around we are given a substantial final gift.This is definitely a multiple viewing movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Thankfully, such a potential conflict was tastefully avoided for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. In a year fraught with third parts, At World's End, the culminating part of the pirates trilogy makes its mark as one of the few final installments to live up to the vivacity and spirit of its predecessors while still distinctly different enough to for the most part not feel overly familiar or formulaic.As consequence of attempting to do something different enough with the series to keep things interesting but still stay true to the hard won Pirates spirit, At World's End comes across as a hodgepodge of lofty faux-mythology and a slightly darker but still spirited adventure romp. As such, the film's convoluted plot is admittably difficult to follow, but one has to give director Gore Verbinski credit for not dumbing down or rushing his film. Instead, Verbinski takes his time, producing a sprawling epic of an adventure film, with a distinctly different feel than the other two Pirates films, while retaining their charming sense of fun throughout enough to make it easy to forget the occasionally over complicated and lofty plot. Similarly, the film benefits enormously from its astonishing presentation: the stunning costumes, sets and props, as well as some of the most spectacular and elaborate visual effects ever boasted on film (the final showdown sequence is a jaw-dropper) as well as Hans Zimmer's rousing, dramatic score make for such an enormously powerful exterior it is easy to overlook the occasionally confusing storyline and sit immersed in one of the most flooring adventure epics in recent memory. The film is reminiscent of the days of classic Hollywood epics, when a film could drift and dabble about for a bit without being chastised by audiences with shortened attention spans, (Peter Jackson's King Kong remake also fell prey to similar complaints) and no scene is distinctly without purpose. Sure the Singapore sequence and surreal, Kafka-esq hallucination sequence in Davy Jones' locker (one of the most bizarre and memorable depictions of the afterlife, and its inclusion into a mainstream blockbuster is a daring and laudable choice) may not be entirely necessary in terms of furthering the plot, but they sure are tremendously fun, enough so to justify their presence. What does slow the film down are the often overkill and unnecessary inside jokes and references to the first two films - comic double-act Ragetti and Pintel are given far too much screen time to crack the same, increasingly unfunny jokes over and over, and did those two bumbling soldiers from the first film really need to be brought back? The exclusion of such moments could easily trim a good 10 minutes off the lengthy running time, a blessing indeed. However, to the film's credit, such complaints are few, and the extensive story is tied up neatly with surprisingly few plot holes and lapses in continuity for a trilogy which ambitiously covered so much storytelling ground. Despite the film being the third outing for the stellar cast, instead of simply coasting along, they all attack their roles with the same charisma and conviction as the prior two outings. Johnny Depp is just as eccentric, endearing and endlessly charismatic as the now iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, breathing genuine life into the character instead of lapsing into a parody of himself. Orlando Bloom is given more of a chance to expand his undeniably unlimited dramatic range, as his charming Will Turner drifts more into deception and betrayal. Keira Knightley retains her trademark spunky energy yet classical poise as the now seafaring Elizabeth, carrying one of the sole female roles with charisma aplenty. The scene stealing Geoffrey Rush, as a reincarnated Captain Barbossa shows just as much relish in energetically chomping the scenery as ever, as does the enormously talented Bill Nighy, once again outshining the astonishing CGI covering him in tentacles and breathing genuine menace and haunting sadness into his tremendously memorable Davy Jones. Chow Yun-Fat is entertainingly menacing, if sometimes incomprehensible as feared Singapore pirate Sao Feng, and the suitably icy Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård as Will's undead father and the tremendously watchable Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma (whose character resolution leaves something to be desired) all reprise their roles to tremendous effect. Instead of simply cutting out the characters of Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's harried father and Jack Davenport as the flawed but noble James Norrington, they are each given one last moment to shine - a classy storytelling touch. And the much hyped Keith Richards (Depp's inspiration for the Jack Sparrow character) cameo is carried out in a far more straightforward and effective fashion than one would anticipate, without the comedic glee of the moment being tampered with. While the film may not quite match up to the uniform excellence of the first, it drifts so tantalizingly close that one is inclined to wish that Verbinski and his creative crew could have ironed out the very few unnecessary bits or lapses in credibility and emerge with a more streamlined adventure escapade. As it is, At World's End still makes its mark as astonishingly strong for a third installment.

Big sound big images, big action, and larger than life characters.This film picks up where Dead Man's Chest left off, with the Crew of the Black Pearl looking to find Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp), and return him to the land of the living, from Davey Jones Locker. The story is convoluted, and a bit confusing. Some of the performances are wooden (Bloom), but this film is much more than just the sum of its parts. It features some of the most stunning visual effects I have ever seen. It blends comedy with action, and it succeeds in bringing to a close the events of all three films.This movie is purely about entertainment, outside of perhaps costume and effects, it is not going to be a ""darling of the Academy"". Outside of Depp and Rush, few of the performances are that memorable, but the overall effectiveness of this movie lies in its ability to keep you transfixed on the screen even when you are not entirely sure what is going on. The film makers drew the story to a conclusion that left me satisfied despite the fact that it was not the ending I had hopped for, or expected, perhaps this added to the film for me in the end, as it is always nice to be surprised.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow is the character who make Pirates of the Caribbean so good. I totally love Jack Sparrow. Ever since the first time I saw him in the second movie, ""Dead mans chest"", I fell in love with his personality. Jack Sparrow, the slightly deranged person with that immovable self-confidence, making an excellent foundation for extremely funny scenes. You just gotta love him.That is why I didn't like ""At Worlds End"". The Jack Sparrow being depicted in it isn't the Jack Sparrow I know. Instead of being that so utterly cool person, ""he's"" now just weird and, quite frankly, scary - in a bad way. Sure, there are some brilliant ideas being presented in ""At Worlds End"" with Jack Sparrow, but the scenes in which they are in always tend to be unsatisfying in the end. It's like they're trying to build up something unbelievably funny and add more and more strangeness to the scene, and in the end it really wasn't anything more than just that - strange - resulting in a big ""meh?"".And it's just not Jack Sparrow, there are more things. For example, when it came to all the ""grandiose"" scenes, and when all that powerful music started setting in, it didn't feel right. The music being played wasn't coherent with what I felt about that being displayed on the screen. Instead of being exciting and all that, it was just silly.There were some good and funny things about this movie here and there, but they were far from frequent enough to weigh up the overall poorness of it. One can only hope that Jack Sparrow will return in yet another movie, to set things right.","20 out of 43 found this helpful.

In fact, this movie actually has more plot development and character interaction than it does action sequences, which don't disappoint. The movie takes a turn by adding in surrealism, using Jack Sparrow and his world-famous Jackanisms en masse to add another dimension and edge to the way the plot develops, and also are used to show another side of his nature as a character. The acting, particularly on the part of Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, is impeccable, and finally, the minor characters who everyone loves get their moments to shine.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The special effects, choreography, costume and music were, as with all the three films, stunning and make the film ever so believable.I am so happy that the third instalment remained visually consistent with the first two, which is undeniably due to Gore Verbinski's astounding directorial skills, and also due to the crew and actors. Johnny Depp is as witty and clever as ever, while Kiera Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy and Geoffrey Rush support each other in a winning combination! Newcomer, Naomi Harris is a credit to Britains pool of new talent! I agree that the ending is a little less 'Disney' than expected, but can we really expect everything to be sweet and happy? The ending as it is, is fun and although it doesn't bring complete closure to the lives of all the characters, the short sequence after the end credits does allow the audience some sort of 'peace of mind'. So make sure you stay until the credits have ended for this little snippet! The film is astonishing, and worth waiting a year since 'Dead Mans Chest'.

"9","/10","A Nutshell Review: At World's End","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1661302/?ref_=tt_urv","DICK STEEL","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0317399/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2007","First things first, you must stay until the end of credits for a scene which truly ends the movie proper, in a bittersweet manner, full of love and fulfilled promises, especially after you've experienced the double, triple, quadruple crossings in Pirates 2 which carried over onto this final chapter.I can't help but compare this trilogy to that of the Wachowski Brother's Matrix movies, only in the way the two sequels are presented in structure. Like Reloaded, Pirates Dead Man's Chest introduced new depth into the established mythos of the standalone original, which made some folks wonder why as they got confused with new characters, new motivations, and plenty of mumbo jumbo. Making things worse, it ended with a cliffhanger of supposed death (you don't really think they'd kill him off do you?) leading directly into the events of the concluding part three.Like Revolutions, Pirates At World's End wastes no time and dives right into the rescue mission to save the (audience's) beloved Jack Sparrow (come to think of it, the original Star Wars trilogy is like that too, but I digress), who is stuck in a similar limbo where nothing works. And there are plenty of scenes in this movie which played on Depp's character popularity, which made you wonder just what the point is, if not just to elicit some cheap laughs which sometimes don't work.And with the much touted, expensive sets of Singapore, you wonder what's the point too. During Pirates Dead Man's Chest, there was a teaser of sorts about Singapore being a locale in the Pirates mythos, after being mentioned a number of times in the franchise thus far. And the hype continued with news about the sets, and the casting coup of Chow Yun-Fat as a pirate from Singapore. OK, some historical liberties were taken, but when presented, it really was much ado about nothing. You get to see sets (artificially done of course), not locales, and much of it is at night, so ""Singapore"" was relegated to what can be deemed like a bad backlot set with poor lighting. Lasting 20 minutes, and given you can't see much, made you yearn for the pirates to hit the high seas, pronto!As much as Singapore the locale was wasted, Chow was wasted too, having being the last minute merovingian-like character added to the concluding trilogy whose value is only a map, some men, and a junk. But the lucky bastard got to snog Keira Knightley and I'm jealous. Anyway the shady wheelings and dealings continue, between characters, and with the switching of allegiances which you'll come close to losing, almost. It's like a movie version of Survivor, and the best way to survive this is to think through and focus, while you're watching, the individual character motivation and their objective, which brings on some working of the noodle fun.Where we last left our jolly crew, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is gone, and the relationship between Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is on the rocks because the latter was caught snogging Sparrow by the former, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is brought back to life, while Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is collaborating with the East India Company, much against his wishes, assisting them in making all pirates see the end of days. Holding the key to save Jack is Chow's Captain Sao Feng of Singapore, as new alliances, betrayals and businesses are formed.Fans of either Bloom or Depp will find their idols absent for significant portions during the movie's first half especially, while the spotlight is set on Knightley, and the introduction of new elements in the Pirate's lore, law and the theme of love. In particular, this movie contrasts quite clearly the love between Turner and Swann, and that of Davy Jones and his, though there are cringeworthy moments in the former's, especially during the climatic battle hinted at in the trailers. Fatherly love too was touched upon briefly for all our 3 main characters, with the highlight on Keith Richard's short appearance as Sparrow senior, which clearly felt like it's added and created just for him.The action bits were great, and though there are adequate fight scenes in between the calm scheming of the high seas, nothing beats the climatic fight at the end where everything comes together and issues get resolved with violence. There are times though that you wonder just how much damage the ships like the Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman can sustain, with so much splinters and chunks of wood flying, before they sink. And like all climatic fights in ending trilogy chapters, At World's End fell back to formulaic rousing of the troops scene with cheesy dialogue, but perhaps for the better, forgotten about all the others in spite of the scale prepared. The CGI was undeniably effective in making the battle work, with fights on a number of fronts properly done to keep the adrenaline high.Pirates 3 is an intertwined sequel which I think you'll either love or hate depending on how you reacted to Pirates 2. For me, I'm swashbuckling towards liking it. It's not without flaws, but definitely one of the better two-part movies around - I guess the scriptwriters must had racked their brains with so much going on in so little time, and pulling it off actually. A satisfying conclusion.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

And it was everything I'd hope for a third movie to be.Continuing from where we left off in ""Dead Man's Crest"". Elizabeth, Will, (newly revived)Barbosa, and the rest of the crew. Travel to Sangapore to obtain a sea chart which has the location of the World's End. The place where Jack Sparrow & the Black Pearl were sent to by Davy Jones.Meanwhile the Navy has made preparations in eliminating all of the pirates to once and for all end the Piracy Era. Davy Jones seeks to reclaim his heart that's now in the hands of the Caribbean government. The Flying Dutchman and the Navy made a deal by teaming up to exterminate the remaining pirates at sea. Davy Jones agreed to do so because they threaten to destroy his heart if he'd disobeyed.It's all a fight to the finish as both sides will soon battle to see who rules the 7 seas.I really enjoyed this one a lot. As it features much more than you'd expect from the previous 2 installments. Everything that was unsolved in the second one is resolved in this one. Despite it having excellent special effects and a well done job on the locations. I liked how unique the flow of the story is. And I talking about how all the action and comedy work so well together to make it entertaining. That and there weren't many obvious parts which is good. Movies with unexpected parts makes watching it enjoyable.Besides some monologuing scenes, there's plenty of excellent moments to enjoy while viewing it. And the climax ending is unexpected and well thought up. Plus this movie has so few openings that could lead to a 4th installment.Ignore those who have negative thoughts on this one. If you liked the previous one, I guaranteed that this one is as much of a classic as the first 2. I know so, cause I'm going to see it a second time and looking forward to owning it on DVD.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Chow yun-fat came out earlier than expected.. right at the start of the film (and left early, for that matter), the octopus guy.. Davy Jones.. man, i still don't get how they do his tentacles.. Orlando Bloom... he looks better with white hair (LOTR) haha.. well.. he looked better at the end of the movie where he wore a bandanna.. haha.. and Keira is too skinny and boyish.. hmph..The story plots is intertwined in such a complete mess, and yet i can't find any plot holes (or maybe i was too busy watching all the action i didn't have time to think of any).. it's not like any of those easier to watch adventure films like tomb raider, with only one storyline.. it goes back and forth, without the need of flashbacks! Amazing editing.. i wouldn't know how to edit the whole thing if i was given all that footage.. Just... really worth the price! even if they add HK$15 to the tickets!!! Better than spiderman 3 for sure..","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The whole series has built up into one massive finale of a battle which is the best battle scenes i have ever seen.The storyline is brilliant and many different unsolved clues are slowly unravelled throughout the film and the acting was top notch especially from jack sparrow and barbossa who i missed from the 2nd film. Also Keith Richards cameo was greatly act out.The special effects in this film are absolutely unbelievably realistic and the film has so much action and sword fighting which keeps you in-locked into the film and the fight scenes were so brilliantly choreographed.Also the locations and sets were made brilliantly.What made this film so good was its ability to make it not drag despite its lengthy 168mins and the film felt so quick.A wonderful finale to the film, it couldn't have played any better and i will miss the pirates but there is hope for a 4th as their could be a clue if you watch until after the end credits.I could go on and on about how good this film was - it was the superb 10/10 unmissable","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Zodiac was far more complex and violent, but did that get a hard time? no chance.No, the critics are about as lenient on this film as Have I Got News For You with a guest presenter in the news that week.It seems that the reviews have rallied against the film, which is a shame as i feel much different to these:For one the 'confusing' aspect is as confusing as a ball on the ground with instructions laid out next to it which go through the method of kicking it step by step over 50 sections, each with pictures. They tell you half of it and let you understand the rest for yourself, they do the same in indie films and the critics call it ambiguous, but if they leave it all on a plate, the critics will say it's force feeding you, so they can shut up.Too violent? Bah, the nastiest moment in the trilogy remains the eyeball pecking out at the start of 2, with Crook's fork fortune a close second, i hate eye injuries. When they said too violent forgive me for thinking it'd be 300 on the sea.The cast are weak? I'm sorry if you find the fact that they have settled into the characters so perfectly that everything they do in real life is more like these characters, but they are far from weak.Depp saves it? I admit, yet again Depp is fantastic and hilarious, and lots of other words, one for each time he appears on screen thrice, or even 10 times at once, but it's 'saved' by the script, the effects, the direction, the plot and the characters mincing together for lots of fun.What was wrong with this movie oh dear Ethan our lord and saviour? Some moments were a tad too slow, the endings were almost outnumbering a certain trilogy to do with rings, and it wasn't a porno, i didn't see that final one, but i'm sure the money shot isn't occurring 50 times within 10 minutes, no one is that, Er, i shan't think of a word there.It's a sad day when a fantastic blockbuster like Pirates is hated as much as a Shrek film, but i guess some peoples tastes don't respect the work of a fine film such as this.And at least the film gets the graphics bearing better than number 2, and with the 100 odd digital artists in the credits it's no surprise, and i predict it'll go down well at the Oscars next year once again, and much more deserving too, with the crew of the Flying Dutchman looking much better.The score is as jauntily fun and epic at the same time, with some nice new music amidst the old classics, 'He's a Pirate' over the start of the end credits adds to the epic-ness, and Sparrow's music keeps getting lighter as the film gets darker.The film looks beautiful, the Carribbean is amazing in itself, but fix the white sands and blue water with the quality of camera-work, a scene with Lord Becket fighting the pearl with him walking as chaos ensues, is a true marvel, and i presume got the shutter speed technique and improved it from Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator, you know when the blood goes everywhere in slow mo and looks amazing, that thing Nighy's presence once again helps add a cool effect to the air, as does a sadly brief section once again with Jonathon Pryce, he's too good for the small amount of work he does in these films, and Jack Davenport, which his role was expanded slightly from 1 and 2.OK, there's no big comic action sequence in this one, no water wheel, cannibal island, and the film is a lot more darker, but credit to Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and Lee Arenburg for keeping the film light and having great chemistry with themselves and others, and also to Jack the monkey and Cotton's Parrot, great scenes involving them, shame we didn't get to see if they wanted the heart, and if they wished to double cross everyone and steal the Pearl.It's a long, but ultimately fun, funny, fresh and interesting approach to the saga, and as sure as it's the most forgettable one, and the scene after the credits isn't funny, rather just a plot point in itself, i'd argue it has some of the great action moments, some of the best comic moments, and some of the highest main character body counts in an ongoing series, even if they keep coming back to life anyway. 10/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It has the comedy, the action, the story, and most of all: the answers. While the first one was a stand alone classic by all means the second one lacked just a little bit, but was very very good by all means. Unfortunately a lot of movie series nowadays fall in a slump with the 2nd and 3rd movies (when they are intending a 3 part story) because the second movie doesn't expand as much story-wise and makes up for it in action. This is obvious with dead man's chest, however it sets up the third movie nicely, which is something other middle men in the series seems to lack, greatly. dead man's chest left enough mystery and story so that the finale is a grand finale not a quiet whimper (like the matrix, don't get me wrong i loved it, it just shouldn't have been done the way it was).Every character remains true to their nature since the first movie and their growth is remarkable. Especially the main core...will, liz and jack. A lot of the reviews i read talked about how confusing the plot was and how it jumped around because it wasn't making any sense. I honestly don't see how it was like that. There was some confusion and twists and turns but just sit back and enjoy the movie, it adds suspense and keeps you entertained. These are family-esquire movies that aren't going to twist and turn your brain with philosophical theories, they are going to explain everything and wrap it up in a nice shiny package and that is exactly what was done. The action, the music, the cinematography and the effects were phenomenal. I personally put spider-man 3 above this one in terms of anticipation but it simply blew it away. Everything that 3peats seem to fail at is virtually nonexistent in these films, the writing was top notch, and the direction was superb. I have very few complaints about this movie, maybe even just one. but its a personal thought as a writer so ill keep to myself and not waste time with personal garbage that other comments might blab on about. i cannot stress enough of brilliantly this product was created. it stands on the same mountain as the lord of the rings trilogy as far as complete excellence. not a single bit of these three movies as a whole falters enough to create a deficit the other movies try too hard to redeem while losing their touch as well.George Lucas said not too long ago that the summer blockbuster idea is going out the window and movie studios won't put the money out for big budgeted movies in the coming future. I think with the success of this movie and with spidey he was dead wrong. just as he was with the writing of the first 3 episodes, ha. people want quality and gore verbinski and jerry bruckheimer have delivered, as well as the entire cast. not a single character is lacking. period. So if you are a fan of the first two movies, you will love this one no doubt about it. It answers all the questions you have before and during the movie and leaves you a very, very satisfied movie goer. One last thing; Keith Richards' role was just icing on this layer cake of excellence. DO NOT MISS THIS.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With the previous two incredibly successful installments, Disney has found themselves with a surprise hit series in Pirates of the Caribbean. The second film is the second highest-opening movie of all time, right beside Spider-Man 3, and the first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, held surprisingly solid DVD sales. With the third installment, At World's End, Disney has made another perfect film with very few flaws that is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best film Disney has ever put out. For a sequel, At World's End actually has quite a story to tell, filled to the brim with bulky subplots and interesting characters. This installment manages to rise above the other big blockbuster sequels like Spider-Man 3 and Shrek the Third by utilizing a great cast, sensational acting, and an always-interesting plot. One may go so far as to say that there wasn't a single dull moment in the entirety of the film's 2 hour and 50 minute runtime. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy return once more for this final installment, joined by Chow Yun-Fat in a memorable role as the pirate Captain Sao Feng of Singapore. The third installment is once again directed by Gore Verbinski, who crafted the previous two installments into incredibly memorable blockbuster films with breathtaking cinematography. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean has always been the most important part of the series. Without the plot, the movies would be merely uninteresting and boring, especially considering their length. At World's End sees Elizabeth Swan, Will Turner, Captain Barbosa, and company on a journey to fetch back Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. Everything leads to a meeting of the Pirate Brethren at Shipwreck Cove, an epic battle concerning several ships, and the closure of many major plot lines. Keira Knightley takes center stage in this installment, and she never ceases to amaze with her excellent acting. Johnny Depp also has lots of screen time, and he is fantastic as usual in his role as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom takes on Will Turner with a somewhat darker perspective this time around, and it reflects the overall darker tone of At World's End. Chow Yun-Fat plays Captain Sao Feng with creepy sincerity, and he brings life to the character with his zany accent and attitude. At World's End starts off on a serious note with the creepy but catchy song ""Hoist the Colours"", and it fits with the most insanely sinister installment yet. Some of the scenes in At World's End are extremely creepy, but, as always, the film has a great sense of humor, mostly displayed through Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa. So much is going on at one time in the movie that it is easy to get lost, and it may take several viewings of the film to truly understand everything. The length of the movie never seems too long for all that you get out of it, and the pacing is nearly flawless. The movie starts off a little bit slow, but once Jack Sparrow comes in, the movie really gets off its feet. There is also a crucial scene after the credits of the movie, and it is definitely worth sitting through. Also keeping with the other films, At World's End features breathtaking cinematography and a much darker tone than the others. If you can only see one big blockbuster hit this summer, see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End; it's full of action, frightening situations, well-written characters, and more story than anyone can imagine. It is certainly the best among the three big 'May' movies, Shrek the Third and Spider-Man 3. Unlike the other two films, At World's End was not disappointing on any level; it delivered in every category, and then some. The great acting and the new characters also contribute to making this the best installment yet, and the greatest big blockbuster movie of the entire year, and many years past.

Picking up from where the story left of in Dead Man's Chest with the surprise ending we find our hardy crew being led to the end of the globe by Captin Barbossa (my enemy's enemy is my friend)to bring back our rather eccentric anti-hero Capt Jack Sapparow with the looming threat of Davy Jones and the East India company. We dive straight into the action and it is a non-stop roller coaster ride. While I felt that the first one was a little slow and the second one was little too long in places I was glad to say that this one had a steady pace and the film moved along rather nicely. The acting was top notch and I felt this movie belonged to Geoff Rush and Orlando Bloom and the special affects were again nothing short of fantastic especially the climatic battle at the end. There were a few questions left unanswered about the movie and I also felt that Chow Yun-Fat should been given a bigger part to play but he was good along with the other foreign pirates from around the globe. To conclude At world's end is a great way to finish of the POTC saga with thrills , spills and laughter (not as much as the first two movies but it is still there). I made a comment during the first movie which was that I felt I was a little to old of Pirates ! I'LL TAKE THAT COMMENT BACK!

I still stand by my criticisms, but most of them, especially the running time and pacing, didn't distract me nearly as much as the first time around.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Somebody asked me for a one-word review of Pirates 3. The problem is, I can't really do that. Because if I absolutely had to, that word would be ""bloated."" But accurate as it is, it's way too negative. I liked the movie - I really did; and I think I'll like it even more upon a second viewing, when I can better digest and follow everything. There are some amazing sequences in it, and a lot of very creative ideas and writing - not to mention the perfect ensemble cast continues to put in remarkable performances.But like so many sequels, including its predecessor Dead Man's Chest, the movie is a little full of itself. Whereas the first film was just a fun adventure flick which had no expectations, this one is far to aware of its epic status. Every scene is drawn out as if to say ""look at this amazing sequence we thought up"" and "" check out the awesome special effects!"" As a result, you have a great 2-hour movie, stretched out over 2 hours and 45 minutes. I don't mind long movies at all, as long as they need to be that long and are not just over-extending scenes unnecessarily.I also think their efforts at making this an epic story have taken a lot of the heart out of the series. With each movie, more and more of the simple fun disappeared. Yes, there are comedic moments, but overall it's just lost a little something. I really wish they would just make sequels as stand-alone films, a la Indiana Jones, Die Hard, James Bond, etc, instead of trying to create these multi-film stories like Pirates and Matrix. I just think stand-alone stories feel fresher, more fun, and more enjoyable.The only other flaw is actually just a case of taking a good idea too far. The filmmakers have talked about how in the world of pirates, allegiances are constantly in flux and in question, which leads to a lot of betrayal and suspicion. But here they have so many people changing sides so often and making and breaking deals left and right, to the point where it's just so confusing you stop even trying to follow it. Maybe that confusion is what they were going for, but it really got to be too much after a while.So, yes, I do feel ""bloated"" is a good word to describe the film, but it's still an immensely enjoyable flick, and far better then 95% of the movies that wil come out this year.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The two of them play their characters so well off of each other. If any more Pirates sequels are made I'll be very disappointed if Barbossa isn't back.Unlike with COTBP, I find the final battle scenes still interesting after repeated viewings and though there are a few areas in the movie that I would have shortened, for me this movie went by very fast.However, it really bemuses me that people had such a difficult time with this movie. Is it because people today are spoon fed everything? Is it because they no longer can use their own imaginations to fill in the blanks? Is it because some people have the attention span of a gnat? I had no trouble understanding the movie the first time I watched it and I enjoyed it very much (unlike DMC which for me was only enjoyable in the last 40 mins.) The subsequent viewings of AWE have allowed me to enjoy many details and underlying currents. I like the fact that it doesn't have a pat Disney ending. I like the fact that it makes one discuss and think of possibilities.""At World's End"" was never meant to be a movie like, say ""Transformers,"" so I guess people going into it expecting mindless special effects with no need to pay attention to dialogue and visual clues will never like this movie.

I saw it three times in the Theaters .. And now i own it on DVD , and i saw it last night ... And i was thinking (not for the first time but yeah ... :p )... OMG i want to see more...! I think people who give this movie less than 7 or 6 are people who don't sit back and enjoy... If you see this movie more than one time, you can glue the pieces together and you get a well and nice story. I think that this story need to be continued! I'm just wondering how the voyage of Jack will be to the fountain of Youth and if he would get the Pearl back... What is wills job and is the curse broken after ten years? All those questions need to be answerd i think... So i hope that their will be a new story(a new movie).By The Way, this story was Awesome ... i think they made a beautiful end on Davy Jones and Calypso... Also great jokes in this movie and cool sentenses... like Now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that one before or others... ^^ ... It's just a great movie that need to be continued héhé ;) :D","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Screw Rotten Tomatoes and ""too many characters and complicated plot"" blah blah bull. If you can't follow the plot, go back to school. While I found Pirates 2 less than satisfactory, this is one of the best 3rd movies I've ever seen. It really pulls on your heart strings and makes you think about the movie long after it's over. While not everything about the movie is perfect, what movie is perfect anyway? There are some corny bits, but nothing you can't shrug off (not like Spiderman landing in front of the American flag in the 3rd; now that was just too much). The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (I went and bought it the day after I watched it). While the movie alone was great, the music was the cherry. Dramatic, majestic orchestrated pieces balanced with playful pieces for other scenes. The comedy in the 2nd movie felt forced, but in this one, it was more reminiscent of the first, which was more natural, smart, and even subtle at times. Nothing too laugh out loud funny (sorry, if that was what you were looking for). While some segments of the story and characters are left superficial and up to the audience's speculation, others are much more complex and really pull on those heart strings. This movie is much more dramatic than the first two, so if you're prone, you might even want to keep a tissue nearby. The special effects are outstanding. When the camera pans out and you can see landscapes and backgrounds, the scenes are absolutely breathtaking. It really helps to see it in the movie theater because of scenes like those (plus the music). Overall, this movie gets an A+ from me. All aspects of the movie come together beautifully: plot, characters, music, setting/scenery. Like I said, of course there are things that aren't perfect about it and could be done better. I can even think of how to do some of those things better (everyone can). The movie leaves you with a bittersweet feeling, but if it were any different, it wouldn't be as good.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

What happened to planing and direction - to the discussions between director and photographer that you see in documentaries all the time? Ignoring the highly complex plot, the stupid story line and everything else that was wrong with this movie - IT WAS UNWATCHABLE!! The filming really sucked!With a rating of 7.3 (at the time of this witting) I honestly suspect the bias of the IMDb rating system. Is there a security hole where the films makers can fudge the rating, or am I just out of touch? I mean, this movie cannot be enjoyed! It is impossible for normal human to follow the action sequences and know whats going on.If all new movies are going to be like this (several are), I would recommend cinemas hand out free eye-shades before people go in. You'll probably understand better if you can't see it.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Boy, was I not disappointed. Loved every,single second of it!!!! And came out hungry for more. Beautiful cinematography, directing, fantastic score and amazing acting from all the cast. Johnny Depp is of course superb, but can we expect anything less? Everything about it was fabulous. The only reason that I haven't given it a 10/10 is because the plot is confusing, but with all the excitement it really doesn't matter who's doing this or that. You can vaguely get the gist. A swashbuckling masterpiece. Can't wait to go and see it again. This film is the reason why going to the cinema is magical.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Places even it is unduly magnificent. Nigtley is beautiful and courageous. Orlando Bloom also is beautiful and not less brave. Veils looks good. Dzheffri Rush looks good doubly. Volume Chollander is aristocratical, cold and prudent. Bill Naji still finds in himself forces to play, not paying attention to the octopus sticked to the person. Actors are faultless. All of them are absolute on the places. A gigantomania  very dangerous piece. It is more, more dearly and more longly  does not mean better. Too many subject lines. It is too much characters. It is too much events. Too many magnificent stages. Too many impressing effects. Even for a picture going almost three hours. The third « Pirates of the Caribbean » have turned out gripping show: The present kaleidoscope with grandiose slaughter in the ending in which two greatest courts in history  « the Black pearl » and « the Flying Dutch », at last, will have a chance to find out who from them is greater. Over the screen dominate dark tone  grey and black. The storm is in the sea. It is raining. Treachery becomes norm in mutual relations. Many stages in a context of the trilogy look unexpectedly severe. Now here quite seriously kill people, including some heroes, grown fond to the spectator by the previous parts. But do not worry, the traditional piracy humour anywhere has not got to, maybe, became only hardly to more cynical. The ending at a picture too ambiguous, at least, absolute happy-end here also does not smell, but the history has turned out very beautiful. The main thing, that it leaves many opportunities for creation of continuation. So there are bases to believe, that we do not say goodbye to Jack.« Pirates of the Caribbean : at World's end is a film which needs to be looked. Imagine, that you are on board the ship, and the captain very much calls in a bell  there, behind horizon, on your ship begins approach the most picturesque, bewitching and unforgettable tsunami. Unless you refuse to look at it? The tsunami is this picture.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first instalment hugely, but the second had lost a bit of the dry humour that I loved about the first. But in this film, it's back. It's definitely better than than 'Dead Man's Chest' and, in my opinion, at least on a par with the original. Of course, a lot of the humour comes from Depp, but he didn't carry this film in the same way that he did in the second. I'm not a big fan of Keira Knightley's or Orlando Bloom's acting, but Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy more than compensated for their failings. There's a nice turn from Keith Richards as well.It takes a while to get going, and after about 45 minutes or so I had my reservations, but it picks up from there, and when it does get going, it doesn't stop. It features one of the best fight scenes I've seen, again with some of the humour that is characteristic of the trilogy. If I'm going to be really picky, I would say that the plot becomes a bit convoluted at times, but that's being very harsh.One of the things that's not mentioned enough about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It really wouldn't be quite the same with the famous dun-DUH-duh-duh-duh-duhnun etc etc. Full marks to the sound team for that! All in all, a film that's well worth going to see. Even if you haven't seen the first two, this one's still worth a look.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If not for Depp, and his always entertaining and fascinating character, and the lovely Keira Knightley this movie would be wholely miss-able. The first film was the only stand alone of the bunch you can watch that and be content at the conclusion though once you have begun the 2nd there is no choice but to sit through almost 6 hours of film to complete the story. The bizarre nature and confusion of this saga coupled with the fact that they leave so many parts open-ended so as to leave one wondering, ""Pirates 4?"" Foreshadowing and minor omissions also mar this film. Items that might otherwise come as a shock were ruined by glaring hints one can't help but miss while other aspects were left out completely leaving one to assume events took place that would seem fitting to show.Overall it is a long tale that will leave you with many questions of the trilogy wondering why they tried to do way to much with it, for it surely wasn't for lack of time (the whole series runs well over 7 and a half hours). If not for Depp and Keira this film was truly lost at sea. Bloom's persistent presence is another blemish on the film as his character, for another film in his life, is entirely hatable.","23 out of 54 found this helpful.

If you like a roller-coaster of fantastic action scenes, here and there some humor, and if you do not mind some unrealistic situations, its even a must to see.Big, bigger, biggest, thats how I feel the last movie in the Pirates of the Caribean trilogy can be best described. But biggest doesn't mean best. The main feeling that stays with me is a simple economic principle. The more money you spend, the more you should expect. Being one of the most expensive movies ever, it is also normal that all scenes are so special, and no effort was saved to use animations.The makers have tried to combine a lot of plot lines, but this does not really add value. The plot itself is traditional, and the acting itself is average. But at the end, would you expect something else? 168 minutes is this roller-coaster long. It could have done with 120. But imagine yourself going to a fun-park, you see this big big roller-coaster, of which you precise know what to expect (you have done so many before), would you still go on it? Off course! And thats what this movie is about. A big, expensive roller-coaster, which is difficult to resist.Because of the simple plot, definitely no 10/10, but because of the huge fun sitting on this roller-coaster, I give it an 8/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp was once again at his best as CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow and Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom deserve to be mentioned, their acting skills have come a long way since their break-out rolls. Another honourable mention would have to be Australia's very own Geoffrey Rush, he shined as Captain Barbossa and in my own personal opinion stole the whole movie. Bill Nighy was also wonderful as the heartless Davey Jones.The story is very strong and you can easily follow what was happening in the movie. The script is very quick witted and original and the mind blowing special effects just add to the brilliance of the film.I was very happy with the ending and I was glad that the ending for Jack Sparrow, left a possible opening for a fourth film.I say all in all Pirates 3 is the best yet in the trilogy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The effects were spectacular and fight scenes really good. The only drawback was the plot being a little bit too confusing but then again there were things that needed tying up from Dead Mans Chest so there wasn't much that could have been cut out. I think any fan of Pirates will enjoy this. Most people say it can't top the first one which is will never do. Curse of the Black Pearl was a film that came out of the blue and that is what made it so good in the first place because it was unexpected.

But ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", is the biggest let down I have ever seen. I kept waiting for ""POTC: At Worlds End"" to get better, but after the first hour went by I realized this wasn't going to happen and began to wait for it to end, but it seemed that also wasn't going to happen any time soon either as I looked at my watch more and more. The humour and heart put into the first two films is gone, replaced by jokes that are cheap and forced. The only time I genuinely laughed was when Keith Richards made his cameo appearance, but it was 130 minutes too late and then he had left the screen almost as soon as he entered it, as the next hour of extreme boredom began. Orlando Bloom seemed as bored as I was, and I don't blame him as his lines were beyond cringe worthy. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow was just a load of recycled crap which came off as annoying, not funny. Even though Johnny, to give him credit, tried to spice it up a little he failed. The movie also seemed to rely completely on CGI during some scenes in a attempt to distract the audience from the awful plot, plus the dialogue was terrible and very confusing, it seemed they were just making it up as they went along, cramming the movie with plot twists and characters becoming traitors for no apparent reason. A lot of the time I didn't even understand what the characters were saying, but I really didn't care.Overall this was a huge disappointment, and I strongly recommend you don't bother wasting three hours of your life watching this. It's a huge shame, as I once considered myself a ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" fan. This just goes to show three times is not the charm, 2/10","25 out of 60 found this helpful.

For me it just has everything. The story is a great conclusion to the trilogy (let's forget about 4 & 5). The CGI is absolutely unreal even with today's standards.What do I even say about the characters? Johnny Depp created one of the most iconic roles ever in Jack Sparrow, perfect in every way possible. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom's performances as Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner are extraordinary. Davy Jones and the crew on the Flying Dutchman are amazing villains alongside Lord Cutler Beckett. And let's not forget Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa. That complemented with some great side characters such as Gibbs, Pintel, Ragetti and Norrington.Hans Zimmer then topped it all off with maybe the greatest film score of all time making it the best movie I've ever seen. Obviously the nostalgia of growing up with this movie since I was 7 years old plays a part in why I like it so much but I have probably watched it a 100 times since and I just never get tired of it.I would give everything to experience this for the first time again and I would obviously recommend it to everyone. 10/10 no doubt about it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then I saw ""Dead Man's Chest"" and I was equally impressed by it. I actually liked mostly the settings that they filmed, hiding any sort of acting clique that might be revealed by actors. And what does Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End have? Best Depp performance, excellent cinematography, great music, great plot, and mostly: a return of humor that just wasn't there in the second movie. More Pirates than ever too. Although this is probably the darkest of all three, I feel like maybe a giant waterfall or a whirlpool didn't feel really cool in the trailers. Well, if you see it on screen, and with some talented ideas to make even a ""de ja vu"" seem awesome, that's what you're going to be surprised to see when you see this movie. I would really disagree wtih many reviewers that Jack's appearance in the movie is late. They said mainly ""1hr, 45 minutes"". That is definitely wrong. Plus, the ""scenes of insanity"" were actually the places where most of the humor was hidden. Having Jack crazier than ever is something that a sane person cannot resist but laugh. Only the too serious people wouldn't understand how unbelievably funny the insane things that Jack does are throughout the movie. It would be also wrong to say that there's a lot of ""we've seen that before"". There definitely isn't. In terms of humor. The producers pushed more and more humor into the story, and there's jokes for everyone; even historians that might find it funny how well the quarrels were made between the Singaporean Pirates and the Caribbean Pirates. Special effects were great too, and I thought that Davy Jones is just awesome. Mainly during the final battle. Remember when King Kong's battle with the V-Rex's was praised so well because of a ""cinematic wonder""? Well here you have cinematic wonder number two: the battle between all of the Davy Jones's crew. Another great thing is, that although in the first and second movies you had sort of an idea of ""who was on who's side"" (even though the two movies tried to make you confused"", in this one, you really don't. And that's the best part. I mean, who would ever think that will would end up as he did in the end? Who would think that Jack and Elizabeth were actually not so involved as you might think? Who might think that Calypso would make an appearance in the history? I generally didn't think Pirates of the Caribbean 3 would be much worth from the trailers. But I was really surprised how funny things can get, and how the long length can be enjoyed. Most people complained about Jack not being there for the first 30 minutes of the film and an opening sequence in Singapore. Well, that isn't entirely bad, because you might as well get to see something more than just the sea. My only complaints about this movie are three things. First, I think that the new pirate played by Cho-yun Fat is pretty much useless. Therefore, making the beginning sort of senseless (but that does not mean entirely useless since it's a cool beginning with a few laughs!). I think Chow-Yun Fat just didn't leave such an impression on me as Davy Jones had. About 2 years ago when I first heard about World's End, I remember in an interview that Chow Yun Fat would be described as a much worse Pirate than Davy Jones had ever been. Unfortunately Davy Jones still remains the crowned villain of the series. The second nit-pick is just that I was so drawn into the movie that I was sort of disturbed with a very emo speech of Elizabeth before the final battle. And it was just lame. It was better for her not to make any speech because when the Pirates were just staring at her talking no sense, I was just feeling like the director should have been banged on the head and forced to remember ""I'm not making a Hollywood movie!"" Another very small thing is that I was agreeing with some reviewers that some characters return for nearly no reason. I mean, the admiral is just pointless in the movie (especially one of the last moments you see him and Elizabeth together). Jack's father was just plain awesome.Overall, I think it was really pleasing. There isn't anything that you can probably go to right now, so if you already saw Spider-Man 3, go check out Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End for great entertainment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's always difficult to recreate the magic of something like the Curse of the Black Pearl but they mislaid the ingredients that gave it such charm.Instead they've gone overboard creating 'myths' and supernatural characters, which consequently appear very contrived. The 'normal world' characters now take the 'supernatural' ones as commonplace, hence, so does the viewer. The writers also cheat, by which I mean that they've changed the rules as they go along. It is very important in Fantasy/SF etc that the writer outlines the rules in which the world they portray operates, and then stick to it. As soon as you bring someone back from the dead, there is no meaning to anyone else dying since they can just be brought back again at any time. Likewise when a character gets into a spot of trouble we don't want to see the writers just invent a new rule/character/myth that gets them out of it.Maybe it's just too easy when they have a surefire hit on their hands - all they need to do is get a film released and the money will roll in, no matter what. Filling a film full of special effects, big names and scenes is a cop out when what is called for is a good story and script. Rather than invest so heavily in CGI and so much make up, the producers would do better to employ the best authors and writers that money can buy, it'd still be far cheaper. And the result would be immensely better. As it is, they've wasted the brilliant 'Jack Sparrow' character in an overlong muddle of SFX, manufactured myths and silliness.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It probably won't be for everyone because not everyone enjoys a movie that goes beyond being simple and to the point. I for one, truly enjoyed the turns and twists that take place throughout the movie.The way the movie was shot, you got to see more of characters you only got brief laughs with earlier on. I think that actually was my favorite part. And perhaps one of the major improvements from number 2, was the comedic moments breaking up moments that would be otherwise boring to people who were not fans of Pirates.All in all, the cast does an amazing job, and the ending is really beautiful. Pirates fans must see, but I believe if you had at least a good idea of the second movie, you'll really enjoy this film. By far one of the better ends to a trilogy in the past ten years for me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story, far from being ""too convoluted"", offers up both new intrigue and satisfying resolution: there are a few muddled moments, but nothing which lingers long enough to create a problem. The action is spectacular (completely and wonderfully over the top at times), and all the actors (expectedly with Rush and Depp, surprisingly with Bloom and Knightley) put in superb performances.

Johnny Depp brings his own brand of movie magic to the screen whenever he appears as Captain Jack Sparrow and I personally feel that he could have had more scenes in this movie. Although the movie makers did try to repair this travesty by using his many clones in certain scenes.All the other performances are good... Keira Knightley came to the fore in a more central role while Orlando Bloom was pushed slightly into the background which was a good thing in my opinion. Geoffrey also had a major role in this. I still feel that the Calypso/Davy Jones story arc was not really required. Wonderful little cameo from keith Richards the muse for the Sparrow characterisation.All in all a satisfying sequel with a slightly surprising ending but well worth the price of admission.I only have one complaint...bring back Captain Jack Sparrow/Johnny Depp for another movie without too many other characters to distract the audience from this amazing character.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is complex but entertaining, the visual effects are state-of-the-art, and the acting is...good. There's a bit of a sense that the actors are trying to get through with this and not pouring themselves into it heart and soul. The fight sequences also aren't quite as elaborate (except for one near the end, the context of which is very complicated) as in the first two movies, but you'll still be riveted to your seat. It's a little hard to keep up with some things, but overall I think you'll be very satisfied.Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is a little different in this movie. He's a touch more serious, and not as given to making playful eunuch jokes. I'm not sure I miss this, but the middle-schoolers probably will. Keira Knightley's character Elizabeth is more battle-hardened, but still carries some emotional baggage about having sacrificed Jack to the Kraken. It's something like Domino meets Pride & Prejudice. Orlando Bloom's Bill Turner actually plays second fiddle to Jack and Barbosa (I guess that makes him third fiddle), and speaking of Barbosa, Geoffrey Rush is possibly the most genuine actor on the set.I was struck by just how unique this trilogy really is. The dialog, the action sequences, the plot twists, the cinematography, the character development...it all adds up to a set of films unlike any other. I would say that it's worth the matinée price at any theater, but some people might not be willing to go to the later, more expensive showings. But I would.Oh yeah, and watch for Keith Richards.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Visuals were probably as impressive as this kind of movie allows. Music was good, though it shone less than in the previous movies.The real problem with the movie was the plot. It's not that it's convoluted and a bit hard to follow, as everybody is treacherous and switches sides every 5 minutes; this is a bad thing (because it prevents you from feeling identified with the characters and living the movie in first person), but not the worst. The problem with Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (and 2) is that the story writer was drunk and the story is utter trash. Too much fantasy. I was almost expecting Barbossa to turn to a dragon at some point. Every 15 minutes a new fantastic, magic, rule-breaking element is introduced. You simply give up on the story and watch a ""demo""  everything goes, everything happens, there are no rules, expressed or implied, that will guarantee one set of standards upon which you can understand what's going on and what's likely to happen or what's an accomplishment; there are no rules for this game. You don't care about the movie because you know something magic will happen that will turn things around. This is a very cheap plot, the kind children write at schools. If you're going to do fantasy, do it right: introduce a single element or a system of elements with certain rules, then work upon it. If you keep introducing trash, the story can go just anywhere without any justification, as in this movie.I couldn't feel involved in this movie and didn't care for the characters. So it felt like an average movie to me.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The acting was great again by those you would expect: Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, etc. But surprisingly Orlando Bloom showed real depth in this one compared to the other two (which seems strange since it was filmed along with Dead Man's Chest.) The visuals were great again, and the score moved the movie along at a nice pace. But what is most surprising in this movie are the writing and directing. There were still lots of laughs, but this movie is deadly serious at its core, and very trippy-art-house in the way many scenes were written and executed. It wasn't the just sit back and enjoy the ride type of experience that the first two were. Instead, you actually need to pay attention and think in this one. And sometimes what you will think is that maybe you took some hallucinogens before entering the theatre, because this can't really be a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. But it is.This is a great movie. But be warned that you are not going to see more of what you saw in the first two Pirates movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought it might be some kind of deal with IIIs. I was, however, surprised.The special effects were not only amazing, but smart. There was not a single moment when my suspension of disbelief was shattered because the CGI came off as waxy like in Spiderman III. The eye candy just melts perfectly into the story.The story part of the film felt smooth. Shrek III seemed clunky to me compared to the first two. Not so with this. A review I read yesterday on CNN or something said Pirates is all over the place, and it is. But it's a big ocean and these characters get around. I wasn't let down by where the story took me and in spite of my five-year-old curled up and snoring quietly in the seat next to me, it didn't feel long. I wanted wanted it to last.As things unfolded, I couldn't predict what we were going to see next and I had no desire to try. I didn't leave the theater thinking, ""Holy CRAP! That was incredible"" like I did after I saw The Departed. I wasn't expecting to. But I did exit the theater 1) Thinking a lot of the reviewers on this site have it wrong. 2) Hoping the studio just leaves it alone now *right!* or at least Depp says no.Keira Knightley is so nice to look at in this. This is one for the big screen.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's a lot of money – a lot of money down the drain, or should I say, the huge CGI whirlpool featured in Pirates 3 which serves virtually no purpose, apart from to amuse. But by now, we are not amused.I chose the word saga at the opening of this review for a reason. Because, collectively, the life-threateningly dull adventures of Gore Verbinski's characters has wasted 9 hours of my life. 9 hours I could of spent of doing anything else, watching repeats of 1980's sitcoms on unknown satellite channels, watching cricket, watching paint dry. Anything but surviving the trilogy which feels like a lifetime. You could take your newborn baby in to a screening of At World's End, and by time you leave, your baby will be a young boy. You will have skipped the nappy changing, the crying, the staying up all night. So, there is a silver lining to the very, dark looming cloud which is the son of cinema's Satan - Pirates 3.By now, we can care little for the unforgivable mess which is the plot. Ships turning upside down, pirate leagues, rocks turning into crabs, an odd, mumbling witch who talks some of the biggest fantasy drivel ever committed to film. We've had enough, and the illusion which was the charm of the first pirate's film has worn off. Jack Sparrow is just a slow, bumbling character with annoyingly awkward dialogue and Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are so wooden they could be harvested and solve the world's problem of deforestation. The tone of the film is evidently undecided; we can go from a hanging scene involving children to a drunken Jonny Depp in a slapstick comedy scene. There's even an attempt at romance at the end of the film, but the scene is so graceless and discomforting it's like watching rhino's mating on the Discovery channel. Ugh, just ugh. That $300 million could have gone anywhere, it could fund 40 Godfather's, save African lives, anything but this.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was very pleasantly surprised to see how much fun it was, and really kept to the standard set by the previous two films. It wasn't introspective or thought-provoking, but that is not what these movies are intended to be, anyways. Captain Sparrow is one of the funnest (and funniest) movie heroes to come around in recent memory, and Kiera Knightly's character is not some typical female sidekick, there just to be eye candy. Knightly is stunning to be sure, but her character, Elizabeth Swan, is a true heroine in every sense of the word.This movie was fast-paced and didn't take itself too seriously, making it the perfect popcorn movie. It didn't get bogged down in too much ridiculous duologue or long-winded explanations. When the movie finished, I couldn't believe that nearly 3 hours had passed.I would recommend anyone go and see this and have 3 hours of unbridled fun this summer. One warning, though: if you haven't seen the first two movies, do that first before you see this one, or else I fear this movie will make little sense to you. That said, it will still be fun to watch, regardless of your Pirates ""virginity"".","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I sat through 1 hour of at worlds end last night and just couldn't take any more. Its all been said before but the plot was confusing, there was nothing remotely funny about the film and everything was a just rush between the next big scene.I am a believer in giving a movie a chance, no matter how awful, but given the huge budget of this movie and well paid script writers / director, I feel the public is just being massively ripped off here.This is a real shame as I think Johnny Depp is a wonderfully natural actor, and Geoffrey Rush is every bit his equal when it comes to hamming up the whole pirate thing.

""At World's End"" is an awesome finale to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy.The film fulfils all of the genre criteria just like the other two films, it has much action that keeps you glued to the screen and much adventure an mystery, as well as being able to bring in comedy through all of this action. I really liked the way the film could bring in comedy in such fast moving action sequences.Another great feature about this film is the special effects. In many violent scenes the film links to the idea of mystery with its pathetic fallacy of using harsh weather conditions. The special effects of the weather in one of the main action sequences is amazing. The way it links to the sea and the violence makes you want more and more. A great job has been done with the effects for this film. In my opinion, it wouldn't have surprised me if anyone who had plenty of food whilst watching ended up being 'sea sick', the effects were that good.One of the other great features of the film are the range of unique characters. In the last film we had a set up of really great powerful characters but in my opinion 3 stood out the most: Jack Sparrow, Barbosa and Davy Jones, each have their own characteristics including accents and when ever they appear on the screen you know your in for something great.What I would recommend to any people going to see this is make sure you have done your homework. This film tries to put many stories into it, making it such a long running time. This film requires much concentration, if you lose focus for any part of the film it can become confusing there is so much put into it. However, if you keep focused on the events happening in the film you are in for one exciting finale.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

On the way to save him are Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom ), Elizabeth Swann ( Keira Knightley ) and Captain Barbossa ( Geoffery Rush ); all of whom are racing against time to ally with Sparrow, as well as the other pirates lords such as Sao Feng ( Chao Yun-Fat ) in order to combat the growing menace of Cutler Beckett ( Tom Hollander ) and Davy Jones ( Bill Nighy ).Like the first two this one has its share of laughs and spills, but there is also some great dialogue between some of the leads. Depp is great as Sparrow and looks like he could do another 3 movies, while Knightley and Bloom have their moments in the sun. But it is Bill Nighy and Geoffery Rush that really drive this movie forward; with Nighy playing Jones as a great man who lost his way; adding depth to his character and Rush having a fantastic time as the villain turned anti-hero Barbossa. The chemistry that these two manage to generate with Depp and with Chao Yun-Fat ( in the case of Rush ) is great. And of course, finally, the supporting cast of pirates who have been through the movies, led by Kevin McNally as Gibbs are once again wonderful.POTC3 closed out the series very well. Many people will be annoyed by the constant twists and turns, but hey, they're pirates! It's half the fun!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

At first I was going to wait, but when it was to be shown starting 4 hours earlier (due to midnight showings) it was decided to see if it could stand up to the first. The movie was once again mixed with all the things a pirate could want: love, romance, betrayal, twist, action, betrayal, and of course the sea. If people want to place the first movie against this one, it is advised against. Even though the story line continues, it seems to take on a life of its own. You wanted to see where the story went, but when you looked for something to go from in the previous movies, there was only the story. As it progressed I found myself wanting to see what was twisting where and how it was to come to fruition. As to be expected, the action gave some fun to the movie, but the intrigue was well placed. It didn't bowl you over but it was not slow going. ALmost a little long you have small kids with you.

Not only was the film based on one of Disney's most beloved attractions, it told a reasonably old fashioned Swashbuckle picture. Of course, special effects and insurmountable amounts of eye shadow were thrown in as flavor.The second was high entertainment with more effects and more eye shadow, yet it had lost some of it's wacky charm. The third has returned to form with flying colors. Never has Jack Sparrow been more comically reliable. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner has become a much more believable character. Dead Man's Chest (the second film) left us hanging, on the edge of our seats, craving more. At World's end delivers more and then some. The film details the search to bring Capt. Jack Sparrow (the incomparable Johnny Depp)back from the land of the dead. This requires the assistance of wiley Capt. Barabossa (Geoffery Rush). The film leads to the climactic battle of the Pirate Lords (including Chow Yun Fat as Sao Feng) against the Eas India Trading Company led by malevolent Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who know controls the Flying Dutchman by way of Davy Jones'(Bill Nighy) heart.Follow me? Well, it is irrelevant anyways. The plot of the three films just seems to be some far fetched fantasy to hang sea battles and sword fights on. There is nothing wrong with that. There is so much double crossing and even triple crossing in this film that it could be mistaken for a Pulp rag of the 1950's, were it not for the ships and pirates. The proceedings are, as always, heightened by the glorious talents of Depp and Rush, who play so well together that one wonders what would come of a different film starring both actors where they had the same sort of relationship.At World's End is 168 minutes of non stop visual splendor, not once did I check the clock in boredom. That's something I couldn't say about Dead Man's Chest, which is 18 minutes shorter.However, I think the biggest and most deserved praise I could give this film is that it most certainly makes the popcorn taste better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film boasts an excellent cast in some very new and exotic locations, not to mention a very very very thick plot that somehow manages to all be resolved.I'm not going to explain the plot, not because it was confusing, but because for those who have not seen part two will most certainly have not a clue what the hell is going on and why. What I will say is that the conclusions are the most surprising, most tragic, and most satisfying of the series, not to mention that there may be a potential for a sequel. The performances were definitely top-notched this time around, especially for Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom, the main characters of the story. Their performances were great, and I actually realized their true purposes to the story.Johnny Depp's performance was, as usual, fun to watch, especially with him acting far more stranger than before, what with hallucinations appearing and all. Tip of the hat to veteran actors Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, and Bill Nighy, who all add such a persona to the film that one cannot resist being charmed. There are a lot more great performances as well, such as by Chow Yun-fat as Sao-Feng, but it'd be just too tough to list all of them.I will always be awed by the combination of Nighy and ILM to create the unforgettable Captain Davy Jones. What they've created here is one of the finest CGI performances ever, topping even that of Serkis's Gollum. The character himself is just so sympathetic and so tragic that though he is a villain, one finds him to be in such a tough position in this movie. He hates being the puppet of Lord Cutler Beckett, played ruthlessly by Tom Hollander, and yet he has no choice, for his heart is in jeopardy (quite literally). There's more to his story as well, and it is such a deep and sad one. He takes souls, always asking if they fear death, and yet he himself fears death the most of everyone.The visual effects of the film are gorgeous and spectacular to watch, with some of the greatest movie naval fight ever, complete with a massive whirlpool and ships combating with next to 30 guns, not to mention a violent typhoon and massive deck battles between British soldiers, pirates, and crustacean-encrusted sea creature-men. ILM's hard work pays through in this film, and not once did I find myself questioning the realism of the CGI, though obviously the stuff done here, such as the Black Pearl toppling towards the edge of the world, are impossible to realize physically.Do you need to watch the previous films to appreciate this one? It would help to clarify some of the various plots in the film, but not necessary. The sheer entertainment value, the characters, the visuals, and the action, are more than enough to carry the film through its long running time. It feels long, but never boring and certainly never drawn out. There is a lot of fun in this film.I pray that there isn't a fourth Pirates, tempting though it may be to desire it. This is a trilogy that deserves more than the fate of, oh, the ""Aliens"" saga, and to churn out a fourth would, I fear, lower the lasting quality of the films as a whole and just be an excuse for Disney to make more money. The characters' stories, I think, have also been told and are complete. Let's just say good-bye to Captain Jack, before he perhaps overstays his welcome, rum and all.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But that is for the same reasons. Great Characters! This movie manages to take the fun of the first film and mix it with darkness which adds up to be one bittersweet masterpiece. Johnny Depp plays everyone's favorite captain, Jack Sparrow, in this possibly final, film in the trilogy and like the other two films, he holds the weight of this 3 hour film on his back. But unlike the last film, Jack doesn't have to hold it all by himself. A ton of characters come in and give their A GAME ALL THE WAY. Barbossa comes back from the grave and really feels like first film magic again. The rivalry between Jack and Barbossa is nothing short of beautiful. Davy Jones comes back but doesn't just boss people around. No, he gets angry in this one. And not just ""oh my hearts gone, I'm gonna shout and wriggle my tentacles"" angry...""I'm seriously ticked off, my tentacles are wriggling, my brow is furrowing, and i am going to kick... your... ASS"" angry. THATS RIGHT FOLKS. We finally get to see what i've wanted to see ever since i found out Bill Nighy would be playing Davy Jones...Davy Jones has a real sword fight against Jack Sparrow. And about that sword fight. Take Princess Bride, take a pinch of Zorro with a dash of Star Wars 1 and 3, pour in the fun of the first film with the size of the second, and then add amazing CGI with twists, turns, and humor, and you only get the tip of the final showdown. Once again, Jack is back with more fun. 24 times more fun in fact because we see more than one Jack. The direction is great, and off the wall, and not at all what you'd expect. Now i know that there are a lot of reviewers out there who say it's complex and all but HONESTLY, i watched it, and the only way you can really get confused AT ALL, is if you fell asleep for half of it and didn't watch 1 or 2. I saw it with my 6 year old cousin and he got everything. EVERY MOTIVATION AND EVERY BETRAYAL (and there are a lot of them). its not that hard! One of the best parts about this film in a sea of good parts is that there is possibilities for sequels and spin-offs but you'll see later. The only bad parts about this film is that it takes a little while to get going. But unlike the second film which took equally long to get going, this film does not slow down. And though it is big like the second film, it doesn't seem overly and unnecessarily big. Also, while Kiera finally holds her own without screaming like an idiot or being too much of a man like she was in the second film, her opposite, Will proves once and for all that he is a ""hair actor."" He has nothing to his name but a good head of hair. Maybe that worked in Lord of the Rings but it doesn't do squat here. Over all, this is a great film that I enjoy. Also, keep an eye out for Kieth Richards as Jacks dad. He kinda looks like Captain Hook and if Academy Awards for best makeup should go to any film it should be this one for making Kieth Richards not look like death. And though i tried to go the entire review without saying any pirate jargon, i cant help myself. MAN YOUR MISSEN MASS OR WALK THE PLANK YE WILL SAYS I. GRAB YOUR DUBLOONS, GET SOME POPCORN, AND SIT YOUR BOOTY DOWN TO WATCH 3 HOURS OF CINEMATIC BEAUTY THAT WILL SHIVER YE TIMBERS (it sure did mine).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The second was so-so, but it was clearly a set up for the big finale, so I thought, let's expect the best.I have not seen a film this bad in a very long time. I kept thinking of the Liz Taylor ""Cleopatra"" or Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"" - massive amounts of money flushed down the toilet (or snorted up someone's nose, which is more likely).The story starts out strong; the special effects are great. Some of the camera work is superb... but then, there's the dialog - Wretch wretch wretch! People do not speak this way - even video game characters do not speak this way! And not fun at all. And the idiotic CGI; and the terrible film-school student editing - And expecting the big finale? - turns out this is just a build-up to the sequel - What happens to Calypso? Where is the Fountain of Youth? Will what's-her-name and what's-his-face ever get it together in real life? And do I care? Will I ever care again? Absolutely NOT! No plastic cups, no posters, no toys, no nothing - Satan, get thee well behind me.And Mr. Depp and Mr. Rush - the two major talents wasted in this slop - shame on you.Finally, a word of warning - Disney Studios has the disgusting gall to market this as a kid's film - do NOT take any children to see this film - Extreme violence; gore; mishmashed paganism; (humorless) dirty jokes; implicit cunnilingus - this is the most wretched display of perverse adult cynicism I have ever seen - and they sell it to children?! Disney - SHAME! Damnation would be too gentle a curse for pedophilical necrophiles like thproducers of this trash. Walt, returneth and pour fire and brimstone on the heads of your betrayers!

It's incredible how a story came out of a ride over at Disney world and 'Land,. Unlike Harry Potter, where people wait for the movie after reading the book, and then of course the comparisons begin. Here there is none of that! There is no book to compare it to. Just incredible people who put a story together! Johnny is yet utterly hysterical, in many of his many scenes. For this comment you have had to see the movie to understand. He has made an art of Jack Sparrow, and to see his mentor or I should say Keith Richards as his dad is a real bonus two minutes or not. We are always curious to see what makes a character what they are. Elizabeth lives up to her name Knightly at that. Will Turner is a sup rising character as well as is Little Jack. It is amazing that they brought back most of the cast from the first two movies and merged them in with a new cast. This saga has been told only as Disney can! Great Casting enjoyable scenes..Honestly I felt like I was on the ride of my life! Thanks to the cast and film crew and most of all Disney for having the courage to go on with this story out of nowhere.....and to go along with Johnny portrait of Jack. Two hard pills to swallow at first but use that Disney magic fairy dust and there you go! Perfection on the Big Screen for the whole family...yes everyone in the family can go see it!

We start where we left off, with Jack stuck in Davey Jones locker and Elizabeth, Will, Barbosa and the others setting off to find him and rescue him.The film moves through stunning visual locations which are made better by using a vast amount of brilliantly constructed CGI which really makes the film feel more real to the eye. However there is very little screen time for the impressive Cracken from Dead Man's Chest.Kieth Richards plays Jacks dad superbly with brilliant supporting roles from Stellan Staarsgaard, Bill Nighy, Geoffrey Rush and Tom Hollander as the villainous leader of the East India Company. Johnny Depp continues to amaze with his portrayal of Jack Sparrow. All the favourites from the first two return which gives the film an added bright tone.However the subject matter and cinematography make the film much darker than one and two. Some material could easily be classed in the 15 category rather than the mere 12A rating it received. As the film plays on the characters emotions a lot more than the previous instalments.Come the end, it does leave it's self open for Pirates 4 however unlikely it will be.

Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America.

The story is answering all questions, but is very, very complicated and long. But you are not bored and that's the main thing. Two captains on one ship, Barbossa and Jack Sparrow, have no mistake. However, there are many charismatic characters that are in the movie only for their charisma and they do actually nothing. That's quite bad as they just complicate the story. After the great One, a little bit worse Two is now the best Three. And after watching Spider-Man 3 and Shrek The Third, this was the only sufficient Three. And the movie continues after credits.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

At the very start of the movie I was hooked again.The movie contains a lot of information to process, but if you actually sit down and follow it you'll find it is not confusing at all. As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There have been other length movies that have that ability to be long and just draw the audience on into a dull somber mood while Pirates does exactly the opposite. It will draw you deeper and deeper into the stories plot until one final explosive ending that has you on the edge of your seat. Plus the bit at the end of the credits was a very nice touch to end the series...Maybe. Johnny Depp has dropped hints that he would be up for doing another one which is entirely possible with the way the movie did end. So hopefully the producers of this movie are pleased with the gross intake, which is easily probably going to set box office records, enough to make a fourth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It doesn't always work.Clocking in at 165 minutes, ""At World's End"" contains several endings too many. ""Ah,"" you think, ""that's the end!"" and then more stuff happens, and you fall asleep. It's as if the producer (Jerry Bruckheimer, of course) looked at the clock, noticed that a mere two hours had elapsed, and ordered his writing minions to crank out more implausibles to stretch the running time for no apparent reason.So. Did I like the movie, you wonder? Well, I sat through nearly three hours of it, so I suppose I should find something positive to say. Things blew up, and that was awesome. Plus, I decided that Keira Knightley was far manlier than Orlando Bloom, who I'm told is actually a man. (No, seriously!) And that Johnny Depp wears mascara better than Knightley, who's apparently not a little boy.All kidding aside, the biggest problem with the movie is that it's overplotted. We make fun of dumb action movies that have minimal plot and are basically excuses for explosions, but here's the mirror image - there's so much going on that the typical viewer will be confused and disoriented. Which is good, I suppose, in that it'll distract him or her from the actual storyline problems.When we last left the Good Guys, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been claimed by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and imprisoned in (believe it or not) Davy Jones' Locker. The resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) must rescue him. To do so, they have to team up with or defeat or betray Singapore's own legendary pirate, Sao Feng (the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat), as well as various Pirate Lords, the British navy, and so on.The biggest problem facing Barbossa is that the one force that can help him and the other Pirate Lords against the likes of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is that of an ancient goddess, who has been bound to a human body for years and years. Barbossa wants to unleash the goddess in hopes that she'll aid them all, but clear thinkers around him are more of the mind that she'll instead beat the snot out of them for imprisoning her in the first place. Of course, this being a loud action movie, there's no way in heck she's going to stay bound in a human body, right? Hilarity ensues.The cast is game, but typically wooden performances by Bloom and Knightley are countered by an equally typically nuanced and often hysterical one by Depp - not to mention a bombastic, scene-stealing turn by Rush. But plot oddities abound. Elizabeth seems awash in makeup that never, ever comes off or smudges in the teeniest, despite one protracted scene taking place in a torrential downpour. I also liked the time Elizabeth was ambushed by British soldiers, one of whom puts her in a headlock; when she recognizes one of the other soldiers, Elizabeth merely throws off her captor's arm and escapes. Why she didn't do this throughout the movie, when she was in constant peril or capture, is a mystery. Or how the entire British navy, upon seeing one of their own ships decimated by pirates, says, ""the hell with this,"" and sails away.As I implied, though, the movie's murky plot is its ultimate downfall. Who's on whose side? You know going in that there will be treachery, but when a movie has every character essentially turning on every other character, the whole novelty of the doublecross is long since vanished. After a while, you come to expect someone doing someone else wrong, all the more so if those two characters sort of were on the same side at one point earlier in the series. Once you tune out important details like who's on which side, the movie's sort of lost its way.And here's more bad news. The conventional wisdom in Hollywood now is that franchise films should be three movies long, no more, that three's about the limit for the typical moviegoer. But the ending very strongly hints that there will be a fourth Pirates movie. This might wind up being wishful thinking on the part of Bruckenheimer and director Gore Verbinski (who have done all three movies), rather than reality, as the second and third movies were filmed simultaneously.All in all, this is a butt-numbing disappointment. If you gotta make it long, make it worth my while. If you're gonna have crap blow up, make it interesting. If you're gonna have double and triple crosses, make me care.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's a movie packed with thrills, spills and chills, every cent of its gigantic £150million budget put to stunning use.Blockbuster season has arrived - and pundits say Johnny Depp's new film will break the $1billion box office record, set by the second Pirates movie, to become the most successful film of all time.AdvertisementFollowing on from last year's Dead Man's Chest, these are dark times for the Age of Piracy. With lovable buccaneer Jack (Depp) missing presumed dead, the evil East India Company now controls the waves with the malevolent Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) roaming the world's oceans in his ghost ship, The Flying Dutchman.As tyranny prevails on the high seas, it's up to young lovers Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley) to save piracy from a watery grave by gathering together the Nine Lords of the Brethren Court.Click above to watch trailer But one of the lords is missing. Jack is trapped in Davy Jones' Locker - his own personal hell, a desert without a drop of seawater - following his terrifying encounter with a monstrous kraken in the last movie.It means Will and Elizabeth must embark on a dangerous mission to find the charts and a ship that will lead them to their salty seadog friend.But neither has reckoned with Oriental pirate Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat, of Crouching Tiger fame) who's slipperier than a barrel of eels.Everyone who enjoyed Dead Man's Chest will be hooked by this three-quel which, like the earlier film, is crammed to bursting with multiple plots, seafaring showdowns and spectacular special effects.Apart from that climactic showdown in the rigging, there are incredible scenes of Jack trapped in the Locker.After the trusty Black Pearl runs aground on a desert island, he's confronted with dozens of clones of himself before an army of crabs emerge from the sand, pick up his vessel and scuttle away with it.And once again, Depp proves to be a natural-born swashbuckler. With so many special effects they start to lose the wow factor as the movie goes on. And, believe me, this is a film that goes on, clocking in at no less than 168 minutes. Pirates may make your jaw thud to the ground, but it'll also make your bum go blue.But they're unlikely to prevent Pirates launching a fresh assault on our pockets. Shot back-to-back with the second part during a gruelling 284-day shoot, there's already talk of a fourth film. Pirates' legion of fans worldwide will no doubt be yo-ho-hoping Captain Jack will be sailing again","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I can't really understand what film the people who hated this movie were watching, because it couldn't have been the pirates I saw.The third film was brilliant! You see, I am a huge fan of the first pirates. I saw it 24 times in the theater, no joke. And then I saw the second one. I must admit, I was extremely disappointed. All dead mans chest seemed to do was repeat the jokes from the first movie, and boringly set up a third installment. But when I saw the third film, I was in no way let down, in fact I was surprised by its originality, character development and ability to keep my interest.People say that AWE lacks action until the end...and I agree that it had many less action sequences than I and many others expected..however, there were so many other things going on in the movie, that too much action would have spoiled the film. The plot was complicated...but not so complicated that it could not be followed. Because there was so much going on, the movie (yes even dialogue scenes) never got boring. Another feature of this film was that new characters were introduced, and old ones were developed and brought into new light (espcially Elizabeth Swann..Keira Knightly carried out a phenomenal performance). The jokes were actually extremely original (unlike in dead mans chest) and the visual effects were again stunning.This movie surprised me because it is so unlike the first or second pirates. It still carries on the first two films attitude and good qualities, but it brings so much more depth, talent, plot and even gore than the first two.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is not a three-quel to be missed. Shrek and Spiderman can wait until DVD...but this is a movie that is worth your buck.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

All I read about before going into this was how confusing it was, how long it was, and how slow it was. There is nothing confusing about this plot and this movie if you just pay attention. Their are double crosses abound and twists and turns aplenty, and they are all just part of the fun.The film starts out with a clear and vivid explanation of why the pirates must fight. Every known pirate; man, woman, and child, are being hung for the acts. The only way to live as a pirate would be to fight back. As explained in the first two films, pirates are not trustworthy people, therefore double crosses and backstabs are bound to come up, and boy do they ever. You can't trust anyone, even those who you wouldn't suspect.In my opinion the first hour is so much fun that it doesn't even feel drawn out or long. The second hour drags a tad, but not bad. The third hour, (yes, it's 3 hours long) is so remarkable it feels like it's ten minutes long. An amazing special effects sequence of two ships in a whirlpool that will leave you breathless.Overall I thought the movie was wonderful and was left open for plenty more sequels. All previous loose ends were tied up but now more have been created. The fates of these peoples lives were very surprising and you are wanting to know after this one, what will happen next.If you enjoyed the first two, you will enjoy this the same. I highly recommend seeing it. And there is plenty of humor in this one, a welcome return if you ask me. Enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Fortunately, they pulled it off thanks to the funny parts that really connected all these different topics and characters.The ending surprised me, in a good way that is.

There was so much pure awesomeness (the definition being it put the audience in a state of awe) in this movie, you will feel like you are a part of the story itself. There are almost no bad words to say about this movie other than the ""where'd the rum go"" joke is dead, and should be laid to rest, but that is no big deal. All the actors are perfect in their parts, and even actors otherwise viewed as ""not deep"" added depth to the characters. There is a lot in the story line, though, so remember to pay attention and avoid bathroom breaks, there aren't really any lulls that would be a good time. They yet again do an amazing job at putting a perfect amount of violence in the movie, making most gore implied and not shown, but showing important parts that need to be shown.

It was funny and had a great story line. Dead Man's Chest was OK but no way as good as the first. At World's End I think was a complete waste of time and money. Its just under 3 hours long and I think I only started to enjoy the film in the last hour. Johnny Depp does give another excellent performance as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow and I will admit some parts of the film made me laugh. But these were few and far between. I think they should of stopped after the release of the Curse of the Black Pearl. I think the problem with the 2nd and 3rd film is that because they split it into two films they had to fill time and therefore putting in many unnecessary scenes. I hope that there is not going to be a 4th movie as I think they have completely sunk this ship.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

But that doesn't mean it is a film worth seeing and paying your money to the makers.You'll see plenty of rave reviews for this film and if you do go to see it, you'll end up wondering, like me, whether they saw another film ! There are good action sequences that are obviously good cinema but the film is so tedious to watch, so much so that by the time the action comes, your enthusiasm to stay the course has severely waned. The film is far too long, the plot (if there is one) far too obscure and in many instances filmed in poor light, spoiling the film even further.After the fun of the 1st film, the intriguing twists of the 2nd one, the 3rd frankly insults your intelligence.If you still want to see it - don't say you weren't warned !","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Character development was begun in the first 2 Pirate movies, and this one completes the process, giving insights into the thought process of the well known characters, and introducing some well known actors to aid in the process. Many were confused by the ending, but if you really think about it, there couldn't have been a better ending.

The overall plot of the movie is a little difficult to follow, so to anyone that has not seen it, I highly suggest re-watching the first two before hand.

I can say that this was better than DMC, but not nearly as good as the original. Captain Jack Sparrow's role in this story is much smaller than what it was in the first two movies. Subsequently, the focus is primarily on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan and their romance, an aspect of this entire trilogy that I thought was over done, it was clear from the beginning that they were going to get together. The last scene before the credits was far and away the best of the entire film, because it had the same tone of the original film.The special effects were well done, but the story was rather boring, and I kind of wish I could get that three hours back of my life. The theatre I went to didn't even have any cool new trailers before the movie.So far the big summer blockbusters have all been disappointing, to me any way.

Critics that pointed out that key characters each had their own plots and treachery weren't kidding. The movie seriously ends on a note you'd never quite expect and that is the genius of this particular installment. I think honestly my favorite character in this now is Lord Beckett, ruthless as he is, Tom Hollander did an excellent job filling out the role of a villain beyond his part in POTC 2.

Will Turner's character is also very strong, serious, romantic and incredibly sexy. Orlando Bloom does fantastic acting and I give him huge amounts of credit for it. My only wish is that I could meet him, Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley.

However when watching the movie keep your wits about you as it is not an easy ride, with so many different plots and sub-plots it is easy to lose your head. Some said that the storyline would be predictable; it is far from it, they said it wouldn't be as good as the previous ones; they were wrong. if anything this movie only highlights why the previous films were such big successes. Finally there are only two more points i would like to make: 1. those who are hardcore romantics, try not to be too disappointed in the end 2. and those who like me wished that Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp would wear less clothes in the movie then I'm afraid more disappointment is in order....lolEnjoy people.....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

No. Is it as good as the first? Not really. Is it better than the second? You bet. Is it a great film? YES! ""POTC 3"" is a great, fun movie-going experience. When I go to the movies, i don't want to see some cute little indie or another romantic comedy with some big names. I want to see a film with big action and big laughs: a film where it pays to have hundreds of people sitting around you. ""Pirates"" certainly fits into this category.""At World's End"" is basically the story of how all the opened holes from the second film are sealed up. Luckily, however, it doesn't seem forced at all. The film is long, but it stays strong all the way through. It's a funny, thrilling, and beautiful thrill ride.The laughs in ""At World's End"" are numerous, and they pop up all throughout the film. like in the first ""POTC,"" we even get funny one-liners and slapstick laughs during serious sword fights. There's slapstick comedy, great humorous dialogue, jokes about pirates, situational irony, and every other kind of humor you could possibly imagined. I laughed out loud more during this film than during ""You, Me, and Dupree,"" ""Little Man,"" and ""Just my Luck"" combined.The visuals are stunning, as expected. I found myself examining Bill Nighy's digital Davy Jones ""face"" whenever he was on screen. The area shots are also beautiful, and the film looks really expensive, which is a good thing.Depp steals the show as usual with his fantastic performance, but Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy held up well as well, turning in stellar work. Keira Knightley was especially terrific. She is one of the few gorgeous modern women who can act extraordinarily well while entrancing the audience with her looks.Yes, the film is a bit long and unruly, but the whole thing is enjoyable. Johnny Depp is always immensely interesting and fun to watch, and the plot is very funny in itself. This is a great film for any pirates fan, and I urge you to see it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Even though it is about 20-30 minutes too long and has a somewhat confusing plot line, the biggest criticism I have of the film is the overuse, in my opinion, of CGI. You know, there is a time for an action sequence in this film, several times over, but just because you can do something with the computer does not mean you have to. As one example, the scene with Lord Beckett on the Endeavor near the end of the film is way overdone. The director seems thrilled with what effects can be achieved, and he uses them even where the context of the film could be, in my view, better served without the obviously computer generated effects. But, other than that, a very enjoyable film. In fact, I saw it a second time and was more impressed the second time around.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Film tremendous: beautiful landscapes, beautiful actors, beautiful visual effects, beautiful monkey ""Jack"", beautiful parrot, beautiful piracy history. A history, about the free pirates, which battled for freedom. The pirates, which were not afraid to battle with legendary "" by the Flying Dutch "". At film there is that special, piracy atmosphere. You look film and worry for the heroes. You would like to plunge into adventures together with them: to set off At World's And, to visit in "" to a Bay of Ship-wrecks "" and at last to battle together with the pirates against Davy Jones in that last, legendary fight. The actors could completely open the heroes: Jack Sparrow - artful, quick pirate, mister of good luck. The light party has won him, he has rescued a Will's life. Elizabeth Swann - became the fearless pirate, by the queen of the pirates and at last has found the present love. Will Turner - noble man fond Elizabeth and trying to rescue of the father. Pintel and Ragetti - sweet couple, cheerful pirates. Each stage with them is a comic stage. The most cheerful pirates from all, which I ever saw. Barbossa - fearless pirate, true captain "" Black Pearle "" Davy Jones - severe, but in too time, romantic hero, present pirate. I consider his line in film, most dramatic. Lord Cutler Beckett - present businessman, man, which knows, that such "" the business approach "". He very beautifully was lost in the third film, having proved, that he the correct captain.In film still there are a lot of heroes, and all of them to not list. But everyone in film has made the contribution. Huge thank Hans Zimmer, which has written such beautiful, graceful piracy music to film, I was in delight from music in film!On my sight, it is the best film about the pirates, and it is looked very smartly! It is necessary to look the third film not a masterpiece, but it really good film, which on the large screen and not once! And the trilogy of the pirates, is the present masterpiece, one of the best trilogies of Hollywood!In the conclusion I can tell one: do not listen to the people, which which speak, that film bad.. I have looked film already 3 times, I live in Russia where this film very much love. Also I can with confidence tell, that the film has managed! Therefore I want to tell, the people go in a cinema on this film, itthat costs.

The rest is what is to be expected: a good sense of adventure, lots of things happening in all places at once, and all the actors of the previous parts coming back for another part to be played.For me this third part was what I had expected from it: slightly worse than the 2nd, still better than the 1st.

If you thought Matrix Revolutions was bad... well then you clearly haven't watched Pirates 3.The biggest flaw in this film is the time it takes our crew of pirate misfits to find Captain Jack Sparrow. Almost an hour goes by in the movie before we even see our beloved hero. What made me a huge fan of Pirates 1 was not only Johnny Depp, but Geoffrey Rush as Capt. Barbossa, here in Pirates 3 Geoffrey Rush is under used and when he is used he comes off as bland and boring, not the Barbossa from Pirates 1 which made us all fall in love with our swashbuckling hero's.My other gripe with Pirates 3 was how blatantly Keira Knightley's sex appeal is used. I don't deny she is a very attractive woman, but do we have to highlight how hot she is in every single frame... honestly it becomes a distraction.The only shining star of this entire turd is Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. Bill's acting really takes an otherwise dull character and makes him not only menacing, but stellar on every level imaginable, tis a shame he is under used in this film, and it is a DAMN shame people like Orlando Bloom get highlighted when they clearly have zero talent.This is a waste of anyones time. With a run time of close to 3 hours with trailers you are honestly better off watching re-runs of American Idol... they both has the same mind numbing effect, one just gets the job done quicker and with less eye rolling moments.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I wish we could have seen more of him. Some of the developments in the ""bad guys"" were great as well. Of course the effects were spectacular, and there was plenty of humor thrown in to offset the drama/fighting. On the down side, a few of the CG scenes went on too long, particularly one of the sea battles, the view of Sparrow at World's End, the transformation of Calypso. I found the same problem with King Kong. What begins as an amazing scene eventually becomes boring and doesn't advance the storyline at all. I also didn't care for the ending, which I won't share here. It's not that I have to have a happy fairy tale ending, but just thought this one could have been thought through better. You will also hear you should wait through the credits for a special scene at the end. Let me just say that there are about 15 minutes of credits, and the extra 3 minutes of movie isn't particularly special.

But POTC3 has both- great fun and a brilliant plot. The film truly belongs to Johny Depp (Sparrow) and Geoffrey Rush (Barbosa)- the two standout performances for me. Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) was also quite up to the mark.Pintel and Ragetti again impress so does Lord Beckett. However, I feel 2 hours 45 minutes runtime is little long but the movie does manage you to keep on the edge of your seat. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley once again prove that they are the worst actors in Hollywood. I didn't like their performances and felt as if they were begging the director for screen presence in the entire movie.Watch it for Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). He once again proves his versatility as an actor and is just brilliant and as usual funny. The moment you see him, you will always laugh in the film.And for Sam Raimi, Please do watch this movie. This is how you make a sequel/trilogy. I give this one 4/5.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For more then three hours we were totally entertained by the third Pirates of the Caribbean film. Yes it has complicated plot twists, it is more or less a rehash of the first two films as far as characters and special effects, and the acting was not inspirational, but boy was it fun to watch. As a movie, I guess it all depends on what your expectations are; we wanted to see Keith Richards, he was great and deserved to have more screen time, we wanted to see what happens with William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), we wanted to see pirates fighting on the high seas, and we wanted to see if Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) would be brought back to the realm of the living. Not high expectations, but all were met and the three hours seemed to go by quickly as we were transported into a world of swashbuckling, magic, and deeds of heroism and treachery.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie was an overall success, Except for the end, which left me, and I'm sure most, wanting more of Captain Jack Sparrow, and his Zainy ego. I also found the quick death of Sao Feng a setback, and the design of Davy Jones locker was different then the image put in my mind from without this series. Hans Zimmer was as amazing as ever in composing the music for this summer blockbuster. The movie was confusing at times, and I found myself getting lost within Dialouge or plot at times. Many characters were killed off, and Calypso and Tia Dalma were useless to me, along with the brethren. I found the guest appearance Of Keith Richards fun, although his part was short. The last battle was an amazing thrill ride, and Orlando Bloom was amazing in the way he brought out the ""power of the dark side"" in Will. The hilarious humor was kept, and I'm glad we didn't go of onto a cannibal infested island, or a beach with a giant wheel on it this time. Staying in the ocean kept the real pirate feel to the movie. I didn't find this movie ""weaker"" than the first one, like in the case of Shrek the third, I found this movie to be better than the original times ten. I enjoyed this movie, and I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, who is brilliant in my opinion. Oceans Thirteen is next ion my list of movies to see over the summer, along with Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, as I am a huge fan of the series, and I was disappointed by the fourth one","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There were some things in the story line that did get a but confusing, but it was not anything that a person would not be able to follow. Everything in the story worked out quick nicely I thought. I was never bored watching the movie. Throughout the entire thing I was left wondering what was going to happen next and how they would get themselves out of this situation. It had the same great humor that was in the first two, but not to much. This movie was everything that the Pirates movies have come to be. It is so much fun and you fall in love with the characters. Each character, no matter how small was important. Really just a great movie. I think this was the best out of all three, and even though Orlando and Kiera may not do anymore, we can bet that anything with Jack Sparrow would not be boring. All in all I thought this was a great was to start off the summer movie season. I prefer not think about Spiderman 3. This was the movie to kick off the summer blockbusters.

There are no recaps between the films; they consist of a single story that is to be followed part by part. You must watch the first movie to be introduced to our heroes and supporting players because it is their actions here that make them the people they are later on. I would recommend seeing at least the second installment again before viewing the finale, however, it is not necessary as being a fan I was able to compose myself very early on with where we had left off. Credit to the filmmakers for realizing that this was the second half of the long tale that makes up parts two and three and not a standalone entity. The fanbase is intact and if you didn't like the previous, why should they cater to your needs of refreshing when the film isn't made for you? With all that said, I believe this film to be on steady ground with the two it follows, rounding out what is a very successful trilogya tough thing to come by lately.We enter the film with a prologue showing the singular will of the pirate community, something that is strong and will come into play later on. The sequence is effective in giving the audience a chance to rejoin the dirt and atmosphere that these movies have so effectively portrayed. Our main action soon follows as our heroes continue their quest for Jack Sparrow and his Black Pearl. Some need the ship to free the bonds of servitude for loved ones, some need Jack to assuage their conscience, while others just want the ship back in order to fulfill a promise that brought them back from the dead. Each character's motives are held tightly to their chests and we are privy to numerous changes of allegiance and multiple double crossing, although not always crossing the ones we think. Alliances are struck and pirates join together in order to save their kind from the East India Company's tyranny and Davy Jones' renegade, murderous bent created from his sacrificing the one being that ever loved him. Don't worry, though, if you have been having fun and following along, all the twists and turns make perfect sense. Also, the intricacies of the plot really impressed me because whether or not originally planned as a trilogy, the attention to detail and past occurrences truly allow one to become totally wrapped up in the action.Once again the acting is top-notch. True it is oftentimes over-the-top, but that is what is expected here. This is a fantastical adventure story seeped in mythology, history, and romance. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have evolved into very serious people who have seen much pain and death. There is little humor with them as in previous installments, however, their love for each other still exists and whether they trust the other or not, they do what they have to do to keep that bond alive. Johnny Depp is again in top form and just adds to the Jack Sparrow role. The laughs still exist, but we also get to see a side of Jack that has been missing, a true drive to fight and a willingness to sacrifice himself for the victory.These three do see a bit of a push to the background as we are bombarded with characters from all sides, though. Barbossa is back, and this is a great thing. Geoffrey Rush was one of the best pieces that the original film had going for it, and to have him and Depp together again, this time on the same side, is a treat indeed. Naomie Harris returns with effectiveness and the ability to still look gorgeous even under her gypsy woman garb; Bill Nighy proves once more that no matter how much cgi is used, it is his skill as a performer that truly overcomes; Tom Hollander portrays his villain with the same amount of sleaze mixed with a false arrogance that he is covering all his bases as in the second, when in reality he is working with pirates, they swear allegiance to no one; and Chow Yun-Fat adds a nice air of professionalism in an intimidating role whose motives are never really known.Besides the writing being true to the franchise and the acting never missing a step, the real success again lies in the animation and visuals. Director Gore Verbinski has a superb eye and a creative streak shown at numerous moments. The visual effects are once more the best in the business and some sequences, such as Hollander's descent amidst an imploding ship or the final ship battle inside a giant maelstrom, are truly breathtaking to experience and wonder how long it could have taken to orchestrate to perfection. Some moments crossed the line a bit, like every time Depp's psyche brought out multiple versions of himself, whether in Davy Jones' locker or out. These instances showed some nice effect in superimposing many Jack Sparrows interacting with each other, but they were overly long and ultimately totally unnecessary to the story at hand.After it all, I can't think of a better way for this franchise to finish. There was no degradation in my opinion throughout the series and with a fully fleshed beginning and end, I hope that this will be all we see. Verbinski needs to continue on to other things, bringing his singular vision with him to create new and innovative films. As for the characters, I believe they have finished strong and whole, any more entries will only demean the integrity that has held thus far. Don't be surprised too if people die that you do not expect, Pirates does not cop out, and as a result succeeds that much more.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are strict laws in effect that grant no mercy to pirates or people who help them. Thus the pirates of the world try to gather together together and decide their fate, and of course get Captain Jack back.By the end of the second movie, the word ""overkill"" was practically written across the screen. In this entry it is there for most of the movie. Desperately trying to top the previous two films, ""At World's End"" packs in relentless and overblown action sequences, filled with all sorts of special effects and pounding music in conjunction with the fact that it is trying to provide the viewer with a clever plot involving elusive allegiances and mythology.The action scenes are just like before, only much more frenetic and constantly less believable. This is a fantasy film, but even the genre has defined limits between entertaining and ridiculous. This is just insanely overblown and ridiculous. The plot tries to be clever, but ends up playing like a daytime soap opera with allegiances substituting for relationships. The dialog is corny and has none of the wry humor that made the first ""Pirates"" so enjoyable. The mythology is not very clever and is just reincorporated elements from other mythologies that happen to suit the story - Calypso was the Ancient Greek Goddess of the sea, for one - but too bad that it is all so bland.Clocking in at nearly 3 hours, the film could use some serious economy and pacing work to be enjoyable. Certain sequences are so long and end up leading nowhere until they are done and even then we are only provided with a short leap in the story. The worst offender of these being a dream/alternate reality sequence early on.The end result of all this is an at times spectacular, at times confusing, at times entertaining, but always action packed mishmash adventure that screams for a better story. --- 5/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Nothing is never good enough for them. Everyone have already decided that almost every damn sequel MUST be bad, and that exactly every third movie in a franchise MUST be terrible, accept for The Godfather 3. That makes no sense; because The Godfather 3 is one of the lamest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. And with this movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, people whine and whine and whine. You hear them telling you all the time that the first movie of these is the best, and that the second and this one can't be as good. Let me tell you this - I first saw the first movie. I thought it was great. Nothing major special; but still great. Then the second movie came, and I was sold to it. It was even BETTER than the first movie. More jokes, more stuff happening, more charming characters, and you just wanna see more. ESPECIALLY more of Captain Jack Sparrow! Then came the third movie... and boy, what a movie this is. It IS the best one in the franchise, without a doubt. I still think all three of them deserves 10 of 10 - but this one is still the far superior. But as I said before, people love to complain as small crybabies. They say that there's too many characters, which there isn't. It's a pirate story; what do you expect? And they say the plot is bad written... yeah, sure. I have never seen ANY movie use their imagination even CLOSE to what they do in this movie. The Harry Potter movies' imaginations is like a single cell in comparison. Then, they also says the jokes are bad and old... yeah, that's why everyone laughed their asses off in the cinema, huh? Thing is; if you are a REAL fan of Pirates of the Caribbean as I am, you love all three of the movies. These could possibly be the best movies ever made in my opinion. I think though I know the problem - people are corrupt. I mean, if they watch the movies, they should obviously love pirates, correct? Then, these movies are everything you can wish to see, and even more. It's like that old TV-series Pirates of Dark Water, that they sadly enough canceled. Or like One Piece; only less crazy though. But I mean, what is there to not like with this movie?They are planning to make a fourth movie; and I can undoubtly say that it's just wonderful that they want to do that. Captain Jack Sparrow on adventures beyond your own imaginations will never get me tired. Jack Sparrow and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies will always have a special place in my heart. We can just pray they won't make the fourth movie CG.I give 10 of 10 to probably one of the best movies ever made. If you don't like it, I don't understand why you even bother to watch any pirate movie at all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp offers nothing new in his portrayal of Jack Sparrow, and even appears to be a bit tired of it. As for the writing, it's taken the characters and plot line way over the top, offering the viewer form over substance, and the form is way overblown. The director of this failing series seems to believe if he inserts enough special effects and strange characters he will have a good movie, and he's wrong. At least the first edition had a believable storyline, even if it did move from adventure into horror. Geoffrey Rush appears to simply be fulfilling his contract agreement instead of acting, and that is unusual for him in the extreme. I actually fell asleep during several minutes of the first half of this boring tale, which is overlong and too full of itself. Just as you think it's reaching its denouement, it picks up again, teasing us into further boredom. I must admit, my interest picked up considerably with the arrival of Kieth Richards, but as suddenly as he appeared, he was gone. If you are aware of the plot of the first episode, it's really not important to go into detail about the next two. Nasty and slimy creatures are once again defeated by Sparrow and his co stars. Ho hum. At the World's End indeed. With any luck, the viewer will be at the series end.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Continuation of a successful series about the adventures of the world famous Captain Jack Sparrow. You know, this picture has become very significant for me, because I, for the first time in my life, went to the cinema, along with the class during the summer holidays. It was awesome, the very first sensation is impossible to forget. A huge screen, speakers on both sides, darkness, oh romance. Now this effect is a little lost due to the routine, but it delivers sensations. Sorry, I'm distracted. So, the third part of the series, which I adore and love with all my heart. And here is my brief opinion - Epic adventures of Captain Sparrow. Here the minus manifested itself even more than in the second picture, but since it is only one, I will devote only one paragraph to it, and therefore I intend to dwell on the expressive merits of this epic adventure.
So here they are:
1. Atmosphere - pirate romance, diluted with mysticism and ancient legends, still captures the viewer from the first to the last frame of this, the longest picture in the series (two hours, forty-nine minutes that look at one go).
2. Epic - in this part, everything is epic: horizons, intrigues, betrayals, battles, extras. After all, the budget of the picture amounted to three hundred million dollars (not including the cost of epic advertising), which made this picture the most expensive in the history of cinema at a certain stage. The creators had their hands untied, and they took full advantage of this opportunity, which occurs once every hundred years, creating costumes, grandiose decorations, and of course the fee to the main actors.
3. Adventure story - and again our charming Captain Jack got into trouble, and old and not so friends are forced to unite with former enemies in order to save not only Jack, but also the pirates of all the seas, because the enemy is stronger than ever, and ready wipe them into powder. We are again waiting for dashing pirates, intrigues, betrayals, politics, humor, unexpected turns and battles on swords, boarding and cannon salvos. Personally, after watching this series, I got a little carried away with the pirate theme, while I was still a schoolboy. For the generation of the nineties and the beginning of zero, these three words ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" give warmth and daring adventures, and we can endlessly revise the pictures in this series (well, the first three parts are so accurate), and get incomparable pleasure. And those who have not watched yet can at any time join our club. There are delusions and logical holes in the script, but I try not to pay attention to it.
4. Music - Hans Zimmer tried again, though he almost didn't bring any new melodies, but the music works so well for the atmosphere and mood of the picture itself.
5. Humor - eh Jack, you tease your interlocutors again, making the latter look not in the best light, but here you surpassed yourself. It's simply impossible to forget your phrases. And the rest of the characters contribute to the comedic part of this epic adventure.
6. Drama - here it is felt more strongly than in the previous picture, because the scriptwriters worked on the text, and the actors really tried. When I watched this picture for the first time, back in the cinema, at that moment there was deathly silence in the hall, and some girls even cried, I myself sat with a fallen jaw from what was happening on the screen, and I nearly let a tear go.
7. The final battle - an epic confrontation between pirates and the East India Trading Company, led by Lord Beckett has become a sort of battle of freedom and tyranny, well, or pick up any metaphor to your taste. Epic - is, fights on swords - are, gunfire is, boarding is, humor is, there are turns, there is drama, there is inspiring speech. What else do you need? Every time I get pleasure from the final battle, although I know how it will end. All boarding!
8. Final - the trilogy is over, some heroes have completed their journey (as it seemed then). It was necessary to finish the whole series on this grand and somehow happy note, but the director Gor Verbinski left his post after filming this part, from that moment the remaining two parts were shot by different directors, but the first three are my favorites.
The bold minus is to understand such a lot of nonsense and logical holes in the script that if you start to sort the picture into pieces, it will tear off the amount of that nonsense that the scriptwriters came up with in an attempt to bring everything together and at least somehow complete the stories of some heroes. I try not to notice them while watching, but they are visible with the naked eye.
A little about the main characters:
1. Captain Jack Sparrow performed by Johnny Depp is a joker and a joker, in this part he also became a little crazy, but with improvisation and thoughtful plans, everything is still fine. Johnny, as always, is great in this role!
2. Lord Cutler Beckett performed by Tom Hollander - the head of the East India Company, appeared in the previous picture. The main enemy of Jack and all the pirates, dreaming of world domination. Cool, prudent, skillfully uses the weaknesses of his enemies, and even with a slightly mysterious story. Tom very convincingly embodied the image of a scoundrel and a villain, overwhelmed by an insatiable thirst for power.
3. James Norrington performed by Jack Davenport - a kind of ""Professor Snape"" of the Caribbean, the former Royal Navy commander, who later became a pirate, and so on. His life shook, from an unprincipled fighter against piracy, he turned into an admiral who is not alien to the concepts of honor and conscience and nobility. For me personally, the most tragic hero who is torn between duty and heart. Jack - well done!
Hector Barbossa performed by Jeffrey Rush is pretty happy, in his jokes with Jack they make him laugh so hard. Will and Elizabeth - romance, where would you go without her!
Each hero is worthy of mention, but there is no time, and you need to round off.
If you choose your favorite picture from the entire series, then I have long leaned towards the first, but now I have made the final decision. The third part will be my favorite, despite the nonsense that it has. That childhood feeling was right.
The fees of this part were close to a billion, but we saw the next part only five years later, but you'll find out how it turned out from my next review, which will be in the near future.
As a result, we have a great epic adventure of Jack Sparrow and those involved, with great music and atmosphere, great acting, great humor, a fantastic final battle, but with a lot of nonsense.
My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The second film had left the series with an awesome cliff-hanger and I was desperate for resolution: Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has found himself in possession of Davy Jones' heart and now controls the Flying Dutchman, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had just been eaten by the Kraken, and the remaining pirates were about to embark on a mission to bring their captain back from Davy Jones' Locker with a little help from one of my favorite characters of the series...Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It's the conclusion to the PIRATES franchise and so now it's time to tie up all loose ends, and there sure is a lot of them.One of the primary complaints about this film is that it's entirely way to complex. I can't understand that complaint, and almost agree with it. At this point in the series, there are so many double and triple-crosses that it becomes almost a chore to keep up with it all. Upon seeing the film a few times, I've gotten a good grasp of it all and can now appreciate the depth the writers, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, managed to work into their trilogy. That's not to say the story's perfect, as there are a couple aspects I couldn't help but roll my eyes at. Jack Sparrow says it best in regards to the position of captain, ""They're giving the bloody title away now."" If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean, as the characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are elevated to unnecessary proportions. Throughout the series, I've never really cared much about Will, and Elizabeth was a fine supporting character but my attention was always drawn to Sparrow, Barbossa, and Jones. We now have all three of my favorite characters in the same film and the focus seems to shift to Elizabeth and Will.Despite this attention shift, the movie is still great entertainment. My favorite segment would have to be Sparrow's imprisonment in the Locker, in which he finds his personality each represented by another Sparrow and together they hopelessly crew a a grounded Pearl. I also enjoyed the sequence in which we are given a chance to view the Brethren Court of Pirate Lords and the colorful characters that populate the seas. Top it all off with an incredible final battle in the raging seas of a maelstrom and you've got some great fun. Depp, Rush, Naomie Harris (as Tia Dalma), and Bill Nighy (as Davy Jones) are worth seeing this film alone but it's also got the usual collection of talented supporting players. Seeing as how the film is complicated for first-time viewers and can be a challenge to watch at a (quick-paced) 2.5 hours, I wouldn't say this film is better than DEAD MAN'S CHEST but it's still a worthy addition to the series and a fine bit of closure.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And given the film's near three hour runtime, it leaves far more to the film than the title might imply. Yet this is rightfully so, given the introduced circumstances and cliffhanger ending to Dead Man's Chest. Going in the Matrix sequel route, At World's End saw itself released very shortly after its predecessor, especially for a sequel. Not surprisingly, both sequels to both franchises were met with very mixed reception, almost having nothing but lovers or haters of each of the films (unless I'm hearing talk of another Pirates of the Caribbean film series). That said, what's one more guy's opinion? The two things At World's End seems to demand of its viewers are patience and multiple viewings. For a first viewing, it's quite easy to get lost with the plot in how it seems to twist and turn all over the place and makes the lengthy runtime seem inadequate in regards to fleshing the story out. Due to this, the film can be argued to have some pacing issues, though after seeing the film enough times the story comes off as far more cohesive and doesn't seem nearly as uneven in its pacing as before. While watching the same two hour and forty-nine minute film multiple times might seem demanding, it's ultimately worth it in the long run.Other areas the film has drawn plenty of flak is in regards to the characters, the acting and dialogue. Yet this is another area I must respectfully disagree. While Depp and Rush might not be nearly as good or charming in this film as they were in Curse of the Black Pearl, they, as with the rest of the cast, do a more than sufficient job fitting back into their roles. Knightley definitely does her most charismatic acting in this film of the current Pirates trilogy (as of the writing of this review) which, admittedly can sometimes come off as over the top, though most of the time she fares well enough, and certainly a lot better than just about any other actress around her age would have. Orlando Bloom also at least deserves some credit for this film since he tackles a more down, serious and emotionally torn character. He's far from the best young actor out there, but as far as I'm concerned, he does a solid job in this film and, like Knightley, pulls off arguably his best acting job in the series. The rest of the supporting cast are just as well, with Bill Nighy standing out once again doing a great job as Davy Jones.Easily the film's greatest strength though is its entire presentation. The film is excellently shot, with little to no lack of great cinematography. As with its predecessors, the special effects are top notch, and we get plenty of this demonstration in the last action scene towards the end. Speaking of the action scenes, while there's not too many of them, what are present are definitely amazing, with the aforementioned final action scene being quite impressive. Yet it's the film's amazing score that really sells the picture. While it hasn't garnered much attention make no mistake the score pieces throughout the picture are wonderfully placed and used to great effect. Many scenes in the film work so well thanks to the superb score. Not many films seem to utilize the potential of fitting score placement well enough, but this film pulls it off with ease and can easily win you over just for that.Judging by what I've said, I think it's easy to determine my regards towards the film. One key reason for this is because this is a film that becomes more rewarding with each repeated viewing; another viewing lets me take notice of several things that really make this film so much more than the majority I've seen recently. Call it blasphemy, but I hold this film as superior to Curse of the Black Pearl and definitely higher than the sub-par Dead Man's Chest. This film feels more complete, doesn't suffer dragging on as much from multiple viewings (the one major weak point of the first film), has far less of the silly, unnecessary jokes which plagued the second film and wraps the trilogy's story arc up satisfyingly while leaving us curious as to what will happen next. Give the film the time and it will grow on you. Watch it once or little more than once and you'll likely hold in ""mid-series"" regard at best.

"5","/10","Confusing and too long","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1666669/?ref_=tt_urv","Superunknovvn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1390493/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2007","The trend must have been set with the two ""Matrix""-sequels: take a successful movie and expand it to a trilogy. Each of the sequels must clock in at 3 hours running time and the original simple story must be complicated as much as possible.""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" the latest (final?) entry in the world's most popular franchise is another example of this approach. Sure, even part 1 was structured strangely but it still worked as a movie everyone could understand. After having already forgotten last years ""POTC: Dead Man's Chest"" you'll have a hard time getting into the story in the first place. What are everyone's motives? Why did Captain Sparrow have to die? What's the meaning of the heart in the chest again? Even if you can remember the ongoings of part 2 well, part 3 will give you enough new story lines and plot points to confuse you completely. There are new pirate lord-characters and a previously unheard of goddess called Calypso. Everybody has a different agenda and after a while you have a hard time figuring out who is who, who is where and if things make sense at all.If this wasn't the third part of a well-established and overly promoted franchise it wouldn't have become a success. I doubt that most people could actually follow the storyline, but were merely laughing about the weird antics of Captain Sparrow, a character they have come to love so dearly for his wackiness. That alone is not enough to make a good movie. It's bad entertainment. Other characters like Norrington were underdeveloped and barely got any screen time at all. The romance between Will and Elizabeth was virtually ignored until it was clumsily hammered back into our heads in the final act of the movie. Just another badly established plot point in a weak script.Apart from the fact that ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" is overly intricate it is also unnecessarily drawn out. And hey, that reminds me of the other big blockbuster this year, ""Spider-Man 3"". It has been said before, but it must be said again: Hollywood needs to stop making bad sequel after bad sequel and start showing some originality again. Movies like ""POTC 3"" might make money, but they leave no doubt that right now we are at a new low of American film-making.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I remember his fortune after seeing the ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" Definitely it was a know-how in mainstream cinema, which I have never seen before. An exciting adventure that is not erased from memory even after a week. It seems that the story is over, Jack in freedom, Will and Elizabeth - the happy couple. But no ... Fast smeknuv that half-baked creation of the ""great and terrible"" Jerry Bruckheimer stable, and in huge quantities brings money, the producers began to stir, and three years after the premiere of ""Damnation ..."" presented to the audience, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" Compared with the first film, the story sequels (well trikvela the same time) has become more complex, confusing and murky. But no less interesting and exciting. After the appearance in the finals of a contented faces of Captain Barbossa and his faithful monkey phantom audience (I, anyway) and waited impatiently for the conclusion of this trilogy. A year later, we saw the conclusion ...""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" came out on Russian screens in May 2007 along with two other candidates in a record box office performance this season - namely, ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Spider-Man: The enemy of reflection."" However, the creation Verbinski has left behind (but not so far) of their competitors. ""At World's End"" - one of the most high-budget films in cinema history. The budget is nearly $ 300 million, most of which, apparently, went to the fees actors and special effects. Internationally, the picture has collected more than $ 900 million, so that Bruckheimer and co. with interest paid back on their expenses.The plot without distracting from the framework of the previous parts. In my opinion, that ""At World's End"" is the best film of the entire trilogy. The script is great. So many plot lines, curves fit in pretty solid timekeeping (169 min.)! Totally unpredictable, but because the painting imparts more ""credibility"", the ending is only good as the regular plans of Jack and Barbossa suggest a short extension (""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is put into production under the auspices of the director's Rob Marshall, creator of Oscar-winning musical ""Chicago"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha""). Cinematography (Dariusz Wolski) and music (Hans Zimmer) is not satisfactory. Everything was done professionally and efficiently. Developed special effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), so too write about it (just look at the world famous ""Star Wars"", ""Iron Man"", ""Transformers"" and the like blockbusters).The cast is really inspires his stardom. The main trio - is, of course, Depp, Bloom and Knightley. The first and the last kept a stiff upper lip, but Bloom, as in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" disappoint. Not a very strong game. Also like Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa), Tom Hollander (Cutler Beckett), Chow Yun-Fat (Xiao Feng), Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) and Naomie Harris (Tia Dalma / Calypso).In general we can write as much about this film and about the whole trilogy, but fact is fact: ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" will forever in movie history, at least for the simple reason that this story was born thanks to a new unique image of Jack Sparrow.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I admit it; I am one of the few who was not crazy about it. But after seeing ""Dead Man's Chest"", I grew intrigued by the mixture of high-seas action, mysticism and goof-ball comedy that this series provides. ""At World's End"" is a simultaneously hilarious and thrilling conclusion. The many plots which sometimes perplexed me also captivated me. My favorite one involves Davy Jones and his fall from grace from being the biggest bad-ass of the Ocean to a lackey and how it ties to a long ago romantic rejection. But Captain Jack Sparrow is also a masterful mixture of romantic hero and comic relief and I love not knowing what he is going to say or do next. He is the anchors that allows the film to be shamelessly silly without embarrassing the audience. It is also satisfying to see pretty much every character getting a decent wrap-up to their stories and that the filmmakers take the time to do this and not care about trying the audience's patience; those 169 minutes flew right by. The romantic pathos of Will and Elizabeth was so beautiful and epic in a wildly unexpected way. The waterfall and maelstrom sequences are exhilarating and the comic chemistry between Sparrow and Barbossa is pure magic as is the way Gore Verbinski makes the humor appealing to adults and kids as well. While the violence may frighten the wee ones, I like to think of this as a fairy tale adventure and some fairy tales are always a bit frightening. This is one of the best endings of a trilogy because it manages (for the most part) to do so many things at once and do it well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Expectations for the third were astronomical to say the least.All the gang is back this time, loose ends are tied up only to be loosened again at the end. The movie takes on a grander scale and its all about the big things, but the creators have continually put in the humorous dialogue, and lots of Jack Sparrow to lighten the mood.I've read many reviews from critics saying the movie was extremely confusing. I'm not a blatant fanboy - I went to this movie with a relaxed demeanour and I was able to understand everything. I mean, a lot of things happen but in no way are you scratching your head going ""I don't get it."" The movie is filled with twists and plot turns, secret plans, treachery, heroism and most of all, good ole Pirates. This one is unmissable, you will end up in the theatre or renting on DVD and loving every moment of it. The crowd cheered in the beginning (as they had in Spiderman-3) but the difference was, when the credits appeared, they gave the movie a standing ovation. All I remember at Spiderman-3 was a mob of people, rushing to get back to their cars and forget what a waste of $350 million that film was.And to cap it all off, Jack is back where he started, a familiar setting and perhaps a premise for a fourth film. Bravo Pirates, you've continued your brand of great action, humour that's going to keep audiences coming back for more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can only recall the the first 2 hours and 15 minutes or so being a bunch of pirates talking to each other, plotting, and cracking puns. The last half hour or so of obligatory battling was interrupted by dry, cheesy humor and slapstick violence. I guess that's what people love about the Pirates movies, but I hated it. It didn't have any flow. I didn't take it seriously, or feel any kind of connection to any of the characters. The special effects were the only redeeming factor, as a lot of visuals were flat out stunning to the eye. Elizabeth may be hot, but she just bounces around to any guy and starts making out, it seems like. She seems to be the obligatory girl, to throw in the obligatory love subplot.If you haven't seen any Pirates movies, don't even bother starting here. It's flat out lame.

Lord Cutler Beckett now has command of both Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman, and is using them as his weapons to exterminate piracy from the high seas once and for all. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, the resurrected Barbossa and the rest of the Black Pearl crew are in search of a way into Davy Jones' Locker, where Jack Sparrow currently is after being swallowed whole by The Kraken. Their journey has them cross paths with the vengeful Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) before they can pull Jack out of purgatory. But once Jack is back, he finds that it's not for the purposes he would've hoped. Will just wants Jack's ship so that he can use it to rescue his father from the clutches of Davy Jones, Elizabeth is looking to own up for the double-handed way she betrayed Jack, and Barbossa is only interested in returning Jack to the land of the living because it means that the legendary Brethren Court of Pirates can convene to formulate a plan of action; both Jack and Barbossa are Pirate Lords. However, it seems neither side can avoid the war that is brewing on the horizon as all the alliances between these characters grow shakier by the minute.Okay, so that's the most basic plot description of this movie I can write. If I were to go into any more detail, then we'd be here all day. The plot of this film is A LOT more complex than you'd expect in a pirate action-adventure movie, but that's what I love about it. Yes, you read right: love. So, let's get into this story, shall we?As I pointed out with Dead Man's Chest, the more intricate plotting winds up making the movie all the more interesting. There is so much going on here, that this movie doesn't merely ask for your attention, it DEMANDS it. And when talking about a big-budget, effects- driven blockbuster, that is something I both admire and respect a great deal. To answer the question that's probably on everyone's mind right now: no, I didn't find it confusing at all. It's an extremely easy movie to follow, really, and I appreciate how it doesn't feel the need to spoonfeed the audience every single, miniature detail. Plus, it has so much plot going on, that for a nearly 3-hour movie, At World's End rarely (if ever) feels like it's wasting time. Not only that, but the story moves along at a very nice pace and the movie never feels overlong.Though, I admit, your overall investment in this movie is determinate on how much you're invested in the characters and everything they're doing. Well, suffice it to say I love these characters, and find myself involved in every aspect of this movie every time I watch it. I care about Will and Elizabeth's troubled romance, I care about Will's burgeoning desire to free his father from Davy Jones, I care about the Pirate Council desperately fighting to maintain their way of life, and ultimately, I care about the fates of all the characters. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio's script gives nearly everyone something to do in the story, so nobody ever feels wasted, but more importantly, the script creates very interesting dynamics between all of them.Those dynamics are another part of what makes this movie so cool. Basically, everyone here is behaving exactly like what they are: pirates. And that's something that feels so natural, given the high stakes of the story. Survival is the predominant idea on every character's mind, and it's an idea that would make anyone in situations like these do what they have to in order to achieve it. Even if it involves unflattering betrayals (again, they're pirates; betrayal is as easy as breathing for them). This is most evident with Jack and Will, whose evolution in this movie I also love. So, call me crazy all you want, but I love this script. I also think it sports some great dialogue, as well as an effective opening scene.Getting back to the high stakes for a moment, this brings me to another point: just how BIG and EPIC this movie is. With a budget of $300 million, there's seldom a moment where you can't see the money on the screen. And that big, epic feeling is something I get wrapped up in all the time. At World's End has some fantastic set pieces and action sequences, but they're not there just for the hell of it; they're there because they're born organically out of the story. That, and they're a load of fun. I mean, just look at the sheer energy of that fantastic maelstrom climax. Not just in terms of action, but story as well, this movie is just huge, and I'm sure no other movie in the franchise will ever top this in that regard. Also, Hans Zimmer's score for this film is equally epic and amazing.Overall, I find Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to be the most misunderstood and under-appreciated blockbuster of the last couple of years.

As a die-hard fan of the series, I had high expectations, and this one definitely met them. I thought it was visually stunning and had a storyline far superior to Dead Man's Chest. Although At World's End didn't have much new to add, it did have the hefty task of wrapping up all the loose ends (and there were quite a few) that Dead Man's Chest produced. It did this wonderfully. The graphics and visuals, as usual, were stunning. One element of the movie that I really liked was the writers' technique of dividing the audience's sympathies. There wasn't one villain that I could intensely hate in one scene but then feel very sorry for in the next. One thing I didn't like was Keith Richards's cameo. It was so publicized and highly anticipated, but in the end he was given so little to do and some people in my audience didn't know that the man was Jack's father. The writers were definitely brave in writing a bittersweet ending that is definitely not happy or Hollywood-perfect. I also liked that they brought back Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. He added great comedic presence. All in all, this is my second-favorite of the trilogy and I loved it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I should also be pooping my pants over Johnny Depp's performance. For certain this is prime foddera fangasmfor Deppoholics all over the world and I'm happy the films have found their audience, but for the rest of us  how fun can this type of hubris-infested, over-the-top mess be?The answer is  well, sporadically fun. As a strong suit the aesthetics are something else: a regal buffet of ships against dramatic landscapes, drenched in absolutely top CGI. There are some vaguely cool lines, and the opening to the film is actually pretty classy. Regrettably, the can of story lines-worms clumsily opened by Dead Man's Chest presents At World's End with a troublesome, chock-full legacy that is bursting at the seems with characters and ideas, all of which Gore Verbinski shuffles into story lines like a Las Vegas croupier. He is not always apt however, and often (read: all the time) five or more different story lines are operating in the same scene, which is simply disorienting.The cumulative effect is that when four ships align to fight (The Pearl, the Flying Dutchman, The Armada, and Chow Yun Fat's vessel), you have no idea who is on them, why, where they are going, where their allegiances lay or what will happen. The latter is the only good unknown in this case. The bottom line is that the writers (and I use ""writers"" in the loosest sense possible, more like 4th grade sketchbook dribblers) are so overzealous with At World's End that in the end you are so desensitized to action- and story elements that nothing keeps your attention. So basically it's a lot like Dead Man's Chest except longer, bigger, and more chaotically organized  for 3 butt-numbing hours!It saddens me, lastly, what a commercial cash cow Johnny Depp has become in POTC. Every frame is milked its worth of Sparrow ""goodies"" (I've never found him funny, but I understand most viewers do). Not only does he occupy an unrealistically hefty slot of screen time, but his hallucinations following banishment has spawned mini-Jacks running around, often 10-15 at a time, all cracking one-liners and chewing scenery. Part of Sparrow's charm was his unique persona and consequently ability to stand out in a crowd, and with a screen that is awash with his clones, this feature severely wanes.4 / 10","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

For some reason that escapes me, the filmmakers seem to think that ramping complexity equates story, which isn't true. The plotting, which would have embarrassed me in a video game, seemed to have been written by a down-syndrome twelve year old hopped up on caffeine at two in the morning. It managed the somewhat rare feat of being not only stupid, but insanely complex: at one point, I think that Johnny Depp manages to double cross HIMSELF. There are so many alliances made and broken (in one seen, there is a QUADRUPLE cross; you can actually try to keep track if you wish, but you could also just bash your heads against a wall for all the reward you'll get). For some reason, the producers felt that making the film INCOMPREHENSIBLY complicated would make the film SMART, which simply isn't true.But at least, I thought, I'd sit through it for the effects, but the action sequences are too slick, too staged, and too illogical to be fun. While the second had the kraken and the escape from the island, all of the action sequences in the third are uninspired and forced, in a Disney sort of way. And, like the rest of the film, they're unnecessarily complicated. Insult is added to injury in that you're forced to sit through a number of ""inspiring"" speeches beforehand, including that most essential and contemporary element of modern blockbusters: the ""they can't take our freedom!"" scene.Unsubtle yet confusing, uninteresting yet bloated, this is the worst kind of big Hollywood drivel: trash that thinks it is something more, or at least tries to convince us of it. How insulting.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It continues the plot points of the previous Pirates of the Caribbean. It is to Dead Man's Chest like Avengers Endgame is to Avengers Infinity War. They're both about the same villain and deals with the aftermath of the previous one. I feel like it does stretch everything out between the two films, with the two films being a little over 5 hours long back to back and them covering the same conflict throughout. I feel like if you enjoyed Dead Man's Chest, you could like this one as well, if you feel like you could handle the story of it going on for about another 2 and a half hours.

I didn't get much of a plot, or anything for that matter, but I found all that swooshing and space battles and laser sword-fighting quite amusing. I did get a sense that the black helmet dude was sort of a bad guy, and all that handsome people the good ones, but that was more or less it.So I gotta hand one thing to Pirates 3 - they really made me feel like that kid again. I was sitting in the movie theater, enjoying all that fancy sword fights, chases, explosions, storms and whatnot and 95% of the time I absolutely had no idea what the heck was going on.Let's face it - Pirates 3 is a confusing mess. In fact, Pirates Trilogy is a confusing mess. The first movie was great as a standalone, but further down the road the plot became twisted, mangled, doubled over and tied to a triple Gordian knot. I suppose not even the script writers know what they want to say - every character seems to have his own motivations not even known to them completely, everybody double-crosses everybody, mystical objects, rules and characters get suddenly introduced, expanded and more often then not totally contradicted... as I said, in one word - mess.Pirates trilogy could really work great as a party game - watch all the movies, divide in teams and every team should try to explain the storyline and fill out all the whos and whats and whys. Fun for the whole family.Did I enjoy Pirates 3? Sure I was. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always a joy to behold and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is probably the most swashbuckly arrr-talkingly pirate character ever put on screen. Bill Nighy squeezes out the most out of his quite one-dimensional character. The special effects are great and the piratey theme is spot on. Soundtrack is also proverbially good. There are quite a few jokes that do work. The movie passes by quickly, despite it's almost three hour duration.But I cannot help but wonder whether the same characters could have been used in much more down-to-earth situations, in some less extravagant and more understandable plots where they could develop more naturally instead of using them just as convenient placeholders for whatever the relentless plot requires next.Pirates could have been a great serial, but it seriously failed the expectations. Good casting is the only thing now that saves it from being downright tiresome. I'm not saying you should not watch this, you definitely should, it is essentially good old Hollywood popcorn cinema - just don't expect too much, and leave your brain at home. Savvy?","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is simply phenomenal. His portrayal of the quirky and unpredictable pirate is both hilarious and endearing. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa brings a commanding presence to the screen, while Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley deliver strong performances as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann respectively.The visual effects in this movie are absolutely stunning. The elaborate set designs, breathtaking landscapes, and thrilling action sequences make for a visually stunning experience. The attention to detail is remarkable, and it truly transports you into the world of pirates and adventure.Another highlight of this film is the brilliant writing. The dialogue is witty and clever, filled with humor and memorable one-liners. The plot is intricately woven, keeping you engaged and guessing until the very end. The character development is also commendable, as we see the growth and evolution of each character throughout the film.Furthermore, the film's score by Hans Zimmer is simply outstanding. The music perfectly complements the action on screen, creating a sense of excitement and intensity. It adds an extra layer of depth to the overall viewing experience.While I thoroughly enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, there were a few minor flaws that prevented me from giving it a perfect score. At times, the plot felt slightly convoluted, with multiple storylines and characters to keep track of. Additionally, the runtime of the film is quite long, which may be a bit overwhelming for some viewers.Overall, I would rate Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End a solid 8.5 out of 10. This film is a thrilling adventure that combines action, humor, and a touch of romance. It is a perfect conclusion to the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, leaving the audience satisfied and wanting more. I highly recommend watching it, especially if you are a fan of the franchise or enjoy epic adventure films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can say, to me, that is was not quite as good as the first two films. Each of the well known characters seemed to be a bit more bizarre, ""out-there"", to me. Maybe it's because they have gone through so much in (as we saw in the first two films), maybe it's because of where they currently are and their situations as the 3rd movie picks up? Whatever it is, all of the characters seems to act very strangely in this 3rd film installment - or maybe it's just my own personal perception.PotC: At World's End is well worth watching and a must see for fans of the film series.8.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

OK, it still runs a little longer than it ideally would and the plot still is a little more complicated than necessary, but these flaws barely register as everything else is amplified to the level of ultimate awesomeness. stunning cinematography, gorgeous costumes and sets, dazzling special effects and action scenes... the visuals are just mind-blowing. the movie also has a darker and more epic tone than the previous entries that makes it feel significant; fortunately, it still keeps a healthy sense of humor.the characters still are what makes this franchise so great. Johnny Depp (as Jack Sparrow) remains the star and he has great chemistry with newly returned antagonist Geoffrey Rush (captain Barbossa). but the biggest surprise is Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) as her character finally gets developed the way she deserves. she now definitely isn't the typical romantic interest/damsel in distress anymore, and Knightleys impressive performance gives the film a subtle, very welcome feminist undertone. more fantastic characters are introduced, most notably Chow Yun-Fat as Captain Sao Feng and Keith Richards as Captain Teague. my secret favorites, however, are Lian and Park (the twin-girls in the first scene with Yun-Fat) and mistress Ching of the Brethren court.so, despite its flaws, at worlds end is so awesome that I've actually enjoyed it more than the original pirates of the caribbean. if this is the end of the franchise, its a graceful exit. if they'll keep making sequels, i can only hope that they'll be as great as this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","I wanted to like it, but the film falls off the map","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2957329/?ref_=tt_urv","C22Man","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47682215/?ref_=tt_urv","8 February 2014","There are certain films that you really want to like because of anticipation and expectation, but the overall delivery leaves you feeling very disappointed. The third film in the Pirates of the Caribbean saga is one of those films for me. I think they tried too hard to change something that wasn't broken by trying to make the film into a colossal epic instead of letting it be an enjoyable swashbuckler.The story follows on from the last film as Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa sail to the edge of the world in order to save Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. But the sinister Cutler Beckett has control of Jones' heart and with it he aims to control the seas as well as put an end to piracy. This leads to the nine pirate lords, Jack included, having to use the mysterious Calypso to make a stand against Beckett and Jones which leads to a lot of inner conflicts. That is just the outline of the plot, so as you can tell that is a lot going on and that is the stories biggest fault. Far too much is going on here. The story becomes needlessly complex to the point where you can't follow it and therefore you no longer care about what is going to happen. Plus the horribly bloated running time does nothing in the way of creating a more coherent narrative.As noted the main problem with the film is that it is excessive in every area and it is clear that the writers have forgotten what made the other two movies so entertaining. The film just feels really bloated, it is almost three hours long and boy does it feel it. Instead of using this time to develop the story, it just adds more into the already too complex mix and keeps on bringing more conflict that adds nothing to the film. By the middle of the film it is almost impossible to know how the characters are feeling or what they're motivations are.Even the characters are not as good as before. Johnny Depp is still amusing and enjoyable as Jack Sparrow, putting plenty of energy into the role and delivering some really funny lines. The problem is that there is a little too much Jack here. At times it is like the writers only really cared about Jack and therefore there are lots of scenes concentrating on him doing nothing in particular, such as when he is the locker. As I've said before Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom do nothing for me, sure they look the part but their acting is bland and not engaging enough. Geoffrey Rush makes a welcome return as the surly Barbossa and he gets a few good moments. Tom Hollander is still nicely slimy as Beckett and Bill Nighy carries on forming Jones into a complex character. Sadly Chow Yun-fat and Jack Davenport are wasted by being giving almost nothing to do, whilst the crew don't have as many comic moments to shine as they have before.The films attempts at changing tone also fall flat on its face. I mean the first two films had dark elements but they still had lots of fun and felt somewhat grounded, but At World's End tries to go way too dark or strange at times and it just feels misplaced. Being the film with a child being hung doesn't fit into this world at all. It just feels like the film is trying to copy of others by becoming this serious epic. As said it is too 'out there' for its own good sometimes. When there are multiple Jack's running around in the locker, all the stuff with crabs moving ships and a sea version of Jack licking a brain, what on earth is this? It's clear that the film is trying way too hard to be taken seriously, forgetting that the fun tone make the previous features.The jokes when used are tired too. There's only so many jokes that you can build around Rum before they become stale. The 'tension' is back between Jack and Elizabeth, the problem being that it has been done to death and is about as amusing as standing on a plug. The dialogue is no longer witty and well-paced, I can't really recall any funny lines presented here. Going back, the characters motivations are all over the place. Jack just seems to be here for the ride, Elizabeth is jumping between a dozen men and Will just wants to stab everyone in the back, there is no lead here that we can really get behind. The two most likable people were the villains from the first film, which kind of says it all.Was there anything good here? Well yes. The visuals are stunning at times, the locker especially looks amazing and the seas are as wonderfully vast as ever. But given this is the most expensive movie ever that is a given. Plus when the film stops its muddled plot, the action is fantastic. It has everything, great swordfights, intense sea battles and the climax itself looks incredible as well as having some really good action set-pieces. But these pieces cannot save the mess created, only make you wish the other parts were as good.So At World's End really comes across as a massive let-down. The story is so muddled that it is virtually impossible to follow and there are so many turns that by the end of the film I couldn't have cared less over what was going on. The film is certainly wasted potential, instead of concluding in true enjoyable style we are left with a muddled mess of a film, where even its positives are massively clouded by all the problems it has.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I loved how light hearted and fun the first two movies were. They were the perfect escape from the day to day grind. So I was very excited to see the concluding number 3. The movie started off good with first the search for Captain Sao Feng, and later the trip to save Jack Sparrow from Davey Jones locker. After that the movie began to go downhill. Where had the light hearted atmosphere gone, where had the fun gone. Also as the movie progressed I began to dislike Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann more and more. Most of the time I love movies that make me feel any kind of strong emotion. But, all Worlds End made me feel was frustration at all the self centered back stabbing. Also the writers decided to change important plot points as the movie went along (I won't mention them here ""spoilers"" but if you are anything like me they will make you mad). It was almost as if they were writing during the filming. The best part of the film was the battle scene in the end which was truly amazing. Im afraid it was not enough to make up for the rest of a picture that lacked any kind of focus. The ending is also I felt no way to end my second favorite trilogy of all time. LOTR of course being first. In the end I will say it must be seen by anyone who loved the first two movies if only to add closure. Be warned it will only bring disappointment.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

That being said, there are a lot of things wrong with it. First of all, the storyline is far too complex and confusing to be understood on the first viewing. Or the second viewing, or the third... I've seen it loads of times and I still don't really get it. There are so many deals and agreements and betrayals that it's impossible to figure out who's on who's side and when. Secondly, it's a bit too long. And thirdly, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley cannot act to save their lives, but bless 'em for trying. This doesn't matter so much, though, because they have Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush to pick up the slack.The way I recommend watching this film in order to get maximum enjoyment out of it, is simply to NOT try and understand the storyline. Just watch, and the gorgeous cinematography and funny dialogue between the characters will do the rest. In a word, this film is EPIC. And fancy. Very fancy. Lots of awesome outfits and special effects and fight scenes. And it's got Johnny Depp in it. That just spells out entertainment, no matter how many plot holes there are. Despite this not being the film of the year, it's certainly worth seeing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The opening scene, where the East India Trading Company flag overshadows the Union Jack while a procession of people is led to the gallows for being guilty by association, is as powerful as it is subtle. The scene's small defiance, where the damned sing, is the first of many payoffs of the trilogy's overarching theme of resistance against colonialism and its effects on the world map.These films are replete with exotic and racist portrayals of adventure stories, including black and indigenous cannibals, bullish African crewmates, and a classic Hollywood example of lumping a bunch of Asian actors of various nationalities together as a monolith. However, this film takes it to a whole new level by portraying a truly multicultural coalition that stands up to the very powers that would seek to reduce them to such stereotypes. While this doesn't negate Verbinski's willingness to play with such images, it adds layers to these characterizations in a series where all the islands where these people live bear the Spanish and English names given to them by their conquerors. Verbinski's anti-conquest themes have an ambivalence that feels more honest than the usual Hollywood handwringing.The plot is absurd; it's like someone removed all the philosophy from the Matrix sequels but kept the anime logic. However, the afterlife scenes with dimension-hopping boats and crab hallucinations are entertaining, and the overstuffed climax that includes a wedding in the middle of a massive fight within a whirlpool and a heartbroken octopus crab man who isn't even the villain anymore is a spectacle to behold. Everyone's fantastic here, from Knightley leaning into a more hardass, unrepentant killer to Bloom giving Will some egomaniacal spine and even down to Chow Yun-Fat making the most of a limited part by offering that weird mix of stone-cold killer and oozing slimeball charisma that makes him so great.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were so many characters, all with their own elaborate plots and motivations but not in a ""Wow, this movie is so beautiful and complex"" kind of way. More in a ""What the hell is happening? Why are they doing that?"" kind of way. It seemed like they tried to throw in as many characters and plots as possible and that would make the best film, but it turned out horribly. I spent half the time being completely confused as to whom was fighting whom and for what reason, and everyone just popped in and out of the situations and disappeared back into nowhere with no real explanation. The addition of this insane amount of pirate lords just made me wonder where all of these characters were in the first two films when everyone was fighting over an enormous amount of gold and being destroyed by The Flying Dutchman. Speaking of The Flying Dutchman, the fact that they actually managed to make Davey Jones frightening in the first film was ruined by making him a pushover in this one, just like every other character.The acting is all outrageously flat or completely artificial, sans Geoffrey Rush who unfortunately came back for this one. It just always felt like the characters knew ten times more about the situation than we did and the audience was supposed to look past that because of all the cool explosions. Every character had in-depth plots and backstories but we see two seconds of that and then move on to the next person. The humor is virtually gone, with a few laughs here and there but for a franchise that builds itself on mixing quirky humor with big action it's lacking in the comedy and tries to make up for it by increasing immensely with the action. Depp, who generally provided all of the comic relief in the first two, is stuck doing lame schtick where he sees different versions of himself that made me laugh...once. That being said it still manages to be entertaining for the parts where I wasn't completely lost and I actually liked the ending, even though it felt like it was never going to come. A letdown, surely.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it was a fun action movie with great acting from Rush and Depp. Heck, even Orlando was O.K.Now the final movie in the trilogy is a very confusing movie. I admit i didn't ""get"" the plot when i first watched it. THe sheer amount of characters is amazing. We have Jack Sparrow, Turner, Swan, Barbossa, Norrington, Davy Jones, Calypso and more... That's right. The movie has so many main characters and so many side-characters it get's totally lost. Before the end i didn't know who was supposed to be the good guy, who was this calypso and where did she come from, why is Jack doing certain things etc. I read they didn't start shooting with a finished script and i must say, it shows. Introduction of a major character in the last part of the movie, with no mention of the character in previous films. You can just see it was a last minute decision. So after re-watching the second and this part, reading the FAQ here, i ""got"" the plot. It's not that the film requires too much thinking to be understood, this isn't 2001 Space Odessey, it's just complicated due to bad script writing.As for the acting, the only one i liked was Rush. He does just the right amount of silly acting whilst others don't do so well. Depp is back and is a bit annoying as Sparrow. He almost made the first movie, while here he's a bit too wacky. An idiot at times. Orlando Bloom's character is confusing, since now he's pirate? What's the point? He was supposed to be the upstanding, honest guy. Doesn't bring much to the table. Knightly is just plain bad. Don't think it has much to do with her but more with the script. She came from a lady turned semi-pirate, in the first movie, to Xena the warrior princess in this one. It's really stupid the way she gives a motivational speech to the pirates about their battle for freedom (pirates=freedom get it?). And the constant shot's of her shouting ""FIRE"" just so out of character...On the whole, the trilogy shouldn't have been made. The first movie was a light fun movie. The second was effects heavy and started to complicate things. Didn't have the charm of the first and Sparrow turned into an idiot. The last is just plain bad.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

""At World's End"" ended up being way too long, dull, and far-fetched. Many parts of this film are just pathetic. The first scene with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in this film, in which he is seen in Davy Jones' Locker surrounded by a bunch of clones of himself, is one of the most ridiculous excuses for a movie scene I have ever seen. There are so many side stories in this film that I just couldn't keep up with all of them. It is a very long and confusing film with few moments that hold my attention. The scene where the characters turn their ship upside down has good photography and special effects, but it is still a useless concept for a scene. Also, the bits of humor in this film are also pretty lame, compared to the ones in the first two films. These jokes suffer from poor delivery and poor writing in the first place. Every time you think this film is about to end, there is another boring scene coming your way. I don't even know why I rated it as high as I did. Obviously, this film and the previous one are meant to be seen back-to-back, or you will be likely to forget who half the characters are, as I did. Not really worth watching. Stick with the first two.** out of ****","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Several different BAD movies. The acting was horrible. The dialogues were ridiculous...I laughed at Keira Knightley's monologue in one of the first episodes...and it wasn't supposed to be funny. Even Johnny Depp, whom I adore, wasn't good...but then again, what can a good actor do with a horrid script and ridiculous lines? Only so much.

A near-perfect adventure film. The second was a bit heavy on special effects, but still enjoyable and memorable. Along comes ""At World's End"" and it seems things have gone downhill rapidly. Here are the reasons to avoid this film:OVERUSE OF SPECIAL EFFECTS: Too many scenes say, ""Hey, look what we can do with computers!"", rather than focusing on compelling action and characters. At times it feels more like a sci-fi movie than a pirate adventure.PLOT: Way too convoluted and repetitive. There are far too many scenes of characters creating overly-complicated deals with each other, only to pull a classic double-cross 15 minutes later. This happens roughly, oh, I'd say, about 1 billion times in this film. They're all pirates and can't be trusted. I got the point the first time.A BOATLOAD OF CHARACTERS: The film tries to keep all the characters from the first two installments, while adding a bunch of new characters. At some point, there are just too many people running around on screen.AN OVERLY-LONG RUN TIME: The first two movies were not short films by any means, but still seemed to fly by. This one is the longest of the bunch and bogs down in many areas. Instead of clever adventure sequences we get tedious, endless dialogue that doesn't really satisfy the audience.If you're a fan of the first two films, it's hard to avoid the desire to see this one. Just be ready for a big disappointment compared to its predecessors. The end of this movie (rather obviously) sets up a fourth installment in the series. Here's hoping they get back on track with that one, although I'm not terribly interested in seeing any more of the ""Pirates"" series. With ""At World's End"" the series has overstayed its welcome.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

For beginners, the movie's opening scene which shows people including children being hanged should act as a metaphor for the next 168 minutes of terror.A $300 million dollar budget, and for what? Huge CGI battle sequences with characters I couldn't give a monkeys about fighting each other, well actually I take that back because I don't even know what they're fighting about. This movie is like the First World War, nobody knows what it's all about. I enjoyed the first installment of this franchise was disappointed with the sequel due to its incomprehensible plot but At World's End goes beyond that. I literally don't have a clue what is going on. Whose side anyone is on? Who's that guy? Why are they going to this place? What's that thing? Even reading the movie's plot on Wikipedia I can't get my read around it but then again they did start shooting the film before a script was completed.While I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance in the first two movies here he is, no apologies, annoying; very, very annoying. When we are first introduced to Jack Sparrow in this film it isn't just one Jack Sparrow, there are dozens of Jack Sparrows and they won't shut up. Too much a good thing, way too much! One scene which particular aggravated me is when a bunch of characters are sitting around a table debating who knows what and it goes on for an eternity. It's like 12 Angry Men, except it's not and there's only one angry man, me, watching the dam thing. I tend to avoid using the word hate unless I really mean it but few other movies have enraged me as much as this ""movie"".

The production strains for bigger and better effects as it goes, from a ship that moves on millions of crabs, to Jack's multi-personality split, to Calypso's giantess metamorphosis, to the final ships' battle on the edge of a raging maelstrom, they just numbingly keep coming at you, interspersed with lots of deliberately exaggerated ham acting and weak attempts at humour.The actors all have a great time, as you'd expect although it's odd that the likes of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom all seem to garner more screen-time than the headlining Johnny Depp although any reversal wouldn't have made much difference.

In short, they made a plondering mess whose only bright spot is its occasional humor and not selling out to a traditional fairy tale ending. From the start, there's the ridiculous attempt at making a political statement in the opening scenes where the pirates and their allies are being hanged. See, they may be murderous, thieving, bloodthirsty people but they had their civil liberties taken away so now they're the good guys. This was the writers attempt to justify why exactly were supposed to NOT want the world to be rid of pirates, but it just came off as lame. Later in the film, Elizabeth attempts a 'William Wallace' like speech to rally the pirates to fight for their freedom which was equally if not more so lame. Then there's Barbossa, who was a fantastic villain in the first movie; now, he's not such a bad guy after all and in fact seems to become everyones pal. What a waste of a great character (he has the best line in the movie however, when Elizabeth and Will want to get married). The entire Calypso plot line was boring; it just seemed made up for this movie to give our heroes a convenient way to beat Davey Jones, though they try to sell it as if it had been mentioned before in the previous films. I didn't buy it, but I'll admit a 50 foot tall woman who turns into crabs does make me shudder.The film is not without merit; there are some genuinely funny moments (the monkey pretty much steals them all)and the acting is adequate. Much has been made of Keith Richards cameo role as Jacks father, when I saw it you could hear people drawing their breathe when he was about to appear (its telegraphed the whole way) but it was an underwhelming moment at best. If you're like me and had forgotten just how ugly Keith Richards actually is, then you'll be immediately reminded. I enjoyed the big ending battle for the most part, though it does get rather unbelievable even for a movie. It was also unbelievable that Lord whathisname went down without firing a shot. I give it 4 stars, and I feel that's being charitable. Of course, the kids and the die-hard fans will love it, and that's who the movie is really for and they'll ensure it makes a gazillion dollars and gets big votes here on IMDb. However, anyone objectively viewing this film will know better. Lets hope they resist the urge to make another sequel.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The three hours it took until I was released from the drivel were less enjoyable than a visit at the dentist to have a tooth extracted. Given it's good predecessors I can't fathom what drove the writer, director and editing people to produce an incomprehensible, twisted and long winding but in some main plot lines open ended film. The visual effects may be stunning but are in the end blasting everything away that might have passed as enjoyable plot line. At times I was missing a laughing track, at least then I would have known which was intended as humour and what was a vain attempt at keeping you occupied.That will be one film trilogy which will not be complete in our DVD collection.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

First off, if you have not seen the previous episodes forget about making sense out of it. I thought there was an unwritten rule that you are supposed to say what has happened in previous episodes if it is important to know them to understand the action in the present movie. This utter contempt for the viewer who may want to catch up withe episodes.But why bother? Whatever the story might have been seems to be totally incoherent and relying on a massive suspension of disbelief. I can go up to a point in suspension of disbelief but a multiplicity of Johnny Depp's come now are we all five year olds. Pirates coming back from the dead, when did that genre gravitate from swashbuckling and chivalry to zombies and the netherworld. Which brings me to my last comments; what a giant waste of talent. The creation of children's movies (for adults with child level stupor ) now means that serious actors end up playing foolish unbelievable yarns. That's sad. I've seen Depp in good movies like the Libertine and Chocolat. Is he really that hard up for money that he has to play stuff that requires all the skills of an actor in a ""grand guignol"" sort of play. This movie is prototypical of the state of the industry, a ton of money spent to create a bad children's movie. Harry Potter, Shrek, spider Man, Superman, Batman 28 Weeks Later, Cars. If we like that kind of entertainment, it's no wonder we are fast asleep as a nation in fantasy when a war of aggression is perpetrated by our leaders.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

As a child pirates were exciting figures of romance and adventure, in this film we have people who look like pirates spouting inane expositional dialogue for nearly three hours. The jokes are overwrought and clumsy, continuously relying on the 'oh so hilarious' pause followed by one of the 'funny' characters piping up with a 'random' comment - the hilarity of it. The funniest moment of my movie-going experience was listening to all the expletives leaving people's mouths as they trudged out of the cinema, bored stupid.It's sad because i really enjoy fantasy films when they're done properly.

As it turned out  try as I might; it would've taken an effort that goes beyond the description of 'mammoth' for me to actually like this film  cinema viewing or no cinema viewing.Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is an absolute mess; it's an abomination and an insult to film as a whole. It manages to give the term 'summer blockbuster' a bad name which is, in truth, a new filmic low. The film is loud, over the top, messy, far too 'twisty and turny' and drags on and on and on to the point where you just don't care any more  you literally stop caring as to what's going to happen and this is a shame as the visually spectacular final fight scene is wasted  you can't have a fantastic sandwich if the bread is great but the filling is two weeks out of date.In Pirates of the Caribbean, (or Pirates 3 as it's also known) we are 'treated' to scenes in which the characters talk about absolutely nothing, people betray and backstab others before forgiving them and making up without so much as an eyebrow flinch and the actual structure of the film for the first two hours at least consists of: 1. Scenes involving Swann (Knightly) and Turner (Bloom) and their romance that seems like it will never happen given their missions in the film; 2. Jack Sparrow's (Depp) seemingly unreal foray into some sort of purgatory in which he acts like he's in a dream state and sees things that are psychically impossible. And, 3; the scenes chopping back to the un-dead sailors that are headed by Davy Jones (Nighy) and their uneasy truce with the British soldiers. First of all, two hours of this formula: '1,2,3; 1,2,3; 1,2,3' tests you  it really, really tests you. It tests your interest, your patience, you ability to even care and very quickly, I found myself completely detached to what was going on.Second, if all those crabs that carried Sparrow's boat from the desert and into the sea were made to look like they were in his mind, how is it possible for the others stranded on the beach to see it happen? This is an example of Pirates 3 breaking reality and just using the impossible as an excuse to either fill up time, instigate action scenes or crack dumb jokes. Un-dead, fish-like sailors I can take but things like this make you laugh at the film.This brings me onto the humour. No line of dialogue in this film made me laugh. Quite a few people around me in the cinema laughed but it really wasn't funny  I have to question whether it is me or them that has a problem. I like to think I have a sense of humour but this was really bottom of the barrel stuff. The only time I laughed was when a dwarf fires a musket, can't take the blowback and thus flies backwards. Some others laughed too, but what made me think afterwards was that we were all laughing at someone's disability and inability to do something  like laughing at a guy with really small arms trying to light a cigarette or something.Other things I hated: Keith Richards' appearance which acted a blatant attempt at a pop-culture reference (I expect about 70% of people watching this film wont even know who he is), the fact the film plays out like a cartoon more than a film, the fact the film can't decide if it's going to include violence or cut away just as something happens, the way Calypso's subplot of being freed was even included (she's not the focus, we don't see enough of her to give a damn) or about the fact a wedding ceremony takes place at the most inconvenient of times.If you like loud, overblown action sequences that have characters defy gravity  you'll absolutely love the end fight scene but I was just begging for it to end. One last thing: mid way through the film a character says to the other about Sparrow: 'Do you think he plans these things or makes it up as he goes along?' I was thinking the same thing about the screenwriter.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And not only is it l-o-n-g it's boring, at least until the final spectacular battle. Ugly characters who you don't care about pontificate on matters that aren't real in ways that are entirely predictable to anyone who's seen more than a handful of Hollywood blockbusters. Scenes of dialogue drag on and on, occasionally interspersed with a brand of humour that was already overly familiar in the '50s. At least it's all quite good natured I suppose, with less of the mean streak that runs through many Hollywood products. The problem with this movie is that it is determined from the outset to be an EPIC in every way, like its predecessors. Hence everything is bloated, there's no subtlety, no nuances, no gentle wit, no human characters. Nothing matters in it, not even death. I am amazed the writers didn't die of boredom from plugging away at their unfathomable, choppy, leaden script that they were ordered to deliver. It is with weary inevitably that this by-numbers blockbuster will go on to make millions of pounds, perhaps even more than Spider-Man 3, a vastly superior, significantly individual and far fresher film. Pirates of the Caribbean isn't about movie making, it's about money making.","76 out of 353 found this helpful.

Fresh and original with smart dialog and an impressive cast. The third, and to a lesser extent the second, are merely parodies of the first, milking as much as possible from the success of the first in terms of box office bonanza. This third entry is a mishmash of plots and subplots. The characters, so well-defined and charismatic in the first, are weakly written caricatures of themselves. Obviously, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on special effects, costumes, sets and talent. I am sure the script was not inexpensive. However, the dialog is wanting and the desire to inject twists and turns in the (many) plots makes it tiring, if not difficult to follow. The much-anticipated appearance of Keith Richards falls flat. I get the feeling that several people had ideas for scenes that were thrown together into one, final script. I truly could not wait for it to end. A major disappointment to me, but obviously a huge commercial success. Based on the box office success, there will be a fourth installment. Wait for the DVD. At least you can pause it once in a while and get up and stretch.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Jack seems to have multiple personalities; he goes from quirky to intelligent to demented to serious to ridiculously silly, which gets tiresome. Honestly, my favorite character is Barbossa; at least he's consistent and excellently portrayed by Geoffrey Rush. All of the acting is really very good except Keira Knightley; she is truly an awful actress. She over acts, under acts, makes ridiculous faces and alternatively stands around like a tree stump.

That I watched it all was proof that it was entertaining but at the end of the movie I turned to the wife and said: ""Wow, I didn't think they could make s**te like this"". She was asleep! The first two movies were funny and brain-dead entertainment which I like to watch on occasions and while this had some funny moments it was far too dark to be entertaining. I am not going to spoil the plot but it seemed to me that the movie was put together to merely tie up the odds and ends of the first two and if that was the case they could have done it with a five-minute segment at the end of part two. Depp is still good, though, as is Rush but the rest of the cast are now just annoying, especially Knightley, who was better in the first two. Disney are now just peeing me off at the moment. My daughter watches a lot of Disney on VHS and even she is disappointed with some of the latest offerings from the company.

It was a very confusing movie with something to say, but nothing for anyone to hear. The first one of the trilogy was good, the second one was OK, but the third one was the one they never should have done. It is a good movie if you really like the theme, but otherwise, avoid it. The script and plot are too difficult and too artist. You want to see a real good adventure film, and what you end up is a really hard to follow sea mystic document. I would advise to give this film a miss.They tried to make it better than the earlie ones, but they failed.

They should all add up to more than before, right? Wrong. This is the approach the film takes and the result is a confusing mess of disjointed sequences embellished with an excess of unbelievable special effects, punctuated by pithy one liners. It wasn't more than half way into this movie that I began to squirm in my seat realizing if I sat through this I'll see everything but the kitchen sink. The movie goes everywhere in space and time, does everything, contains characters from every country, and in the end will leave you with little... because the formula here is simple: do it all! They are hoping that it will seem so exciting and full of action we''ll forgive them for forgetting to write a proper script! If a disjointed special effects extravaganza with little substance (and entertainment) is for you, then don't miss it. In actors' speak, ""Less is more"" referring to subtlety and the danger of over-acting. Unfortunately for us, reversing the order of words in this adage is also true.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

That kind of criticism is ridiculous of course, the second Pirates movie was far worse than that, but assuming he judged the scale of the artistic degeneracy correctly, At World's End is just that  the end of the friggin' world.It's fair to say that the original film was far better than an adaptation of a theme park ride had any right to be, though the script for Alton Tower's ghost train is rumoured to be incredible  apparently Robert Towne's greatest since Chinatown. Its pantomime humour and breezy swashbuckling plot felt like a fresh wind blowing through a room of soul crushing sequels. Johnny Depp hammed it up and somehow captured the admiration of the entire world; the world showcasing its egregious taste in the process. An Oscar nomination followed, that's right an Oscar nomination for Christ's sake, which thankfully didn't translate to a win but nevertheless seemed, like the box office, out of all proportion to the quality of the film that had been made. It was not too bad, overlong and an intermittently exciting affair. Orlando Bland and Kiera Knightley provided the good looks and teeth but characterisation was a plush bounty that remained hidden and on the evidence that made it into cinemas, safe from seeking filmmakers.Disney couldn't quite believe how much it had made, which made two of us and sticking to the business model now well established in light of Back to the Future and the Matrix, two sequels were green lit to be made back to back to maximise the potential box office and allow two visits to the well while the series was still popular.So, inevitably the tonic to those summer sequels of many a year ago is now responsible for summer sequels of its own. Talk about irony sitting on your face without invitation and jostling from side to side.The problem with making two sequels back to back is that the temptation, so far irresistible to the 'creatives' at the helm, is to make one long film and split it in two. This way you give the audience an incentive to return for the second sequel, effectively locking them into it. It's a bad move, principally because the second film is inevitably open ended and the third, lacking a self-contained plot, begins abruptly and relies on the audience's foreknowledge of characters and incident to work. Artistically you may think it would be better to make two self-contained movies with their own resolved story lines  perhaps the merest hint of a joining plot thread deftly inserted to act as that cliffhanger. Well, wouldn't you? But Disney didn't do that and so at World's end begins where the old film left off with all manor of plot threads bleeding in from the previous movie. The finished film just sort of meanders along, joining up the characters, then splitting them up, then uniting them again while contrivance buggers incident follows setpiece and repeats en route to the show stopping conclusion. It's so long that when the certificate came up I'm pretty sure there were real pirates still on the high seas and that the cinema I was sitting in was just the lunatic daydream of an old seadog, albeit a seadog with an extraordinary scientific imagination.Initially it seems as if the middle tenet of a pirate's life  rum, sodomy and the lash, is missing from the series all together but as the third part went on you realised it was there alright, just symbolically afflicting the audience. Did Verbinski have his script and film editor killed? On this evidence someone should be looking into it. A DVD of this would surely be enough to send Gore to the gallows.One area that should be praised however, is ILM's special effects which are simply superb and occasionally, and somewhat impressively in this era of CGI saturated boredom, genuinely exciting to look at. The film's climax, which comes sometime during the movie's 15th hour, is a triumph of computer animation and pyrotechnic excess. The sheer all consuming nature of it and the pace at which every digitally stuffed frame is cut together, is the right side of breathtaking and yes, a ship cannoned to destruction in slow motion as it's captain walks down her stairs may be pure Bruckheimer balls-out action porn but that wood shattering goodness is stunning to look at. It goes on for a long long time certainly, in fact I dropped my popcorn during the third act because of the onset of acute arthritis, but in the absence of wit, economic plotting or a real story it's by far the best reason to see this groaning behemoth drag itself over 168 waterlogged minutes.Ironically unlikely to be affected too much by online piracy  it made a shocking $401M around the stupid world over it's first weekend  the third Pirate's film stretches one pantomime turn across three movies, one of them okay, and in doing so shows that deprivation of quality in all other departments, bar those effects people of course, is no barrier to success on an earth shattering scale. It may not be a good advertisement for cinema but many, Michael Bay for one, will have slept better once they'd seen the film and taken in the figures, while others like old school blockbuster veterans Spielberg and Zemeckis will wonder why they ever bothered in the first place. The storytelling values of 40's and 70's Hollywood are as much under threat as Depp's pirates but unlike Sparrow and crew, it's no laughing matter.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Too bad.What went wrong with this film (with no spoilers):1. Overlapping of secret deals and negotiations (too much)2. Mostly stock character based- majority of characters aren't really developed. Or those who were developed were strongly out of original character. Some characters that could have greatly contributed to the story and seemed interesting weren't used at all. At least everyone in the first installment was interesting.3. Same jokes and dialog-somewhat funny, but gets pretty boring. Sorry Captain Sparrow (and you were my favorite!) 4. Unexplained pasts, decisions and characters- an example we have no idea WHO Lord Beckett IS, everyone in the film already knew all about who he was, however nothing about his character or what his relation is to the other characters is ever explained- definitely a huge raw back. I also found that those who met their demise was completely unnecessary, and just seemed to make this film even worse.5. While the second film could have had about 1 hour cut because of unnecessary footage (despite the fact that it was interesting it added nothing to the story), this film was very long and the creators tried to cram as much as they possibly could, which I found to be in vain. 6. HEAVY use in special effects. The first installment was simple, the only CG was distant shots of ships (and those that were blown up) and the skeleton pirates. But almost every scene had some sort of CG addition.BUT! There were some good aspects of this film as well:1. Twist in plot and the clip AFTER the credits. I applaud the creators for being fearless from this aspect. 2. Chow Yun Fat and several other talented actors were added to the cast (but again I'd go back to #2 above of why this wasn't a great film). 3. That's all.For those who are IMDb: Would I say that you should see it in theaters? Maybe, because there is a lot of action and those types of films are best on the big screen and after all, most people will have seen it by the time you can rent it-BUT! If you have a friend with a large TV or a projector- rent this film instead.But my personal opinion, and recommendation for people who like REAL films: I really detest this film and unless you absolutely HAVE to know what happens, just have your finger on the fast forward button.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I didn't really understand the second movie all that well and definitely was lost in this third one. The impression I was left with after viewing this movie aside from exhaustion of waiting for it to end was that this had to have been a spoof movie ... one example is a showdown on the beach minus Clint Eastwood and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly music. The other impression was fraught with most every pirate in the movie was gay, including Jack Sparrow. I got very weary of watching Johnny Depp prance around like a fruit, which am glad I was spared most of this gayness in the second movie, but it had enough to wear me down.To me, the 2nd and 3rd movies should have been put into one movie, but with all the visual padding they sold it down the pipe to the public. I really feel badly for parents taking their kids to see this since it won't make much sense to them, but kids like visuals so I suppose it will fly. However, due to how very, very, very long the movie is, I doubt young kids will sit comfortably in the theaters.At least George Hamilton did a great classic in The Gay Blade with a good script, but Pirates 3 definitely is an arduous one-time viewing, heavily touted movie and not another Gay Blade.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow's character is no longer funny and merely gets irritating. There are many jokes which no-one in the cinema laughed at, and the writers completely failed at replicating the humor previously seen in the trilogy.The plot has gone to ridiculous and pathetic fantasy whereas the previous movies had a halfway decent basis in normality it now becomes a boring fairytale.In the last hour things liven up a bit and there is some good action, suspense, tension and drama.

Group Therapy session in progress in nice recovery ward.MARK: Hi, my name is Mark, and I'm a recovering Pirates film fan.ALL (Unison): Hello, Mark! MARK: My first Pirates movie was Curse of the Black Pearl. After that,I couldn't stop. I read, I devoured, I became a pirate.THERAPIST: Then tell us when the crash came, Mark...MARK: It was when I saw At World's End.ALL (ad-lib agreement): Me, too. Arrrr, Aye, Lad, Me as well, etc.THERAPIST: Please tell us your story, Mark...MARK: The first movie blew me so completely away that I knew I would be disappointed by any others they could make. Number 2 made up for its' lack of focus by breaking new ground with special effects. Gore Verbinski is an evil genius, and I don't know of anyone who can come close in effects-related work. However good the cast and crew of At World's End are, there's no more magic here. The vein has run out in this cave, boys; time to move on. Black Pearl was a huge hit mainly because it was so DIFFERENT. Capitalizing on more of the same ol' DIFFERENTNESS is a recipe for disaster, I don't care who you are. This is something Johnny Depp himself has always stuck to BEFORE, going effortlessly from one character to another in film after film. Here, he's stuck with caricaturing his own performance in Black Pearl, much the same way that Anthony Hopkins has done with Hannibal Lecter after Silence of the Lambs.Walt Disney didn't believe in sequels, either, and his oft-used mantra of ""you can't top pigs with pigs"" should have been said by someone in at least one of the script meetings.You've seen the movie by now. You know what the problem is. It looks like they shot a bunch of scenes, figuring they would fix any problems in ""Post"", and wrote a script later that tried to tie them all in together, in much the same way that the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride was designed: ""we've got this building, it's shaped like THIS, now we've got to fit this scene here, this scene here, etc."" The difference between these two is that, while Walt wouldn't let the ride open until it was perfect, this film apparently was rushed into production without a solid story...CUT TO: Disney SUIT GUY with feet up on desk in office, on phone.SUIT GUY: ""We're revamping Tom Sawyer's Island with Pirates! Yes! In five weeks! Can you guys have the movie out by then? You still there? Hello?"" CUT BACK TO: MARK: We know these guys can write a smash: they gave us skeletal pirates and cursed treasure, after all.ALL (Unison): Undead monkey! MARK: Right! Um, however, that script (or versions of it) was in the works for what? 10 years? I'm trying to remember from the special features on the Black Pearl DVD... At World's End comes off like a term paper written at 7:45 AM on the morning it's due.Sorry, guys. I wanted to believe. I really did. I just can't. And you know why? Because I like using my imagination. Really. Just like you. Because of that, I don't need every single ounce of backstory you can cram in a story. I don't need to know what every character had for breakfast on Tuesday. I don't need to know every FREAKIN' thing about what made this character or that the way he or she is; it's not important to the main story, and you've thrown it in there just to aid the transitions from one scene to the next.CUT TO: GEORGE LUCAS is sitting at his desk, playing with a JAR JAR DOLL. He appears startled, looks directly into camera.GEORGE LUCAS: Who, me? Why are you picking on me? Get out of here! CUT BACK TO MARK:MARK: You've also forced us to sit through almost 3 hours of a film that's not based on a sweeping literary epic to begin with.The first movie gave us scary pirates, did explain why they were how they were, (because it was necessary to the story) and then made fun of them, so it never let you forget you were watching a pirate movie. A FUNNY pirate movie about a scary subject. Harry Potter, anyone? My solution? Simple. Much as I love Capt. Sparrow and Cmmdr. Verbinsky, Black Pearl was the only movie they should have done together. The next in the series should have had a completely different cast & director. The one after that, another change. Better yet: Get Johnny D to play a completely different pirate rogue in EACH of them, something he'd probably have drooled at, if you'd have offered it to him that way. There's your added spark! Hmmm...Brenda? Get those guys over at Time Portal Incorporated on the phone...I've got an idea...! THERAPIST: Mark has just summarized what we've all had to face: Black Pearl was not promoted as a Blockbuster; it seemed to surprise Hollywood when it became one. The other two have been OVER HYPED, rather than just dropped on us, and nothing can live up to those promises. Admit it. You're disappointed. It's okay.ALL: We're disarrrpointed! (MUSIC: Acoustic #3 by the Googoo Dolls, underneath)THERAPIST: I think we've done some good work here. Who wants ice cream? (MUSIC: UP AND OUT) FADE OUT","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean 3 has inspired my creative juices though, so i think a longer review is justified. For those people that prefer the pithy reviews ...Pirates of the Caribbean is your average blockbuster with plenty of bangs and very little in the way of good acting or story telling. As with the second POTC there is very little in the way of plot with the film being a series of set pieces. Most people that are looking for eye candy will be entertained by the movie since it contains Messrs Depp, Bloom & Knightly. There's plenty of action as well for those adrenalin junkies that enjoy plenty of explosions and fighting.Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is a classic example of what is wrong with Blockbuster movies.The acting in the movie is appalling. However good looking Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are they cannot act and have less presence than Marlon Brando's wig. It's probably a bit unfair to compare any actors with Brando, but I'm sure if you plucked a couple of good looking people from the Mall they'd be better actors than Bloom and Knightly. I've actually given the film an extra point because it was rather entertaining to see just how poor they were! Having said that the rest of the cast can't be excused either and the performances of Rush and Depp are probably worse than Bloom and Knightly, since they can act in the first place! One of the fundamentals of film making is that you should be moved in some way by the characters. This is certainly not the case with POTC 3 though and as the trials and tribulations unfold you are completely detached and couldn't care less who bites the bullet and who survives. I would be absolutely staggered if anyone showed any emotional reaction to the film whatsoever.Bearing in mind the previous comments the director must take his share of the blame. Verbinski is clearly more interested in the cgi than the fundamentals of the film. I suspect if you put aside the last couple of scenes you could rearrange the previous 30 or 40 scenes in any order and it wouldn't make much difference to the finished product. It feels like each actor has been allocated scenes based on their order in the cast. I'm sure most people will be aware of the friction on the set of the Magnificent Seven and this has a similar feel to it. Johnny Depp obviously wasn't content to appear once, so appeared several times and you can't help thinking that he might have had something to do with that himself.The film is too long and the editor should have cut an hour from the running time, but maybe the 168 minutes gives the film some gravitas. Apart from the acting inabilities of Knightly and Bloom some of the effects are quite good. That's one thing you are normally sure of with blockbusters though ... a few good effects.The thing that most annoys me about blockbusters ... I (and many others) go and see them! You feel like you are missing out if you don't go to see it, so even though you know it's going to be average you still shell out your hard earned cash! Sucker!!! For those people thinking of going to see POTC 3 at the movies ... wait to watch it on TV!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Nobody took on themselves to make the story moving.The final piece of problem is there are too many stars in the movie and movie was struggling to justify any solid role for them.The special effects deserve a mention.

Well, I don't know about Cap'n Jack... but it certainly seems like the screenwriters (there must've been dozens of them judging by the inconsistencies) made it up as they went along and didn't feel the need to go back afterwards to tidy up the mess they'd made.And it's such a pity too.

No? Good. Then let's move on to why it sucks.First: Massive portions of both this film and its predecessor (Dead Man's Chest) were completely ludicrous and seemed to have been invented as the writers went along. Insane sequences come out of seemingly nowhere and magically solve whatever current boring problem the heroes (who we hardly care about by this point) are trying to solve.Example: Every part of the crew's attempt to bring Jack Sparrow back from his untimely fate in Davy Jones' Locker. I don't have any problem with magic in movies, but when it has no rules and seemingly no logic or any mechanism of restriction (other than what the writers want it to do for them), how can I be expected to come anywhere close to suspending my disbelief? Other examples of this complete disregard for plausibility within the writers' story include: Davy Jones' seemingly endless and unexplained powers. The out-of-nowhere revelation about the stabbing of his heart (which should have been set up in the previous movie). The unnecessary and unexplained plot device of Sparrow's find-what-you-want-most compass. Sao Feng's magical maps, also completely unexplained. Barbarosa's almost completely dismissed reappearance.Other holes in logic appear throughout the story, but I won't spend the time displaying them all. You get the point.The second major problem is the complete lack of concern for the characters. There is entirely too much backstabbing in this film. Not only is it confusing (how many times did you wonder who was trying to accomplish what and for what reason? Be honest.) It completely undermines their relationships and frankly makes them very unlikeable. They all seem willing to betray each other at the drop of a hat; Yes, they're pirates, but in the first movie they were pirates with honor and friendship. Now all they seem to care about is their own selfish desires. So even when I understood what they were trying to accomplish with their endless betrayals (which was only occasionally), I didn't really care because they were all such friendless bastards that I had no desire to watch them pop through another implausible misadventure.Oh yeah, and what was with that whole East India Trading Company storyline? Did anyone else find it pointless and its conclusion entirely unsatisfying and unbelievable? Finally, I'd like to make a note to all movie screenwriters and directors who might read this review: Just because you can show something with computer graphics and make it look incredibly realistic, that doesn't mean it could actually happen or that you can make me believe that it could actually happen. Show a little restraint, please. We don't need to see Jack Sparrow swinging around on ropes with crazy abandon for fifteen minutes in a row. Even Tarzan never accomplished the kind of crazy swinging acrobatics Jack did in this sequence. I miss the days when technology forced you to show a little restraint in what you make appear on the screen; it made things so much less... Ludicrous.After all of this criticism, I'd like to point out there there were a few things I liked about the movie. Though it showed up at inappropriate moments at times, the wit and slapstick humor did make me laugh. The beginning and ending were actually fairly decent, if you ignore the crazy special effect-driven insanity I just mentioned. Some of the core ideas would have been good if they had been executed much better.Of course, executing them well would have required rewriting both this and the previous film into a single, simplified, tidied up story. Which is what the filmmakers should have done. This current obsession with trilogies is ridiculous, and is constantly sabotaging what could have otherwise been great pairs of movies.Let me wrap this lengthy review up by stating frankly that I wish I had never wasted three hours on this movie. It was boring, confusing, and the few tiny bright spots couldn't come close to making up for the near-complete lack of planning on the part of the writers. Three stars in generous, but what the hell. I like Johnny Depp.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, thankfully, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' reclaimed some of the sparkle on the franchise that the second film lost. This film sees Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa strive to rescue Jack from the world of death itself as Cutler Beckett plots to rid the seas of all pirates.In terms of the characters, I felt as if there wasn't enough interaction between Will, Jack and Elizabeth as each went in their own direction and the film suffered as a result since these are meant to be the main characters. It was the minor characters who had more of a presence, especially in the comedy scenes. The crew of the Pearl were fleshed out more to a degree that they were actually more interesting than the three leads. Duos Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, in the role of the Black Pearl's not-too-bright crew members, and Angus Barnett and Giles New, as representing the daft section of the British Navy as Mullrog and Murtogg, were all hilarious in scenes that were probably the best of the film. Jack Davenport's Norrington brought some sense of drama to the film and it's a shame he wasn't used more. Also, under-used was Keith Richards, who played Jack's father. It felt as if he was brought in just for the sake of 'look who's play Jack's dad' and the role seemed to serve little purpose.The special effects were top-notch, especially when it came to the battle scenes and the Flying Dutchman crew, however, gone were the days when films could coast on dazzling CGI. Plot is what counts. This time around, there was less tedious, over-long scenes designed to amuse small children in the audience (a la 'Dead Man's Chest') but there were many things that could have been improved on. The storyline was rather clunky and choppy as it tried to build up to the final battle between the pirates and the English. It felt as if the scriptwriter just wanted to have a juicy battle but there was little thought put into how to get to that point in a logical manner. The plot wasn't helped by the fact there was no character development for the three leads, who were all reduced to bit parts, thus leaving the film struggling to link to the first two of the trilogy.If you were disappointed with 'Dead Man's Chest', it is worth seeing this film to see all was not lost but don't expect anything of the excellence of the first film. It's good as a means of spending an afternoon but it won't bowl over many people over fourteen. And certainly, it will left me hoping this was the end and there would be no fourth film. It's time Hollywood learns that it can't just rely on special effects and actors' good looks to sell films to intelligent cinema-goers.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There was even comic relief for the comic relief in this movie, almost at the level of such classics as Airplane, or 2001 a Space Travesty.Second, the use of computer graphics was mind blowing. I don't even know why they spent money on a pirate ship or actors in the first place. They could have saved money and just used the CG characters that were in the majority of the fights for the whole movie.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be as tight lipped as possible with this one.

Tolerated because Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow I'd watch in a episode of Sesame Street if necessary. The character itself is a delight that brightens the entire series but even he couldn't save this clunk of a threequel.The problem with the Pirates series as it continued is they just kept piling on more ridiculous confusing Pirate lore and making it painfully difficult to follow who was screwing over who for what. I can't remember one characters motivation from this film overall because none of it really seemed to matter anyway the movie makers were just using them for excuses to use special effects.Also all the hype around the Elizabeth character was just over the top and stupid this movie and they really ruined the essence of the character as a whole by making her ridiculously desirable and exceptionally awesome. I just watched Pirates one last night and you can't barely even believe the same woman who ends on the cliff kissing Will is the same woman in this movie.Jack is mostly used for comedic relief but Johnny Depp still works it like no other in this clunker. If anything was salvaged in this poor installment he did the salvaging even though there is one cringe worthy moment for Sparrow too.What a shame. This trilogy could have been the Star Wars for this generation in a way on a smaller scale. Instead all this movie reaffirmed was what I thought at the end of Pirates of the Caribbean 2 Dead Man's Chest...they should have just left it at one movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I hope my abilities of writing in English are sufficient to express what I want to say - they wanted too much. Obviously, the writers wanted too much. This story is much too complicated! And also it is too serious. This kind of seriousness does not compare to the whole story. It does not suit the story. That's why it has lost the charisma of the first part. As far as the first part is concerned, the writers did a very, very good job. Now it seems to me, as if they were experimenting with telling a story. Johnny Depp is great, as he always is, but it seems to me, even he could have been better - he acts as if he was forced to slow down. But there was a big surprise: Keira Knightly.

It just meanders aimlessly, building up to a final showdown of lots of battle ships, but blue-balls us and just gives us a disappointing 2 v 1 that is over in 30 seconds.As for naval warfare, I was really hoping that At World's End would have delivered some of the incisive brilliance of Master and Commander, but it just falls short in every way.Granted there a few decent scenes scattered throughout, but 80% of the movie is cringe and eye-roll.

The first one was okay, but too long and kinda boring, but I could see why people liked it, interesting premise, solid acting etc. The second movie, I thought was better, I enjoy the clever premise of Davey Jones and his crew being made of sea creatures it was creepy and in style with the film. The action sequences were better, the story was good, and Johnny Depp was stellar. Still it didn't really have an ending and was again too long, good not great. But the third movie is utter crap. I story is way too intricate with too many twists and characters. Also, I hate how Orlando Blooms father looks exactly like the evil pirate from the first movie. Am I the only one who found that confusing? This movie is just filled with unnecessary things that muddle it up. The first sequences in Asia somewhere is just filler that didn't really need to be there. Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightly have no chemistry so why even try to float that boat. The insanity sequences with Depp were just inane. There were so many uninspired and insipid action movie sequences I just wanted to gag. One scene where a voodoo woman turns into a I don't know what, but the transformation was soooo cheesy. Nothing about this third installment screamed originality. It screamed, rushed to make money. I remember a particularly terrible scene where the general of the ship walks down stairs, as his ship was being torn apart by cannonballs and finally it explodes. Well, he got off lucky not having to sit through the rest of this inexplicably terrible film. In trying to make everything grandiose and epic the creators just managed to make a grandiose turd. It gets a three only because I think Johnny Depp has done a heck of an acting job with the series.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't buy it. The visuals--makeup, costume, lighting, special effects, etc.--are fantastic. But it doesn't really matter when a film is so poorly written, poorly directed, and the actors are left to execute a horrible script. Johnny Depp needs to stop doing these films before they ruin his legacy as a great actor; I know, I know, he makes millions and millions of dollars from this film. The witty, snappy lines delivered in the first ""Pirates"" movie are long gone, replaced by lame one-liners and bop-you-on-the-head, guys-looking-up-a-skirt humor that a few 4th graders might like. And we know, by now, that it's entirely possible to write a funny movie that both adults and children can appreciate. (See most Pixar films.) This misses on both target groups. I can't even justify spending much time on this review. But I must point out how the film is 2.5 hours long, and should have been edited down to about an hour and a half. Extremely long scenes of dialogue, seemingly pointless exchanges between enemies for 15 minutes before going into battle, and tedious moments of forced romance will put serious moviegoers to sleep. See this movie when it comes on DVD, if you must see it at all. And if you still insist on going to the theater, take a good nap before you go, and load up on caffeine halfway through the film. Don't worry, you won't need or want anyone to fill you in on what you missed when you stepped out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not very impressed. The things that felt fresh in the first movie now just feel tedious.For example, captain Jacks queer-positive antics which gave the first movie some spark now are a bit dull. You can fell how they are trying to cash in on his style by cramming as much of it in the two sequels as possible, and you feel a bit fed up with it after a while and wish they'd just get on with the story. The introduction to Jack in the third movie (surely it can't be a spoiler that he returns in this one?) is a scene that just goes on and on. It may have been five minutes long, but it felt like it dragged on for half an hour. The whole scene feels constructed to give the audience as much of wacky Jacks crazy antics as possible. I say alright already. And this come from someone who loves Johnny Depp as an actor.The first hour of the film is tedious, and it's already now dragging its heels (sadly, it doesn't get much better). Why oh why does it have to be three hours long! Verbinski just has got to learn how to kill his darlings. Yes, battles are fun and special effects are cool, but if it goes on for too long it just gets plain boring (especially the final battle).Unfortunately I can't remember where I read it, but I think it was Bloom (I may be wrong) who said that there was some confusion while shooting the movie because of the ever changing script. Rather, I'd say that the crew made it up as they went along. The story is messy and the dialogue as poorly written (I never did get the ""Aaargh, matey"" captain from the Simpsons out of my head).I quite liked Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven (not the crapfest I expected it to be) and Keira Knightley, well she's Keira Knightley, what can I say (be still my heart!). But the couple has zero chemistry on screen. You really don't get what she sees in Blooms character (or is it just me that's jealous?).The special effects are OK, which I think is a result from how quickly you grow accustomed to things. I remember seeing the first installment and was insanely impressed by the special effects, especially the scene in the cave where Depp and Rush are fighting, where they run in and out of the moonlight. Still one of the best special effects sequences I've seen. In the second movie the thing that made me raise my eyebrows was the crew of the Flying Dutchman, and especially Bill Nighy's character. But this time around most things were met by a big yawn and a wish that they'd move on with the story instead.Spend your money on David Fincher's Zodiac instead. Yes, it's a totally different genre, and yes it's slow. But it's still the best movie to be released this summer (so far).","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

Named after a roller coaster ride (I actually rode this in California once) I found the ride more artistic although the soft wheels on that ride probably contained less rubber than the actors' costumes.Efforts at quality were filled with Pathos. I cringed. I ached as I would ache for Jethro and Granny in the Beverly Hillbillies. I cannot believethat they are doing this or that! The surrealistic moment when Depp arrives on scene was pathetic and my heat skipped in pity for poor Johnny. Deep you might think. Actually quite silly and the camp cannot disguise the betrayal of principles here by Johnny. Depp is no Kinski and no amount of over acting can remedy this. The efforts by the director to match Herzog (yes there is a midget and chicken in the movie) merely reflected his inadequacy although I will credit him for stealing from Herzog-what with the ship being crabbed over a hill. Fitzcaraldo be damned--We need the dough and all is allowed come blockbuster time and most of the goofs who will watch and pay for this one probably never saw that artsy movie anyway!¨(Hey, I didn't say that, the guys who made Pirates did or likely did while truth abounded in their cups).I really did hurt for Johnny. Poor lad. He is probably a very nice boy; but alas one who sold his soul on this one for filthy money and no amount of grimacing or back shots hopping a la Chaplin will save this man from a well deserved commercial success.

The second and third clearly had much too much money thrown at them in the hopes that special effects could distract from the lack of a plot. I don't know why studios think that more money makes a better film: often, less money makes filmmakers more inventive and imaginative, and almost always more money makes them completely the opposite as this film proves.At least the first one was something fantastic happening in the context of something vaguely real-world. This movie just seemed to make up its own rules in order not to have to bother making sense in any vaguely real-world context.As I've said the special effects were, as always, brilliant. All four of my points are for them. If you liked the original Pirates but were disappointed with the second, don't bother with this one. If you like a film with a story, don't bother with this one.

There were far too many plot lines, far too many plodding, irrelevant scenes and the end result was a confusing, drawn-out mess. Yes, it had things to recommend it - the finale was exciting, Geoffrey Rush was terrific, Depp was, well, Depp and the film looked fantastic.But I was disappointed. No way should this movie have been three hours. When I saw it the kids in the cinema grew restless very quickly and some parents had to take their kids out early. Nearly three hours for a family movie? What on earth were they thinking of? As well as the afore-mentioned many, many plots, I have to say that Bloom and Knightley's performances left me cold. I found myself shrugging my shoulders over their romance and Knightley's rallying speech, intended no doubt to be inspiring and moving, was laughable.The next one should be a much shorter, uncomplicated romp. I don't mean dumb it down - just don't stuff it so full of plot it has to be this gargantuan length. Some films need to be long - the Lord of the Rings movies for example - this one didn't have to be and shouldn't have been.Three stars because of Rush and the visuals.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, I cannot say that this one did a whole lot for me. Where the first one was written very well, incredibly easy to follow, and one of the best all-around action movies I've seen, the third one was quite the opposite. Written in what seems like a different movie series altogether, this movie makes no sense. You feel as if you have come into the end of the trilogy without seeing the first two, because this movie is almost impossible to follow. They take themselves a bit too seriously, having none of the fun laughs offered by the first two. I did laugh out loud a couple of times, but I'm not sure if that was necessarily a good thing. Jack Sparrow seems to have lost the charisma that the first one had so strongly, and feels almost like a character from Ghost Rider. Although this movie is too long, and progressively gets worse as the hours pass by, the ending does try to save itself. Cool final battle and an entertaining last portion, with some things that make you laugh, I give this movie a 5 star.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

After 45 minutes of solving the same things again and again, the film becomes absolutely boring and the bore lasts till the end.The screenplay is full of flat and banal characters. Everyone is ""the commander"" there, it does not matter who says ""set sail"". You can replace them one by each other. Even Jack is sometimes ""lost"" between other characters.

Surely it deserves at least a 2.To say this movie has plot holes would be to imply that originally someone intended it to have cohesion. It feels like this movie was made using every idea anyone ever considered a possibility for a story. In the midst of trying to wrap your head around a barrage of plot lines that you will never understand, more are constantly added to the mix.This movie falls victim to the infamous recipe for a sucky sequel. Take a movie that was never intended to have a sequel. Then take all the jokes from the first movie and repeat them, changing the person who is saying them if necessary. Spend all the time effort and money you spent developing and original and interesting screenplay and use it all on special effects. Done and done. I am so glad I got into this for free, I hate donating my money to reinforce this kind of movie making.In closing: This movie makes following the plot of ""Memento"" seem like following that of a Muppet's movie.

Too many story lines made the movie so fragmented that I didn't care about the ending anymore. I saw the movie four hours ago and frankly, there wasn't one scene that really stood up. Oh yes, perhaps the surreal Jack Sparrow ones in the afterlife. Well done. Reminded me of the ending of 2001. Keira Knightly looked as pretty as ever. The cameo of Keith Richards was also very nice though not vital to the story. I liked Pirates 2 a lot. That was just no nonsense fun with some great visual jokes. I hope the producers will let the Pirates franchise rest a while and maybe come back with a new chapter in five years. Or better: make something entirely new. But with the billion dollar box office success I expect mr. Sparrow to be back with a new adventure before 2009. Too bad.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I absolutely loved it, it was a solid, spirited story and great escapism. But now imagine the writers - you have a great hit movie, the people are screaming for more, so what do you do? Throw all the characters from the first movie in a pot, add some new ones, hell even bring some back from the dead, flavor it with lots and lots and lots of action and fantasy, stir a few times, and boom, there's your story! Does it have to make sense? I guess not.The second and the third movies can't live up to the first. Their story lines are heartless and wobbly as Jack's brain. They both might visually be mind blowing and make you feel like you're a pirate in the Caribbean yourself, but story wise they are just confusing. I had a very small headache when I entered the theater and a really big headache when I left.The character developments are more than questionable - they change their opinion by the minute and you never know who is on who's side, it's incomprehensible what their motivations are. The extra portion of epic love just didn't fit into this movie, nor did the sudden change of heart in a battle scene, of which we do not even know what the meaning of it was, just as we don't know why other certain things happened. Allover I can't even put my confusion about the plot into words. It's way too much to absorb and it'll just be confusing to think about it any longer.The one scene I enjoyed the most was when the screen went all black and you could hear far away singing and rattling and a voice slowly saying ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" - those were original sounds from the Disney ride, and I felt just like I was in there again. It had such a great atmosphere, even the air in there is unforgettable. And then the screen went white.The third movie is deeply melancholic from the first to the last scene - despite all action. The ending leaves the audience frustrated and discontented. The scene after the credits seems to close the trilogy - which is a good thing, because nothing will ever live up to The Curse of the Black Pearl.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The second one seemed like half a film to me, so i was keenly waiting the conclusion of this tale. I could not have been more disappointed.It is easy to forget that the first film focused on the roguish charm and wit of Jack Sparrow, told a coherent story, was well plotted, pacey, and had few special effects. ""worlds End"" has grown into a bloated monster, fat on the success of the first two installments. Hugely impressive, and expensive, special effects have dwarfed the plot such that Sparrow has been relegated into little more than a bystander in this juggernaut of a CGI driven picture.Many of the scenes were shot during last years filming of the second ""Dead Mans Chest"", and apparently the script had not been finalised at that point. It shows. This franchise has become a ""Mision Impossible"" style enterprise whereby the set pieces are put together first, and then joined up by a script that tries to make some sense of it.Sadly, i do hope that this is the end for this series.The English Rose innocence of Keira Knightley now seems wet, her attempts at being Action Woman risible. And as for Orlando Bloom, he is about as dashing as Larry Grayson, as he hangs around to win his lady's heart. Jack, previously the vibrant life of every frame has been sidelined by a tidal wave of special effects that are simply there because the money is there to provide them , rather than because of any dramatic imperative.Farewell, and bon voyage - i will remember the good times.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Same costumes, characters, scenery, dialog, etc., no new ground broken here, except to try one's patience while waiting for something interesting to happen. I've heard that this will be the final installment of 'Pirates'. Thank goodness! The first installment was great, second was fair at best, this last one was almost unbearable to watch due primarily to it's length, but also because of it's story line and screen play. The first hour had about 10 minutes that I found interesting, the rest of it had me glancing at my watch to see how much longer I had to endure it. It runs for almost 2 1/2 hours and is just too damn long! Kiera Knightly's character is so well scrubbed throughout the film that she looks out of place against the griminess of all the other characters. Her teeth twinkle with every close up shot, as do Orlando Bloom's.....their characters must have both gone to the same dentist that all the other characters in this film couldn't afford. There are 'Pirates stock characters' like the guy with one eye and his shorter fat friend. These two have a somewhat expanded role of popping up every now and then to do a watered down Abbott and Costello-like pirate flavored routine. ""Hello Poppet""...I saw it already! There are other characters like these two that one will recognize that also have expanded roles...the tongueless guy with the talking parrot, the cute monkey, the two arguing soldiers, etc., etc., when I saw any of them I thought ""hey there they are again....so?..."" As we have all probably heard by now, they manage to squeeze in a couple of scenes with Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones. I think he showed up in his normal attire....no make up or wardrobe needed here. They even have him strumming a few chords on a guitar at the big Pirate meeting....I think I recognized it as ""Little T & A"" but I could be wrong. I enjoyed watching most of the main actors...Depp, Rush, even Chow Yun Fat, and a few others. They are so good at their craft and true to their characters that their performances become part of the few saving graces of this film. When you consider the exorbitant cost of admission, I must say that I can't recommend seeing this in the theater.

I don't think I have ever done that and I am not proud of having done it now. As a film lover this really pains me.I should take the time to affirm that I absolutely loved the first movie (8 stars, going on 9): it was fast, witty and altogether surprising - I am a fan of Johnny Depp but on that movie he especially awesome. Though there is no love like the first one I thought the second was pretty good too (7 stars), with a few really hilarious parts of its own.I kinda knew this one would probably not live up to the others and, boy, was I right. From the very start, there's too much stuff going on that is neither funny nor exciting. The script is all over the place, you don't ""get"" where the characters' allegiances are or what they are trying to achieve: people keep floating between the action theaters with no rhythm or rime. The parts where Jack Sparrow talks to himself just don't work and, for all his craftsmanship, Johnny can't save his character from being just annoying on these sequences. In fact, none of the characters are really likable and I certainly felt no empathy with any of them which is a first. The combat sequences were dull throughout and, though I'm sure the last one would probably be an eye opener, I just couldn't endure any more boredom so after 2 hours and 10 minutes I left.To my dismay, this really was one of the most disappointing films I have seen in a long time. For what it's worth, my suggestion is to wait for rental to watch it: I don't give it less starts solely because it would then be dangerously close to Catwoman... and not even this film deserves that.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The result is dull beyond measure. Even Jack's wit and wisdom has lost it's edge. What you get for your money is 1 sword fight, 1 good battle and effects that we've seen before i.e. not special.

They threw too many conflicts in at once, and you spend the whole movie trying to decipher who is screwing who over, though it wouldn't spoil it to say it is predictable that the good guys will be good guys in the end.All this film seems to be is an exercise in how good CG can be in a film, and as my summary suggests, there is only so much CG I will endure without having an Xbox pad in my hands. Visually it is fantastic, but it is all for nought when there is no story. The only plus side for me is that Johnny Depp is once again brilliant as Jack Sparrow, although even then (and this is not Depps fault at all), the character flip flops between being a coward and having balls of steel in a heart beat.The longest 3 hours of my life.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Okay, well, I needed the internet's help to resolve all of this problem.*10 minutes later* Okay, I get it now but I really think they should make it clearer for the audience. So, the beginning of the movie was a really good ""attention getter"" for the audience. You know how they say, if the people don't have fun, you don't? Well, my audience didn't laugh at some certain scenes, and they sounded bored. With that, I was very bored with this movie. In fact, number two could have been boring, but since the audience was actually getting into the movie, I was having fun with the second. So I'm being fair with this third movie.I could let the boring scenes go away. There were some great action scenes in the film. In this film's third act, whenever you were bored throughout the movie, you could actually forgive it for being boring because in this act, it's really fun and filled with special effects and swashbuckling action!I liked the weird acting by Johnny Depp. I also think, while not as good as Depp's, that Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting were good, if not great. The special effects in this film is really great.It depends if you'll enjoy this movie. If you have a great audience, you'll probably love this. If you have this boring audience, like I did, you'll be so bored but you'll forgive it for having its last hour really entertaining, although it's a bit too long.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a long film, with far too much time spent in boring fight sequences. The plot is peculiar and convoluted to say the least.Sadly, too, there is little novelty here. The same old characters, mainly, continue in the same old way.If you enjoyed the previous two films, then there is much to enjoy here, it is fun, but it leaves you much less satisfied than before.I was surprised, and impressed, that Captain Sparrow appears to be something of a classicist, or lawyer as, at one point, and aptly, he says 'res ipse loquitur' and there are no sub-titles to interpret the remark. Could this lead to more children taking an interest in Latin? If so, three cheers to the film, that sort of intellectually enriching stuff is seldom seen, or, rather, heard, in a Hollywood film.There are some amazingly sloppy anachronisms, though. Early in the film a child sings before being executed, and shows us that he is undergoing modern orthodontic treatment. It'd have been easy to conceal his braces, or, better, to have used another child. Is this just laziness, or is it a deliberate signal that they're taking the peess out of the audience because they don't care as long as they get the money - or is there some excuse that it's a 'post-modernist' piece of deliberate rubbish (relabelled because of IMDb yankish puritanism)?Some scenes appear to have been left in without any recollection of the original point. There's a rotting sea creature (a giant squid perhaps) on the beach at one point that the characters walk around, prod and consider it's huge eye - the reason for this isn't ever explained and there is no point to it in character or plot development, it's just there. Why couldn't it have been cut out? The film would have been shorter and less pointless - I suppose they spend a lot of money making the creature so had to include it as some sort of justification.Keith Richards appearing as Jack's father has very little point to it, apart from just that - it's a self -indulgent reference to Depp using him as part of his character development. Clearly Keith manages to live, against all odds, but he can't act.Unless you're really keen on the Pirates, and I'm quite fond of them, I must say, I'd avoid this. The little Latin isn't enough to make it interesting, not really. There were one or two rather good jokes, but, tellingly, I can't remember them a few hours later. The multiple Depp instantiations, as Sparrow's hallucinations, are, again, simply self- indulgence, it diminishes the effect of Depp's character and makes it all feel as if it is just a vehicle for his acting - good acting, certainly, in context, but shallow and mannered when isolated like this, it makes him appear simply hammy, an unkindness, I think, to Depp's undoubted talent.Calypso, the goddess, apparently, was deeply unimpressive, as was the silly puzzle that looked interesting, but was trite in solution, to returning from Davey Jones Locker.In summary, to long, to thin and too lazy.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

But the script The film is made up of scenes that should either have been cut by a third or cut out all together. The dialogue labours heavily over a ""who cares"" and extremely convoluted so-called plot and it just goes on and on and on with barely three actual jokes to brighten its running time of over three hours.In the hands of a nimble and witty script writer there's no way this film would have clocked in at three hours and it certainly would have been a much, much better movie. As it is, its exhausting and dull length is the result of very poor story telling pure and simple, creakily papered over by special effects and big bucks.I would challenge anyone at any given minute in this movie, to explain what's going on and why. And I mean that from the very first scene which has no plot connection with the rest of the film at all. And of course, characters are constantly doing things to get the movie to the next scene rather than because it makes sense for them to do it.My score of three is for the effects and the cast.

Like its predecessors, AT WORLD'S END is a bloated and overblown exercise in style over substance. Featuring a cast that the director finds it impossible to keep track, endless action sequences that have no discernible beginning or end, repetitive sword fights in which nobody is ever killed or seemingly wounded, and a complete lack of realism from beginning to end, this is everything I hate about Hollywood blockbusters.There's no character development whatsoever. Johnny Depp is still the irritating, one-dimensional character he played in the original movie. There are WAY too many supporting characters and the screen time between them is spread too thinly, so that few get a look in. Yes, the special effects are splendid, spectacular and photo-realistic, but the effects never make a film and these PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies are a case in point. No matter how much money you're going to throw at a blockbuster, if it doesn't have a good story then it's going to sink.","3 out of 22 found this helpful.

Summer is here and marking it for the summer movie season is the third installment in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series named 'At World's End'. You see, if I named the film, instead of 'At World's End', I'd name it 'The Film that Never Ends'. A 2 hour and 48 minute runtime for a popcorn Disney flick is not stupid, IT'S F__KING PSYCHOTIC!!! If you thought the second film was a pointless, annoying, ass-numbing experience (ass-numbing because you're constrained to a dinky little movie theater chair for hours at a time), you have no idea. Brace yourself, I used to think the cruelest form of torture was castration, but not after seeing 'Pirates of the Caribbean 3'. If someone walked up to me and told me I had to sit through Pirates 3 one more time, I'd most likely cut my own balls off. The third installment takes off where the second film left off. Captain Jack Sparrow is lost in the cabinet of Davey Jones and.... you know what -- F_CK IT! Do we even care about the over-the-top, ridiculous, and hard to follow plot? I don't think so. I think the biggest reason people sit through through these piece of sh__t movies is because of Johnny Depp. Another reason would be horny teenage boys who for some reason despite the PG-13 rating, think Keira Knightley might by some chance get naked. The third reason would be horny teenage girls who think the same thing, except applied to Orlando Bloom. But back to what I was saying, the plot in 'Pirates 3' is terrible. Sure it's complex, but complex doesn't mean it's coherent. It's all over the place, and it will make your brain hurt if you attempt to figure everything out. The action sequences are well-made and entertaining, but after a certain point watching them gets to be an exhausting experience. At the 2-hour mark of 'Pirates 3' I was ready to leave, but stayed in hopes that for some act of God it might get better. It didn't. Big freakin' surprise. From an acting stand-point the movie isn't half-bad though. Johnny Depp is as hysterical and scene-stealing he can be with poorly-written and cheesy dialogue, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush is exquisetley over-the-top as the villain pirate turned hero. Orlando Bloom is as flat as always, and Keira Knightley is average at best (but not bad to look at.) The members of the supporting cast are decent enough -- veteran actors Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Still Crazy) and Stellan Skarsgaard (Insomnia, The Exorcist: The Beginning) are great in their roles, Chow Yun-Fat is annoying to say the least in his role but doesn't break character, and Naomie Harris as the Voodoo woman would be better if she wasn't so over-the-top. In my review you probably noticed I used the phrase 'over-the-top' several times. That is because that statement pretty much sums up 'Pirates 3'. It's too much. Too much plot, too many drawn-out action sequences, too much cheesy dialogue, too many characters, etc. Although it isn't the absolute worst movie I've seen, it's one of the most painful to sit through. I don't mind three hour movies, in fact I love three hour movies. 'The Godfather' and 'Schindler's List' are two of my all-time favorite films. I just like three hour movies that are, say Oscar-caliber material, because if I'm going to sit in a theater for three hours, I BETTER be blown away. Sitting through this movie made me want to cry. I used to think rape was the worst thing that could happen to someone, then I sat through this movie. OKAY, I'm being a tiny bit melodramatic, but still, it's pretty goddamn awful. These three hour pirate movies need to stop-- what the hell do they think a film editor is for?! Dear Mr. Film Editor of Pirates 3 -- DO YOU F__KING JOB!!!!!!!!.

The once great glory from ""Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest"" is gone. Jack Sparrow seems bored, Barbossa and Davy Jones have lost their evil edge. A billion subplots are worked out through two hours of expository dialogue to the point where I was checking my watch, just waiting for the final battle. Despite some visual effects and some amazing battles at the beginning and end of the movie, (not to mention a fantastic, and all too short cameo by Keith Richards, the only actor who truly seemed in character), this movie was lacking heart. It's boring, long-winded, and just not enjoyable. To all you people who claim to like it because ""It has Jack Sparrow"", WAKE UP! It's a slapped together piece of crap because Jerry Bruckheimer is giving Transformers the time it needs to be a decent movie so he can start another franchise.

Piracy is over.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1686728/?ref_=tt_urv","gutterstar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7026437/?ref_=tt_urv","4 July 2007","The latest Pirates of the Caribbean film had one of the highest box-office opening weekends of all time. It had a record 4,362 US theatre openings and has now taken over $700million worldwide. With the number of people going to see At World's End, you'd be forgiven for thinking the world actually was coming to an end, and we'd decided the only people we could trust were mega film stars. But this POTC is neither a fitting end to human history or to a popular franchise.With all the logic of the Flat Earth Society comes a series of plots that attempt to intertwine like cords of a rope, but aren't nearly as well put together as the ones we will see pirates flying about on towards the films climax. Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow, whose unstable and seemingly drunken daft antics are compounded after he spends some time in Davey Jones' Locker, with multiple versions of himself and lots of crabs. The character is a bright spot in the film, though with so many returning and new characters he barely makes it through as protagonist. Chow Yun-Fat, Geoffrey Rush and others deliver great performances, but anyone hoping for an escape from Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner's brain-punchingly annoying romance will have no such luck. The various stories are complicated, but not clever, and the overall sense of pointlessness leads the film to fall back on the pretty people. Yet even this fails to make comprehensive sense and is laden with ham-fisted clichés. You can watch previous installment Dead Man's Chest  from which this conjoins heavily  immediately before viewing, and still not make head or tail of it. It's not surprising to learn that shooting began when the script wasn't finished.As always, Orlando Bloom acts with the personality of a ships plank. Whether he is on the brink of being killed or conversing epically with the love of his life, he comes across as the character who can't quite believe he is lucky enough to be in such a cool situation, who must gruff his voice and squint his eyes. Acting can be seen a mile off, they say, but in the case of this well-scrubbed pirate, you'll wish your eyes were a mile away.Keira Knightley doesn't fare much better. The series has tried to build her princess character into a tough deck-swabber, but it fails spectacularly to convince. When she makes a pre-battle speech to her comrades, you cringe for everyone in the room and in the scene. As in Domino, it's impossible to believe Knightley can kick anyone's arse, rotting zombie swashbucklers or not. And she never washes the floor once before becoming Queen of the Seas. Typical.The jokes are poor (monkeys, rum) and between scenes just so we can take a break from trying to understand what's going on, if we haven't given up already. With the brainlessness that comes from knowing you've got a Disneyfied hit on your hands the script tosses in references of everything from The Little Mermaid to The Godfather (the latter via a line from Tom Hollanders bad guy character Lord Beckett, butchered in the way only a business pirate could do  The East India Company being the first big monopoly trying to be hip).The very long final action scene, although as illogical as the rest, is certainly impressive - but it's not worth sitting through the rest for it. Indecisive as always, the film doesn't know how to end, leaving just enough opening for a possible third sequel to scrape through pathetically, covered in seaweed and lacking imagination. Pieces of Eight? They should cut their losses and stop at three.3/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film has excellent special effects, a great score, great moments of humor and memorable scenes and dialogue. The film has a number of notable battle sequences. The ending is interesting and satisfying given the direction the film took.However, this ""At World's End"" has the same problem as ""Dead Man's Chest""; it has a long and dragging plot line that is contrary to the focused and engaging first film. The story of this film was more engaging than that of ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it is still a far cry from the quality of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". It is safe to say that if you found ""Dead Man's Chest"" disappointing, you will also be disappointed by ""At World's End"" because it similarly deviates from the style of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

LOTR I adored because like the books it was suppose to be 3. But PotC was a failure again like the Matrix.The story line had aboslutley no point. The comedy was pure stupidity of either using animals or Jack (if you have seen it, I think you know what it is) by the third movie that stupid, clumsy love for the pirate is starting to fade away.But crediits still go to an obvious high budget film.

However, At World's End failed to impress me. I believe with expectations as high as they were after the last two movies, it would be difficult to live up to it, probably IMPOSSIBLE, but I would still expect the makers of Pirates to do it and keep doing it each time. For one, there were very few links between the first two movies and the third (compared to the brilliant links established between the first two movies). Also the level of wit seemed to have gone down considerably. Some scenes seemed to stretch beyond limits and kill the smooth flow one associates with these movies. The two people who did well though were Johnny Depp and Hans Zimmers and indeed Hector didn't disappoint either. However, the movie had far too many open ends to be the final movie of a trilogy, far too many unanswered questions. Frankly speaking, I expected Gore Verbinski to do better. Had it been a movie of the same standard with different characters and bad music, I would give it a 1, but I cant quite do that to Captain Jack (though he doesn't seem to have a clear future ahead).","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

People in general consider this film to be really good, but for me it was a sort of torture to watch. To start with, it was difficult to understand. Too many characters and too much senseless dialogue. The movie just keeps hoping from one plot line to the other (and there are like 20)without ever landing something meaningful or interesting. And then you add the cheap and silly surrealism they used. The only reason why i went to see this film was johnny depp (i'm a big fan) I said, well if depp is in the film it might not be that bad. But not even the amazing talent of this actor could save the film. I have to admit he made quite a creation of Jack sparrow, but anyways it is a cartoonish silly character at the end. I rarely want to leave the theater before the movie ends, but in this one i was eager to do so. Anyways I didn't leave because my friend and i just started to make fun and laugh about how ridiculous and bad the film was.

The first two hours drug on and on. The early action scenes did not seem to me to be filmed very well; far too many 1/2 second blurred shots in the first fight scene, and too many characters in them that I didn't care about. When they were not showing off poor direction in those early fights, they were showing off poor acting. I knew coming in that Orlando Bloom couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but Keira Knightly's character was both written and acted poorly. While I could never say that Johnny Depp's acting was anything less than superb, what was with the Army of Darkness rip-off? It looked as though they even used the same 20-year-old technology! It just did not fit with the rest of the CGI, which was spectacular. Yet another knock was the predictability. Who didn't know coming in that Tia Dalma was Davey Jones' love interest? Aside from that predictable outcome, the writers seemed to try really hard to confuse with multiple twists and back-stabbings that all ended up unnecessary and led to the predictable outcome that could have just as easily been reached in two hours.But then the story ramped up, and the action came in hand over fist. The movie finally had a chance to redeem itself! And it almost did, but then it got stupid. The wedding scene in the battle was a bit over the top. It was cute, but not even in the same league as the ending of the first movie. Then, once again, it had a chance for redemption, when Turner was stabbed and became the new captain of the Dutchman. But they blew the whole premise of why Davey Jones had his heart ripped out in the first place! The story had shown that he had it ripped out and kept far from him so he didn't have to feel anymore. So why then, did Turner continue to feel for Elizabeth when his heart was far away? I would have been much happier to see Turner come back with a barnacle attached to his face, and hatred in his eyes than to see such a contradictory ending. I was happy that they left the ending open for more from Jack and Barbossa, the fountain of youth would be an excellent premise. But then, after waiting through 10 minutes of credits (like it wasn't long enough to begin with), the final scene finished the story for Will and Elisabeth. The only other option for them is what happens when she gets old and dies, and he is still conscripted to the Dutchman. Not such a happy ending after all, is it? I would be happy to see more Pirates movies, with the storyline between Jack and Barbossa carrying the movie, but Elizabeth and Will are pretty well dead to me.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I honestly wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie, but I was hoping that all the questions would be answered.In all honesty, the movie's biggest fault is the fact that it is almost three hours long. I found myself sitting there bored waiting for the movie to end because things just continued to go on and on. The acting was probably the highlight of the film. Again, solid performances by Depp and Rush and they really carry the movie to the end. I was disappointed with the fact that I felt Orlando Bloom did not seem to have a big part in the film except at the end.All in all, I felt the laughs in the movie were suitable for 12 year olds and the plot had too much of a sci-fi twist. And I found myself very confused throughout the entire film, despite having some pretty entertaining action sequences. At the end of the movie, I felt that they left it open to make a fourth movie (which they have pretty much agreed to do) where they create more questions than those that got answered.The bottom line is if you are a fan of the series, check the movie out, but I think unless you are a die-hard fan, you will be quite disappointed.

Some twelve years later, Ebert's line applies to Verbinski's ""Pirates 3."" Both films spend their ducats on big stars (the obviously aggravated Costner and the enthusiastically guy-linered Depp respectively), elaborate floating sets which eventually get blown up real good and enough extras to bring the U.S. unemployment rate down a full point. ""Pirates 3"" has the extra cost that ""Waterworld"" did not of the requisite CGI now standard on all films not labeled ""indie."" The CGI animators create a mass of mock crabs that carry a galleon across a desert, a ship that floats on either side of the ocean's surface and one presumes the tentacled beard of Davy Jones (unless that was all puppetry). Expensive spectacles all to be sure yet Davy Jones' appearance reminds one strongly of the much more convincing aliens in the South African film ""District 9"" a movie that cost reportedly 1/10th the price. ""Pirates 3"" likely contained more than 10 times the amount of special effects but this amounts to overuse of the technology resulting in the ""Transformers""-type visual confusion and difficulty following the action. The excessive CGI is manifest of an overreaching director's vision, again much like Costner's ""Waterworld."" To put it bluntly the film is too damned long clocking in at 3 hours if you count the advertisements and previews most theaters now tack on at the beginning of the screening. Long running times do not represent an inherent evil - certainly broad sweeping biopics such as ""The Aviator"" or films that need to acclimate the audience to a very alien world such as ""Avatar"" require more than the requisite 88 minutes. The third in a series of films based on one of Disneyworld's least interesting amusement park rides maybe doesn't have the grand narrative arc to hold the audience's attention quite that long. Beyond being too much to follow and too much to sit through there is too little interesting dialog, clever repartee and compelling relationships. Depp and Rush clearly compete for attention, Orlando Bloom as overstayed his welcome and more interaction between Depp and Keith Richards is not forthcoming likely because of Richards' limited acting ability (Mick Jagger he is not). In short, rent ""Waterworld"" instead - at least you can follow the story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I exaggerate but I really do believe this could have been a hundred times better.Continuing the proud tradition of the POTC movies, this one has more story lines than characters. This is a great achievement because the movie isn't lacking in characters as they keep coming back to life. The laws of quantum physics are bent, broken and sold for spare parts at various points resulting in numerous WTF moments including a woman who consists entirely of crabs, a regenerating fire monkey and ships armed with what I can only assume are homing cannonballs.Aside from the obvious flaws of characters, plot, dialogue etc the film does have some saving graces. The first is the special effects which are, as expected, very impressive and, where permitted, realistic. The acting by and large is fairly good, apart from knightly who couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Another positive is Capt. Jack Sparrow. Depp again pulls off a slick brand of sickly charm held only by Sparrow and Russell Brand. Sparrow furthers his charm with the acquisition of additional personalities (all Jack Sparrow) and Depp's portrayal of these schizophrenic episodes provide some much needed comic relief in a sea of drab characters.I would say that loyal fans of the Pirate series will enjoy this one. If you are not and especially if you missed number 1 or 2 you will be lost in the constant stream of dramatic betrayals and bizarre swashbuckling. I give Pirates of the Caribbean 3 a generous 4 fish monsters out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The greatest Chinese pirate of all time was not a man! It was a woman, Ching Shih. In this movie, she is relegated to one of the supporting 9 pirate brethren roles. She she should have had the lead.The Calypso was pretty cool, but a little too much like out of Zena, Warrior Princess (a great show, but not appropriate in the POTC setting, IMHO).We didn't see much of Tia Dalma in POTC 2, and only a little more in POTC 3. According to the storyline, her character plays a central role throughout all 3 movies. So why not give her more face time? Her compelling relationship with Davy Jones could have been explored more, which would have re-enforced what we learned in the first two movies. The movie alludes to Dalma's and Jones' pain, but we don't witness it. That could have been very powerful.The writers had a great opportunity to play off the ancient seafaring myth of a flat world, a place that ancient mariners truly dreaded, to the extent that it halted westward expansion for a millennium. How many times in the history books have you seen those images of great sea monsters lurking at the edge of the earth, where any ship foolish enough to travel was doomed - to either those monsters or an eternal abyss? It could have (and should have) been an allegorical high point, ala Moby Dick. It could have had the Kraken (or a bunch of baby Krakens) writhing in a bubbling sea of despair, warning the mariners to turn back, but they press on through that adversity. Unfortunately, that drama was very much underplayed and, hence, a disappointment.Another disappointment was in the lack of creative fortitude of the first two movies. As posted elsewhere on this site, POTC 1 was fresh (skeletons walking the ocean floor), POTC 2 introduced new creative drama and fun(the Kraken!, headhunters, Jack's lizard walk), but POTC 3 just seems to lack that creative genius.One emotional high would have to be Boostrap's mid-movie behavior. Anybody who has watched a loved one waste away with Alzheimer's will certainly be touched by that scene. And Jack's internal dialogue was interesting, but could have been a little more ethereal, perhaps like some of those dark scenes from What Dreams May Come (but with the POTC aesthetic).Overall, POTC doesn't hold a candle to LOTR, but then its not supposed to. I view POTC sort of like the ride: it should be fun, a little scary, and a little wet. Unfortunately, most of the fun is missing from POTC 3; what fun is there is misplaced, and there isn't enough emotional dark drama to offset it(perhaps aside from Bootstrap).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

We went back and forth over some titles when he reluctantly picked Knocked Up (he thought I was at work earlier and I didn't tell him I watched some movies and one of his choices, Delta Farce, was in another theatre that wasn't near him). When we arrived at his neighborhood cinema, however, I asked if he enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End the night before with his nephew. He said he did and asked if I was willing to switch to that. I did since I didn't want to see KU again so soon. Now, having not seen the previous two installments and having fallen asleep during some of the movie, I was a little confused at what was going on but by the fight scenes in the final 15 or so minutes, I was genuinely thrilled by many of the action set pieces. As the new pirate king, Keira Knightly delivered a very rousing speech to her new crew. Orlando Bloom certainly proved very sexy and romantic next to her. Seeing multiple Johnny Depps and having a dialogue with his father (and his character's inspiration) Keith Richards provided some of the movie's many amusing moments. I may now have to see the first two POTC films and this one again to really understand what was going on but I must say, I still didn't have a bad time watching this one.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is trapped by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in his own version of hell but he soon finds his old friends and joins them in bringing the bullies down.No way was I sitting through this in the cinema. After the under-whelming last instalment which scuppered the memory of the excellent first film, I did not fancy spending nearly three hours twitching and fidgeting through what was bound to be an almost equally bad prequel.Now I've finally seen it on DVD (free to watch it at my own pace), I guess I can't complain too much. Anyone who sat through The Return of the King can't either, because the pace is nowhere near as slow and there's none of that nonsense with the bits where you think it's ended and then it hasn't. Jack Sparrow is still quintessentially Johnny Depp's role, and although he looks a little creaky here, he still tries to give it his all. Knightley is good as feisty support, and Keith Richards makes his cameo as Sparrow's dad but Bloom is still terminally wooden and there's not much more to the cast than that.It's a stylish, slick, polished effort with a lot of flair put into it. But this series really went downhill after the first one. **","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first instalment of the trilogy was amazing, Johnny Depp creating a character that was so lovable and appealing to all ages made the film the most talked about for a while. The 2nd film while still entertaining mainly due to Johnny Depp was long winded and took so long to entertain, that you were no longer interested after an hour. The third film unfortunately not even Jack Sparrow could save. Orlando Bloom succeeded in being more annoying and amateur like than the first movie. A fête which I thought was near impossible for any one actor to accomplish. Keira Knightley again did nothing but make me want to get up and vacate the cinema every time she appeared on screen. The film although mildly entertaining if stood alone seems to have departed so much from the first movie that you could easily assume that the trilogy had nothing in common except the use of the same characters. The Curse of the Black Pearl managed to encapsulate all that people would associate with pirates and bring all the ideas together. Resulting in a film that was entertaining, funny and wrongly or rightly had you rooting for the triumph of the pirates. In my opinion the two latter instalments achieved nothing but disappointment. Hopefully now this will be the end and I can try my hardest to gain back the hours of life I have wasted by watching this movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a plot that shouldn't be too too complicated, but boy it endeavors to make your head spin. I loved the first two Pirates films and pretty much knew the characters and plot lines, but I still couldn't fathom some character's motivations or why some things were happening. It felt at times like the directors were putting the movie together by way of a jigsaw puzzle.I found no fault in the acting. Depp was great as usual, but being that these films are more or less him, it is questionable as to why he's given so little to do. Geoffrey Rush is great though tame this time. Knightly is fine, though I don't know who thought it was a good idea to rip off Braveheart. Bloom, funny enough, gives his best performance in any of the trilogy. Bill Nighy turns in a better performance than last time as Davy Jones.There's no fault in the acting or special effects, though there's little notable action and nothing that approaches the brilliance of the three way swordfight in #2. This movie hinted at a sort of mad brilliance on ocassion, but like Spider-man 3, just seemed to be too high on it's own popularity. The script by far carries the brunt of the fault here. There were far too many ridiculous plot-holes and vague explanations. Also like SM3 there were too many unnecessary plot lines. Why the hell was Tia Dalma given so much (and yet so little) to do? Her plot-line was pointless. Why was Chow Yun Fat in this movie if he had nothing to do? How did the main cast get to Singapore if they didn't have a crew or a ship? The film is too long and overdrawn. You could have cut about an hour from this film and it probably would've been better. There's fun to be had, but the lasting feeling is irritation.This was one of those movies that I really wanted to like and for the critics to be wrong about. But they're right. The movie is mediocre, and that's a shame. I hope one of the ""Third"" movies this summer will break the curse, one even more horrible than that caused by cursed Aztec gold.

And then, Sparrow arrives, does weird one-liners, jokes, moves and everything, and we still feel fine, because we liked the first movie - in a way. After about 50 minutes we still believe there has to be a believable story behind all this, and after about 80 minutes we were confronted with even more mysterious plot lines and desperately hope that everything fits together in the end...But, this does not happen. Instead we are confronted with lots of ""this is my ship, get your own crew, get off my ship, let's enter the other ship, and where is the plot anyway?"". The result is really boring after half of the film and continues 'til the end, which is even more disappointing. In conclusion, there is nothing we can follow through the film, just the hope that a final showdown will solve all our problems. But if even this showdown fails, the whole film remains in our minds as just an bombastic pirate movie-clip with nothing to remember at all.And Johnny Depp? Well, we plays his role just like before, which was basically great in contrast to the other characters and a quite simple plot.

This one however is so convoluted and archly constructed that even allowing for the still impressive effects, I neither knew or cared what was going on within the first half hour; it just got more and more silly, confusing, and boring to boot. Enough is enough, there was no story to begin with, and we forgave them that..but no more...I like Johnny Depp and no doubt he has bills to pay, but I never want to see him ponce around like that ever again, it's pathetic, the only bright spot in the whole thing was Keith Richards, he has actually got screen presence, and knocked everyone else off the screen in his brief appearance...not worth waiting a whole 2 hours for though. Forget this rubbish....yuck.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In my opinion, the first Pirates movie was magnificently done. It was entertaining, the characters were lovable (although somewhat cliché), there was humor at the right times, and the special effects were pretty good. Oh, and the story line was very easy to follow.The second film was just OK. The plot got a little too crazy for my tastes- in the first film, the only unrealistic components were the whole crew of the damned. I didn't mind it too much, one completely unreal event in a movie isn't bad. In the second film, they just went overboard. A monster that can swallow ships whole, Davy Jones' locker... at least get the story behind the flying dutchman correct!This film's plot was just bad. There is no other way to put it. Isn't this series called Pirates of the Caribbean? Then why start out in Asia? It really didn't add anything to the plot to start out there, just made it more confusing. And I don't confuse easily! In addition, the first two hours of the movie were riddled with unbelievable/unrealistic events. A great over use of deus ex machina in my opinion. I'm still wondering why Calypso and Keith Richards were in this movie... they didn't add anything to this film (except another 15 minutes). The plot was utterly useless and detracted from what was actually done well in the movie.The most redeeming quality of this movie would probably be the camera work/special effects. These were top-notch, with the scenes being beautifully detailed and rich in color, with great CGI effects.If you want to see this in the theater, go right ahead. I personally feel that my $9.25 could have been much better spent, and I would have rather waited for it to come out on DVD so I could openly talk about what the heck was going on with my friends.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first movie revived a long dead genre and the second build up a real 'Empire strikes back' cliffhanger but unfortunately the third fails to deliver. The first two hours are spent with endless tired dialog and unfunny jokes, and when we finally get to the action scenes they look like something ripped from either of the two first movies. The plot twists and turns with more backstabbing than you would imagine, and the main problem with this is the fact that there is a path that would make everybody happy, but nobody seems to acknowledge it (least of all the scrips writers).I caught myself looking at my watch 4 times during the film wishing it to end, which is something I can't remember feeling since 'Phantom menace'. And for the love of god don't wait for the after-the-credit scene as it is completely unnecessary and certainly not worth the long wait. I really wanted this to be good, but in the end I just wanted to go home and watch a Hornblower movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Overlong, over-hyped, overblown, undisciplined mess of a movie. I have never got the Pirates Of The Caribbean phenomenon and I never will","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1661940/?ref_=tt_urv","teh_mode","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2116666/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2007","Whip out your cutlass, put on your eye-patches, feed your parrots and fetch up a bottle of Malibu or two. Yes it is that time of year again, the time when I say ""Oh god, not this tripe again"" and stomach another movie featuring a cesspool of floundering talent awash in the midst of a franchise vehemently sailing way out of control. It is Pirates Of The Caribbean, the most overrated, overlong, over-hyped and damn well irritating movie trilogy since the Star Wars prequels. A throwback to the late 1950s style of TV-counter cinema that said to hell with logic, convention or narrative cohesion, films need to be really long, really grandiose and utterly overblown. And this time, it is the dark side of those pesky pirate dwellers, as the opening scenes of serf hangings suggests a much more mephitic aura to the film. That is, until a certain Johnny Depp turns up.Continuing much in the same vein as the second instalment of the POTC franchise, At World's End has no plot. Or rather it has 28 different plots, all of which are almost entirely incomprehensible. The first quest of note is the one to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow, last seen tickling the throat of that huge great Kraken at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After they have done that, they must call the Pirate lords from all four corners of the globe, including Captain Barbossa (Rush), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Sao Feng (Yun-Fat) and a whole host of culture-clashing pirates. Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett is still searching for Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Jack Sparrow, in the hope that he will be able to execute them all himself.The first Pirates Of The Caribbean was an entertaining mess, the second film was a sporadically enjoyable mess. Third time around it is just a mess. After the film's opening we are introduced to the new bad guy, Sao Fen, played by Chow Yun-Fat. Chow made his name with ultra-violent John Woo actioners, and as he rambles this boring Singapore bad-guy drivel, all I could think was how I wished he would just whip out a Beretta, an Uzi and a pump-handle shotgun and just shoot the hell out of absolutely everything that moves. This is a movie in desperate need of some John Woo-style mayhem. We are then re-acquainted with Captain Jack Sparrow, who appears to have gone bonkers by himself in the land of the dead. We are now treated to the sight of multiple Jack Sparrows all vying for position as the Captain of the black pearl. All the worst since Depp's space jockeying has become completely absurd. Then there's the drawn out love between Elizabeth Swan and Orlando. In fairness to Keira Knightley, she does her best under the circumstances, but Orlando Bloom is just not good enough for a romantic lead. His version of acting is, if you are a bit angry, turn the volume up. If you are a bit said, turn the volume down. But under no circumstances will you stretch your precious face beyond its lovely unwrinkled borders. He is almost transparent for this movie, as the huge concoction of ""stuff"" that happens all over the screen never allows his weak talents to shine through.If, like me, you are thoroughly bored with Johnny Depp's gravitationally challenged pirate shtick, the film's only saving grace is the fairly spectacular final ship battle. There are cannons blazing, swords clashing, rain raging down and explosions galore. Yet even this is spoilt by a ridiculous moment of infancy, when Will Turner decides to pop the question to Ms Swan in the middle of a huge sword fight. It is this moment that sums the film up for me. It is too grizzly for young kids, but too infantile for gown-ups. It is almost the money-stroking filmmakers way of saying ""to hell with logic, we think its funny, so what?"" I have never gotten the fascination the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. It is ridiculously overlong, woefully directed, badly acted and spectacularly undisciplined. I don't get people's fascination with Johnny Depp's one-joke note performance, made even more insufferable by a self-knowing cameo by Keith Richards as the old drunk's father. I really don't get how Gore Verbinski has become the single most profitable director of our generation grossing well over a billion dollars with his films. I don't doubt that, like the first two, At World's End will take a ridiculous amount of money, and cause a huge wave of Jack Sparrow hysteria. Nor do I doubt that the very same people that were bowled over by the first two movies will embrace At World's End in much the same vein. But as far as I am concerned, this is just not good enough. Not for my summer blockbusters, and not for my pockets. And if people continue to humour Jerry Bruckheimer, by giving him the box office figures he is more than used to, you will not only encourage him to do it again, but you will damage the reputation of all those involved with this mess, but you will encourage them all to do it again. Hollywood will only work as hard as they need to, and a profitable movie is more important to them than art, entertainment, or the movie industry as a whole.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's about the only compliment i can give it other than a couple good one liners. It was filmed very well, as were its precedes.But this movie has absolutely no meaning behind its actions, no clear plot or story line, and a lot of the same cliché ""adventurous"" acts as most sword fighting movies have. One example would be that, like in the other two Pirate movies, there was a sword fight between two people while they were balancing on something. It's been done a hundred times before; not exciting.The only consistent character throughout the three movies was Jack. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and plays his role very well as usual. But his co-cast members cannot seem to get a grasp on their character. For one, I thought Davey Jones was almost a completely different person from who he was in the second Pirates movie. That's just one example but there are others as you will see in the movie.And also, the level of humor was extremely juvenile for the audience the movie seemed to attract. With all the violence and situations that are not so appropriate for children, the humor was that of a five year old's, with the exception of a couple one liners made by Johnny Depp.So with a dry and meaningless plot, bad character consistency, AND clichés, this movie was one that I feel I've lost some brain cells and wasted dear moments of my life.Also i spent $9.75 to go see it so i hope you don't make the same mistake as I did.If you must see it, please i beg of you to wait until it reaches DVD so you don't waste so much money and you'll have the option to turn it off whenever desired.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Relies too much on Depp's performance, which, albeit very pleasant, becomes repetitive when framed by a non-existent storyline.Most people who found this movie 'awesome' will also say they found the prequels 'excellent'. However, there is no question that this movie is very weak as compared to the first of the trilogy. Where the first had a compact, entertaining storyline and polished characters, ""At world's end"" flounders ineffectively, ultimately failing in terms of good storytelling.There are excellent visual effects - some truly glorious artistic moments. This goes to prove that a lot of work and devotion was given to the making of this movie - it's not a 'cheap sequel'. But it's entirely disappointing to see that all this work has gone mostly to waste. Like 'Spiderman 3"" it's long, it's tedious and it's trying to be something it's not.The repetitive jokes (which originate from the first movie), the effort to give the film an epic atmosphere...it all falls flat. If it weren't for the visual effects and the excellent soundtrack (from the first movie), I'd rate the quality much lower than I already have. Despite Depp's and Rush's professional efforts, the fact that the movie barely contains a concrete plot cannot be overlooked.The reason why you see people unquestionably adorning the movie with 10 stars is because they liked the prequels. They would have been happy with anything, as long as it contained the name 'Jack Sparrow'. And, of course, that seems to be the ultimate purpose of the scenario of this movie: Depp fan service, Kira fan service, and Bloom fan service...oh, and 'insert character' fan service.The first movie, in my opinion, is at a completely different level from the sequels. I didn't find this movie very entertaining, only vaguely redundant.Completely disappointed. Not up to par.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you say yes you are a liar. You are lying to yourself.What I don't get is that admitting this movie is bad does not in ANY way take away from the original POTC. It doesn't make it any less great of a movie (which it was - the first POTC was a very, very good movie).Questions for some of you die-hards:1. What was with the ""sexual tension"" between Knightley and Depp? The movie started to imply there was something there in numerous scenes, but never got any deeper into it or explained why there was tension at all in the first place. Perhaps just bad acting on Knightley's part? I checked into this and the script never intended there to be any.2. What the hell was that flipping the boat over crap all about? (DON'T just recite the inane storyline to me, I understood it quite well at the time. It was just completely stupid.)3. Could there have been possibly one more double-cross? Could the director have possibly squeezed in just ONE more? To make it, by my count, 18 double crosses?4. The pirate meeting! THE PIRATE MEETING!

But all i found was a confusing plot. What happened to the easy to understand and well driven plot like the first movie? There were so many thrown in plot points that didn't seem relevant and it made the movie boring. It was tremendously long too so i don't understand why they put so much useless scenes in. I also found some of the actors speech hard to understand, leading me to be completely lost and have no idea whats going on. However, the special effects were great, and the acting was well done. There are some really well done parts in the movie which i enjoyed, but the rest in between made me loose interest. Pirates 1 is by far the best and At Worlds End is no where near its success.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Just like in ""Dead Man's Chest"" it fails to capture the enthusiasm and warmth the first movie provided so easily. The writers clearly tried to put a bunch of plots and subplots, but failed to let things blend together smoothly enough, making the story difficult to follow at some times. The jokes are often the kind of jokes you would expect on the back of your calendar (referring especially to the poor humor of pirate-buddies Pintel and Ragetti). Fortunatley, there are a few nice comedic relieves as well -- I enjoyed the multiple Jack Sparrows -- but they were very hard to find. There were some plot holes in the story and an extra load of questions were thrown at us. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" tried too hard to be epic for me and had seemingly lost its touch with ""Curse of The Black Pearl"". Johnny Depp's performance was once again charming and the only bright light for me in this rather boring adventure. Too much visual spectacle had to make up for lack of a solid story. 6/10 - **/****","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was too long, slow, convoluted, and dark, and by dark I mean, visually dark and not interesting. The most beloved character, Jack Sparrow did not show up until the end of the first hour into the movie, and the scene of his first appearance was the best, the funniest, and sadly, the only scene in the movie that I liked. It showed Jack Sparrow trapped on the sea of sand in Davy Jones' Locker as the captain and the multiple members of the crew. The scene brought to memory the famous sequence from Being John Malcovich and it was the highest point of the movie. After that, Jack was moved to the periphery of the plot which was so incoherent that the film creators actually came up with the list of FAQ that baffled moviegoers had about the total mess of the final installment in the pirate trilogy. The list was included with the DVD. The original idea to make a movie based on the popular Walt Disney theme park ride proved to be great for two first movies that are funny and entertaining. The idea to create a philosophical-metaphysical-mythological epilogue to the series in the traditions of Lord of the Rings turned to be disastrous. The movie failed flat in all directions. I was either bored or laughed at the scenes that were not meant to be unintentionally funny. Even appearance of Keith Richards, Johnny Depp's inspiration for the role of Jack Sparrow, as Jack's father did not help much. First two films were exiting, had stunning special effects and awesome achievements in make up. The films breeze freely and move along with great pace. I liked the second movie very much because the way its creators prepared us for the third film was very clever. The final chapter, sadly, was ambitious ponderous mess.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Various ""asides"" in the plot rely on you remembering what happened in the previous episode, but they were referenced so briefly, it was difficult to get your bearings. It desperately needed an hour cutting out of it. There was a brilliant film hiding in there. In fact, the first film was excellent and there is a single excellent second film to be made out of the footage of the second and third films.A good example of the confused complexity was the introduction of several other pirate captains - each used stereotypes to establish their character and at various points the film stalled to ensure that each one was allowed their reaction: yet in the end they contributed nothing to moving the story along. In fact, so many other characters were allowed their little cameo that the key characters were reduced to bit parts along their way. Surely the ambiguous relationship between Elizabeth and Norrington needed more than a couple of snatched sentences to resolve? Similarly, Calypso is a critical plot device, but she is used as a tool to stage a major battle, yet simply vanishes from the plot without a proper resolution once that device is used. Keith Richards again puts in a cameo appearance, but you are left asking why bother? Special effects so good you don't even consider them, but all in all an insubstantial and disappointing film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Please bear in mind that, to avoid spoilers, there is actually more to it than that.There are probably two good, fun 90 minute films in the two PotC sequels.

The villains and heroes changed roles about every 10 mins, and when the characters eventually ran out of things to do, the movie just... well, ended. Finally. Thankfully. It's not that it was actually bad, just incredibly boring. The effects were good but, as we saw in Spiderman 3, spectacular effects don't carry a dull movie.If you're hoping this last film manages to recapture the charm of the first, I'm sorry.

Still I scaled my expectations down to rock bottom took gods name and entered the theater.Well I was right, this was indeed better than part 2, but I have a stinking feeling my rock bottom expectations had a lot to do with it.For starters Part 2 wasn't 3hr+(it certainly felt like it) it was 150 min this ones 168 but still felt only 168 min long.The movie is still script-less, multiple ideas, multiple scenes, and multiple gags have been stitched together in one editing and storytelling disaster, PLOT HOLES and continuity be damned.Yet this movie pull through, mainly on the basis of continued good performances from the main cast and the continuing antics of some of the new characters, as well the ""sideys"" that have been upgraded (laurel and hardy pirate duo).The jokes and one liners are still funny, and the attention paid to individual scenes ensure that although the entire package is strictly OK some of the scenes are breathtaking in their scale and really funny.The acting and soundtrack is once again up there and technically too this movie is as sound as any movie with this budget should be.Even the finest ingredients can give an ordinary dish if the recipe is bad or the execution is messed up.Even here the movies tosses up decent moments but the overall package rises just above tolerable.Some memorable scenes are the pirates meeting and the rescue of jack sparrow.The dialogues still are the highlight of this series (and some extent the budget and related big scenes) and even here they don't disappoint, lots of memorable dialogues help to carry this film through.Any attempt at logic and looking for continuity or plot holes will only lead to misery.A idea with enough content for a ride was made into 3 films and I'm embarrassed that I'm not man enough not to resist the hype.IF YOU DO FEEL COMPELLED TO WATCH IT THEN PLEASE DO SO WITH ROCK BOTTOM EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT IS UNEMOTIONALLY THIS MOVIE IS REALLY ONE BAD PIECE OF CINEMA.-s no script whatsoever, lots of bad patches, TO MUCH FOCUS KIERA KNIGHTLY.+/-s responsibility is shared by the cast, not as much focus on Depp.+s some really good moments that are spread throughout, superb technical values, acting, soundtrack,SUPERB DIALOGUES ONCE AGAIN.total 5/10 (factoring in absolute rock bottom expectations which were exceeded, detailed analysis will only make this movie go from OK to bad to worst, which was not what i felt when i walked out of this movie, i felt it was OK thats the part I've tried to focus on).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Cannons, muskets, and the clang of swords are everywhere, but it doesn't go overboard, nor does it seem out of place (like that wheel- balancing sword-fight in Dead Man's Chest). It just seems right.But then there's the humor, that was ever-present in the Black Pearl, but seriously lacking in Dead Man's Chest. It's back, and boy is it great. Black Pearl became known for doing a great job at intertwining action and comedy, and At World's End brings it back and does a great job. Again, the comedy is no where out of place, and the timing is perfect.Those in the press who gave this movie a disappointing rating need to see it again, and actually pay attention. Those who go into this movie with the predisposition that it'll be disappointing will only find disappointment, and thus will miss the great experience that At World's End is. The storyline is beautifully done and leaves you wanting more.And to those who call this a finale, not so fast. There is plenty left open, plenty of questions to be answered, and the ending scene following the credits, along with the last scene before the credits is proof of this. Will they make a fourth Pirates? Who knows, but I'm hoping so, and that fourth Pirates would easily make a finale.With the resurrection of the comedy and action found in Curse of the Black Pearl and the elimination of many of the problems with Dead Man's Chest, At World's End is a great film that is going to be on my buy list when it hits store shelves (Blu-Ray, of course). I highly recommend this film for those who loved the first movie and either loved or even felt disappointed by the second.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a breath of fresh air, at least in what comes to blockbusters. Yes, it had the big special effects, the two lovers and all the clichés this kind of film offers, but it brought the pirates and the good old-fashioned adventure flicks. Although the second film was already a bit of a disappointment, it still had some of the spirit of the first and, at least it had its funny and entertaining moments and the end left some eager for more. But then came ""At World's End""... Let's face it, Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow played a huge part on the films' success and he doesn't appear until about we're 30 minutes into the film. I don't mean to diminish the other actors' work, but during that time we see some of the worst moments of the three films. When Jack Sparrow finally appears, he makes his worst entry ever. The multiple Jacks don't make up for his absence at all and are just plain silly and boring, not funny in any way. Then, the film continues to get worse. Starting with the storyline. There's too much to be revealed and too many characters which makes for too many camera swifts and very confusing scenes. Some of the acting is unbearable, and most of these unbearable moments come from Orlando Bloom. He was never good in any of his previous films, but, on this one particularly, I just wanted somebody to kill Will Turer. He's by far the worst actor of ""Pirates"" and got a well deserved nomination for the Razzies. Unfortunately he's not alone. One of the things that made me hate the film, was the wasted talent. Bill Nighy is a great actor, but gave a very poor performance here, as well as Geoffrey Rush (which was surprising since he was great in the first) and Keira Knightley. But not everything is bad on this third film. Visually, it astonishing. The make-up is very impressive, specially Davy Jones and his crew. The special effects make some very epic scenes. Keith Richards was also a very pleasant surprise. Nevertheless, ""At Worl's End"" made enough money to let us guess that there will be more Pirates in the future, which shouldn't happen. I would hate to see them ruining it more than they already did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But what I can do it let you know that you sir have ruined the Pirates franchise for life.So our story begins in Singapore when Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) are looking for a ship an allies because Lord Beckett and Davy Jones have teamed up to conquer the pirate world I guess. From this point on it is a half an hour of bullshit that doesn't even pertain to the movie. It was a neat fight scene, but how many neat fight scenes can one put in a movie, much less, a trio of movies with neat fight scenes already.So what do you do? You try to give a blockbuster movie an elaborate storyline. Let's be honest here sir, blockbusters don't have elaborate story lines. They have lots of action, great effects, impressive sets, and a story line that isn't hard to follow. The only people who will get the movie are the faithful followers of the pirates. The ones that come to the theater dressed like them. I haven't seen that yet but I am sure it has happened.The movie was 2 ½ hours. Was that really necessary? To add all the extra dialogue that had nothing to do with the movie was point less. Then you have everyone in the movie making shrewd back room deals. It gets to a point you feel like a stockbroker in his first day standing in the pit watching everyone do crazy hand signals.Here's another question, what the hell happened between William (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth? They don't love each other, and they don't trust each other. They feel their ""burdens are theirs to bare."" And then all of a sudden, during the final fight, they want to get married and ask Barbossa to marry them. Barbossa? What did he go to Sunday School while gone for Dead Man's Chest? There was no chemistry at all between them. In fact, I didn't get William Turner at all. I think Bloom was phoning in his performance. He sucked! There was a spark between Jack and Elizabeth, and it would have been funny if he popped in during that wedding scene on the ship.Johnny Depp did an amazing job as usual, and I think you do a very great job of manipulating the camera. There is no question that this was a well-shot movie. It would have been even better shot if we could have done away with the multiple Jack sequences as well. Sure it was funny the first time but it got quite old quite fast. I think we get the point, he's conflicted. He has been conflicted since Pearl. That is one of the things you have to like about him. He is unpredictable and you never know what he is going to do.The bottom line Gore is that this movie was way too much of the logic and not enough of the fantastic. You only had one scene in the movie that was fun when Calypso turned into the giant woman and exploded. You try to develop a relationship between her and Jones but fail as they have one time together in the movie where she turned him into a normal man before he revamps into squid face. A movie like this needs to be quick, fun, and thrilling. Not boring, trite, and following a storyline like the pirates following the code presented by Keith Richards, nice marketing move there people.This movie was a little fun, but not as much fun as the first two and unfortunately it looks like there's room for a sequel, and I can tell you will after the paycheck you will receive, make that. I wonder if your actors are up to the task for that as well. You had only four five fight scenes and too much craziness to deal with for a simple summer blockbuster. When I watch Pirates, I want it to be simple, fast, furious, and fun.Your movie was 2 ½ hours, so I will give you 2 ½ shots of Seagrams.JAE","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the only laughs at the press screening (We movie reviewers get to see this early) were afforded in retrospect, when reviewers recalled the plea of the studio that they not reveal details of the plot's twists and resolutions in writing about it.Reveal 'em? I'd bet a wooden eye that there wasn't anyone in the room who could understand 'em! Unless you watch the first two ""Pirates"" movies in the hours before you see this one, unless you have a Ph.D. in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" studies, you will have no idea what in blazes is going on nor, I reckon, will you give an undead monkey's patootie.In what's shaping up to be a summer of deflating third-films-in-the-series, ""At World's End"" is the loudest, dumbest, slowest, least entertaining and most annoying by a very comfortable margin. The second ""Pirates"" film did quite a bit to erase the good will created by the first. This one makes matters worse, leaving you feeling angry, cheap and suckered -- after the coma lifts and the raging headache subsides, that is.Director Gore Verbinski and a team of writers who should wear masks when picking up their checks have turned their serendipitous blend of comedy and action into a grotesque special effects franchise laden with jokes that were already tired when the first film dragged to its conclusion. They have let the tail grow so big that it not only wags the dog but dashes its brains out against a mast.The ineptitude of ""At World's End"" is evinced in its hoohah about the goddess Calypso, the mythological sea nymph who, here, has been trapped in human form by a cabal of pirates. For reasons too complex to explain (wouldn't want to spoil those precious plot twists!), she is released from her fleshy bonds, morphs with unintentional hilarity into a giantess and . . . disappears from the film without rhyme, reason, explanation or purpose. A good 15 minutes has been spent fussing about nothing. Add 21/2 hours to that and you pretty much sum up the whole ordeal.For the record, a crew led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) sets off to free Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' Locker, a spectral underworld comically filled with multiple Captain Jacks, so that he can join a council of pirate bigwigs assembling against the British; Jones himself (Bill Nighy) is in the thrall of the evil capitalist Beckett (Tom Hollander), who controls his heart and thus his invincible ship; Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) struggles to free his dad, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), from Jones' crew; and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) pursues both Will and Captain Jack, unsure whom she truly loves.Throw in several more plot lines, a few new characters, the icky romance of moony Bloom and knock-kneed Knightley, lots of computerized fighting and sailing, and painfully tiresome comic relief involving Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, and it amounts to nearly three hours of slow misery, none of which rises to the level of a ""surprise"" or ""twist"" that can be spoiled for anyone.Grudging credit is due to some of the special effects and, especially, to Keith Richards, the only one among all this prattling mob who knows that less is more. Of course, he's granted a mere 90 seconds of screen time before the film succumbs once again to its congenital pointlessness. The pang of regret you feel at his departure is the sole emotion this mess ever manages to stir.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Another dead captain (Barbossa - Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat) and the lovely Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), team up to extract Jack from Davey Jones' (Bill Nighy) Locker - a desert island where dead pirates end up. Why? Well, it's actually sort of unclear, but it seems that they want to end Jones' scourge and gain their freedom from the British fleet's persecution once and for all... or something. And oh ya, they bring along the goddess Calypso, bound ages ago into a human form by pirates, just in case she wants to help her persecutors fight against her former lover Jones.Rush is great, Depp is amusing and the rest of the cast does well. The sea battles and visual effects are particularly good. But the film's meandering plot, and over-emphasis on frenetic visual activity detracts from its aesthetics and renders it merely entertaining in a very Disney way. Epic, repetitively paced and hyperactive, World's End is the least interesting of the Pirates of the Caribbean Series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

POTC3's special effects might keep your eyes fixated on the screen, but what you see will make no sense. The movie features a squid-faced alien, a square-rigger being carried on the backs of thousands of crabs, talking skulls, ships falling off the end of the world—literally, and more. Dream sequence or no, the whole movie reeks of fantasy nonsense.None of the POTC movies to date have much to do with reality, or with actual 17th century pirates. Real swashbucklers were far more interesting—and far more terrifying—than this drivel. It's a shame Disney decided to target the 10-14 year old boy audience with big budget junkers instead of producing an authentic, big-screen version of Black Sails.When I was about 14, my friend's cat got sick and began trailing something from its hindquarters. I think that stringy, tubular thing, soaked in food coloring, became the script for this movie. The story elements become irrelevant, lost in the absurdity of what's happening on screen.Simply put, this movie is an insult to the intelligence.NOTE: extra star added for the special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is a little more of the comedy aspect in this one than in the second turning the Johnny Depp character, Jack sparrow, almost into a silent comedian-type with all the shtick that he goes thru. The movie makers teased us with the upcoming Keith Richards cameo as Sparrow's father and the romance of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters blossoming into a marriage but these were very minor parts of the overblown and overlong 3 hour + movie that this one turned out to be. This adventure started in Singapore as pirates around the world(representing free men) are trying to unite against the evil British-like empire(representing the oppressive slave-based upperclass). Jack Sparrow is in Davy Jones's Locker going mad as he commands a crew of his own look-a-like's which leads to some funny scenes. Bloom & Knightley and others are trying to find him and free him from this other-worldly grave for one reason or another. They are successful, of course, and the battle begins. kind of. There are so many other elements to this movie too numerous to mention that just confuse the heck out of the thing to the point where you realize that all the dialogue is just going to lead into an action-filled climax, so as the viewer you kind of give up on the particulars and wait for this. This, in my opinion, is the fault of the director(if he can't make us understand the plot why include it at all??). Pieces of these specifics include a witch turning into A giant force of nature, the return of the Davy Jones ship and it's crew siding with the Brits, and a guy-girl romance with the hint of jealousy over Jack Sparrow, of course. All of this is thrown together into a money-wasting overblown swashbuckling adventure leaving the viewer looking at this watch wondering when it's all going to end. Oh Hollywood, when are you going to believe that the American audience is smart and has a heart instead of peddling us this junk as entertainment?? -- I guess never because we keep shelling out the dough so that another one can come out with the same senseless stuff as the one before(don't be surprised if there is a number four in this series and more...).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As the third film finishes (assuming, and it is a big assumption, that this is the end in a trilogy) the trio of films feels very much like ""The Matrix Trilogy"": it started with promise but cashed-in in a disappointing manner that ruins the fine start.Now, this is not as bad as has been made out. The plot (or rather plots) is a complete mess, but there is still fun to be had. Johnny Depp is still thoroughly entertaining, as is Geoffrey Rush. Gore Verbinski also directs the film, at times, with a great deal of ambition and a bit of visual style. It is a truly cinematic film with many sequences that push boundaries and that are clearly made for the big screen. If you can follow the basic plot there is enough to get you by.However, the film is far too long and, though many actors try hard, you are bored and ultimately don't care what the outcome of the climax is. Also, individual characters get lost in the mêlée of this film (there isn't even enough of Johnny Depp) and so many people cross each other that you haven't really got a clue what anybody is doing. Orlando Bloom is complete tripe and I remain bemused at how he is a major film star, whilst Keira Knightley, that's Oscar nominated Keira Knightley, isn't much better, even though she's shown that she can be good. Furthermore, it's a geeky complaint but, Hans Zimmer's music is crap. It's so crap, you notice it, which is a real measure of how bad it is.Anyway, the film as a whole is pretty rubbish, but there are worse films out there and it isn't all dreadful. It is also questionable as to whether this film can really be seen as family entertainment. There is a lot of death; it's too complicated and too dark, though teenagers will love it. There are things to enjoy but I would, on the whole, advise against.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Really, I did. I thought the first two Pirates films were fun but very flawed movies. I was hoping that this would be the film to really rap it all up and give new life to those first two films. Sadly, it just didn't do that for me.Personally, Jack Sparrow has never been more interesting than as he was in Curse of the Black Pearl. Depp's performance made that movie and he deserved his Oscar nomination. But in these sequels, something's missing from Jack and I'm having real trouble figuring out what it is. Depp plays him well enough in At World's End and they take the character to some bizarre new places, but I actually found myself not rooting for Jack in this film. I was rooting for Davey Jones.Speaking of Davey Jones, there is just not enough of him in this movie. He and his crew were by far the highlight of Dead Man's Chest. The rap up to his story is very disappointing. He has abilities in this movie that seem inconsistent, and the way he gets around not being able to set foot on land in one particular scene is quite honestly just lame. More of his history is explained, but it goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing, as does a subplot involving Calisto that is truly and aggravatingly underwhelming.Some of the recurring characters just feel tacked on. The bumbling pair of British soldiers really didn't need to be here and they provide for a very weak plot resolution in the film's third act.Bloom does the best he can I suppose, but let's face it, Will Turner is just not a very interesting character. Kiera Knightley has improved, though I still don't completely like the way she plays angry, what with all the jutting out of the lower jaw. The return of Geoffrey Rush is glorious however. I found Captain Barbossa to be a much more compelling character than Sparrow in this film. Playing a pirate is a role that can easily lead to overacting, and Rush masterfully knows when to go full throttle or apply the breaks a bit. Stellan Skarsgard's role is so small it's barely worth mentioning. Chow Yun-Fat was good, but I wanted more. the real revelation here however is Keith Richard's small role. I was dreading his cameo, but his character completely steals the show and his line delivery is wonderful.The special effects are amazing, despite a few unconvincing shots of multiple Sparrows in act II (it's too complicated to explain). The final action scene is an absolute marvel of technical wizardry. I'm gonna go ahead and call this as next year's Academy Award winner for Best Visual Effects. The only problem is, the final battle is underwhelming. Without getting into spoilers, this scene could have been far more epic. While I was amazed with the visuals, I just couldn't bring myself to get excited as I did in say the Mumakil stampede in Return of the King.I'm sure this film will make gobs of money, and many people might still love it. I never understood what people found so great about the other two, so I'm not going to try to predict how die hard fan's of the series will react. All I can say it left me empty and longing for the great adventure epic it could have been.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A fantastic, emotional, heart drenching opening shot on par with Shindlers list. Then the story goes down hill soon after. With a million plot lines, confusing dialogue, plot holes, characters triple crossing each other it is as if the Director had a bad case of ADD when filming this. Granted the cinematography is great, and the special effects a superb, but the story is just so atrocious its mind bending. Absolutely nothing makes sense in this story. The film is also way to long, you would think with this ADD direction and writing we would be entertained... But no. It's just a bunch of beautifully shot scenes of nonsense. If it wasn't for the exceptionally well camera work and visual effects department this movie would have gotten a solid one from me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They try to reuse many jokes here, and only a few of them actually made me laugh. If it weren't for the breathtaking special effects, the only thing this movie would have accomplished would have been to tire me out. I think the idea might have stayed fresh if they stuck to the basics a bit more and not tried to overcomplicate the story. Also, the ending, which is a little unconventional (usually I like unconventional), didn't work for me.

Shot simultaneously with last year's ""Dead Man's Chest"", this one picks up where that one left off. Which is to sayI have no idea.Okay, that's not entirely true. When last we saw Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, he was being swallowed by the giant sea monster Kraken, which means that he's now surrounded by himself in a strange sort of purgatory located, that's right, at world's end.The story initially involves getting Jack back from Davy Jones' locker, which is necessary in order to save pirates from extinction, because (if you remember from the second one) the British Navy is holding Jones' heart hostage, and thus forcing him (he's the octopus-faced undead pirate) to exterminate the remaining pirates. If you were able to follow all that, good, because that's the most comprehensible portion of the plot. It's the trunk, from which plot lines and motives sprout like Hydra heads from every possible location, layering on additional story arcs that only complicate things. Hammering out all the whys and hows would take far more time and effort than such a movie is worth. Too often, the details of what's happening are fuzzy or uncertain, which is most frustrating because the plot is actually relatively simple.Fortunately, that barely matters, because the point of the movie is to create moments and imagery that awe and enchant. On this level, Pirates 3 succeeds wildly. There are battles with visual effects so stunning that they are scarcely noticed. There's a great scene accompanied by wailing electric guitars that calls to mind the classic westerns of Eastwood and Wayne. The dramatic score is again filled with hard-driving strings and horns that rile adrenaline and make for an over-the-top movie experience. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are still beautiful people. There's a great cameo by a legendary rocker, and Depp still owns the idiosyncratic Captain Jack in every way possible. Just look at that poster! Is that not the epitome of cinematic coolness? All these similarities to the first two are good, but also part of the problem. Some sequels (""Shrek the Third"") get ripped because they are too different from their predecessors. Others get downgraded because they are too similar, which is the category that ""Pirates 3"" falls into. Many of the parts are good, but essentially it's is just more of the same, with an emphasis on the MORE. There is too much here in the almost three hour movie. Continuing the tree trunk analogy, the movie is an out-of-control tree that needs to be pruned back. Clip off those stray branches. Trim the bunny trails and betrayals. Shape the tree into a more presentable and palatable two hours plus.Bottom Line: ""Pirates 3"" had its moments, and wasn't a bad experience overall, but the exhausting length constantly throws needless curves and double-crosses into the relentless fray. As my dad said at the end, ""I hope they stop."" 4 of 10.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't mind that the story got more complex and they put more characters into the movie, but for heavensake, would someone please tell Disney's execs that famous actors & big budget don't necessarily translate into good movie. This movie is so confusing, dialogs sometimes make no sense, plot that contradict the storyline, I just don't know what to follow. And even when I tried to not care about the story line, some of the action and acting are just too much to bear. Kiera and Orlando getting married in the middle of a fight, seems like they're dancing instead of fightng for their life. Beside, in this movie, there's really no chemical between them, suddenly they just decided to get married? Please. Other problem: Old characters lines that get reused over and over, just got boring.

No way!! Better than the second? Nope. As good as either? Sorry. The third installment in the POTC adventures is a drone. Too long and too much. The too much part of it is all the insignificant characters involved. We don't care about them or what they do. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) I would say was interesting. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) was also interesting. All others didn't do enough for us to say, ""They acted well, etc."" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) disappointed me. He wasn't near as funny as he was in the first installment. This time he was there... He had one funny moment toward the end. That was it. As for Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), there was nothing to them! They just stood and talked. In the first two films, we saw them as good, interesting characters. In this one, completely the opposite. Plus, they have a predictable moment together at the end that got me fed up. I truly think this 168 minute long film could have been sliced in half or at least a quarter. I honestly think the film would have been more enjoyable if it had been shorter. Some films are made to be long. This one was not. The second was exactly 150 minutes long or two and a half hours long. That's a tolerable running time. This one was pushing it with practically three hours. No need for that. The story wasn't bad. The screenplay was. The effects were fantastic. So were the costumes and makeup. But what really matters? The story AND screenplay, direction, acting, blahbbity-blooh Those things really didn't show up except for those two characters I mentioned earlier. The only good MINOR character was Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally). He's always fun to listen to. The last MAJOR character to be mentioned is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). He was the most annoying and the least important. Sure, he wanted to wipe out all pirates. But he wasn't the only one. Norrington (Jack Davenport) shows up for a brief, also unnecessary role and so does Governor Swann (Elizabeth's father played by Jonathan Pryce). You see the film has so much potential. The fact that writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote such a great film like POTC 1 and a good POTC 2, don't forget Aladdin, and wrote the masterpiece Shrek, means they have enough skill to write a full screen story and screenplay for the LAST installment of the POTC adventures. Of all POTC films, the last one SHOULD be the best in THEIR eyes. I predicted this to not be as good as the first and second and I was right. They tried TOO HARD to make it the best and it turned out they failed to impress. I gave it two stars for the fact that they tried as hard as they possibly could and for all the junk I mentioned earlier. As for the story, it is all mixed around. Chow Yun-Fat/Yun-Fat Chow as Captain Sao Feng shows up for a brief moment. He wasn't really entertaining but he wasn't annoying either. He was the minor part who was there as another plot device; otherwise, fluff. He started the film. Then the film finally went to what it was all about. Turner, Barbossa, Swann, etc. are on a mission to rescue Sparrow from the depths of Davy Jones' locker. But before that, they have to encounter treachery and deceit from opponents and even allies. More treachery and deceit than needed!! First, someone deceives another. Then that person deceives that person who's friends with another person that has just been killed but then that dead person happens to be another plot device just put there for fun. Then all the people that had just betrayed each other hug and do it again. What I just wrote wasn't completely accurate but that sure was what the film felt like. And what was also ridiculous was the decision of who will be the king/leader/captain of this adventure. First it was this then this but then a that comes in and intrudes but what about these and the thoses. A who shows up but then is killed by a what. The what is killed by the who's friend, sir. A ma'am shows up and it turns out she is going to be the captain. Again, that wasn't completely accurate. But what fun! It was almost like a game! But it was as aggravating as Aggravation! So, what about Davy Jones? Well, he has something happen to him at the end of the film. It was sooooo surprising You know what? I think the film deceived the audience a bit and even gave them some treachery by making them sit through a three hour film. That wasn't very nice. And by the time the last part of the film showed up- the final titanic battle- I think most of the audience was asleep by then. But they shouldn't fret because they really didn't miss anything.

Instead, they were content to deliver the same formulaic entertainment that the first two movies had. And although they succeed in this, the result is missing the charm of the original and to a lesser degree of the first sequel.I think At World's End's most significant weakness is its script. It moves very slowly at times, it's often confusing and it's afraid to try anything new for fear that the audience won't like it. With a movie this silly it's disappointing that it doesn't explore some of the crazier ideas a bit further. Calypso was a bore compared to the Kraken from the previous film. Johnny Depp was wasted as his character ends up in situations we've already seen him in and his reactions are predictable.If it wasn't for the mediocre script, At World's End could have been excellent. The special effects are great, most of the acting is top-notch (except for Bloom and Knightley - I think their inexperience shows), the action is well-choreographed, the directing is decent, but it's all wasted.Another problem was that At World's End seemed to be going for a serious tone at times even though I found the drama laughable. If it had embraced its silliness rather than pretending to be a well made multi-genre movie, it might have worked. As it is, it's big loud predictable entertainment with nothing new to offer.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately At Worlds end tends to be more incoherent than the sequel, and even more pedantic, that it concludes to be a waste of talent.Johnny Depp was sublimely memorable as Jack Sparrow in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", however with this installment he has turned a once named icon to a schizophrenic idiot, whose aimless adventure exacerbates the dull plot line to one similar to a Farelly Brothers script. Offcourse there needs to be humor, however since the adventure itself is disoriented, the humor surfaces as purely lame and unfunny. Keira Knightley has much better movies in her resume, that she does not need Elizabeth Swann as a driving force for her career, as God only knows that she may end up capitalizing on this mundane and overdone character over some of the other major projects, that could turn her into a highly acclaimed actress. Finally there's Orlando Bloom who may provide eye candy to many teenage girls but his acting skills needs such an uplifting as much as Gore Verbinski's directing.The only positive aspect was seeing the once villainous Captain Barbosa returning to his conniving and shrewd role BUT Geoffrey Rush wasn't powerful enough to patch up the loop holes in the movie.At the end all what remains is sheer confusion, plenty of yawns and watch staring.

Davy Jones, who was a brilliant, funny Ironic character from the second film, was made to utter his line 'do you fear death' for no apparent reason, other than it sounds good. Lots of holes in the what was the plot; looks like they didn't have time to write a decent script and wanted to film the movie back to back with the second to cash in on the money.The ending looks they may be other films in the franchise, but if they happen, I will wait to see what the other reviewers say, before watching it.To be honest I could write a lot more, but just can't be bothered to; if you haven't seen the first two films, then perhaps you might enjoy this; if you have seen the first two, then don't expect much and then you want be too disappointed.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

In that period, Singapore is known as Temasek. It's only known as Singapore in 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles set foot on it.More Chinese from China only start coming to Singapore then. It is very well known in that period (1720s), the Bugis people (from South Sulawesi, Indonesia) were the most feared pirates in Temasek and The Straits before the British came. The island of Sentosa in Singapore was back then known as ""Pulau Blakang Mati"" (Behind the Dead Island) because of its history as a haunt and refuge for Bugis pirates.So historically speaking, there weren't any Chinese pirates in that period (1720's) in Temasek like what has been visualized in the movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Now i remembered mildly enjoying the first one at home and being underwhelmed whilst half-watching the second one at a friends house, so i wasn't exactly thrilled at the prospect of having to sit through this, but i felt it would be best to be sociable.So anyway, i sat through it and even though my eyes were drooping for the last 30 minutes (seriously) i managed to get the impression that whoever organised the production of the latest POTC had absolutely no idea what they were doing.Firstly, the general genre and feeling of the movie was completely mixed up and contradicted itself on several occasions. It portrayed itself as a fantasy/adventure laced with (poor) humour. Yet after setting this tone for a good while the last third of the movie in my opinion basically becomes some warped form of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. This all starts when Keira Knightley goes and delivers a god awful 'rousing' speech, which i strongly suspect was derived from Gibson's in Braveheart and it was done quite laughably. And i thought this just completely crippled the movie from then on, throwing the audience off the scent of any kind of finale.Secondly, the acting skills of Keira Knightley were cringe worthy, as i have said that badly written Braveheart parody made me want the ground to swallow me up. Keira was basically screeching (did anyone else notice how funny her voice sounded when she was shouting?) for two minutes, demonstrating her ineptitude to time her lines into an emotional crescendo and in the end she just went down like a lead balloon.Thirdly, the humour was unoriginal and predictable, the only thing which made me laugh was when the two pirates were looking up Keira Knightleys skirt through the crack in the floor and in reflection even that wasn't funny. Also, the Calypso segment further convoluted the plot into a mess of story lines i for one failed to grasp.Finally, i must once again go back to the similarities i felt this film shared with Braveheart, for some reason it just struck me as a complete rip off of the 1995 epic from the last battle on, almost shadowing it in the battle scene. Examples include, the final battle where when the two sides line up across the sea, the 'enemy' side vastly outnumbering the side we want to win by at least 3-1 as it does in Braveheart. Another is where the leaders of the opposing armies meet in the middle to negotiate and no resolution is found making battle inevitable.On the positive side Johnny Depp gave a relatively good performance and worked well with what he had as a script and some of the action scenes were visually impressive.All in all, a poor effort and i hope this vastly overrated film series ends now.4/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, most of its negative. Therefore, I will try to keep this short and to the point. I went into this movie with low expectations and these expectations weren't even met. I loved the first Pirates, but I was let down by the second as most were. Therefore I wasn't expecting a lot from the third installment. It was a complete drag sitting through the first 2 hours of the movie. The storyline was weak and some things could have been easily cut out to make for a shorter, somewhat more enjoyable experience. It wasn't until the last fight in which I was really into the movie. The last 45 minutes of the movie is why its is getting a 5 from me instead of a 2 or 3. I really like where the characters were taken at the end and how everything resolved. I like Keith Richards in the movie, but I was hoping of more laughs between him and Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp is what makes all of the Pirates movies interesting. He is a great Jack Sparrow in this film just like in the first two. However, a movie can't be rated on one actor so unfortunately his great acting can't save the movie. This movie could have been so much better but the writers and director dropped the ball. Here are the best things about this movie in summary: Johnny Depp, the score for the movie, and the last fight. The rest is pretty much crap, which is why this movie is getting a 5 out of 10. If you thought DMC was a disappointment, you will be even more let down by this film. It makes DMC look good.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

For sure, there was an element of fantasy in the story, but only in the sense that in the world of the film, all the old sea-farers' tales were actually true. But Hollywood loves a sequel (or three) and so we come to this monstrosity, a film characterised by preposterous metaphysics, an un-followable plot, bewildering computerised animation and unendurable length. It's a sign of the film's self-indulgence that Sparrow, its best character, doesn't even appear in the first half-hour; while every supposedly moving moment could have been cut and pasted from any other blockbuster. It seems that Hollywood must kill the things it loves; usually through an overcooking process that takes away whatever made an original film good and replaces it with pointless, generic bombast. If there's a metaphorical black flag flying over this film, it's sadly not a pirate one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And the Kraken made one appearance, dead on the beach, and the film never said what happened.Since this was the third film, most of the jokes that were very funny from the first film, fell flat.

The fans are so loyal to this franchise now that they can't bear to speak an ill word about it, even though we now have TWO sequels that absolutely suck. Most of the negative reviews have mentioned the serious problems in this one, and they are very obvious, but I will summarize:*Way too many characters and different ship crews, all with different motives. Impossible to follow or keep track of. Who is with whom? And why?*No character development. There isn't much dialogue, period, but no one really learns anything or does anything interesting. Elizabeth is the same brilliant swordsman and pirate that she was (inexplicably) in the second one, and Will is still hardly in the movie at all, and has no interesting scenes. Then there are all the new characters like the Singapore pirates and the new English officers, whom we never learn anything about. They have no character whatsoever and I didn't even know their names by the end of the movie.*Calypso... What a retarded plot device. No one cares about this character or knows anything about her. Half the time you can't even understand what she's saying, because of the accent. Then she turns into crabs and disappears; the whole thing was built up to be important, but actually it does nothing and is pointless.*Confusing elements. There is no explanation for how Barbossa came back to life. Like a lot of the bizarre stuff in this movie, it is just assumed to be the case, and it is not questioned by anyone or seen as unusual. The new British naval officers in particular, are totally emotionless and don't find it remarkable to be working with undead mutant pirates. It's just like any other day.*Not fun. Even if it doesn't have distinct humor, a movie like this should have charm and flavor like the first one did. But this is just dark all over with almost no fun moments. Sparrow is the only character who has any real life in him, and they milk that at the expense of everyone else. Even the enjoyable culture clash between Elizabeth, Will, and the pirates is totally gone now, because they are all pirates and act like they always have been, so there is no variety in character types.I didn't walk out, because I was expecting it to get better at any moment, but it never did. There were maybe 2-3 good scenes in the whole movie. The rest of it was just mindless and overblown, and often very long. I am also surprised that it squeaked by with a PG-13, as it is the most violent so far and has one particularly disgusting and graphic scene. It is so weird how this stuff is considered ""ok"" for little kids, when the same content in any other live action genre would be out of the question.Even weirder... Can kids really sit through this?? At my showing, even the adults were restless and clearly not entertained by this long and confusing saga. I would think anyone under 10 would be crying or begging to leave, purely out of boredom.At the end of it, there is a pretty distinct setup for another sequel. I will definitely be skipping any more to come.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow about the tradition of throwing hats in celebration I don't get it either, the hysteria about the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogyit's old hat by now. The computer graphics have always been eye-catching, the makeup charmingly realistic, and the actors about as good as you get in film. I just tire of Johnny Depp imitating Johnny Depp playing Captain Jack Sparrow, a gender bending hero for our summers.In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, everyone, including Elizabeth (Kira Knightly) is headed for Pirate Brethren Court in Singapore, where they must prepare for a great battle with the evil British empire or become extinct, not a possibility as long as a lucrative film empire can continue steal admissions from a willing audience.Although I think of the franchise as child's fare, the opening sequence of a child being hanged with a bunch of greasy street characters singing a dirge on an elaborate gallows makes me realize this film is not easy to categorize. It can be creative, albeit macabre. But that is the opening sequence; thereafter the film stretches for freshness.That lack of definition carries for me right from Dead Man's Chest, where the only consistency is Depp's Sparrow. His erratically fey swishbuckler is old hat by now, his speech so eccentric that subtitles might not be a bad idea, exceeded only by Naomie Harris as a garbling, black-toothed oracle, who might as well be talking to the wind for all she can be understood. The cameo by Keith Richard as Jack's dissolute dad (it doesn't fall far from the tree) just isn't the kick I had hoped, and not just because he can't be understood.Kira Knightly's Elizabeth remains the only character with good teeth, and Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, her main man, is more mature and more likeably able than ever. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, still breathing through his spore and badly in need of a facial, has nothing new to add to the fun except as the jailer of Sparrow and ruler of a most chaotic kingdom under the sea.Jack Sparrow may next travel to the fountain of youth, where I hope he'll pick up some aqua vitae for the franchise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","A Satisfactory Conclusion, If Not A Memorable One.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3278682/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","17 July 2015","The third & final instalment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy is a bloated & convoluted mess that unnecessarily adds more complexity to the plot by introducing too many characters instead of bringing its pirate mythology to a satisfactory conclusion, lacks the very sense of fun that made its predecessors click so well and is the weakest film of the three.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End continues the events that unfolded in Dead Man's Chest and follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann & the crew of the Black Pearl as they team up with the resurrected Captain Barbossa on a quest to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker and then join the other pirate lords to make a final alliance against their common enemy, the East India Trading Company.Directed by Gore Verbinski, there is no denying that At World's End is visually striking but the issues that surfaced in the previous chapter only get worse here for the story features too many new subplots for what was intended to be the series' finale, takes way too much time to get things moving, and also happens to be tediously paced for the most part which makes its 169 minutes of runtime a challenge to sit through.On the technical scale, the film fares much better for the set pieces are grand, impressive & finely detailed. Cinematography is very much in tune with the previous instalments and the camera makes fab use of its angles, movements & colour tones. Editing however is a major step down for the length of its narrative isn't justified at all plus there are many sequences it could've managed without plus a better pace would've definitely benefited the experience.Visual effects continue to make its mark and its use is much more extensive in this chapter, especially in the action-packed moments and of course, the grand finale. And last but not the least is the background score by Hans Zimmer which presents the legendary composer at the top of his game for the soundtrack carries the same epic feel of its predecessor with a melancholic tone seamlessly blended into the narrative and it amplifies the experience by a great deal.Coming to the performances, At World's End brings back the cast of the first two films for one last venture and has a new addition in Chow Yun-fat who plays one of the pirate lords. Johnny Depp's rendition of Captain Jack Sparrow is a mixed bag for there are glimpses of the usual wit & charisma that made him such a beloved character in the first place but his eccentricity is stretched to a point where it almost stopped working and those hallucination scenes are simply unacceptable.The contribution by its supporting cast is all over the place though. Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley do a fine job in their respective roles of Will & Elizabeth, Bill Nighy as Davy Jones has his moments, Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett takes over the role of prime antagonist of the series, Naomi Harris' character gets a major expansion in this chapter yet the finest work comes from Geoffrey Rush whose Captain Barbossa is the only character who shows no loss in form and is absolutely thrilling to watch.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End joins the long list of second sequels that failed to capture the magic of its predecessors and while not as rewarding as expected, it still ends the trilogy on a satisfactory level thanks to its final hour that redeems much of what was wrong with the picture with an effects-laden & action-packed finale even if it seems quite over-the-top. Enjoyable in bits n pieces, entertaining in the second half but also marred by useless twists, At World's End nonetheless packs in a few thrills & spectacle to bow out on a slightly fulfilling note, if not a memorable one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Takes a little bit until the epic conclusion","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4044591/?ref_=tt_urv","philipposx-12290","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur74588514/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2018","Back in 2003 The Curse of The Black Pearl was one of the best movies ever made, just brilliant and captivating Pirate Action (10/10) and the follow-up three yeas later still was a blast but suffered from having no real ending (8/10) and 2007's third movie gave that ending.
I would say that it is the ""worst"" in the series, although it is still good. The major complaint are the complete boring minutes in the first and second act. Sadly, nothing happens until Captain Jack is back from the World's End.
Here is the problem that the series just couldn't avoid. PotC is a franchise that lives because Johnny Depp brings such light and charisma into Jack Sparrow.
That does not mean that the other actors like Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Bush aren't great, because in fact, they are, but the movie just drags when there's no Sparrow.
When we then kick into second gear, about on the 100 minute mark, it is Pirates of the Caribbean at it's finest. Epic battles, a wonderful score, strong performances and iconic one-liners. 
The ending sequences are gripping and mesmerizing, just as the consequence. 
Had it not been for the boring first minutes, PoTC III would just be on the level of the previous ones: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But: is it any good? In truth, it has all the strengths - wonderful entertainment, stunning visuals, clever effects, constant action, visual and verbal jokes, and above all Johnny Depp - and all the weaknesses - a confused narrative, poor dialogue, some wooden acting - of the earlier two sailings in the franchise, but with a few extra little nuggets and problems.On the plus side, we get to see some multiple versions of Jack Sparrow in a series of surreal sequences, there's a cameo appearance from Jack's dad, and the final exciting battle sequence in a swirling vortex has everything from mayhem to matrimony. On the other hand, there is no synopsis of what has gone before, there are many more pirate leaders than before, there are more double-crosses and betrayals than one can mentally accommodate, and the whole thing is so incredibly long (168 minutes) that in my local cinema they introduced an intermission at an utterly random point. If after this interminable voyage, one sits through an endless stream of credits, there is an extra little clip that takes us 10 years on - leading the way to yet another sequel?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The second Pirates of the Caribbean movie was entertaining and fun, and yet this one drags on and on. The storyline is very confusing and is often incoherent. One minute they are in an ocean of ice and another minute they are in the desert. It is not helped by the flood of minor characters present, and most of them are dispensible and appear for a few minutes just to take up screen time. Calypso's accent is ever so hard to understand, and I barely understood a thing she said. The jokes are not funny, and there is hardly anything entertaining with the film. The constant fighting, which is supposed to be exciting, gets tiring after 2 hours. I feel very bored with the film. I regret watching it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I believe the second chapter was a bit disappointing... and it was too long. I guess the story was not very well presented and this contributed to ridicule Jack's character more than was necessary. I also think that Orlando Bloom is overrated as an actor... I don't really like him. On the contrary Keira Knightley is fantastic, she will have a great future in this job. The nice thing of the third movie is that there is actually every member of the cast!! This movie is definitely better than the second one and the meeting of the pirates is absolutely awesome! I heard there was a scene after the closing credits but I knew it the day after I had gone to the cinema!! even in the second movie there was a final scene after the credits, it was funny but not really important. Anyway this was just the opinion of an Italian fan I hope you enjoy he movie!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Still its reasonably entertaining. Johnny Depp is absent in the first hour as the film focuses on Geoffery Rush, Knightley and Bloom. Rush is excellent as usual but the young leads are average. The opening fight sequence in the far east is disappointing. WIth Depp's entry however, the film regains its sense of fun. There's some demented humor and some striking photography as Depp is shown all alone 'at World's End'. There are double crosses galore, and things get confusing in the mid-section. Thank heavens for a rousing sea battle which occupies much of the final hour, as Sparrow and Davy Jones (a fine Bill Nighy) go head to head. The Special Effects are excellent as usual.Overall 7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
