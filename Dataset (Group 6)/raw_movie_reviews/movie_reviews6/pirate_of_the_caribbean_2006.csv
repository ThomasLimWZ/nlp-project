On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you.","86 out of 116 found this helpful.

The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.If you like the first movie, you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.Jack Sparrow: ""Why is the rum *always* gone?"" (he stands up and staggers) ""Oh... That's why.""","86 out of 117 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Shamelessly entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1416001/?ref_=tt_urv","bmelanie","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4768390/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2006","Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.","111 out of 155 found this helpful.

Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.This was the best ""Pirates"" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.The newest main character is the multi-tentacled ""Davy Jones,"" and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before ""Davy"" was ready for action. (Actually, the same good be said for Johnny Depp's ""Capt. Jack Farrow, who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker.) Anyway, between the battles of both land and sea, something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie, making it a fun ride all the way.","58 out of 78 found this helpful.

But it is solid entertainment, with a good plot, and consistently good acting, as well as the whole production looking stunning. Johnny Depp is as lovable as always as Jack, and Kiera Knightly is as lovely as ever. Orlando Bloom, while less charismatic than he was in the first movie, is still charming. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport also delight, as does Stellan Skargaard as Bootstrap Bill. But an unrecognisable Bill Nighy almost steals the show as the rather creepy Davy Jones. The special effects and the stunts were very impressive especially with the very scary krakon, so was the outstanding music score and although the script lacks the sparkle of the predecessor, this is a resoundingly entertaining film nonetheless. Oh, and be prepared for a surprise at the end. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","31 out of 40 found this helpful.

The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist. Overall, I believed the second Pirates of Carribbean was a rather good film, and very successful in standards of sequels. I can't wait for the third.","520 out of 808 found this helpful.

fun!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1410130/?ref_=tt_urv","HiddenVoice","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4125122/?ref_=tt_urv","4 July 2006","Man,these Summer Blockbusters keep getting better and better.One after another,each better than the previous ones.I'm sorry Superman,but those bloody pirates are just so damn good that ,you've got to fall in love with them.Pirates of Caribbean is the film that shows what Summer Blockbuster is all about.They don't make movies like these you know.It was endlessly entertaining,more entertaining and fun than anything all year.Not even the Man of Steel could pull this off.With all the cast returning and more,this is a joy ride that you have to pay twice to fully experience it and feel it.I was astounded and rocked.This film was awesome.The film begins with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner being arrested just before they were about to get married.They are accused of letting Jack Sparow escape.So in return Will must find Sparrow to help himself.While Elizabeth tries to escape, follows Will.Settling down with his ship and crew, Jack Sparrow is pretty much hidding something himself.But things of course can't be well for a damned Pirate,when a squid like pirate Davvy Jones reminds Jack that he has an old debt to pay.So,of course ,the dishonestly honest Jack must seek help from Elizabeth and Will Turner and there we go again.Another wild ride that will simply leaves you completely satisfied.One hour to this film and I found myself completely clueless.All that was taking place on screen made no sense.With all its silliness and half baked jokes really left me terribly unsatisfied and disappointed.It filled me with doubt that the rest of the film is pretty much gonna be like this.But then by the start of the second hour,the film picks up like a person can spot a pirates lie.Then it enters back to territory that made the first film so endlessly enjoyable.The smartness and clever side of the script emerged and thrills,surprises and incredible effects with huge excitement totally made me change my mind.And an ending that will leave you dying to see the third part.All that pretty much assured me that ,this sequel is exactly what I had expected.There's everything here for everyone.The thing that Superman Slightly lacked.Colorful ,fun Characters,smart dialogues,great epic-sized action.And of course,some really ,really awe-inspiring CGI effects.There are twists and surprising turns,especially towards the end ,where the fun gets even better ,scene after scene.Something great is always popping up.Though less superior than its already splendid first installment,we all loved the first one.And it concludes with a cliffhanger to leave you thirsty for the third.It's the kind of cliffhanger that Reloaded gave us,but its final installment didn't live up to expectations.But I can say this much that ,this films finale,or final installment will rock the world.The Production designs,the sets were unbelievable!They were breath taking.They were so elaborate and detailed that they meet the standards of LORD OF THE RINGS films.It gives the film an other-worldly look.As if the characters were in some kind of a fantasy world.Thank someone,that we have a versatile actor like Johnny Depp.The only actor who I would thank.Having his presence throughout the film was like having a magician constantly pulling out tricks that are all satisfying.Depp,is the first and best reason to watch this film,just like the first one.Knightley is a surprise here.The first one didn't develop her character much,but here she elevates and pushes the boundaries.She really has a lot to do here.Bloom was just like he was in the first one.But his character discovers something that will leave the audience surprised.That is his father.What a surprise it was to finally see the legendary Bootstrap Bill,and Sarsgard was perfection.And then there is the always fabulous Billy Nighy.Where the first one had Geoffrey Rush,here we have Nighy to give you a great baddie.Who never had disappointed me with his performance.So goes for the rest of the cast with a few new additions,such as Naomi Harris.Kudos,to Director Gore Verbinski,and Producer Bruckheimer and Ted Elliot& Terry Rosio for their smart,witty writing.They all give you the very definition of ""sequels better than the original"".They give you a grand spectacle.They really give you everything you deserve to get from a summer Blockbuster.It's a film that we deserve after numerous Blockbusters that didn't fully satisfied us.This film boosts a better score than the first one too.This one is purely fantasy.The Squid looking Pirates are hardly believable,I mean did they ever existed in really world?Whereas the first one had a more believable Bad Pirates.In this film,the Pirates are more Fantasy-like.And somehow detaches itself from reality.It doesn't occur to you that this might've happened.I mean Pirates that look like squids can hardly be bought.It features a lot more weird creatures,that are actually pirates and more.Giant sea monsters and creatures that are very well created with CGI.And that's one of the few big flaws this film has.It doesn't make itself realistic,nor does it take itself too seriously.When there's something dramatic and serious is suppose to happen.And yes,it's a lot more darker than the first one. Way dark.Don't bring those kids of yours,or they'll hate pirates and their misadventures.Yet,this is a splendid entertainer.It's funny,exciting,fast-paced even with 2 hours plus length.It's simply great.This film features more than you could ask for.Those 2 and a half hours in the dark will keep you thrilled throughout.This year's greatest entertainment is here and will knock you flat.I've seen many Blockbusters, from V for Vendetta,to MI3,Da Vinci to X3 to Superman returns.But none could achieve the satisfaction as this Pirates sequel did.So,it's not all that risky to trust the bloody Pirates after all.","55 out of 112 found this helpful.

There's a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.My only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain 'heart' that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn't contend with.That aside, you will hardly notice it.

My gripe really centres around the unnecessarily complicated plot and the overall length of the film. Unlike the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings trilogy there is nothing in the screenplay to really justify the bum-numbing 150 minutes spent watching this film, particularly as the plot takes so long to get going. The major set pieces involving the island cannibals and the key to Davy Jones' locker are good but seriously in need of editing, and although the CGI effects are impressive, there really is only so many times you can marvel at the 'beastie' before its time to stifle the yawns. Anyone who saw King Kong and experienced midway restlessness will probably recognise similar symptoms here too. That said, the performances by the lead actors are excellent and although the script doesn't seem to provide the same number of laughs found in the first film, this is generally not a poor sequel. Expectation gained from the first film is likely to be an issue when assessing the merits of the sequel and most fans of JD will not be too disappointed, I just hope this 'trilogy' does a 'Back to the Future' and ends with a pacey flourish, rather than a further need for pressure-relieving cushions.","39 out of 77 found this helpful.

"9","/10","More than equals its predecessor.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1411893/?ref_=tt_urv","I_Like_Turtle_s","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5284108/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2006","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.9/10","382 out of 633 found this helpful.

There are definitely some strong scenes in it and I'm a big fan of the nonchalant, humorous way that Johnny Depp played the role of Jack Sparrow, but the story was just too much. If the makers had just simplified the movie a bit, maybe even cut it down to +/- 100 minutes, the movie would be more pleasant. And by the way, I wasn't really convinced about that whole sea-creature thing. To summarize, unless you're a huge Johnny Depp fan (like I am), this movie isn't more than a way of filling up your free time.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

Dead Man's Chest gives us all the characters we loved in the first movie, but puts them in a refreshingly original movie. The action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. And there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this movie than in most comedies. I felt entertained from the beginning right through to the special scene after the closing credits. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I and my entire family will be going to see it again today.For parents with young children: This movie is more violent than the first movie. There is a lot of killing, though none of it is shown close up or in a grisly manner. Davey Jones and his gang are very gross. In the screening I attended, there were a lot of ""Ewwww!""s from the audience.

The story-line is cut into small story-lines which gets very confusing to keep focus on after a while, then the movie becomes silly with too cheap jokes, you laugh so quiet that you don't even think of if you're having fun or not.I will watch the third one, why will I? Because they have succeeded in franchise a beloved silly adventure without any certain ending, and the effects and the environment is actually quite fantastic to rest your eyes on. Well it's a bag of chips really, you get tired of it the more you eat it, and after all you realise it wasn't giving you anything really.

They are a lot of fun. However, I thought the second film was rushed and over-used many of the special effects. I do not want to give anything away but you will see what I mean while viewing the film. The cast was pitch perfect. Depp just keeps getting better and better. The length of the film was a major issue. I thought it was a bit too long and the word of mouth on the length will not work for the better for this film. I think I had high expectations for this film because the first one blew me away. Not because it was a good movie but because it was unlike anything I have ever seen. I was hoping to be blown away by this one but I just felt some parts were too dull and when the scenes were exciting they did not last long. A 6 is pushing it. I thought it could have been so much better if the production was not rushed. I can see it had to make a deadline but something this huge should be filmed carefully and to perfection. I think Disney really wanted to make this movie a ""filler"" to fill in the gap between (hopefully) the two stronger movies. The one thing I can say I loved about the film was the end, it was very satisfying and leaves me wanting more of the Pirate world.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

However, something motivated me to give it another chance and surprisingly I enjoyed it. It is quite well executed. The action sequences and stunts are brilliantly choreographed. My favourite one was the three-way sword fight that continued through a spinning wheel. I liked that the director used minimal CGI for these scenes. The cinematography is stunning and the exotic landscape is breathtaking.The actors do a fairly good job of reprising their role. It's great to see Johnny Depp again as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is quite alright but his chemistry with Keira Knightley appears to be weaker than in the first movie. Knightley does an okay job too. Jack Davenport is a surprise to watch in a different gettup. Bill Nighy is great as the squid-faced villain and Naomie Harris is convincing as the witch with the Jamaican accent. The rest of the cast are adequate.The dialogues are funny and witty and the comedy works but at times, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' felt more like a repetition than a continuation of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The CGI, particularly on Davy Jones and his crew looked poor when compared to that used in Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' (the kind which would have excellently worked for this movie). The ending is unintentionally funny and seems very rushed. Not to mention, it's continuous (a cliffhanger ending) so the third one better be good.For me, what stood out more about this movie than the first one were the amazing outdoorsy locations and the action scenes. It's quite a good sequel and very entertaining. Hopefully, the third one properly rounds up the trilogy and not end up like the disastrous 'X-Men'.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Capn' Jack returns for another adventure, and this time the scale is ginormous! If you thought Pirates 1 was action packed, and spectacular, this film goes far beyond with massive sets, brilliant effects, and a massive 2 and a half hour running time, that will have you leaving the theatre feeling like you've spent a year in the harshest prison, wearing a ballerina's outfit, with a bull's-eye painted on your rear. Now the scale is huge, and there's all the lavish extravagance that Bruckheimer loves to give his punters, but the story lacks some cohesion, and it's all a bit too much, without much in the way of character depth. That could be an unfair nitpicking for a film entitled Pirates of the Caribbean sure, but the film is little more than a rollicking and fun night out at the cinema. It's not going to adorn top 100 lists of film buffs around the world that's for sure.However this is the second in a series of films that should be predominantly about fun, spectacle, and pure entertainment. In this regard Pirates 2 more than delivers, while maybe lacking the ingenuity and surprise factor of the first movie which, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, took the public by storm. Depp once again is superb, despite giving one of his least interesting performances, as of course this is the first time ever, he's reprised a role, and Depp of course is renowned for doing startlingly different roles from one film to the next. It actually seems incredibly strange to see Depp treading old ground, still his creation of Jack Sparrow is superb. Orlando Bloom again is in the film for little more than to play the straight man to Depp, and to look good for the ladies. It's not a great role for Bloom, who as yet hasn't proved just whether he's going to be a top actor or not, or merely a pretty boy. To some extent the same is true of Keira Knightly, who come mud, sweat, grime, or rain, or dragged up as a boy, looks phenomenal. However while this role offers little for Keira she has already proved she's going to be a great actress (one Oscar nod to her name already!). On one regard though Bloom and Knightley at least have more to do in this film, and Depp is allowed to step back every now and again. This isn't merely the Depp show, which is arguably to the films detriment. The rest of the cast are good, but it's Bill Nighy who steals the show managing to convey an amazingly expressive performance from behind his squiddy CGI mask.All in all Pirates 2 delivers all you could want in a fantasy adventure. The story gets muddle in amongst all the swordfights and giant sea creatures, but still for pure fun at the movies, you can't go far with this. I most certainly look forward to Pirates 3. ***1/2","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Once you've seen a couple of stupid sea-men you don't need to keep seeing them over and over. The physical adventures of the characters, the sword-fights, etc would have been exciting enough without the stupid creatures added on. And the blatant set-up for a sequel is a box-office cheat.

He holds the spotlight most of the time even though he is up against some of the most fantastic looking creatures a make-up man ever devised. Hideous as they are, it's hard to look away when they come on the screen. The cinematography is stunning, but the fast clip of scenes is overdone and gets wearying after awhile.ORLANDO BLOOM and KEIRA KNIGHTLEY do nicely as hero and heroine, the sort of pair that harks back to the days of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Miss Knightley has a beautiful face but not quite the warmth of personality this sort of heroine should have. Orlando Bloom looks good with a sword but needs more work with his acting abilities.The busy, overly orchestrated score by Hans Zimmer pounds away at the music in what must be the most overwritten score of the year. Dialog manages to be clear enough except for Naomi Harris who mumbles some inexplicable heavily accented words as the exotic Tia Dalma that should have required sub-titles for all their blurriness.Most fun are the chase scenes wherein Bloom and others are locked inside some sort of a rolling wheel-barrel--but all of the special effects are handsomely staged for maximum effect. And surely, an army of stuntmen must have been kept busy on the sound stages for all of the action scenes.Depp's character is given some questionable things to do. His moral compass is not quite what it ought to be, even if he is the anti-hero of this swashbuckling epic. And much of the action scenes could have been trimmed to bring the story in at a length less than two-and-a-half hours. Perhaps with some of the action trimmed, there would have been time for more emphasis on exposition, especially for those who never saw the first film.Aside from these minor reservations, it's highly enjoyable entertainment for those wanting to escape the summer heat and looking for more than two hours of pirate fantasy with stunning special effects and photography.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

"","","Noisy and quite fun but not as good as I had hoped for thanks to a darker approach that doesn't have the material to really sustain it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1438950/?ref_=tt_urv","bob the moo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035/?ref_=tt_urv","4 August 2006","On their wedding day, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan find themselves arrested for helping Jack Sparrow to break out of jail. Facing the death penalty themselves, Will accepts a deal from the East Indian Trading Company to win their freedom by getting an enchanted compass from Sparrow. As Will sets off to track down his acquaintance, Sparrow has his own problems. The deal he made with Davy Jones all those years ago is due and Jones himself is coming to settle the debt. Meanwhile Elizabeth's father arranges for her escape and she sets out to find Jack and Will.Having enjoyed the first film and applauded the Oscar nomination for Depp, I was looking forward to more of the same and went to see this film on the fist weekend. I was slightly on edge because of having of having to share a cinema with a group of chavs determined not to let anyone forget they were at the back, but settled into it. The opening of the film is rather heavy as it sets up the plot and it does rather lack the fun that the first film had  which is sadly how much of it turns out to be. It doesn't really help that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense at times and that the film is too long but generally the main problem is that at times it forgets that first and foremost it is supposed to be entertaining. Others have wittily ripped of The Guardian newspaper by describing this as The Empire Strikes Jack, which is fine because it does have a good try at being dark and interesting, but it is at the expense of the fun.It does have moments throughout the film that are funny and entertaining but it puts too much emphasis on the plot (which isn't that great) and the darker tone. The latter is a problem then because the first film never took itself that seriously so it is a bit jarring as an audience member to be expected to suddenly buy into this film as the second part in a dark, sea-faring trilogy. The direction is still good and visually the film is very impressive; the sets, costumes and make-up are very convincing and the special effects look like every penny was spent (but they also merge well into the film and don't stand out for their own sake). Depp is as good as he was in the first film but here is sidelined by the many other characters and threads. It is a real shame and a big reason why it feels less fun than before  he has less to do and less to work with. Bloom is rather wooden and history may well remember him (assuming it does) as someone who lucked their way into two massive trilogies of the time before fading away. This may be a bit cruel but his performance isn't anything special and he is totally in Depp's shadow. Knightley is a bit better because she is feisty and fun. Nighy is a great addition  not only for his character but also for his performance, which is fun and slightly menacing; god only knows what the film would have been like without him because he does steal many of the scenes. Support from Skarsgård, Crook, McNally, Pryce, Davenport and others is mostly good but really the film could have done with a few characters and threads being scaled back to make for a brisker and pacier film. Harris was a surprise find and I was impressed she still managed to be sexual while under very ugly makeup.Overall then this is an OK summer film but those that loved the irreverent sense of fun of the original will probably feel a bit let down. It is still a solid film and the dark edge makes for a more rounded film  albeit not one that I actually wanted but still a good one. Visually it is amazing and I was never really bored at any point but I would have liked it have been a bit more fun than it was and also for the darker stuff to have had a bit more substance.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The characters we thought we knew from the first film, are lost in hard-to-follow plot lines. Like Jack's compass, they don't know what they really want. To add to confusion, there are several passages of dialogue that were impossible for the audience to understand. Captain Jack is still the man to watch, there is wonderful acting delivered by Johnny Depp. He, along with Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, are the saving grace of the film. But even Captain Jack seems distracted enough to throw his compass out of whack. Poor editing puts characters in one place after another with no clear explanation why. An example, for what purpose did Jack and his crew sail to Cannibal Island? I'm still perplexed as to how the characters wound up in the final scene. It is unfortunate that the special effects overpower character development in ""Dead Man's Chest"". While Davy Jone's octopus face is amazing to behold, the Kraken's tentacles are overdone. If more attention had been paid to the story line, these effects might have enhanced this film. As it is, it is a movie without a heart in more ways than one.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

The main question I wanted answered was, ""Would this movie live up to the legend that was The Curse of the Black Pearl?""I am pleased to tell you that not only does this movie live up to the BP, it exceeds it. DMC is amazing!! The acting is exquisite, the special effects are astonishing, the music is inspiring, the jokes are endless, the storyline is flawless and the ending leaves you satisfied though still wanting more and wishing that we were just a little bit closer to May, 2007.The characters in this film are just as amazing and intricate as the first. There are the main characters, each with their goals, priorities and little quirks to go along with it.The costumes and sets are amazing. Each character has an individual quality and looks authentic for their person. The islands of the Caribbean act as a playground for each scene, complimenting the storyline and actors.I heard a bad review of this movie before it's premiere date and I thought I may be in for a disappointment. How wrong I was.Go and see this movie as soon as you can. It will push fans of the first film to further heights and will make fans of those who haven't seen the first (though I cannot imagine why they haven't). Gore Verbinski has yet again gone above and beyond and Jerry Bruckheimer has delivered another great film.

I laughed throughout and enjoyed the action. It's not a bad film. But the plot was thin and the character development was lacking. If the jokes and action were trimmed a bit here and there, greater weight in the plot and character development could have easily been achieved. Unfortunately the film is yet another example of executives saying, ""Well they bought the premise the first time so now let's just give them more action and laughs."" Who doesn't like action and laughs? But if that's all you have the story gets old after a while and the characters never grow. Why is Terminator 2 a better film then the first? Because the plot was dynamic and the characters throughly changed within the story. Sure there was great action scenes, but the reason people keep watching the movie is because the character relations are so strong. Why was Terminator 3 not as good as 2? Because it was pumped up with action and jokes and lacked in character development. The first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a great film, because the plot was solid and the character's were genuinely understood. And I'm not saying the plot of the sequel isn't interesting, it's simply under developed. I wanted more back story on Davy Jones and his ship, and stronger relations between Will & his father, Jack & Elizabeth. One might say ""That will come in the third installment."" And I say it better, because if all it is, is just more jokes and action then I won't see it.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, I own it, love it, and have watched it many times. Our of all the movies I have seen this summer (Superman, Cars, Da Vinci Code, X3, & Click), I have found Pirates to keep me the most entertained. I would say it is comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Depp has Sparrow nailed to a perfect part. While Bloom is not as good, the part he plays in the film is very important. Everyone does a very good job at their part, especially Mr. Gibbs (who seems to be the pirate narrator for those of us who do not know about things such as the Kracken). I would say that if you go to see one movie at all this summer, you should see Pirates:Dead Man's Chest. The CGI is incredible. Davy Jones is the best bad guy since Vader. Depp is a perfect Han Solo match and Knightly has the sass of Leia. I think that anyone who does not feel impressed with this film did not understand what they were going to see; a sequel to a fun, summer, popcorn movie with scary effects, interesting twists, and many surprises. Time your bathroom breaks, or don't have them at all. The first part of the film is the only place I would ever go back to the restroom. Sit down, have fun, and enjoy the movie. Pirates:DMC is the only movie I would go back to see again at the theatres so far this year.","235 out of 459 found this helpful.

Sure, the actors are great, and they're all the original ones. But they might as well have not been. This sequel doesn't even compare to the first. Imagine seeing a commercial for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The TV Series!"" and mix up all the episodes and Dead Man's chest is what you've got. A very shrimpy plot line that doesn't stand out among all the other garbage that happens. For those of you who had seen it-- I'm not even talking about the thing about which you probably think I'm angry. That was one of the high points, among two other high action sequences. But it really feels like a bunch of fans sat around together and said ""Wouldn't be funny if .... wouldn't it be dramatic if ..."", got the money to make a movie and they did.Leave it to the fanfiction writers to write sequels to carry on the stories by adding stupid dramatic plot twists that didn't even exist in the first one.

I don't have the - Oh My God, I have to see that again - feeling that some films give me.In general I enjoyed it but I just feel that everything was taken to the point where it was working and then pushed to see if it could get any better. In doing this it actually made It slightly worse. Cpt Jack for example - In the first movie you really wanted him to win. Every time he was on screen I felt myself moving towards the edge of my seat, wanting to see what he would do next. This time he juggles with the old good Vs bad, light Vs dark storyline and makes decisions that I feel he as a character would never make. I felt let down by him. Also his little quips that made him so lovable in the original began to get on my nerves ever so slightly.As I said the Actors did a great job, Bloom and Keira as usual are very watchable. However they gave me no reason to think they even liked each other let alone are ready to wed! ...All in all the movie is watchable and I will go and see the next one just to see what happens.

Next, you must keep in mind that it is intended to go hand in hand with POTC 3. Finally, you should truly like the movie. If you simply thought the first one was OK or technically OK but the plot stunk or whatever, you will likely not appreciate this movie because you have no real attachment to it.

If you want to read them, it always pays to start from that seed.Disney has been very smart about those seeds in the past, and they may be entering a new age of power in this regard, now that at least one of their research ideas has born fruit.The seed in this case comes from the business reality that Disney has a special way to leverage movie franchises through their themeparks. The question is: what cinematic effects can you put into a movie that will stick in the popular imagination AND be exploitable in a completely different domain, the one of physically built rides, what they call ""attractions."" There are colorful characters of course. But what else? Worlds, but how to define worlds. What works? Viewers might not be aware of the rather exotic science that comes into play, in addition to following trusted artists with intuition.""Treasure Planet"" was an experiment in how to place a camera so that the environment was the star, more precisely the built environment, the ship and planet. And in that case, the edges. The world is made of edges  in our eye and mind. It wasn't a particularly effective movie, either as entertainment or architectural experiment.But there were lessons learned from it. Most of what we know in film and architecture goes back to Orson Welles, in particular his ""Othello."" The first one in this franchise was very serious about this, a heavy investment. Sure, they wanted to sell theater tickets. But more than that they wanted to built monetizable intellectual property, duly injected into the culture.With that as preface, look at how the camera relates to the built spaces here. Its extraordinary, extreme. Every shot starts with the inclusion of an edge, which is then registered with an object: a ship usually, but any space. The reason is because they will later be selling entry into that space.See how every composition is thus influenced. You can see it immediately from the opening: rain on lips of teacups... what a device! Then scanning  not panning  to tell you that what you will get is place defined first. The situation is always placed.Later, the big effect is a huge wheel. You can just see the brainstorm: we need something that is spatial, that moves, that moves differently than anything else in life or the movie. We have to be inside it and outside. We have to as characters be manipulated by it, its dynamics not influenced by humans.Then see how that is set up earlier by the similar device, men in suspended globes (of bones!).Its a remarkable advance in the cinematic lexicon. Celebrate.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought the action sequences to be somewhat excessive. For this movie to be stretched out to two and a half hours is ridiculous. When I saw it at the drive-in, I was so thankful for the intermission, just to get a break. I don't understand how the studio expected kids, let alone, anyone to sit through this entire film, knowing that the attention span of today's audience is nothing compared to what it used to be. I'm wondering how long the third one is going to be. The movie itself as a sequel was not too shabby but it didn't meet the high hopes I actually had.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I know that some reviewers have said that it's too long at 2 hrs and 30 min. I say how can you never have too much action. All the characters are explored a little deeper as well as some questions being answered. The Location in the Grenadines was spectacular as were the special effects! Although different from the Pearl the effects were just as exceptional! You do need to pay attention to the dialog very close in some parts because it is difficult to make out. There were as many twist , turns and surprises as there were course changes in the ships directions. Speaking of the ships, the Flying Dutchman looked pretty menacing. The Pearl was as sleek as ever and appeared to have changed just slightly from the first movie. Wehter you root for the Pirates or root for the ""other guys"" you will have a great adventure. Wherever your travels take you this summer make sure you go on this adventure with Jack Sparrow uh..oh..um... CAPTAIN, Captain Jack Sparrow, Will, Elizabeth and the rest of the swash buckling crew.

I loved the first one and this didn't quite live up to its high standards, as with most sequels. I found that it dragged on too much and the ending was also a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to leave people in suspense and looking forward to the third one but i think they could have done it differently. The ending left me feeling disappointed and incomplete. However, apart from these small things I thought it was still pretty good. It had the same good humor that fans one the first one loved and of course everyone's favorite character, Captain Jack sparrow remained his hilariously charming self. I'm not a great fan of Will though as I find him too heroic and trusting. No one is perfect. I also thought the bringing back of some of the previous characters from the first movie was a bit unnecessary as they sometimes seem out of place and to be grasping a bit to have it similar to the first.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , adding lots of state-of-art computer generator special effects. The motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle including savage natives , cannibals , ravines tumble down, fantastic pirates , tentacles flail and ships sinking and splitting . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy providing the necessary hilarious touches . Along with habitual roles : Kiera Knightley, Orlando Bloom , they're well accompanied by a good support cast , such as : Jack Davenport , Bill Nighy , Jonathan Pryce, Kevin McNally , Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Stellan Skarsgård, Tom Hollander , Naomie Harris , Derrick O'Connor , Martin Klebba , David Schofield and Geoffrey Rush.It displays colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer .

They usually put in a hell of a lot of money, they may throw in some very good-looking actors, probably some expensive things like muscle cars (The Fast and The Furious), some really good looking girls, explosions, bad one-liners, POP CULTURE REFERENCES AND MAYBE EVEN SOME POINTLESS CAMEO APPEARANCES, bad dialog and a really uninteresting or boring plot... if not no plot at all. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is not one of those films... IT'S A MASTERPIECE!!! I was a huge fan or the original and own it on DVD. I have watched it many times over. The performance of Johnny Depp earned him an Acadmedy Award nomination and knowing this man I can honestly say right now that he without a doubt the greatest American actor of all time! I mean... sometimes you can hardly tell that its Johnny Depp because he gets to into this character of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are good in their roles but of course they are overshadowed by Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. Davy Jones is a complex, dark and very original kind of movie villain and one of the best I have seen in a long time. The plot is very original, the action sequences done extremely well and the loads of money put into such a production hasn't gone to waste... every cent has been put into good use. This is ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"" or the modern age... and I am without a doubt not the very first person to say such a thing!","19 out of 31 found this helpful.

The elements of a rollicking yarn are there but too many scenes overstay their welcome. The film could have been cut by at least half an hour and it wouldn't have lost a thing.

Orlando Bloom didn't seem to really get into his part, which seemed diminished, as if the writer(s) really didn't know what to do with him. The ending made us eager for the next installment, and we hope that they have a better plot line and script. The special effects were excellent; the replacement villain and his crew are far more frightening than Barbosa and company. I wouldn't recommend that children under 10 be brought to this movie, as it is very intense in parts, and the creatures are extremely gross.

I enjoyed the first movie, but I wasn't what you would call a fan. My wife dragged me along to this one and I relented mostly because of the poor reviews for Superman, which I would have rather seen.Pirates II wasn't funny and it was totally self-indulgent. The editor is a genius, basically because he figured out how to get paid without actually doing any work. Almost every scene without fail had five to ten seconds of crap on each end of the action. The run time was way too long (which could have been remedied with cuts in appropriate places). For an action movie, it doesn't say much that I got bored on two separate occasions, finding myself searching for the remote.The first movie was redeemed by a fantastic script and solid wit. The sequel had neither. I saw an interview with Johnny Depp in which he claimed to be willing to do ""eight of these movies if the scripts remain as good as the second one."" LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. I love Depp, but he will forever be a sell-out in my book if he continues to insist that this is a well made movie. I'm totally OK with actors making crap for the money so long as they acknowledge that they did it for the money.The only thing that could have possibly redeemed this movie would have been extended gratuitous shots of Keira Knightly just standing around or doing basically anything. For a movie that didn't know when to edit a scene, there were surprisingly few of these shots. It also didn't help that at some point near the end of the film, she gained an ugly, obviously fake tan out of nowhere.All in all this movie was bad, but it wasn't so poorly made as to become entertaining in its badity. This is the worse kind of film to watch. That being said, I'm definitely looking forward to the third one; at this rate it will be exceedingly awful and possibly awful enough to be entertainingly bad.","78 out of 149 found this helpful.

You will be glued to the screen from beginning to end, not wanting to miss a single minute of the action. The plot is original and entertaining and really takes ""Pirates"" to the next level. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly are brilliant once again as Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. There are also several familiar faces that will entertain and surprise fans. Will Turner fans will definitely not be disappointed with ""Dead Man's Chest."" This second outing allows Will to show his magnificent and exceptional leadership abilities and once again his undaunted bravery and love for Elizabeth. The music to accompany the action is fantastic. Hans Zimmer does a magnificent job capturing the power of the movie. The soundtrack is driven and epic in nature to support the grandness of the movie. Fans of ""Pirates"" will be humming the music in their heads for days. Now that ""Dead Man's Chest"" has finally sailed into theaters -- taking the box office by storm -- the countdown is on for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" (tentative title?) due out in May 2007. Have a swashbuckling good time with ""Dead Man's Chest""!","27 out of 47 found this helpful.

So instead of just doing two movies, someone, other then the original writers, stretched out the first part of the script at the last minute. I don't know if this is true, but that is certainly what the movie felt like. The first half-hour or forty-five minutes is rife with jokes from the last movie, or jokes playing on the jokes from the last movie, and they are sadly uninspired. This movie also features more, and more drawn out, fight scenes, that seem to do little more then eat up time. After a bunch of ill-thought out CGI sense, this part is over. Thank god. Then the movie picks up! Lots of good stuff that you can see for yourself if you want. The last halfhour the movie starts to die again with more loooonnnnngggg fight scenes and bad dialogue. But there are some good bits in this as well, especially a three way sword fight that is good for the first five minutes, but unfortunately goes for fifteen. What Jack does at the end is fitting, for the most part (even here I smell the stink of the producers touch), but the featured ending is not surprise. In short, with some editing you would have the first half hour of a good sequel to the first movie, maybe someone will try that in the directors cut.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This sequel delivered a well-balanced blend of both, and for that I'm very grateful.In the spirit of second acts, this installment is darker, both in terms of ambiance and character twists. The rum-soaked lurching, sexual innuendos and sight gags are still there (the second act still knows how to have fun), but there persists an undercurrent of real treachery, both promised and delivered.The first film posed a basic challenge to what the term ""pirate"" really meant - pedestrian notions of ""good"" vs. ""evil"", as contrasted against Jack Sparrow's uber-utilitarian ""what a man can do; what a man can't do"" maxim, etc. And it was all a big laugh.Dead Man's Chest, while still grinning, is decidedly grimmer. Inbetween the laughs, this sequel effectively pushes the lines of loyalty and sentiment, while adding more nuances to the already fantastic Pirate lore.That, and Davy Jones and his pet Kraken are two decidedly nasty pieces of work.Don't trouble yourself with the ""critics"", the usual fashion victims of pop culture.

Yes, that bad.Too long, tortuous story, cliché ridden, not very well acted, very badly cut, with some of the most awful digital work I've ever seen. Orlando Bloom is as bad and annoying here as he was in Troy (No small feat), the rest of the cast isn't really believing it themselves. The rhythm and tone are off most of the time. I knew it right away, something felt off in the first five minutes. My wife and I looked at each other and said in sync: 'Oh no!' It got worse from there. It's hard to say if it's the writing or the direction, but nothing quite runs well. It feels like a car running on three cylinders most of the time. It runs, but it's unpleasant to witness.I don't get it. The first one was so enchanting and fun. What happened?On the plus side, Depp still manages to come out on top repeating his performance from #1. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking at times and the special effects for Davy Jones' character are absolutely remarkable.Ask yourself: how many scenes of a giant calamari slowly crushing sailboats can you stand before you start thinking of something else?I had the same feeling coming out of there as I had when I came out of Waterworld: How does one ruin such a great premise?Grrrr.","136 out of 271 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, Dead Man's Chest has taken the route of many sequels; disguise the fact that it is not fresh anymore by making it look prettier. And that is probably the best way to sum Dead Man's Chest. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not as good as the first.Most of the cast have returned, and this is actually one of the films' problems. At the end of the first film the cast had all separated, and so the sequel needs to find ways to bring them all back together again, and this results in a plodding first half hour which mounts up as episodic and badly thought through plot devices. Even Commodore Norrington returns, and his entrance and role in the film, whilst is interesting in its own way, is (at least for the moment) needless. Also needless are the return of Ragetti and Pintel as the (unnecessary, given the fact that Jack Sparrow is the source of all the humour) comic relief, who really aren't that comic at all.The point about Norrington brings up the next big fault. As it is the first part of the two sequel story, Dead Man's Chest is not a film that can stand up on its own; it is only half a story. This may mean that come May 2007, all the various plot points will make sense, but at the moment they are all too far-stretched to makes a whole lot of sense. There are also really too many different plot strands to last its two and a half hour running time (which is itself about half an hour too long).There are good points about the film, of course. The effects are nothing short of staggering (although some of the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman are not quite as good as the rest), especially Bill Nighy's Davy Jones who has a multi-tentacled beard. Nighy himself is good in the role, but Davy Jones never seems as menacing or, quite frankly, as good as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. Also good is Stellan Skarsgård as Bootstrap Bill, Will Turner's father. Will is a little darker but Orlando Bloom lacks the gravitas to pull off such a character turn. Knightley's Elizabeth Swann is also different, showing a more pirate side to her actions, at least making her a little more exciting even if Knightley herself doesn't entirely convince.The star is once again Depp's Jack Sparrow; even though, like the whole film itself, his act is not as fresh, he is given enough to work with so that most of the humour he creates lands well. His entrance is another classic moment, and his ability to run away as well as he can swagger is often hilarious  he even manages to build on his role from the first film.There is plenty of action, and although it can be thrilling, it feels a little too over-the-top to truly impress at times. However, much of it is well handled, and injects a little more fun into proceedings, just when the audience begins to think that the film has begun to take itself too seriously to be fully enjoyable. It is now down to film number three to see whether the franchise is strong enough to stay afloat; the last ten minutes of Dead Man's Chest has three plot twists that at least will make us come back for the answers next summer. Overall, whilst it is enjoyable enough, it is certainly not a patch on the first, and the third entry in the series has a lot of work to do to restore audience faith in it.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Anyone going into these films expecting to see something truly new and unique is going to be sorely disappointed. I had heard the hype over the first film and was not overly impressed with it. It was fun, true enough. But, it wasn't an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination.So, too, is the second film not a great film in any regards. It has its fun parts mind you, but it is nothing new, nothing unique, and falls prey to rehashing the same action sequences over and over again. I don't know how many times we need to see Orlando Bloom parlaying an action sequence either on top or inside of some round, rolling obstacle... but when you have the main character in a ball made of bones, on a net full of gunpowder and on top of a water wheel all in the same film, you know the writers are running out of ideas fast.What truly annoyed me about this film was the fast and cheap setup at the end for the sequel yet to come. There was no sense that this film resolves anything or even ends a narrative path. Instead, it leaves the story hanging just as any of the previous action scenes did. In truth, for how little this film resolves anything, it could have ended anywhere and achieved the same result in terms of the story coming to a conclusion.At least with other films that mandate a sequel, there is some sense of closure in the story lines. Even the second Lord of the Rings film had several plot resolutions, though the ultimate story had yet to finish. This film concludes nothing, and in that it feels like I wasted two and half hours, which is far longer than this type of film can sustain any semblance of relevance. By one and half hours I was already bored, but by the time the film ended with what was not even an ending, I was sick to death of the same things over and over again.All in all, the second film is full of the same silly humor, rehashed action scenes and forced character development as the first. So, if that is your thing, all the power to you. But, if you are looking for something new or to stir the mind and imagination, this is not it. I like silly humor (I even loved Snakes on a Plane) but this film simply isn't interesting enough to reward the attention it deserves.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The action sequences were clever, yet funny, and I just loved every part of the film. It was a little slow in the beginning because it was building up the story, but it quickly caught up its pace and blew me away for the rest of the movie. In conclusion, I found the film very endearing among all the other horrible summer movies this year, and inspiring for more terrific action/adventure movies to be made.

The stunts are great. The jeopardy scenes are inventive. The costumes are spectacular. But where's the plot? An hour into the feature and we've seen a host of quality action and choreography to go with Keira Knightley's heaving bosom, Orlando's pouting and Depp's masterful Cockney lecher's leer, but it feels like five short action features one after the other with nothing holding them together. One review of this movie I saw noted it was five minutes longer than Goodfellas, and pointed the question as to what might be gained as a viewer from this as a result as opposed to taking in the Scorsese masterpiece. Cut it down to 115 minutes and you've got a quality pop blockbuster the audience can go home from brushing off the popcorn crumbs with all and sundry telling their friends how they can't wait for the last one, and plenty of good script ideas left over to use in the final instalment. Mind you, it always pays to stay till the end. I've never seen an actor steal a two and a half hour movie with his only line in a fifteen second scene, but well, it's all in a day's work for Geoffrey Rush.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The audience gets a simple plot that lasts definitely over a couple of hours, bogged down heavily with rather lengthy action sequences. People sword fight. People sail on ships. If that entertains you, then you'll like this movie.If you want something to sink your teeth in, something with a little ""depth"" (pardon my pun with this being a pirate movie and all), take your business elsewhere. This is just a cheap, petty thrill to help roll in the bucks that will subdue the moviegoers with less complex needs.Unfortunately, if you're an avid moviegoer, this movie may bore you. I know it did for me. The jokes really weren't that funny, nor was the action a spectacle. Although, I must admit, the makeup and atmosphere was probably the best element this movie has going for it. I give kudos to whoever took care of that.Other than that, this is a sleeper. I didn't care too much for the ending either, but I won't mention more about it. You'll see what I mean if you see for yourselves, which, with the way this movie is really cruising at the box office, I'm sure you probably will.Johnny Depp still has an interesting character though. So if there's any redeeming factor about this poorly scrambled together shindig, it's the makeup, atmosphere, and Mr. Depp. The rest was just assembled out of bits and pieces left in the Hollywood dumpster. It's a pity that there wasn't enough to give personalities to Will and Elizabeth.","17 out of 27 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Difficult sequel to a tee","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1418790/?ref_=tt_urv","ExpendableMan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4491531/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2006","Criticising Pirates of the Caribbean is a bit like criticising Christmas. It is one of those sacred institutions whereby daring to even utter a word against it leaves one branded a miser and a scrooge with no sense of fun, but the downside is sometimes it is quite apt. Now the original Pirates movie was terrific, an energetic romp through the high seas that has become one of the classic blockbusters of the decade, but the sequel sadly isn't quite as good. Like trying to recreate the childhood magic of the holiday season as an adult, it just isn't as rewarding. Not that Dead Man's Chest isn't a good film, far from it. In fact it's another highly entertaining ride with enough one liners, set pieces, ""yarr matey"" shenanigans and sea monsters to keep the multiplexes packed for months, but unfortunately it doesn't have the zest of it's predecessor. The main reason for this appears to be a case of over-ambition on the producers part as they have crafted an epic film with multiple plot strands and have sadly succumbed to the same over-stretching that blighted the Matrix sequels.The storyline here involves Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) attempts to pay off a blood debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), commander of a fearsome crew of sea monsters and Captain of the fabled Flying Dutchman. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) meanwhile is hired by the East India trading company to retrieve a key that Sparrow is searching for in return for pardons for his crimes in the first film. Inevitably, Turner's fiancée Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) becomes involved as well and all three characters set off on their own individual plot lines as they race towards a reunion in the latter half of the film. This may sound exciting on paper, but sadly what it translates to is increasing the running time to a bladder-challenging length and over-complicating the premise. Worse, each character is afforded an equal amount of attention and as they all become separated, Johnny Depp is given less screen time. Bad move. Jack Sparrow was the best thing about the first film and once again, every second he is on screen is a joy to behold. Unfortunately, Turner and Swann are considerably less interesting characters and whenever the storyline returns to them, you find yourself tapping your fingers and waiting for the mascara-clad pirate rogue to reappear. The pacing suffers because of this and there's a continual sense that much of the fat could have been trimmed to make this as sleek a vessel as the first: an escape from an island populated by cannibals at the start for instance is riotously enjoyable but in all truthfulness, isn't that essential to the rest of the film.That said, Dead Man's Chest is still a rewarding experience despite it's faults. Alongside Depp's vibrant charisma there are some terrific performances including the return of the ever bickering Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) who provide a lot of laughs, plus the foreboding sight of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). His is a villain that easily matches that of Captain Barbosa from Curse of the Black Pearl, a sea-dwelling abomination with horrific arachnid legs and a beard composed of a slimy wriggling mass of tentacles. But the real breakout is from Jack Davenport, who returns to play the now-ruined Commodore Norrington. Where once was a man of honour is a drunken, brawling, back-stabbing villain and one of the biggest surprises is that he quite effectively steals every scene he's in.Furthermore, the studio hasn't held back on some big budget set pieces. A three way sword fight inside a spinning waterwheel is perhaps the standout as director Gore Verbinski makes the players throw in a really rough and tumble ride that looks so dangerous it's amazing nobody was hurt. Added to this are plenty of rucks with the Kraken, a vast sea monster sent by Davy Jones to drag Sparrow to the bottom of the ocean and numerous clashes with all kind of villains.Additionally, they should be praised for making Dead Man's Chest a significantly darker proposition. There's an ever lingering sense of foreboding hanging over it and the moody lighting, grim score, themes of damnation and the sight of men having their eyeballs pecked out by crows leave no doubts that the waters are far more turbulent this time around. And let's not even get into the sub-textual references of Jack Sparrow falling into an open grave...In a nutshell then, Dead Man's Chest is a film all set to divide audiences. The over-indulgence in the running time and the sometimes convoluted storyline do it no favours but these grievances aside, it still makes for a glorious evening's entertainment with plenty of giddy thrills to remind us all why we love Jack so much. Just bare in mind that it is the first part of a two part story and come the jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending, you'll be counting the days till Pirates 3 sets sail.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But if people like it, then who am I to say otherwise.How could Gore Verbinsi treat us to so much in the first instalment ""Curse Of The Black Pearl"" and then give us so little in plot and character development in Dead Mans Chest. I'll say no more of that, i feel i've already said enough The saving grace of this movie is the Special Visual Effects. WOW!!! they get a 10/10 rating all on their own. ILM has done a fantastic job. You wouldn't believe that Davy Jones and his crew of Sea Phantom's were all Digital. Simply Superb.So a massive round of applause and cheers to John Knoll and all the crew at Industrial Light and Magic, But jeers overall to this not so great sequel to a bonafied classic. It's good all round entertainment, But never will it bear the title of being a ""hollywood classic"".Still bring on POTC 3. Maybe that'll be better...

I was a huge fan of the first one, having seen it at least 5 times in the theaters. This movie just adds to the fun. Captain Jack is just as mischievous and charming in this movie. I felt that there were more humorous moments in this movie, but some may disagree. If you haven't seen the first movie, some of the humorous moments will pass you by. There's a line about rum that's absolutely hilarious.As a mother of a 5 year old girl, I had no intentions of taking her to this movie. She has seen the first movie and loved it, but I was concerned about the images I saw in the previews. After seeing the movie, I was right not bring her. Davy Jones' crew is a bit on the creepy side and I wouldn't recommend this movie for children under the age of 9, and that's assuming they have strong constitutions. Other than the graphic violence and pirate images, the other daunting thing for smaller children would be the length of the movie. 2 1/2 hours a bit much to expect from a 7 year old The surprise at the end was enjoyed and it makes you want to see the next movie even more. If you liked the first one, than I seriously doubt you'll not like this one.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Fantastic, Superb, Thrilling. POTC Dead Man's Chest was all of those things and more. I must say that if you are looking for the 2nd most thrilling ride of your life (after POTC Curse of the Black Pearl that is) then sign up for the sequel of a lifetime. The crew is back in full force and Captain Jack Sparrow is funnier than he was last time around. Orland Bloom and Keira Knightly were wonderful Pirates, and the addition of Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as Bootstrap Bill was right on the money. Ragetti and Pintel were back in full force as was the wooden eye (lol). The action sequences were over the top but not to be outdone. I got dizzy at my second showing (I sat near the front!) during the wheel sequence. Norrington is very comical and rightly has a bigger part in this one (although not as you might expect). Tom Hollander as the new Lord of Port Royal was surprising at first but welcomed. He is a fantastic actor. I Must say that Tia is a character who I think will be a major player in POTC 3. The movie got a standing ovation in both showings I saw on Friday and during the last two minutes of the movie you couldn't even hear the dialog because everyone was hooting and hollering from a surprise character appearance (and no not Keith Richards). I won't spoil it and say who but man was I cheering louder than most.

Other than that, references to the previous film were amusing and all the actors delivered stellar performances.

Disney really has a winner in the Pirates series, and they did nothing but seal the deal for our purchasing the DVD and eagerly anticipating the next sequel.

They all fight for the same treasure, which many have killed for, given its value, but the duelers don't seem intent on killing each other. In fact, none of the attacks seem aimed towards killing, but rather towards grandstanding and making an ostentatious show of one's ability to balance on an ever-spinning waterwheel.Thus is the spirit behind this inferior sequel that seems more intent on keeping us in awe at the stunts and/or special effects than giving us a cohesive story we can follow. The thrills are in surplus, true, but we still leave the theater with lots of unanswered questions, which I daresay will have to wait until Pirates 3.But maybe I got my hopes up too high. Not an hour prior to my screening I had finished the first Pirates in hopes of refreshing the details of the story. Instead, I sat through Dead Man's Chest with disappointment where there otherwise would have been a more overwhelming excitement. It may have been the comparison to a superior film, but with all bias aside Dead Man's Chest crosses into the upper echelon far fewer times than its predecessor.Not to say that it never does, though. In a complex and sometimes confusing webs of plots and character motivations, some brilliant and suspenseful moments break the surface, especially a jolt moment that would probably startle me again and a tense game of do-or-die Yahtzee. Such scenes are fueled by the improved performances from Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, and of course Johnny Depp's ebullient Jack Sparrow. All are seeking a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones, which, for some reason, enables the possessor to control the seas and thus the wealth that traverses it. Will wants it to save Elizabeth from a greedy lord's bum rap, Elizabeth wants it to save will from eternal servitude on the decks of Davey Jones' ship the Flying Dutchman, and Jack wants it to avoid paying his soul to Jones as a debt owed to him. Enter some cannibals, a giant octopus, and some characters of questionable origin and purpose, and you've got something decent enough to sit through, even for 2+ hours.The final third of the trilogy may make everything clear, just as the last half of the first movie explained the storyline to a satisfactory degree, but this time the anticipation is not exactly killing me. Maybe next time it will not be so set up for a letdown, but one thing is for sure: Jack's got a lot more fighting to do. Savvy?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

What a beloved character he has become and Depp is perfect in this role. All is well that ends well, and movie no. 1 was a unique masterpiece.Here, however, one immediately starts to think of the original Star Wars trilogy or even Back to the Future, Matrix ... etc. Not because of any reference (although one can easily do so), but because this film is a true example of a great trilogy in the making. I am at awe, truly. Everything in this film is perfectly done, but the only negative side is that I have to wait until next summer for the final chapter to appear. If I would break it down a little, I would do it like this:Costumes: perfectly done. I haven't seen that many pirate movies but I have a feeling how a pirate should dress, and here the costumes are flawless.Music: Always an important factor for me. And I loved Badelt's score in the first one, but Zimmer takes it further and with familiar references to Badelt once in a while. Awesome!Script: Without giving to much, I think the scriptwriters have done an amazing job, I loved the dialog, I loved the scenes and interactions and I loved the ending - that's all I can say!Visual effects: Flawless, yet again. The Kraken is without a doubt one of the best cgi characters I've seen. And of course Davy Jones's face! and other sea-creatures and the cursed crew of the Flying Dutchman.Acting: Depp is hilariously great and awesome, Bloom and Knightley improve a lot, Bill Nighy is fun and of course the smaller parts are all cleverly cast and wonderfully executed.Action: One of the best I've seen! The turning-wheel sword fight (don't worry - this has been seen in trailers so I'm not giving anything away) ... pure magic and skillfully done. And other action is great!Direction: Verbinski is a master at work here, no doubt about it.With this in mind, I think it's gonna be hard to top this one. The final chapter is gonna be awesome, but until I get to see it (with the rest of the world) these two films are gonna entertain me very much.To sum it up in few words: The Greatest Entertainment you can find this year! Savvy?","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

Once the movie makers of a successful film decide to make a sequel, they should keep in mind how many sequels they will be making. Dead Man's Chest was made keeping in mind that in yr 2007 they will release Pirates III. Thats Okay, as long as you know what do you want to show in part 2 and 3. Here, i think the makers had plan for a big part 2 film, started making it and then realized this movie will become 4 hour long. So they decide to chop it into 2 parts ... Now they wanted to build a plot for the 3rd part however without giving away the whole thing, so they kept dragging this one .... First 35-40 mins are good, sensible, entertaining and refreshing, next 1.5 hours is drag ... simply stretching the concept by using gross costumes, acts and scenes.No fun, no one liners, no thrill, I could have taken a nap for 30 mins and wouldn't have missed a thing. As a movie goer, I don't like that. If you have something interesting than show it. Don't worry about the size of the movie. Finish it in one go ... don't be greedy to make more money with part III.Depp fans will watch this ... I simply loved the first part and thought Depp was marvelous ... this part he is ordinary.I will wait for the 3rd one .... $10 more for Mr. Depp","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The same old, ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" type thing. Orlando Bloom has too big of a roll, he needs to stick to the type of thing he had in Lord of the Rings. Kiera Knightley is beautiful as ever and does a decent job (it's not her fault that the scene were she dressed like a man was total garbage).

We have action sequences stretched out beyond anything enjoyable, there is absolutely no depth to anything in the movie, you could be a mushroom and still understand everything happening on the screen. It was like watching formula 1 these days. Bland, no likable characters, no passion , no nothing. Just something happening. Great CGI and technical perfection. No good dialogs, no real background of anything or anyone, no intelligent humor, It just has no essence.

It was a packed theater. A few people were even dressed for the occasion, swords and all. As soon as the film began, I was hooked. From the moment CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow made his entrance (I cheered) to the shocker at the very end, I loved every minute. Most everyone else did as well. If this was a stand-alone movie, I might have been disappointed because of the ""here comes the sequel"" cliffhanger. But as part II of a trilogy, it works wonderfully. It was darker, funnier, and the various sea battles, swordfights, and escapes were creative and exciting. I appreciated how the director balanced the serious dialogue with slapstick comedy so well. Davy Jones' crew were gross and unpleasant to look at, but that was the point. They're trapped in a watery hell, they're not exactly going to have faces like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (people who complained about the ugly pirates probably went to the film just to ""ooh"" at the two actors listed above). The plot was a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll be alright. I had no problem with the violence and I believe it was done tastefully, not gory or graphic. It's a PG-13 movie based on an idea of Uncle Walt's, not some soccer mom's home video of the ride in Disneyland. I say kudos to the Disney company for having taken such a chance three years ago with The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's about time they realized that most of their original customers have grown up and want things a little more mature from the main Mouse. By the way, Johnny Depp is an incredible actor. Jack Sparrow just might be my favorite franchise movie character since Indiana Jones (incidentally, Spielberg would be proud of this film I think. It feels a lot like Raiders of the Lost Ark at sea). The CGI was top-notch. I really believed there was a giant squid crushing those ships, and as mentioned before, the crew of the Flying Dutchman were delightfully creepy. I don't know if I can wait for the final installment.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

The action sequences were great but sparse for a 2-1/2 hour movie. In my opinion, the special effects used on Davey Jones' crew was over done and unbelievable. The actors' performances were excellent as usual. Johnny Depp was fun and witty although it seemed that his drunken banter was much more limited than in the previous Pirates. Kiera Knightly was incredible and a joy to watch as always, and Orlando Bloom met all expectations as the hero. I have to say I was overall I was disappointed.

So, of course, I've been dying to see this thing for a long time, as many of us have. I left the theatre with a very mixed reaction, but I'd say I was more disappointed than anything else. Rather than go on about how I don't like it, I'll give my honest reasons of exactly WHY I was disappointed.The plot was interesting. I'll give it that. I was interested in the whole Davy Jones, Dead Man's Chest storyline. I enjoyed it, and I would liked to have seen a little more detail on the past of Davy Jones, and mainly a better explanation on his heart and how it ""controlled the sea"". When I sit down for a movie that is two and a half hours long, I don't want to have questions. I understand that there are supposed to be loose ends in order to build suspense for the third installment, but the plot just seemed to be a little incomplete.The acting was solid. Johnny Depp didn't seem to be quite as good as he was in the first film, but I don't think that is his fault necessarily. The writing was good, but not quite as clever and witty as the first. I would have liked to seen even more humor. The audience seemed to really feed off of that, and it created a great atmosphere. I think that's what gave the first installment an edge- it wasn't just a good action movie. It mixed comedy with drama, action with romance. It had something for everyone, and yet it remained a family film. That's why everyone loved it. That's why it was nearly impossible for this film to be as good as it's prequel. That doesn't mean that this isn't a good movie. As far as good entertainment goes, it's about as good as it will get. Extremely entertaining. But it lacks that ""edge"" that the first film had, and it lacks that edge due to the plot and the writing that failed in comparison to the first film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yet it is not his movie - as he does in the first, he injects trouble everywhere he goes, of which the story is built upon. New characters, particularly Bill Nighy's Davey Jones, do not feel like 'filler', or character clones, but like everything else in this film, widens the POTC universe, as though we were journeying through the mythological canon of an ancient seafaring cultures. They all have a screen presence which excites. Acting, although not exactly award-standard, is at the right tone and consistency to make this a fun family adventure, rather than an emotional drama.The CGI is consistently brilliant. Davey Jones is the 'gollum' of 2006. Sea monsters and flying tentacles are the real deal, and applause must go to the crew animating their butts off to bring us this convincing, wondrous world.As i've said, its a thrill ride. sure, its long, and that may get people tired of it. But as it goes on, enjoy the ride with its twists and turns, and you'll be eager for the next. Word of advice though: pay attention to every word said by the characters, as so much happens in this film, and it is easy to at times be a little confused as to what has happened. Keep your ears peeled as well as your eyes. ;-)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I went anyway, because I figured the first Pirates of the Caribbean was actually an enjoyable film. I wish I had listened to his advice.By the time we hit the 2 hour mark, I was thinking to myself: ""This could have been over a half hour ago and I could be banging my head against the wall and having more fun."" The plot was ridiculous, even by Hollywood standards. For example: ""Let's see, Will Turner will strike a deal with a diminutive bad guy in order to save his future wife, who ends up escaping anyway."" There was no real character development, or even any sort of resolution.The last hour or so of the film featured a giant octopus eating a ship for the third time, a long drawn out and boring sword fight rolled into a chase scene, neither of which were entertaining and an ending that offered no resolution to the film and actually felt like a slap in the face.After the film was finished, my friends and I sat in our seats in disbelief as we felt robbed of not only our $6.50 but our dignity after being tricked into watching a 150-minute long trailer for the next installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. We didn't even sit there long, but we were the last people to leave the theater. It seemed to me that no one there really enjoyed the film enough to sit around through the credits and talk about how much they enjoyed the film. This observation was confirmed on our way out by the overwhelming number of downtrodden faces and lack of smiles among the crowd in the theater lobby.If I could give this film a 0/10 I would.","72 out of 138 found this helpful.

Another great aspect is the return of recognizable characters of the first part with a very pleasant appearance of one of my favorite characters of BP in the last scene (again: IMHO).

I was quite excited for the movie to begin. The beginning of the movie was awesome however it started to drag on near the middle and I was definitely ready for it to be over with. Don't get me wrong, the performances by Johnny Depp (Capt. Jack Sparrow), Orlando Bloom ( Will Turner) & Keira Knightley ( Elizabeth Swann) were very well done, however, it was the plot itself that was non-existent. When the end of the movie finally came, it was disappointing as there was so much that was left not explained.It was the reappearance of one character from the previous movie that topped off a growing dislike for the movie. To me, the movie felt like it was originally supposed to be 6 hours and just cut off and the 2 1/2 hour mark and then only given half the story. The acting, the visual effect *which are awesome, though a little bit over done in parts* are probably the best part of this plot less movie. It's a good movie to see, but don't go with high hopes as there's a pretty good chance that they'll be brought down. Despite this, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the next movie and hoping that it makes up for this one.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Come on, ""Dead Man's Chest"" starts off with the same mood and pace the first film left us with. But this film is far more complex in order to deliver something new.First of all, it is just insanely hilarious. Really I didn't expect so much bout of comedy. Yes, a few of the funny scenes are rather forced but the rest are just brilliant... and this comedy mood stayed throughout the film even when suspense and action were full on. Second, the new characters... be it the crew of Jack Sparrow or Davy Jones and his men... are extremely well-designed and well-written. For the actors, Depp's acting this time looked rather forced sometimes as he was trying hard to achieve his Oscar-nominated standard of the character. But face it, in the first film Jack was something unique, here we already know his character and his antics, manner of speech etc. So I think ultimately Depp did a nice job. Keira Knightley has got a more wide and complex role this time but she does little besides delivering her beautiful bullet-like English accent. She falters often with careful emotional sequences. Bloom also hasn't much improved from his previous portrayal of Will Turner.Bill Nighy portrays the infamous Davy Jones with much style. And the make-up and visual effects regarding him and his crew are really worth every praise. The overall special visual and sound effects are top-notch, as expected. Verbinski took special care building the sets and location, as evident by the excellent outdoor scenery and entirely believable and captivating indoor atmospheres like the bars, the dungeons and the tribal area in the river at night.The film has enough amount of action, perhaps too much at some places with the underwater monster. It ends in a rather interesting manner, making you crave for the part 3 to come out. I really enjoyed the ending and its various implications or predictions. To summarize, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time.","17 out of 30 found this helpful.

It was good don't get me wrong but the film could have done with a lot more grit to it. I think it needed a few more jokes in serious moments, a little more action and lots lots more gelling material. The film itself was good but I thought it was in no way better than the first. I am a fan of action and felt that this film didn't do justice to the subject. There should have been a lot more hand to hand combat. However it was still a good film and I will have to see the next film when it comes out next year I believe it is.

For whatever reason though, I really get a kick out of these Pirates adventures. Whether it be because I had fond memories of them when I was much younger, or because there just wasn't quite a spectacle like them in the mid-2000's, either way I still find Dead Man's Chest to be an admirable part of the franchise.I'm not sure there will ever be a Pirates film as good as the first one. There's nothing quite like that first adventure with Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. And Dead Man's Chest wastes no time trying to top the spectacle and scope of that film. However, when the story and characters are second fiddle to the set pieces and grand action sequences, that's where you have the problem. In many ways, this film only exists to set up the third film. Most of the story beats are drawn out in what could be only one film's worth of story, but we don't get the payoff for any of it until the 3rd adventure. That's not necessarily always a bad thing, but I would have preferred each film to stand on its own a little bit more.Although we don't get Geoffrey Rush's maniacal Captain Barbossa, we are treated with equally invested performances from Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard as Boostrap Bill. Jones', the main antagonist, is essentially a supernatural pirate with the ability to also control a large sea creature called, the Kraken. If you thought the original film takes advantage of the over-the-top side to the series, the second one doubles down. Luckily, Nighy is an absolute joy to watch on screen, thanks in large part due to the groundbreaking special effects of Jones & various other characters and creatures.Much like the first film, Dead Man's Chest is a bit overlong and has too many moving parts. It worked with the first film because the script, directing, and performances were all brilliant. I think some of the magic wore off here because you definitely feel the length. But there's no denying the entertainment value if you enjoyed the first outing. The ridiculousness continues to an island of indigenous people wanting Jack Sparrow and subsequently a dog to be their ruler, a wheel barrow sword fight that goes on for like 15 minutes, and one great cliffhanger. I know they're silly, but I always manage to have a blast re-watching them.+Doubles down on ridiculous action+Mind-blowing special effects+Cliffhanger-Lengthy & too goofy at times7.6/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It just STOPS. What kind of idiots release a movie that is INCOMPLETE!!! I will spend hours looking into this and I will determine who had the most control over the concept of NOT FINISHING THE MOVIE and I swear I will NEVER pay to see another movie that that person works on again.When I pay for a movie, I expect to see a beginning, a middle and an ending. I expect EVERY thing in that movie to be tied together and completely resolved before the credits role. This movie did NOTHING but create more questions and scenarios to make you wait and wonder until the next one is released.I for one am completely disgusted by this.In Matrix we were ALL WARNED about the cliffhanger - and the next movie was released within months... I saw no published articles warning about this... and I am completely surprised to be the first person to complain about it online here... Is no one else bothered by this? Speak your mind! I have seen people talk up the soundtrack - - WHAT soundtrack? There are no 'lei motifs' for the characters, (meaning a specific type of music that appears when a character appears... like the famous JAWS music when the shark appears... or the Darth Vader/ imperial march music... etc) there is simply a few scores that repeat themselves with a slight variation as the movie drags on... Certainly not something I would pay for at the local music store.I did not see the spoiler at the end... After 2 hours of the movie I started wondering how they were going to tie in all the loose ends... then the movie just ended... I was so angry I stood up and nearly cursed the screen!! It was all I could do to smile at my nephew and ask him how he liked it as we left the theater at as fast a pace as I could set! This movie gets a 1 out of 10 because no matter how good the special effects are, the ending (or lack of one) ruined it for me. I will never watch it again.Pirates, Disney, Gore Verbinski,Ted Elliott,Terry Rossio and whoever else may have had a hand in NOT COMPLETING this movie - you should be ashamed of yourself for your lack of vision! -One extremely unhappy person.Brian","19 out of 31 found this helpful.

This movie was great, plain and simple. Even better than the original, in my opinion. And I didn't even like the original that much, I just saw it for Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly (yow!). But this time, there's a lot more to see than good ol' Johnny and Keira.Yup, a lot more.First off, the story pacing is a lot slower and steady. Something I loved very much. We explore the changes in character with Elizabeth, Will, and Jack even more (with two new recruits as the comic reliefs), with bits of comedy and incredible action here and there. While I thought the Skeleton Barbossa from the original was okay, the new one (the squid-like Davy Jones) actually felt pretty intimidating and incredibly 'wow' to look at. The same goes for the rest of the crew, the makeup effects are incredibly top notch.The movie takes its time in telling the story, letting you soak into the characters and beautiful scenery. Gore and his team have a good eye, through realistic landscapes, makeup, and even with CGI (which is rare nowdays for people who heavily abuse CG).The music seems a little better too, Hans Zimmer seems to carry the soundtrack on with more of an epic beat this time (and doesn't let it drag like it did in the original). The Pirates' theme sounds a lot more ""adventerous"" this time, the new beat really helps enhance the movie even further than I could've imagined.The action was one of the things that surprised me the most. They somehow managed to top themselves every time a major action scene comes up. The over the top sword fights, the ship battles, the bar fight...every single one of them was great and better than the last.Not a whole lot more to say that's not spoilerific other than...you have to see this movie!

When the second installments trailers came out I made sure that I watched them like crazy...memorizing the lines. I have been counting down the days to the movie for the past two years and was very angry when I wasn't able to go to the premiere in Disney Land. I had a HUGE party honoring the second movie on the sixth and saw the midnight show. I was definitely not disappointed. However I wasn't too surprised either...I had read the book, watched trailers, read whatever I could that was supposedly ""the script""...although I was defiantly not expecting the ending. The cliffhanger will definitely keep me wondering. The humor and the intensity of this film is enough to keep watchers at the end of their seats. I've seen this movie every day since midnight on Thursday and plan on seeing it everyday until it is out of theaters. If you loved the first movie then you will think that 'Dead Man's Chest' is much better! Johnny, Orlando, and Keira do a great job in portraying their roles and always have and will I am sure. Verbinski is a pure genius and so are the writers of the film. Their job I'm sure is very stressful but in the end they pulled off a movie that is WAY to good for words. The third movie I know will be even better and anyone who thinks other wise has got to hate movies because this trilogy will definitely be right there with LOTR or even better if they keep up the good work!","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

The comic relief is decent, and the lead acting is good, but overall, the film left me very disappointed. The CGI is very well done for the most part, but the plot is just too boring and predictable to be considered interesting. This film didn't feel quite as exciting as the first film. While I understand that it is a Disney production, this film felt a bit more simple and childish than the first.

In terms of story, mythology, villains and protagonists; this film is better.

It's telling a bigger story that the original, and for that to work they split the story up into multiple sub-plots that all come together in the end for a well set-up final fight with a lot of tension and suspense. The third one does the same thing, but it doesn't work as well there.I've loved this film ever since I first saw it and it's one of those few movies that no matter how many times I watch it, I can never grow tired of it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I watch this series sometimes when I have nothing to do. Johnny Depp is the hero. His performance is good and unique. He often acts the role of person which is crazy or looks addle-brained. I like his acting which despise somebody. But in serious scene he is always cool. The story is simple and we can understand it easily. And this film has many funny scene. The enemy is scared with the figure of monsters for children, but I think there are more scenes that are more interesting than the serious scene. I do not get tired even if long. Everybody enjoy watching it. The figure of monsters is made by the CG effect. It is very fantastic. It will be one of the factors that this movie is splendid. If you like action movie, you should watch it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

From the time I first saw the trailer I knew the movie was gonna be at least fun, but I wasn't sure it was gonna rise up to everyones expectations. But it did. THe story was well told and even though you were a little confused in the beginning, it ended up to develop beautifully. Johnny Depp was magnificent and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen when he played. Orlando Bloom did a very good job as Will Turner and he gave the character more depth and mystery, than he did on the first film. Keira Knightly played her part very good, even though the difference between Elizabeth in the first film and Elizabeth in the second one is evident from the beginning. The other characters completed the puzzle, each giving a little something so as to make the movie wonderful. Stellan Scarsgard forced you to look at him, every time he appeared on screen as Will's father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner and Bill Nighy was the most sinister Davy Jones, that made you wonder if his appearance was truly digital, or if he was somehow real. The next best thing were the special effects that were even better than the ones in the first film. But the cliffhanger in the ending was the cherry on the cake. The ending was the one that promised you that the third installment was gonna be darker and I'd like to hope better than the fist two. ""Dead man's chest"" is a fun movie and promises you 2 and a half interesting hours. Go Pirates. Can't wait for the third.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a bit jarring, and watching it now after the fervor surrounding the series has died down certainly makes the winking more distracting than amusing. That quickly goes away though, and we're whisked away into a story that is all over the map, a tone that less elegantly dances between slapstick humor and grand adventure than the first movie, and a Jack Sparrow that no longer feels fresh.Still, there's no denying that many of the set-pieces here are pretty astounding, especially for how they're handled simultaneously. I love the Kraken attacks, even if they go to that well maybe one too many times. The organ playing while the ship cracks in half is a great, epic moment. Then there's Davy Jones, a CGI creation that still looks great a decade later and Bill Nighy's performance which manages to feel human.I think this one was my favorite when I used to watch these when I was younger. It's definitely the movie I where I developed a crush on Keira Knightley. I don't think it's my favorite anymore, but it still certainly carries a rangy sort of charm once the story kicks into gear about half an hour in.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Depp continues his tightrope walk of a performance but he isn't quite as sure-footed as before. His character is even more selfish, basing his relationships entirely on a series of double-crosses and triple-crosses so that he can come out on top. He does have an arc that sees him, essentially, admit that he really does care for his pirating buddies, but by the time it's complete it's almost too little too late. This makes him less empathetic and, combined with his ever-so-slightly annoying mannerisms (which are accentuated through the actual screenplay this time), creates a less compelling character than you'd expect. The villain this time is Nighy's Davy Jones - an impressive, entirely digital character - who hunts our hero for the hundred years of service he owes and somehow manages to add an extra vowel to every other word. He's a good baddie, suitably callous and commanding, but he can't compete with the previous entry's Barbossa. The plot is sprawling and sporadic, featuring less swashbuckling than its predecessor and relying on the fact that it is, in essence, 'part one'. Indeed, the narrative doesn't actually complete itself in a satisfying way; it just sort of ends, with the denouement being dedicated entirely to cheap sequel bait. Still, the story is entertaining and the set-pieces are well-conceived. The stand-out is clearly an extended sabre duel between three of the focal characters, which starts on a beach and ends on a rampaging, ever-spinning wheel. The thing does a brilliant job of keeping track of its characters, with everyone's position and motive being clear at all times. This is as important in the action as it is in the set-up, which sees most of the core cast separated. By the time everyone comes together, the movie is in full swing and it's a fair bit of fun. It doesn't match the quality of the first film in the series, but it's a decent continuation and a good time in its own right. 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest takes everything good about the first film and amps it up. Not only are the stakes higher, so are the challenges that our heroes face. Be it from the enemy outside, or the internal struggle between right and wrong.What becomes apparent from the very start is a sense of direction. The first film, while a tremendous success, felt in many ways like a test. No one knew if people would like a comedic action film about pirates. Curse of the Black Pearl was much smaller in scale, and importantly, had it not been successful, it would've always worked as a standalone. Despite its enormous success, I do applaud Disney and Verbinski (director) for the audacity of creating a sequel that needs a companion movie. While Dead Man's Chest could, weirdly enough, be its own thing, it ultimately leaves the story wide open. Although it was a big risk, it's clear that it paid off. However, had this film not been as wonderful as it was, I doubt how successful this plan would've been. So, what then makes Dead Man's Chest so good?
As already briefly mentioned, it's the change in tone. This second instalment is much darker, much bigger, and much, much more ambitious.A testament to the much darker tone is an example from the very first minutes. A dark and grimy prison, where some of the prisoners who have been left in cages outside have their eyes pecked out by crows. And no, it's not just implied, it's actually shown. It was that scene, despite its insignificance, that set the tone for what was to come. And boy was there a lot to come. As mentioned, Dead Man's Chest took everything that worked in Curse of the Black Pearl and turned it up a notch. The action sequences are much improved, both in the way they look and how they feel. They encompass a whole new sense of grandeur in their scale. That is of course helped by the new and improved villains captained by the infamous Davy Jones. He and his whole crew are simply spectacular. The combination of practical effects and surprisingly good CGI make for an exciting and ghastly feeling bunch. While they aren't immortal, like the villainous crew in the previous film, they feel significantly more frightening. Add to that the Kraken that Davy Jones wields, and you have yourself an opponent that even the mighty Jack Sparrow might not be able to best. Indeed, it's partly thanks to the new and improved sense of dread, and partly to the stakes that are also much higher, that this film succeeds even better at its goal than it's predecessor. That is, providing a tense and entertaining bit of cinema, that makes you want to return for the sequel.However, despite all that, there are still hints of the problem that The Curse of the Black Pearl faced. What I'm talking about are some of the scenes that feel a tad too long. Although there aren't nearly as many of them in this one, there are quite a few sequences that feel a little redundant and stretched out, and it begs the question, should they have even been there in the first place. Regardless, these problems are far and apart, the biggest problem that Dead Man's Chest has is that it isn't a proper film on its own. The story in it doesn't get any closure, it leaves an endless number of questions unanswered, and ultimately, it requires for its sequel to be seen. While that is not a problem, of course, especially now that they are all on Disney+, I do have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of films that make you watch another film, so that they work. While some other films, most notably Lord of the Rings and the last two parts of Harry Potter, do the same thing, at least they had a source material to go by and justify the decision. In the case of Pirates of the Caribbean, though, there is really no excuse for it, apart from hoping that people will feel the need to return for the next part and create revenue. But alas, I can't stay too mad. This film, like the one before it, is great fun. In fact, as far as the film itself goes, I think I slightly preferred Dead Man's Chest. I just wish that it had wrapped up at least some of the loose ends.With all that being said, I happily look forward to watching the last part of this original trilogy. There is something special to be cherished in these films. It could just be the nostalgia speaking, but I honestly feel that movies like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and others in the series aren't made anymore. They have a wonderful sense of carefreeness and an endless yearning for fun and adventure. Not only do they provide a great time, but they also make me wish that I could be there alongside Jack, Will, Elizabeth and the rest of the crew.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, in short, part 1 was brilliant, part 2 is pretty great.It doesn't happen very often that I love a film from the first time I see it, but Pirates of the Caribbean was one of them. I fell in love with it from the start. But, part two (and three) were announced, and the people among us that love films know that sequels can really ruin it. I'm a very difficult guy to please with films (and pretty much anything else), so I think there should be some credibility when I say they did an OK job.If The Curse of the Black Pearl deserved a 9, I rate this one 7,5. Still a very good score, if you ask me. But why is there 1.5 points difference, well several reasons. Dead Man's Chest is a bit less mature, or a bit more Hollywood than The Curse of the Black Pearl.The use of fantasy has increased. Part one had unrealistic elements, but part two stretches to fantasy (of which the CGI has definitely improved since part one, may I add). Speaking of stretching, the story is all stretched out. While I have no real problems with the duration because I enjoy it so much, it could've easily been cut 20 minutes shorter. Especially considering the story doesn't end in this one. But there is still some good writing at times, and even though it's not as captivating as part one, you'll still enjoy it. They tried to make it seem like the story was meant to continue, and they succeeded in making it seem like that.The jokes are more obvious and if you compare it to part one, they could bother you. Because a lot of small jokes are surrealistic things. Things that would never happen in real life. I won't give any examples, because I don't want to spoil. But Jack as well, you might sometimes get the feeling they're overdoing him. I did have that feeling once or twice. But it's still Jack Sparrow, and you'll still love him. They haven't fked him up, don't worry. And there's another character, Davy Jones. If you are familiar with Bill Nighy's strange ways, you'll know that he fits in this film and is a lovable character as well.One last thing I'd like to mention is the ending of the film. You will probably not like it, I warn you. But let's hope for part three to make it all up.So, people who hate this one just have to get over it. It's still an enjoyable entertaining film, just see it for yourself.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Davey Jones character is very inventive and portrayed wonderfully by Bill Nighy. This is the kind of movie I go to the theater to see. Definitely big screen, big sound. I like to get lost for a few hours and this movie certainly does the trick. It is a bit much for young kids though so I would definitely heed the PG-13 rating. I ended up seeing the first POTC 4 times in the theater taking family and friends who where reluctant at first to see it. I am sure I will be going at least that many times again with this installment. If you are looking for a movie that makes you ponder the nature of the universe and why we are here this is not the movie for you.

It was also linevitable the sequel would be of inferior quality. The filmmakers decided to make two further instalments back-to-back. Since Empire Strikes Back, every film maker with an eye on a trilogy feels that the second movie must be darker than the first movie. Dead Man's Chest is full of plot holes, inexplicable character actions and is not half as much fun as its predecessor. Pacing is a huge problem, the movie slogs through about hour of set-up before launching into its main story. For what is pretty much just a simple quest movie: find the key and chest, and use one to open the other, for the next 90 minutes.I find it hard to figure how a movie with the central character of Captain Jack Sparrow could ever be anything but fun. Depp is in top form again, making Captain Jack the most dashing scoundrel since Han Solo (there is more than one similarity with Solo and his character arc).Kiera Knightley is a bit more than the obligatory love interest she was in the first movie. This one takes Elizabeth's romantic life in an unexpected direction, as sparks fly between her and Jack (Even if she does not want to admit it) Knightley and Depp have decent chemistry. Knightley and Orlando Bloom do not. They are a much more interesting coupleOrlando Bloom's Will is not much more than he was in the first movie, the dashing hero. Bloom is more than ok, but he is often overshadowed by Depp and Knightley. Davy Jones represents a creepy villain (great CGI), Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport both return, as do the comedic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as pirate versions of C3PO and R2D2. Yes, I know, another Star Wars nod.The slow, uneven beginning is not really compensated for by the climax, which drags on about twenty minutes too long, with one scene after another, just leaving you feeling blah as it drags to the end credits. It's a common problem in movies these days, as the movie makers are more interested in putting scenes in movies, to put things in place for the next instalment rather than concentrating on one solid instalment. There were no further movies planned (though I'm sure Disney had hopes of a franchise) when the first movie was made, and it's to the movie's benefit. Despite being nowhere near as fun or fresh as the first movie POTC: Dead Mans Chest grossed $423 million at the domestic box office to become the highest-grossing movie of 2006. Making it Depp's highest grossing and best performing movie. For a time, this movie also held the box-office record for the highest opening weekend with $135,634,554 dollars earned.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Comparative Look at the Pirates Series - Part 2: Dead Man's Chest","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3424808/?ref_=tt_urv","kdavies-69347","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62910059/?ref_=tt_urv","2 March 2016","The second entry in the series returns to the world of pirates in a bold new way.It is still an Adventure film in many ways, but I think this and the next in the series is far more in the realm of Fantasy. Dead Man's Chest brings back the characters that we were introduced to in the first film, and many new ones to add more depth to the 'Pirates' world.At the beginning of the film we return to the island where William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann have recently started their life together. Very early on, their relationship is threatened by a new and much more human villain. Under the employ of the East India Trading Company, a man by the name of Cutler Beckett uses his financial and political clout to arrest both William and Elizabeth for their acts of piracy in the first film. He uses this to manipulate William to hunt down Jack Sparrow and bring him to justice. Jack hasn't changed much since the first film. When we are introduced to him, he is literally escaping what looks like hell, and he does so with such ease that he makes it look like fun. In addition we are introduced to another new villain, Davy Jones (fantastically played by Bill Nighy) who is consumed by an immortal quest to sail the seas and collect the souls of the dead to spend 100 years aboard his ship in service. Personally, I think he is my favourite personality throughout the series, if not just for the facial expressions he (and the FX team) managed to portray through the digital design of the character.This movie and its sequel serve a much larger portion of plot to the viewer. Dead Man's Chest serves as the middle story for the original trilogy of films. There is a definite negative undertone throughout as each character goes through their own trials and alliances are tested. It becomes quite obvious that each person will play their part and betrayal is the main theme of this movie. Despite the fondness William may have for Jack, they are pitted against each other. Elizabeth finds herself in a position of power for the first time and must use it to manipulate Jack to her own ends. And of course the villains of the film pulling the strings to achieve their own ends.This entry is probably the darkest in tone, and certainly has an undertone of death to it. The fight scenes are certainly aggressively violent for a Disney movie, but I think it was essential for this adventure. It is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the series, and so; ends with a cliff-hanger as expected. It maintains that level of excitement throughout and plays an important role in the series, although perhaps not as lighthearted and fun as the original.7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This had everything that made the first one enjoyable. There is amazing sword fight/action sequences, creepy bad people created with incredible special effects, romance, humor, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow.Captain Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davy Jones. The deal was for Jack to be captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years, then give up his sole and become a crew member of the Flying Dutchman. Those thirteen years are up, and Davy Jones is after Jack Sparrow. Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann are also on the lookout as well. After being arrested by the British government for aiding in the escape of Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are blackmailed into helping track down Jack. Lord Cutler Beckett forces them to find Sparrow and obtain a magical compass from him in exchange for pardons.There were many similarities to ""Empire Strikes Back."" This is darker compared to the first film, just as ""Empire Strikes Back"" was to ""A New Hope."" Captain Jack Sparrow has that classic Han Solo type feel, Will Turner is a lot like Luke, and even Elizabeth Swann has a similar feel to Leia. Even Ragetti, tall and skinny, and Pintel, short and round, are back and have some comedic roles, just like R2D2 and C3P0. There is a cliffhanger, which will catch most people by surprise, much like ""Empire Strikes Back"" did.Once again, there is a great villain. Davy Jones was a better villain then Captain Barbossa. What made him better was that Davy Jones a more multi-dimension character then Barbossa. Barbossa was just pure evil. At least once did you think that Davy Jones had a passionate side, but then the next scene he would do something totally brutal and evil. Davy Jones is sure to become a classic villain.The special and visual effects, once again, are top notch. From the look of Davy Jones to his henchman, it was spectacular. Davy Jones was created the same way that Gollum/Smeagol was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Some of the special effects used to make his tentacles are possibly the best use of CGI ever shown on screen. Davy Jones and his crew all looked like creatures from the sea. Davy Jones' main defense, which he summons to destroy ships, was the Kracken, a giant tentacled beast with a toothy throat similar to the fictional creature called a Sarlacc from ""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi."" Just like in the first movie, you should expect some major sword fights, and those fights are improved.A ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie cannot be reviewed without mentioning Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Once again, the rum loving pirate steals the show and shows that his character is the coolest character since Hans Solo in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. His introduction was humorous, but not as memorable as the first one. Hopefully, Johnny Depp is once again nominated for best actor. It will be exciting to see him and Keith Richards, who was Johnny's inspiration for Jack Sparrow, on the screen together. In case you did not know, there will be a third movie and Keith Richards will be playing Jack Sparrow's father.Some of the side characters we all knew and loved are back, such as Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce), Pintel (played by Lee Arenberg), Ragetti (played by Mackenzie Crook), Mr. Gibbs (played by Kevin McNally), and Marty (played by Martin Klebba). Those people got the same amount of screen time. Norington (played by Jack Davenport) has received a bigger, more in depth role. Orlando Bloom (who plays Will Turner) has shown a little improvement and has improved quite a bit since he donned bows and arrows in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Keira Knightley (who plays Elisabeth Swann) has also added a little bit more to her character.The new additions are also well done. ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (played by Stellan Skarguard), Will Turner's father, is finally introduced and he had very nice chemistry with Will. Another interesting character was a woman named Tia Dalma (played by Naomie Harris). She was very strange and was possibly even weirder (maybe just more mysterious and unknown) then Jack. Maybe they will explain more about her back-story in the next chapter. Of course, we know about Davy Jones (played by Bill Nighy).If you are looking for the perfect summer popcorn movie, you are in the right place. This was just as enjoyable as the first movie. This is must see on the big screen and hopefully you do not forget to leave until after the credits. Bring your family, bring your friends, and do not forget to start singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirates life for me."" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is very recommended!","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Put ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on the opposite side of the sequel coin to ""Matrix Reloaded"" - there most decidedly IS a precedent for second films emerging from the shadows of their predecessors.Thus my hopes when I went in to see ""Dead Man's Chest"" were reasonably high. The fact that all of the original cast had returned, along with quality additions like Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy, only buoyed my optimism. And surely Johnny Depp wouldn't have let himself be pulled into any old crap, contractual obligation or no.Like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this is a considerably darker affair than the all out fun of the original. The themes dealt with here are more somber - betrayals and double crossings are commonplace even among the good guys, and issues of mortality dealt with by Davey Jones and his crew make them far more frightening than the villains of the original - indeed, Barbossa and his men look almost cartoonish by comparison. There are some real scares here, and this is definitely not a film that I'd recommend to parents with young children, bladder busting running time aside.Not to say its all gloom and doom. Definitely not. The visual effects are virtually flawless, and the action set pieces - particularly a three way sword fight between Jack, Will and Norrington while Elizabeth throws a temper tantrum (not to mention rocks) on the sidelines is fantastic. The script is great, not only containing a good measure of great one liners (of which Captain Jack predictably gets the lion's share) but also real deepening of relationships between the characters. Jack and Elizabeth in particular. Ragetti and Pintel are great fun, trading on their great rapport like they did in the original, and Norrington finally gets to be something other than a ""prat in a wig"" (as the lovably self deprecating Jack Davenport described himself in a magazine interview).Inevitably, it lacks the freshness and the ""wow"" factor of the original. But there's nothing the filmmakers could have done to avoid that. Because, lets face it, nobody expected the original to be as successful as it was. A Disney flick based on a theme park ride starring Edward Scissorhands, Legolas and the skinny chick from ""Bend it Like Beckham""? Who knew? Pleasingly, though, there's no sense of anybody resting on their laurels - in particular I had dreaded Jack's antics skirting into caricature territory but Depp is, of course, far too ""savvy"" an actor to fall into that trap.The ending, like that of ""Back to the Future Part II"", is predictably a cliffhanger ensuring that everybody and their dog (or monkey) will drag themselves back to see part three, but oddly the feeling of being manipulated is somehow all part of the fun. And if part three is even anywhere near the quality of part two....we're in for an awesome ride...","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, most impressive part of it being the sea monster Kraken as well as the convincing portrait of Davy Jones.Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, who happens to be a strange mix of aquatic flora & fauna.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing to the story. More epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is definitely a fun experience that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

All the critics had panned it and other people's reviews I had read did not give compelling reasons for liking it.However, it turned out that this movie is waaaaay better than the critics claim. It's only drawback is that it is long and a few scenes could have been worked out. Despite this, I loved the action sequences and I didn't at all find the plot to be razor thin by any means. What I think this movie is suffering from is critic's bologna. These are the same people who claimed Spider-Man 2 was the greatest superhero movie ever made. It's great but not the best (in fact I got kinda bored through it). The point being that since they hold that sequel to such a high standard they have since panned all other attempts by other franchises.The plot to POTC:DMC is actually quite similar to the first in scope and execution but it is no way a repeat. Gore Verbinski does a great job again at the helm of direction and the music by Hans Zimmer goes very well with the action sequences. And the ending is a nice set up to the third movie due out next year. I was not ""overstimulated"" as one critic has put it and I never found any of the returning main characters to be annoying or less than what they were before. I think actually that Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is much more real character now than she was in the first. I honestly believed this time that she was more than just a pretty governor's daughter.My advice: definitely go see it. The critics have no idea what they're talking about.

The guy and the girl will find out they're brother and sister? Will they start saying ""May the Caribbean Sea be with you, says I, maitee"" and then make 3 prequels? Fill in your own Star----oops, I mean, Pirates plot twists here.Overall, it's an OK movie, but with some flaws. Johnny Depp was brilliantly dashing yet devious in the original as Capt. Jack Sparrow, and has made this character part of our cultural lexicon. However, the awkward scripting this time on how Sparrow evolves is a challenge even for Depp's talents. Unnecessary action is thrown in, apparently to pad the running time, so that you don't notice this whole thing is just a commercial for part 3. The entire chase scene with the island natives means nothing in the story line. The free-for-all-mayhem where several characters just start fighting over stuff at the end has too much slapstick; the 3-way sword fight and the odd way it is shown are almost too much to endure.On the other hand, if you prefer a film that has loads of action, you'll love the pace of this movie. The ship-to-ship engagements are not bad at all, and the Kraken's ""Moby Dick"" style appearances are highlights of the flick. The Flying Dutchman creatures are also very creative, but their design is almost comic relief, rather than scary, in nature.A half-hearted thumbs-up on this one. The movie's strong points outweigh the weaknesses. However, this movie is shallow compared to its predecessor, and I hope the installment that it spends a lot of time pointing to is better than this, as well.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It successfully resurrected the swashbuckler genre, became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2003 and received five Oscar nominations, including, for the first time, Best Actor for Johnny Depp (apparently, the Academy didn't notice three previous gems such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco), who turned from indie poster-boy to Hollywood superstar. Oh yes, POTC was a great movie. And now the pirates have returned, bigger, but not always better, than ever!This time, everybody's in trouble. Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) wedding day is ruined by the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a very unpleasant man who's been sent to arrest them for helping the notorious pirate Jack Sparrow, I'm sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow, escape from hanging. The couple's only chance to get a full pardon is to steal Jack's compass, which will lead Becket to the Dead Man's Chest, an object that gives its owner the power to control the sea. Jack (Johnny Depp), on the other hand, has gotten himself in an even worse situation. You see, in order to become captain of the Black Pearl, he made a deal with the demonic Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Now, thirteen years later, the Scottish pirate wants Jack to pay his debt, meaning our hero is supposed to serve on ghost-vessel The Flying Dutchman for 100 years. Unless Jack can get out of this mess, of course. Hence the need to retrieve the aforementioned chest...Now, let's be honest. Pirates didn't need a sequel, since everything ended so perfectly and everyone got what he/she wanted. But who cares, when the continuation is, for the most part, a fun ride? Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio have returned to familiar territory and expanded the mythology, creating a fascinating world which fuses elements of Indiana Jones and Star Wars (DMC has plenty of references to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, not to mention a threesome sword-fight that will make The Phantom Menace eat its heart out). And while they introduce new locations (a stunning cannibal island) and new threats (the half squid, half crab Jones, his ""fishy"" crew and his pet sea monster, the Kraken), they don't forget our old friends on the way. Supporting characters such as Commodore Norrington and the comic duo Pintel & Ragetti are given more space, while the protagonists carry the story without disappointing us. Will is still an honorable man, driven by love towards his fiancée and forced to deal with his father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill (a very human Stellan Skarsgård), who turns out to be not only alive, but also a member of Davy Jones' crew. Elizabeth still seeks adventure as well as a peaceful life with her man. The pirates are still a bunch of stinking rascals, and Jack... well, he's Jack! Constantly unreliable but charismatic, he steals the entire movie with no effort at all (although he has less screen-time than expected). From the moment he first shows up, you know you're in for something absolutely unforgettable. His performance is zany and brilliant enough to make the very long running time (two and a half hours) and occasional far-fetched twists seem less irritating than they should be. If you loved the first movie, you just can't miss Dead Man's Chest. It may not be as fresh and well-crafted as its predecessor, but it is a good piece of entertainment and should raise expectations regarding the upcoming number 3.6,5/10","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Alright, but feels held back by a few inconsistencies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1412699/?ref_=tt_urv","DonFishies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1622466/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2006","I checked out the midnight screening of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with mixed anticipation. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first film, and seriously consider it as one of the most recently released films that actually felt like it was made just to be fun. It was an obvious risky gamble as a film, and it paid off for Disney. As could be expected, two sequels were greenlit, and filmed back-to-back. And as one of the key highly anticipated films of the summer, it has some mighty shoes to fill. And understandably, there are mixed results.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) are about to get married. Unfortunately, the newly appointed Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has other plans. They are placed under arrest for aiding and abetting felon Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), and are told that their penalty will be death. Meanwhile, Jack, after a great intro, is informed that he has to pay an owed debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), and is now a marked man.Revealing anything else would just give away some of the intriguing subplots, and the useless boring ones. Some elements felt a bit half-baked, but of course, will sound and feel a lot more developed come At World's End next summer. The script seems fairly well formulated, but it feels like they went heavy on story here, and cut back on the comedy and action that made the first film so much fun. There is plenty of it to go around of course, but it just feels totally lessened down in comparison to the first film. Another element missing here is a lack of character development. A few crazy developments do happen, but the characters really do not change at all throughout the film. Again, something that may be fixed in the next film, but nonetheless feels awkward here. One thing they did not bother changing from the first film was the intensely long running time. In fact, it's even longer. The editing feels a lot sharper as opposed to the original film, but there is still quite a bit of dialogue and useless add-ons that could have been excised.Although not at the forefront of attention this time around, Depp still has the right amount of flavour to pull off Jack Sparrow. His performance in the original film was flawless, and he just continues his fabulous Oscar-nominated role here. As said though, he does take more of a supporting role here as opposed to Bloom and Knightely. Bloom does great again as Will Turner, and while nowhere near as stunningly superb as Depp, he puts in another fine performance for what is arguably his short career's best character. Knightely is alright here, but she looks and feels a bit distracted for the most part. She does not have the genuine independence or the spunk that her character had in the original film. Her character instead feels a lot more static and uneven in comparison to the other two.Jack Davenport pulls in a great continued supporting turn as the conniving Norrington, as does Kevin McNally as first mate Gibbs. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, although they could have done with a little bit less screen time, do great as the comedic pirate duo of Pintel and Ragetti. They were shining parts in the original film, and despite feeling overused, do very well here too. And although they only skimmed the surface of their characters, Nighy's Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgård's 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (who was only mentioned briefly in the original film) are great additions to the cast. The only thing they would have benefited from, was more screen time. I can only hope they get extended and more developed in part three. Other characters like Hollander's Lord Cutler Beckett and Naomie Harris' Tia Dalma are almost totally unreviewable, as they get even less screen time, and are given nothing but plot advancement/surprise revealing to do.The music, while featuring a few recycled/redone tunes, is just as great the second time as it was the first. The depth and feel of it only complements the film. The costumes, set designs and makeup also continue to be well done. Their authenticity adds greatly to the film.And even with their unevenness, the special effects dazzle. Davey Jones and his crew look absolutely phenomenal. Watch them in battle scenes and they look just as awestriking, if not more so, than the skeleton pirates in the original film. A particular standout for me was watching Davey Jones play the piano with all of his tentacles. It looks so realistic, and is done so well that it looks absolutely flawless on screen. However, the Kraken (a giant octopus that can be summoned at will) just does not look anywhere near as good. His tentacles, as they come around on the various ships, look fairly well done, but look weak when they attack any member of the cast. And when they do show anything more than just his tentacles, the effects look totally off, and feel inadequate in comparison to the great effects used for Jones and Co.In the end, the film really is a mixed bag. It does have many inconsistencies and a lack of completion, but it is watchable. The original film is obviously better, but at least this does not feel totally rushed and ill-managed. I can only hope that they fix up the loose ends in the screenplay, clean up the effects and get a better editor for the next round though. Otherwise, this really is going to be a one-trick pony of a franchise. 6/10.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is still swaggering about, stealing the show with his swashbuckling charm, while Bloom and Knightley keep making their way into Jack Sparrow's plans to repay the debt he owes to Davy Jones.The film runs over two hours, and some things probably could have been cut out, especially for an audience that is used to films under the 120 minute mark. But Pirates has many of twists and surprises for the audience, many of which are reminiscent of the first film. Those who are familiar with the first will notice many references in the first to crack a smile or make a point. Which isn't bad, but it's a little overdone.I was very impressed with the CG in this film, Davy Jones and his crew were always a joy to watch, and the mystical sea creature, the Cracken, was extremely well done. Environments and props were crafted to perfection, and the film draws you in very well in this department. I don't think they could have had a more convincing atmosphere for Dead Man's Chest. But it doesn't make up for the film as whole, which has some issues.Overall the movie looks like a perfect specimen from a far glance, but it has a serious gimp. There are a ton of plot holes, inconsistencies and it's incredibly absurd considering how many characters make returns and how much Dead Man's Chest has to lean on its predecessor to keep itself from stumbling over itself. Some of the magic from the first film is there, but the only thing that has improved are the CG pirates and the sometimes almost mystical environments. The third installment will have a lot of explaining to do thanks to Dead Man's Chest, and I don't know how they are going to keep it under three hours without it making any sense and still have it be as wildly entertaining as the first.Overall it's an enjoyable experience, with laughs here and there, but in the end you're going to be saying out loud, ""what?"" Let's just hope that the final installment can patch up the holes and make this trilogy a solid, consistent winner, and make Dead Man's Chest a little more understandable. Perhaps then it will lose its gimp. But for now, I'll have to say the highlight of the film was Davy Jones blasting away at his organ. 6/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action is non-stop, the special effects are flawless, the acting is decent and you truly are immersed into the pirate world. However, I left this film disappointed. There is no attempt to create a single film here, this is one very long film chopped in two, with an abrupt ending that resolves nothing that has been previously set up. Most films that are written with sequels in mind still make an effort to tell a story within the overarching plot (e.g. Star Wars), this makes no such attempt. A lot of the story that is set borders on the pointless side (Why did Captain Jack need to find a picture of a key to know that he was looking for a key?) and there are certainly parts which do not cater for those who have not seen the first film (the 'cliff-hanger' will leave the uninitiated clueless). I enjoyed this film and will go to see the second but I wish more effort had been given to the script rather than the money grabbing approach of forcing people to watch the third film to resolve the second.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The storyline is just a unnecessarily complicated and the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be suitable for kids or not. By now we've gotten used to Johnny Depp's weird performance, although I'm still not entirely convinced by it.Still, the movie is full of great ideas for action sequences (even more so than part one!) and mostly the chemistry between the actors works fine. Here's the thing: THIS MOVIE IS WAY TOO LONG! It's like a neverending roller-coaster ride. Things fly through the air, people are thrown around like volley balls, ships explode, a monster Kraken unleashes hell. After two hours the headache starts and it's just too much. It's an annoying trend in Hollywood that probably started with the Matrix and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Also, why is it not enough to make just one sequel these days? Why do they have two come in pairs? I'm so fed up with a movie ending right in the middle of the story, so you have to wait another year until you've already forgotten about everything that happened in the previous part.Well, it seems to be a clever concept commercially but I'm not so sure if this procedure won't backfire sooner or later. After all the trick is to stop when the audience still wanted to see more, not when everybody's so exhausted they just can't take any more. After all this is really the one thing that keeps ""Pirates Of The Carribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" from being more than a slightly above average summer blockbuster.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Completely justified.Dead Man's Chest suffers from sequel-syndrome, with an extraordinarily convoluted plot, and jokes that seem to scream (in an increasingly hysterical voice) ""Remember the first one? Remember how funny it was?!?!""Not to say that the movie in itself was all bad. Certainly it meets the requirements of a fun summer blockbuster, but after the overwhelming success of Black Pearl, this seems depressingly inadequate. With three years between the first and second movie, all the good jokes were already feeling hackneyed enough without being dusted off and reused. One could only moan ""not another rum joke Please not another rum joke."" Most viewers, of course, will go simply to see Johnny Depp  but it seems Gore Verbinski decided this was not enough reason to shift focus from the overly-dramatic Will Turner onto Jack Sparrow. Jack appears to have (shockingly) gotten even less screen time than in the first film  and what he does get is, for the most part, poorly written. In the scenes where he was given new material to work with  new jokes and character development  Johnny Depp is absolutely extraordinary, but these scenes were too few and far between to save the film.In true sequel-style, the ending will, indeed, leave you cheering and waiting expectantly for the last installment, but this fabulous last 30 min. doesn't really justify 2 hours of drudgery. There is much potential here, but to capitalize on it the film would have had to try harder to stand on its own - not relying so heavily on Curse of the Black Pearl  a true sequel instead of a half-hearted clone.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Let's set our expectations sufficiently low here: if you're expecting a piece of cinema that will satisfy you on a critical level, excelling in all the ordinary boxes of plot, character development et cetera, you'll probably be disappointed. The plot is silly and meandering and character development is clichéd (the father thing) and forced.That's not what this film is about. It's a family adventure film, a swashbuckler. Personally, my criteria for this genre, which I enjoy very much, would be inventive and exciting fight scenes, a little light-hearted comedy and characters that are likable and fun without necessarily having to be compelling or three-dimensional (though it'd help, of course), and spectacular effects, visual feasts and music that capture the imagination.This film has these in spades. The fights are fantastic and so original it doesn't matter if they're a bit ridiculous. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is in my view as cool as ever while remaining the classic pirate - his last scene in the film (I won't ruin it) stays in the mind for hours after you leave. It's so powerful and awe-inspiring. Once again the environments and scenes, from Tortuga to the islands visited to the ships, are enchanting. The music, though unchanged, remains the brilliantly exciting and dramatic adventure score it always was (I played it in my head during a rugby game while on tour, it's that heart-pounding. I definitely played better. This film will improve your rugby - further incentive.) The issue of violence and darkness is one valid area of concern. There are some nasty bits in this film and some pretty freaky monsters - wait until you see Davey Jones' crew, for one. I'd be careful about bringing your youngest. More than that, however, is the notion that the very imaginative ideas, but very dark ones, that they had in this film might have been better suited in a film that wasn't aimed at families. This would have been better as an adventure thriller with a higher rating. All the ideas are there but they're a bit out of place in a film with Road Runner-esquire cartoon comedy sequences (seriously).These remain minor issues. This film is not a critically satisfying piece of cinema. But we're not all critics. Expect a funny, passionate and fiercely exciting adventure film and you will be richly rewarded. Promise.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

This had not beginning, middle and end.

Jack Sparrow (sorry, *Captain*) has been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years (unlucky thirteen, as it were). Originally, he had made a deal with the sea himself, Davy Jones, to raise the ship from the depths of his locker (we don't find out the details of that, yet, but I'm sure they'll be answered in the third movie). The deal was that Jack would be captain for thirteen years only, and then be doomed to servitude on the Flying Dutchman (Davy Jones' ship). Now, his time is up, and Jack gets the ever-familiar 'black spot' on his hand, marking him as pray for the Kraken (Davy Jones' assassination minion of the depths of the sea) if he should defy his deal.Now for everybody else: Will and Elizabeth are about to get married in the very beginning, but a certain Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company has put out arrest warrants for them both (for helping Jack escape the hangman's noose, for which their crime shares the exact same punishment), and one for Jack (for his crimes mentioned in the first movie), and even one for the *former* Commodore James Norrington (his conditions are a bit more fuzzy)! The deal Lord Beckett makes with Will is that, if he gets a certain 'compass' from Captain Jack, then Will and Elizabeth will both be pardoned (Norrington has been nowhere to be found for the past few weeks). Too bad Lord Beckett has a hidden agenda...Now, that's the beginning, and I'm going to stop there, because I don't want to post any spoilers. So, with this in mind, forgive me for being a bit evasive as I give my analysis: Captain Jack changes quite a bit in this movie. He's much less decisive about what he needs to do with his strategies (and a bit sloppy with them), and his heart seems to always be torn in two (you'll see what I'm talking about during the course of the movie). Overall I see this as a negative impact for the movie, but it may turn positive in the third, showing that he is indeed 'growing'.Will is actually an improvement, in my honest opinion. He was the classically adorable, lovesick puppy in Curse of the Black Pearl, but much more of an adult in Dead Man's Chest. He seems to have lived more in this movie, and experienced a whole lot (like all of the events of the first movie). Though some may say Orlando Bloom's acting is wooden, I *completely* disagree! I think he portrayed a very 'real' (no other word to describe it) person as Will Turner, without you feeling like you're even watching an actor, but the actual person Will Turner, ups and downs both.Elizabeth, pardon my English, is a major S-L-U-T in this movie. She mentions toward the beginning how Lord Beckett ""robbed her of her wedding night"" (the least ladylike thing she could possibly say in front of company). She flirts with nearly every guy she meets in this movie (Jack most certainly included, if you can believe it!), and throws herself at a couple of them (literally). Total downhill spiral from the first movie, making Elizabeth a rich and promiscuous snob (never a good combination for a movie heroine).Norrington is a MAJOR plus! He pitches the white wig that made him look like an ice cream cone in the first movie, and becomes... well, *piratey*, if you can believe it! His personality has many different sides here, with conflicting desires (including a possible remaining love for Elizabeth?) and motivations. And also--and this is not something to criticize the movie with, but my own heterosexual female opinion--Norrington was incredibly HOT!The new bad guy, Davy Jones, is another negative. His story is explained (such as how he became an immortal sea-like creature), but his motivations and desires are rather fuzzy. Barbossa from the first movie was a much better villain: you knew that what he was doing was evil, and that Jack needed to defeat him for the movie to be happy, but you understood *why* Barbossa did what he did in Curse of the Black Pearl--to feel like a human being again! (And, be honest, you sympathized with him a bit.) Davy Jones, on the other hand, is much colder than Barbossa (and not in a good way), much crueler, and offers you no outlet for sympathy, making the storyline more one-sided. That's not to say Bill Nighy was bad for the role (he portrayed him very well, actually), but the character himself was a downside.All in all, with the above story and character analysis, I give this movie 6/10 stars.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

However it has received much hype as being an equal to the first film if not better than the original. Nothing could be simultaneously further from the truth or more correct. That is to say that this was definitely not as good as the first film, (which proves I'm not just some cynical critic because I thought the first film was fantastic, my date agreed and was also disappointed with the sequel). However I can see how people compare its quality to the first. They do this because the sequel recycled all the originality and funny scenes from its predecessor. This was basically the same movie with a different name and a monster added to it. Therefore to me the film was a failure. The cast did deliver, Captain Jack did a marvelous job of looking drunk or off-balance or most likely like a man used to being aboard a rocking ship. His constant stumbling awkwardness was a welcome comic relief. Furthermore the monstrosities that were in this film were imaginative and very well done. Lets also not forget the action, which was not lacking. Yet in the end the effects, action, and comedy were still not able to overcome the fact that this film was riding on the coatails of the first movies popularity.

Jack is back and he is magnificent -drunk most of the time, his morals as unstable as his walk, lying, seducing, running, hanging by his leg on the rope, and always irresistible. Depp's Capt. Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I am sure that the make up artists will be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserve them all). I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all. The film is a rare case of equal opportunity entertainment and enjoyment - for the young children, their parents, cynical teenagers, sophisticated intellectuals, rednecks - for everybody and their uncle Max.8.5/10","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, Jack is afraid of the sea, because he owes his soul to the evil Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchmen. When Will meets Jack, the pirate proposes to exchange his compass by a key owned by Davy Jones. Will goes to the Flying Dutchman without knowing how dangerous and diabolic Davy Jones and his crew are.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is another good supernatural adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, with action, humor, romance, mystery and great special effects. The story is inferior to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but is also very entertaining. Unfortunately it is does not end, actually it is interrupted in a suspenseful moment in order to have another sequel again with Captain Barbossa. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe  O Baú da Morte"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Death Chest"")","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Just like the first one, I thought it would never end. What could be much more suspenseful and captivating is dragged on for two and a half hours. A snip here and there would have done wonders for this film. One thing that always bothers me is the complexity of the hero's task; we are submerged in a whirlpool of details. At times I think the characters themselves are confused by what's going on. How could they know?Still, it's nice to see someone put forth the effort to tell a really nifty adventure yarn. The sea puts forth obstacles that we don't have on terra firma. It has its own legends and its own being, and it's really quite wet. I like the hammer head guy and the octopus-like Jones. Obviously, the makeup people put in a lot of overtime. It also sets up episode three.

I'm not that much of an adventure-fan usually, but there is just something about playfulness in movies that attracts me. When filmmakers allow themselves to play and have fun with the media as well as the subject. The first movie was genuine fun, and so of course the expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? I think it did.Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to fall in love with. Insanely weird and existing somewhere between good and bad, wrong and right, he's just the perfect. Orlando Bloom who should have the Academy award for stiffness (if such is ever presented) is also perfect as the, guess?, stiff William Turner. The first movie had captain Barbossa (the always wonderful Geoffrey Rush) and this movie has Davy Jones (the equally wonderful Bill Nighy) who is a worthy successor. So the stage is set character-wise for a repetition of the success. Don't forget story though. Of course treasure is the goal and enemies must be avoided and vanquished. In this movie though there is more at stake than just simple gold, something that doesn't destroy the fun luckily. There is sword-fighting, acrobatics, insane stunts and crazy sailing to make everyone happy. Much as in the first movie.So we have the characters, we have the story, we have the action and the comedy. Is this a better movie than the first? Not in my opinion. The first movie had the advantage of being first, as well as a story that perhaps made more sense. But this is as worthy a successor as i could have hoped for. Intensely funny, exciting and without losing the comedy and tongue-in-cheek that made the first movie such a delight. Maybe just one small point, i somehow wish the third movie would have been released closer to this one considering how close it follows story-wise. But that is just a small complaint, something that will make the arrival of the third movie all the more exciting.7/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The elements of the movie such as characters and objects, all of it was switched around to accommodate a completely different story line. Satisfying? As far from it as possible. This movie was as complete as the opening scrolls in the Star Wars movie. All it did was set the scene for the next one, which I hope is more complete.

Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I can only compare it to the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean' which I felt developed and used the characters much better than the sequel. I was utterly disappointed at how the plot unfolds, and the changes in the personalities of some of the leading characters. And I was really let down at the ending, for reasons some of you will understand when you see this movie.Maybe I was just expecting too much. Maybe it was ""fresher"" the first time out. Maybe there was an obvious point to this movie, which will be better known in 'Pirates 3' (At World's End) due out next year. I don't know, but overall I just sat there at the end of the movie going ""What the heck??"" I might just go back and see it again in a few days, maybe it will be better the second time around; but I am not getting my hopes up. 'Pirates 2' falls short of the original, not in the CGI (Davy Jones' crew equals the ""dead"" crew of Captain Barbossa in the first movie) but unlike the Indiana Jones trilogy, the sequel did not meet or exceed the original. I am very disappointed to admit that, but it is how I feel.","8 out of 25 found this helpful.

Dead Man's Chest is definitely not a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed a little. It's always tough to create sequels to successful blockbusters and have them live up to original's name. The first ""Pirates"" film had a rare charm that most other Hollywood pictures would envy. Fantastic characters, a great story, amazing special effects, and an all-around ""fun"" feel. It's not hard to understand why it became so popular.On paper, nothing really seems wrong with Dead Man's Chest. It has the same elements that made the first film a hit. Yet at the same time, something felt missing.Two of the ""main three"" characters (Sparrow, Turner, and Swann) seemed to have experienced a personality makeover. Initially, all three characters are likable and you found yourself rooting for them through both good and bad intentions. That's not the case in DMC. Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann both show their dark side and become devious, cowardly, and double-crossing individuals. Their actions are so despicable that even a movie audience will have a hard time justifying them. Will Turner, however, is still the same honorable and loyal gentleman that is the fish-out-of-water among cutthroat pirates. This leaves Turner as the only remaining likable character out of the ""main three."" On the other hand, there is one character change that I was pleasantly surprised with. Commodore Norrington. In the first film, he was a snobbish stiff that dedicated himself to capturing criminal scum and bringing them to justice (or execution). In DMC, an unfortunate twist of fate causes his character to do a 180* and become the very same scum he once fought to destroy. This spin is very amusing and one of the highlights of the film.A great amount of the storyline felt like filler, as if they were just there to set up the next action scene. This formula works for B-movies and martial arts films, but for a big budget film like DMC, it feels awkward.The humor is hit-and-miss. It's impossible not to smile Johnny Depp's performance, even at his most outrageous moments. However, it often feels that the writers tried too hard to squeeze in humor at inappropriate places just so they can meet their humor quota. This sort of bad timing is another element that sets DMC below COTBP in terms of quality.Davy Jones and ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner are two terrific additions to the ""Pirates"" cast. They both add to a very dark atmosphere that the overall story focuses on. While the dark tone is a welcome change for the series, it also makes the story a bit depressing. You can't help but pity Bill Turner, trapped in a world that he can never escape.Though far-fetched at times, the action/sword-fight scenes are a ton of fun to watch and help make DMC an all-around solid film.The ending is not 100% satisfying, but that was done intentionally to build up anticipation for the third (and perhaps final) film. I hope that the third film improves on what I didn't like about the story and ties up all the loose ends so it can leave audiences feeling thrilled and satisfied. If they do, The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has the potential to be remembered as classics worthy to sit by the legendary Back to the Future and Indiana Jones series as great timeless adventures for everyone to enjoy.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow, the action, and the visual effects, the plot and story behind the second installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" makes the movie confusing and detracts from what we're watching unfold on screen. While the light tone and gentle gabs at the genre remain from the first movie, as well as the slightly intoxicated character of Jack Sparrow who is as hilarious as ever, character development is lacking. Elizabeth Swann is simply an annoying heroine who loses the edgy graciousness she had in the first movie, while Orlando Bloom just doesn't convey the youthful excitement from the previous film. Plus, the scene where Will is reunited with his father is just silly. Add in a two dimensional evil villain who just cares about money and you have at least three blah performances who revolve around Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. The movie is entertaining, but far too much is going on for us to enjoy Johnny Depp and the special effects.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The CGI was top notch and you won't complain about how horrible and fake looking it was. The acting was amazing, probably because of the super casting Johnney Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geofrey Rush, were most likely the best actors at the time and still are.Pirates of the Caribbean Mans Chest is no different. The CGI was amazing, especially Davy Jones who looked like a real keeper of the sea. His tentacles were astonishing, his face was creepy and disgusting in a good way and his body was great. Also how can anyone forget the Kraken which looked amazingly real and scary. Davy Jones crew was quite the cast that I won't be forgetting for a while, and the fight scenes were much better than the 1st.The acting was just as good if not better than the 1st. Bill Nighy did a great job of playing Davy Jones and Johnney Depp proved to us again that he is the only man on earth who can play Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom did a fantastic job of playing Will Turner just like in Curse of the Black Pearl and Keira Knightley also did splendidly.Overall: This is the best movie of 2006 so far. The CGI was amazing and very believable. The acting was great, especially Jack Sparrow, the movie itself is so astonishing that you won't be looking at your watch at all. Some might think this is a bad movie because it is too long, but time doesn't mean anything ( look at Titanic, Return of the King, King Kong, Godfather ). People might think this is a bad review, but you can believe whatever you want, just like Pirates. 10/10","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Following the rules of a sequel, it is bigger, brasher, and derivative of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, Curse of the Black Pearl. The jokes felt (and often were) recycled. Each reference deserved nothing more than a fond chuckle. To psych myself up for the new film, I watched Curse of the Black Pearl again last night, and found that my appreciate for it actually grew with each watching. I do not see this happening with the latest Pirate escapade.But enough comparisons. As i said, on its own Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a satisfying summer blockbuster, with pretty faces, somewhat clever writing, and its fair share of shocks and scares. Based again on the Disney theme park ride (which I hear they're finishing revamping to capitalize on fan's love of the film's story), this one feels more like a ride. That is to say, the plot points are used simply to thrown the characters through various roller-coaster like adventures without any real consequence. No one is ever safe, but then again you never feel that anyone won't make it into the next scene. Maybe its just because I know there will be another sequel, but any genuine concern for the character's well-being or actual investment in the story is missing. So yes, an enjoyable film, but missing the heart of the original. but you probably knew that already. So catch a matinée, sit back, try not to think too much, and enjoy the movie based on a ride. or don't.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I find myself enjoying it even more than ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" at moments.I've said this before, but the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are insanely fun and exciting adventure films, but they are also surprisingly subversive and thought-provoking. You can enjoy them equally with your brain turned off, or your brain dialed up to 11.This film takes everything that is wonderful about the first film, while further deepening and exploring the themes. I feel that Lord Beckett, as a villain, is genuinely such a sly commentary on the human urge to control and dominate nature and the world as a whole. He's smug, powerful, and a wonderfully hateable villain. His presence in this movie, I feel, furthers the ideas presented by the ""Pirates"" movies: that authority is not always right, and that being a good and noble person sometimes exists outside of the mainstream.Yet this movie further complicates these themes by giving each of the characters (including the once-idealistic Will and Elizabeth) complicated motives and conflicting agendas. It really makes me think about how the world, and society, breaks down individuals to commit such acts of ""piracy"" when at the core they're just trying to protect the ones they love.You can say I'm reading too much into it-I say otherwise. As I said, the beauty of the original ""Pirates"" trilogy is that you can enjoy it both mindlessly and mindfully.Beyond the thematic exploration, I think ""Dead Man's Chest"" is still just as fun and ridiculous as its predecessor-if not moreso. Everything from the action sequences on the islands to the fight at the ruined windmill is just so much fun, so badass. Aesthetically as well, I think this movie is so pleasing. Davy Jones and his crew are such creepy, skin-crawling characters, and surprisingly, their special effects still hold up to this day. Moreover, this film is perhaps one of Disney's darkest films ever (which, granted, isn't saying much); I find myself surprised each time I rewatch it at just how violent it is; I kind of doubt Disney would have the guts to be so brutally violent with their films in recent years.Overall, I find myself enjoying this movie just as much as the original, I probably have seen it more times as well. It's just so damn fun, hilarious, emotional, and thoughtful. Another near-perfect film in the series.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like what they had to say was really just about 30 minutes worth of plot movement and the rest was to show case their academy nominated talent and amazing vfx. This was more the promo video at a scifi convention and less the movie part 1 was made of. The actors really flopped as well. Jack Sparrow was wonderful, but Johnny seldom fails in his delivery. Sometimes he picks bad scripts, but regardless his delivery is always on. He was the only human actor that did this with this plot less tale. Orlando and Keira really missed the mark. Sometimes you can tell when an actor is already swinging for the fences and strikes out completely.With these two actors that is exactly what happened. There was no levels in their performance and no memorable moment. The second savior of the film (The first being Jack Sparrow) was Davy Jones. WELL DONE!!! I am so glad I live in an age where claytronics don't exist and characters like Davey Jones does. I couldn't stop staring and couldn't get enough. Jerry Bruckheimer should be kissing who ever did the VFX's rear, because without that this movie would have flopped. At the very least he should give his writers a smack on the wrists as they didn't fill the void of a second movie with amazing content, instead they left it empty with the occasional change of scenery.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first POTC was one of the most enjoyable movies released in 2003, and Johnny Depp just owns the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Naturally, I was looking forward to a lot of the same things that were very entertaining the first time around today....with the added bonus of furthering the story and providing a little more insight into the world of the Pirates of the Caribbean.What do I think now that I've seen it? Its somewhat unremarkable, underwhelming, and didn't really meet my expectations.Although this movie is visually stunning, I couldn't help but wonder if it really needed all the bells and whistles that they threw at it. Davy Jones and his crew were somewhat distracting, and I think would have been just as effective as a supernatural crew of pirates without all the CGI.The story was scattered, but OK. We all know that there is a third film coming soon, so it didn't really feel like a complete film (Not to mention that knowing who is signed on for the next one kinda ruins some of the tense parts of this film). I think that this was really due to most of the characters having their own agenda in the storyline. (You kinda have to pay attention to this) Some of the best parts of the first film are still here: Captain Jack Sparrow (Which Johnny Depp still owns), some humour and cool sword fights. This does make it a fun movie, but it is by no means a must see. I could have waited for a rental.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I would go as far to say that this movie was WORSE than The Village (which I also hated). The story picks up a bit after the last movie left off, which is probably the only good thing about the movie. After the intro, he just goes horribly wrong. The plot feels like it's pulled and twisted just so that they can stretch this movie to an uncomfortable 2.5 hours and leave the story open at the end so they can make 4 or 5 more of these atrocities. The number of plot holes created from this warped directing style just adds to the confusion of why I actually bought a ticket in the first place. Maybe, it was because I liked the first movie and expected the 2nd to not be absolute junk. I can honestly state that I will never watch another Gore Verbinski movie, seeing that having his name stamped on a movie must mark it as manure.You've bested me this time Gore Verbinski and taken me gold, it will not happen again!","41 out of 80 found this helpful.

"","","Overall Good, Heavy on the Plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1416714/?ref_=tt_urv","animationchick","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4014447/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2006","This weekend I had the pleasure of seeing the next installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie is one of my favorites, so I have been eagerly anticipating what Disney and Bruckheimer would cook up with this franchise. When news came in that the movie may be so-so I was worried, however went into the packed theater with an open mind. While thoroughly entertaining, witty and enjoyable, the movie is very long, filled with filler fluff, and probably could have been cut down and combined with the third movie and made into one better film.The plot is hard to describe in a few sentences, but basically Captain Jack Sparrow is back, and his life is in debt to the legendary Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchmen who are supernatural creatures who do underwater dirty work and are out for blood. Facing possible eternal damnation, Jack must save himself by calling on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who have an obligation to come to Jack's aid. Unfortunately, their involvement causes them to miss their wedding day, and sends them into the high seas for danger and adventure.In Dead Man's Chest we see a lot more character development of Will and especially Elizabeth as they go about their story lines and get tangled in the plot. The enrichment of their characters was a pleasant surprise for me because I wasn't expecting it. Everyone loves Jack Sparrow, but it was nice to see that the movie focused on them and wasn't only the 'Johnny Depp' show (although he pretty much steals the movie anyway, as predicted).So what of the film? Extremely appealing, a loud, fun, summer 'popcorn' flick if you will, however inferior to the original in many ways. Overall very dark, with creepy characters and a LOT of plot to explain, the movie delves into the supernatural quickly and while very interesting, sometimes is too unbelievable. The good news is that it's quite funny and doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there is so much plot that I felt like I should have had a notebook to keep track of all the important elements. The overall artistic look and feel is mysterious and menacing, but could be considered scary for children or people like me :) Overall the CG was so-so and did not compare in any way to the original with had a much better villain and more interesting bad guys in general.The main complaint I have with this film is that there are TONS of action sequences that are there for no reason other than to show more action and perhaps take up time. For example, the scenes involving Jack Sparrow and the natives could have completely been cut out, because they did virtually nothing for the plot. I sincerely think that this film could have wrapped itself up within one movie if unnecessary scenes had been cut; leaving only the parts that served the plot. Now there is going to be a third movie, probably with more action scenes, rather than one solid movie with a great script.To wrap up, in order to enjoy the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the viewer must understand that the point is to have fun; therefore you must sit back, relax, and roll with it. If you are expecting an Oscar film, this ain't the place for you. If you've got that, then you will be all set for this movie. I honestly wish that Dead Man's Chest would have wrapped up much like the first one, however predictably now I can't wait to see the third one to see how the adventures conclude.:::www.animationchick.com:::","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

That's why I've decided to post a comment. Anyway, here goes...We've got the same cast, same thrilling music, same director, same writers, and same Caribbean baby!! What more can you ask for? Unless... Heath Ledger, Elijah Wood, and Jeremy Sumpter were to pop up as new characters-O.K. now I'm letting my imagination run off. But really, Ted & Terry did another amazing job with the writing; I don't know how they do it - much respect. Someone posted the comment that they were trying too hard or forcing things. In my opinion, they observed the way Johnny played his character *Captain* Jack Sparrow and played off of that nicely.Someone also said that DMC was darker. I found it to be more humorous. Capt. Jack was hilarious and Will and Elizabeth also added a bit of comedy here and there.The fight scenes were sensational. I couldn't believe that they actually got to do some of their stunts with the giant wheel. When Norrington, Jack, and Will are all fighting each other while Elizabeth helplessly throws rocks at them there was a roar of laughter in the theatre.On the contrary to what another poster has said I don't believe ""it doesn't take itself seriously."" Johnny Depp wouldn't participate in a film if it wasn't taken seriously. They also said ""unlike the first one the second one wasn't realistic."" Did you forget about the whole cursed pirates never dying and turning into skeletons in the moonlight thing? But it's all fun, and don't spoil that!! Although I thought this movie was fast-paced, exciting, funny, and had a lot of shocking surprises, I'm going to have to disagree again by saying I don't think it was better than the Black Pearl. That person may be saying that because they've just seen Dead Man's Cheast. Perhaps they should watch BP and compare the two. I will say that they are about equal to me.Johnny Depp may be pulling an Adam Sandler by having his fellow co-stars in several movies with him. Some guards in BP and Mackenzie Crook(Ragetti) play in Finding Neverland. Also there is Lor Cutler Beckett from DMC and the third film, At World's End, who's in The Libertine and Pride and Prejudice with Kiera. Comador Norrington is also in The Libertine and the links go on and on. I love when actors do that; it's so fun to see them working together again.We are introduced to some fun new characters, Tia (whom I think though she is hard to look at because of her ugliness might have been one of Captn. Jack's old flings. She really isn't ugly in real life by the way), Davy Jones, Boots-straps Bill and others. Also you will be delighted to see some familiar faces you may not have expected to see. You'll have to go see it to find out who that is!! Captn. Jack is the same, however other characters have changed a bit and I think we'll have to wait until the final film to see what that's about. Will Turner's character has also expanded, but still not completely developed yet I think.Again, perhaps we must wait until the third film.Capt. Jack's entrance was just as good as his entrance in BP - brilliant and might I be so bold to say he is the BEST pirate you've ever heard of. The ending is a shocker. I can't wait to see what will happen next, and Keith Richards (Johnny's inspiration for the character) will make a cameo appearance as Capt. Jack's father!! How cool is that? He was actually supposed to be in this one, but was busy.To the people who keep complaining about the ending leaving them hanging - I'm sure you'll recall that The Lord of Rings didn't have an ending to every movie either, but that is the point!! It's a trilogy. We should be glad they filmed the second and third film at the same time or else it would be coming out even later. And for those people who are saying DMC was a disappointment, I can guarantee they'll be in the theatre watching the third film when it comes out.The ONLY thing I didn't like in the movie (being an animal lover) was the scene when Captn. Jack was being chased by the cannibals and didn't rescue the dog with the key (from the first film) but ran right past him. I thought good ole Captn. Jack will surely swipe him up or turn round for him (after all they do have history together), but sadly he didn't. Then they show the cannibals chasing the poor thing and I as well as some other people in the theatre shook our heads. Awww noooo. *But I'm told I should have stayed until the end of the credits because it has something to do with the dog.* Maybe it's like the first film where after all the credits are finished the monkey takes the medallion. Something to think about; so stay and watch the credits!!This movie will do wonderful because it's a movie the entire family can enjoy - for real!! Truly, age doesn't matter, give this movie a shot and you wont regret it. It's also a good movie for couples because it's not a chick-flick, but the girls will love it just as much as the guys (I know I did). And if you're looking for an adventure this summer, look no further. So just sit back and allow yourself to get lost in it!!Now, you have your heading mates, so cast off and go see it you scalywags. Let's say it all together - Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. The rum is gone? Oh bugger.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I've had the DVD at home for about a week from Netflix and I finally got around to watching it.I enjoyed the first movie (as most people did) and was surprised by how entertaining it was given its source material (as most people were). So, while I wouldn't say I had high hopes for the sequel (didn't think it was necessary), I was looking forward to some more Captain Jack Sparrow and top-of-the-line special effects (I felt the original movie's effects were the most impressive to date).Wow, a lot of parentheses in that last paragraph.Overall, the movie was entertaining, although not as good as the original. The story was hard to follow, the first 45 minutes were completely unnecessary and did nothing to move the plot forward and overall it was probably about ½ an hour too long. Actually just remove those first 45 minutes and it would have flowed much better and been a better flick.But we must remember that these Pirates films are about having fun, and when the film gets going, it is just that: fun.The cinematography, sets, costumes, audio, effects and acting are all top notch. Everything looks fantastic. Johnny Depp again reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow to perfection. Maybe some of the magic is gone, since it is not as new or fresh, but you can't blame Johnny for that.I'm not going to bother with plot details, but I will say this. The folks at ILM have done it again. They've topped their previous effort and again delivered a special effects tour de force! The main antagonist, the pirate Davy Jones, a half man/half octopus creature is simply the most impressive visual effect ever put on film. Ever. He was created completely out of CG, overlaid over the actor playing him, and it is so convincing it looked like the actor was wearing a prosthetic mask. Only you know it couldn't be a prosthetic because if it was, it was the most convincing, organic looking prosthetic in history. The texture of his skin, his tentacles, the way the lighting would reflect off of him (in either night, rain or sunshine) was absolutely perfect. I can watch the scenes in which Davy Jones are in over and over and not get tired. They did a simply amazing job.If you haven't seen the film, rent it just for Johnny Depp and Davy Jones. They are both worth the extra long run time, the so-so beginning, and at times convoluted story.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Before you start firing your cannons at me or plan on starting a mutiny, allow me to explain myself. The first Pirates of the Caribbean, was well directed and made and all that, but as far as story goes, I found it a big bore for some reason. Of course this has nothing to do with Johnny Depps masterful, memorable and Oscar nominated performance as Jack Sparrow which I loved right from the get go. So, I was one of those guys who thought that the only saving grace that the first movie had was Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Now after the enormous success of the first one here comes the bigger sequel. In other words, if Dead Mans Chest follows the rules of being the sequel to a successful film right, we should get more of everything. More effects, more action, more comedy! More Jack Sparrow! I'm glad to say the film successfully achieved all of these and then some! This time around Jack Sparrow is running away from a supernatural evil pirate called Davey Jones. You see, Jack owes Davey Jones his soul, but of course Jack being the sleaze bag trickster that he is doesn't want to pay up what he owes. Instead he chooses to run away and find a way to destroy Davey Jones and his crew of half human half fish pirates. This enrages Davey who conducts a search for Jack across the seven seas, leading us to a cannibal infested island, giant octopuses and strange half man half fish creatures.Little did I suspect that this was going to be the best movie of the summer. I mean literally, it took me by surprise. The big anticipation this summer for me was Superman which for various reasons I wont get into here was great and at the same time disappointing. But here comes Pirates of the Caribbean blowing me away. As this film progressed I realized what a huge production it was, everything is bigger and better here. From the monsters (giant octopuses ROCK!) to the sets (loved that cannibal island!) to the villains (Gotta give props to Davey Jones, what a cool villain!) and the comedy. Yup this film had it all and it turned out to be a really entertaining film of epic proportions.The best thing about this movie of course is having Johnny Depp return to one of his best roles. Like I said before, the thing everyone loved the most about the first flick was Depps Jack Sparrow and on this sequel we get plenty of him. Jack is funnier, trickier and in a strange way more lovable then the first since the guy finally learns that sometimes we have to do the right thing. All the supporting characters were great, I loved some of the jokes coming from some of the lesser important pirates. Orlando Bloom was in the movie, but honestly he has very little to do in this one, since most of the film focuses a whole lot more on the chemistry developing between Keira Knightly and Jack Sparrow and the action and effects.Speaking of effects, another great bonus on this film is that the effects are truly spectacular. Getting wowed by effects is getting increasingly difficult for me, but Ill be damned if this one really had me saying wow every five seconds. The gigantic octopus known as the Kraken freaking rocked! Some of the extended effects sequences with the octopus were extremely exciting and incredible to watch. It brought back memories of scenes from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and seeing Kirk Douglas battling rubber tentacles. On this film Gore Verbinsky has orchestrated a truly memorable monster sequence. One for the books! And speaking of memorable monsters, I loved Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. Its only fair that since Jack Sparrow is such a memorable anti hero we should also get an equally formidable villain. And such is the case with Davey Jones. Aside from the fact that Mr. Jones has a striking look to him (all about the tentacled beard!) the character itself moves and talks in a very interesting and different manner. Loved the way the bad guys looked in this film! So visually speaking get ready for some cool stuff.Of course the guys behind making this film are very smart. They know how much audiences love Jack Sparrow and they know we want to see more of him which is probably why the movie ends with a cliffhanger ending. They literally leave you gasping for more even though the movie last well more then two hours! So be ready for a Lord of the Rings type of ending where you go WHAT? No way it just ended there! So to me, this was the true spectacle of the summer. Incredible effects, great action, great characters and just plain fun. After all ain't that what summer movies are supposed to be about? Fun big budget special effect spectacles! And this one delivers in spades. So trust me on this one maties, we got ourselves a winner!

Yes for me, and if nothing else, just for seeing Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It was a raucous, fun ride as I expected. The CGI is incredible. It's action packed. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann mature a little bit this time around. And good ol' Jack, one of the most loved pirates in movie history, is as sleazy and funny as ever and always scheming up something. However, this time he's also slightly out of his elements, and not quite sure what he wants. Maybe in the 3rd movie, we will get to know why. Devy Jones might be just the most impressive villain coming out of the movies in the last few years. The ending, with Jack returning to his fearless self and walking into the mouth of Kraken and the return of Barbossa, is absolutely jaw dropping.That said, I walked out of the theater feeling entertained but slightly disappointed. There are too many actions and not enough Jack Sparrow, too many plots and not enough building up of the characters. The film makers are so eager to make sure that this is going to the biggest and the most spectacular ride in Summer and that there will be plenty left for the 3rd installment, they forgot the success of the first POTC is mostly due to unusual and vastly intriguing character(s). Take away Jack Sparrow and there's not much left to watch (OK, there's still Barbossa). Here not only that we have only bits and pieces of Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth suddenly becomes attracted to Jack, Bootstrap Bill came back from nowhere, and seemly dozens of new characters show up with very little background and introduction. They all seem to be lost in the non-stop actions and a very complicated plot.Hopefully everything will fall into place in the final movie. I will definitely see the movie the 1st open weekend. And Disney better not ruins it for me the magic and the enjoyment that came with the 1st one.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I thought the first film was fairly good. It was entertaining, but nothing that made me yearn for a second one. That being said, I hadn't read a review of this film (and still haven't) and had only heard that it had received mixed reviews. I had tempered expectations going into the theater, but I was certainly open to a good time.A good time was not had. This film was quite simply awful. I have not seen anything in a long time that made me marvel at the fact that it was actually the finished product of a gigantic summer film churned out by a Hollywood Studio. I saw X-Men 3. While that was dreadful, this was eons past X3 in terms of excrement put to celluloid.The plot was akin to a second-grader's class project. There was zero character development and not a single moment in which you thought you were seeing an original thought projected onto the screen. While it is a sequel, at some point the things that happen to the characters should matter, and if something bad happens to a character, the events that have molded him or her to that point should affect the audience somehow. Instead, the tools responsible for this screenplay have events happen without emotionally investing the audience in any way, shape, or form as to the fate of the characters on-screen, simply hoping that writing an event will somehow tug at the heart-strings of the audience without ever having to earn it.I don't know that it is entirely the filmmakers' fault, because it seems that Verbinski & Co. were tied to some P.O.S. script that was churned out in a matter of days to get the cameras rolling, so Disney could bend the movie-goer over and sodomize them while getting paid for it. In the place of an actual story, they were probably told to blow up the film with mind-numbing action sequences and lame special effects.To add insult to injury, the film clocks in at a mere two-and-a-half hours, which for a film with a plot wouldn't bother me in the least, but when you can write out the entire plot of this film in a matter of moments, seeing that paper-thin storyline stretched into 150 minutes is unbearable.I could even make an exception to all of the aforementioned gripes and say that there was something in the film worthwhile if there was one performance from the cast that was mildly amusing. Alas, there is not. The actors all seem to have mailed it in, including Depp, who had a single chuckle-worthy moment as a follow-up to an Oscar-nominated turn in the previous Pirates outing.***********SPOILER ALERT*************** When it comes down to it, all you'll get from this film is an obscenely long prologue to Pirates of the Caribbean 3: The Search for Spock--I mean Jack, because the entire plot of this atrocious piece of refuse is enough to fill a mere introduction to a real story.","26 out of 48 found this helpful.

Normally a young woman of impeccably British cynicism and with barely an iota of emotion, she goes completely to pieces at the sight of Johnny Depp. And Orlando Bloom. Put them both in one movie and she's positively girly. So of course she thinks Pirates of the Caribbean 2; Dead Man's Chest is quite the most wonderful thing since, well, Pirates of the Caribbean 1. And I don't. I'm only giving it 5 stars so she doesn't leave home.Yes Johnny Depp is very nice to look at, (what the hell is he using on his skin? It's just beautiful..) and he is faultless and entertaining again in this his second outing as Captain Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly is lissome and lovely and feisty, and Orlando Bloom is, umm, Orlando Bloom. Sweet, inoffensive, very straight and loyal as Will Turner, and struggling hard not to be completely overwhelmed by Depp. The effects are awesome of course, Bill Nighy is excellent, Naomie Harris is good value, Tom Hollander does ""prissy"" so well etc etc.This is an ""Oh look there's"" movie, as in ""Oh look, there's thingy, wasn't he in......er you know, that TV thing, and oh look there's what's his name.."" You get the idea? But this movie is half an hour too long, way, way too complicated and not as good as the first one, which I thoroughly enjoyed, mostly for its complete honesty. Yes, it was cheesy, but it was high class cheese. Hand-made farm organic Stilton. This is Kraft cheese-food slices. And it's bordering on the cynical, in its efforts to milk every last drop of interest out of the audience. And I'm afraid it lost my interest way before the end. Trilogies rarely work for me, although I'm sure the bankers love them. The only trilogy I've ever seen where part 3 was as good as part 1 is The Lord of the Rings. Somehow I doubt that Pirates 3 will be up to the standard of The Return of the King. Tell me, have they fired every film and story editor in Hollywood? Truly there were at least four places in the last third of the movie where I reached for my handbag thinking ""Well that must be it,"" but no, it dragged on into another scene. And another. And another. More is NOT better. Sometimes less is better. This film could have lost at least 20 minutes, maybe thirty, and it would have been a far better movie for it. We would still have loved Johnny Depp, we would still have gasped at all the clever CGI stuff, we would still have put our hands in our wallets and gone to see part 3. In fact, I'm less inclined to see part 3 after sitting through 150 minutes of this one with my legs crossed. It's ironic that cinema owners love these super sized blockbusters because they fill the cash registers with money from pop corn stuffing and soda slurping kids, then the movie-going experience is ruined because every few minutes after the first hour and a half, someone gets up and clambers all over you to get to the bathroom. They should sell incontinence pants in the foyer, not sodas.I'm not the first person to note that the current tendency for movies to go on and on and on and.... is just way too much. King Kong, Superman Returns, X Men 3. All way too long (although the latter was worth sitting through just to see Hugh Jackman finally take his shirt off.) Enough already!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first Pirates replaced Superman the Movie as my favorite movie of all time. I loved the script, the banter, the clever lines, the cinematography, everything. It was a perfect movie. So this Pirates had a huge uphill battle and it failed pretty convincingly.So what made Jack Sparrow such an interesting character in the first movie? After all he was a ""bad guy"", a pirate; yet we rooted for him. Will Turner summed it up when he proclaims Jack as a ""good man"" (what Jack called Will's father, Bootstrap). In the first movie Jack risks everything to save Elizabeth. He rescues Will. So he is worthy of redemption at the end, and that's why we root for him. In the new movie Jack is much more the scoundrel and less the hero. That is a HUGE error. How can we root for a villain? The first movie was so beautifully choreographed. Dark scene (literally  night), then bright scene and back and forth. New movie  mostly Dark Scenes. First movie had many great lines. Second time Jack shows up in front of Barbosa and Barbosa exclaims ""impossible"". Jack corrects him with ""improbable"". Just an example of a terrific line. Very few of these in the new movie. Will and Elizabeth were very good in the new movie.Music was great, special effects were excellent although some were hard to see in the darkness.I give this movie a 6 but then add a point because is is a MUST SEE movie. Afterall, it is the highest (by far) single day grossing movie of all time.So the movie gets a 7.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But after seeing the trailers for this one I thought that this one had a lot of potential to be better than the first one. So I just had to go out and watch this one.So. What is it about? Well. Davy Jones wants Jack to pay of his debt. So Jones goes hunting for Jack. And Jack goes avoiding him and tries, in his own evil way, to avoid him and find a way to get out of his arms forever. And all that, in that setting of beauty, fun and pirate laughter.Good stuff. Several factors better than the first one.

Johnny Depp, in my opinion, will soon be considered the greatest actor to have ever lived and in his greatest role as the camp Captain Jack Sparrow he didn't let us down. The narrative was brilliant, the graphics were fantastic and I would advise that everyone sees it  the film seems to appeal to all ages. The only disappointment was the inclusion of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom whose soporific acting continued, something which seems to coincide with the whole tradition of being Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. I heard it said that Keira Knightley demanded that she was in a fight scene; I'm surprised the director gave way to her - it seemed rather out of character.Apart from the minor hic-up of two very poor actors, the film was brilliant and the cold Bill Nighy, starring as Davey Jones, was a sensation in his own right. It has many story lines overlapping and I'm sure everyone can at least relate or enjoy one of them. So far this year, for me, this is the must-see movie! n.b.

After the original pirates, I wasn't sure if a sequel could stay as clever and offbeat, but Dean Man's Chest delivers on nearly every front! Yes, it's great to see Johnny Depp's bizarre creation, Jack Sparrow, again, and this time to peer into his mind. The original film never really took a close look at the character, who returns this time with motivation, complexity, and (perhaps) genuine conflicting emotions. This installment also takes care of Orlando Bloom, whose character is given much more of a chance to be both leading man and action hero. Only Keira Knightley is given the short shrift, giving a great performance but only having a few scenes that really give her a chance to do anything with her character.The special effects are as spectacular as it gets in this jaded age of CGI, and the fight sequences are intense and energetic. But what I loved the most about this movie was how wonderfully weird and demented it is. I won't give anything away, but just from the trailer you can already see Jack's eye makeup, a duel on a rolling mill wheel, and a villain with an octopus for a head, all much fresher and more demented than anything you usually find in Hollywood outside of the realm of Tim Burton. I had no idea Disney did things like that! This movie definitely lacks the strong, uncontrived storyline of its predecessor, clumsily maneuvering a number of contrivances to get the story rolling. The resulting plot is more a travelogue than anything, but fun nevertheless. It also picks up speed toward the end, and, for a film that sets itself up for the next installment, still works pretty well as standalone fare.Anyway, this movie, like the first, is first and foremost an exercise in camp and offbeat swashbucklery, which it delivers beautifully. Be warned that there are frequent references to the original film, many of them clever, others quite predictable. Still, as an extension of the original world and characters of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie excels takes the cake, and in terms of blockbuster entertainment, there's nothing fresher or better under the sun.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Appearances of characters we knew from the first film gave the story a familiarity and continuity I hadn't anticipated, and yet the film stands well on its own with lots of characters that have ""history"" with Jack Sparrow - that guy sure gets around!

So wide was the disparity between fx and writing that he seemed to need to spread one thickly and one far too thinly.The movie rambles along nicely enough for the first hour and 20 minutes, very much in the vein of the first, tightly directed, plot well built, some decent jokes and neat ""in"" jokes to keep fans intrigued. What follows though is comparatively very dark.Without entering into the arena of spoilerdom; the plot line goes off on an elongated wander apparently intended to ignite interest in the third installment, but actually in serious danger of extinguishing interest. We see some very tired devices attempting to twist the plot, but in truth far more suited to a bad episode of ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"". Sexual intrigue which isn't intriguing, wholly unbelievable character reversal and re-reversals, the re-introduction of an unnecessary character and a lame attempt to draw on the audience's emotions by the elimination of another.Verbinski also seems unduly obsessed by the use of paranormal characters to add wow. He fails almost completely. What actually occurs is that we become almost ""effects weary"" by the continued use of jaded devices which are not original the first time they appear in this movie, never mind that they are rolled out time and time again. It feels like one is being beaten over the head with them. The first movie benefited greatly from the occasional displays of the ""curse"". No such subtlety exists here.Taken in isolation, this movie could be pronounced an entertaining spectacle, but perhaps Disney has created a rod for their back by attempting to recreate the magic and the excellence of the first twice more.This story cannot stand by itself, much as the second Matrix was a meaningless ramble without the third. That series remains a flawed tale, we can only hope that Pirates finds it's touch on the third outing. After such an excellent start it would be a dreadful waste of excellent talent for if the third were nearly as unsatisfying as this disappointing follow-up.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Already dominating the box office, Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest is a almost a lock to end up in the top three of the all time box office charts, with some already imagining it might even sink Titanic.Well, to start off with, let me say that Pirates 2 is not a titanic flop in any way. If you've been afraid the last few months that this movie will end up being cast aside like The Matrix Reloaded, then rest easy, the film is good.The film has improved in more ways than one. As enjoyable as The Curse of the Black Pearl was, there were many instances where due to no fault of the crew, the film visually fell short because of it's lack of size (in money and in space). The skeleton people looked as best they could, and the waters as dreadful as humanly possible (with a tinge of realization that it's a set, not a real... boat). Dead Man's Chest does away with all visual doubt. The Black Pearl in it's full glory carries a menace of its own, equalled only by The Flying Dutchman, ship of the villain Davy Jones, made out of oysters and seashells.The tentacle man Davy JonesSo the story goes that Davy Jones wants Jack Sparrow to pay up his debt, which is (to no surprise) his soul. So the double crossing, triple crossing, quadruple crossing plot unfolds with Sparrow, Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann, Ex-commodore Norrington, and other familiar foes. The plot twists in the film surprises well, and the film in it's own right carries substantial weight and food for thought for us viewers to chew on till the finale. It's no secret that Pirates 2 ends on a cliffhanger note, which I believe many will not enjoy. But that's life :PHowever, the interesting storyline also is perhaps the greatest weakness of the film. The many prominent plot points are used as ""excuses"" to set up unnecessary chase, swordchopping, swashbuckling, and squimy twitching, scenes.Jack Sparrow exceeds expectations, if only marginally, and caused my belly to swell, thanks to all the laughter. The sideline story of the aboriginies is easily the highlight of the film because of the level of creativity, which mind you, required minimal computer graphics. The human element, that's what they would call it. Speaking of computer graphics, as great as all the sets and costumes were, and the by and large innovating animation of the seashell baddies, the giant octopus, known as the Kraken, supposedly the biggest visual highlight of the film... turned out to be quite a bore. Won't say more, other than, well, it's a giant squid la.Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom gave par performances, riding on the film's other great qualities. Davy Jones amused and delighted me with his twitches and his nostalgia, but fails to inject fear into my blood. Most of the supporting cast were supporting enough, with none rising above the tide to steer the Black Pearl into greatness.I love you. You love me. Scriptwriters don't let us marry. Darn them.And oh yes, Hans Zimmer didn't fare much better than his apprentice from the first film, cos the music was one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. I've always admired/defended Zimmer scores to be purposeful, highly functional, and when necessary, glorious, even if dull notes needed playing, but Pirates was only existent at best, and a nuisance most of the time.All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is deserving of it's record breaking blockbuster status, and as startling as the film is visually, it fails to deliver a consistent pace and balance of adrenaline and thought. Hats of to Johnny Depp, Jack Sparrow, who has single handedly carried this film on his back, but the prominence of his contributing is leading me to wonder if his presence will burn out with the next film.Then again, Chow Yun Fatt is in the next one.Savvy?And I've been saving this line for the last: Johnny Depp should win an Oscar for his role as Jack Sparrow.

"9","/10","Keyword: FUN and ENTERTAINING!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1418786/?ref_=tt_urv","ferdianwijaya","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11259302/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2006","My best friend had told me that this movie was very entertaining, and his word was proved well after I finished from watching it.It was all about another adventure of the crazy-but-lovable trio, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and this time they were facing someone (or something) far more dangerous than Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It was none other than Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who wanted Jack's soul as payment for his debt.I must say this movie totally blew me off with laughter and excitement. It was so silly in a fun way and made 2.5-hours worth watching until I didn't realize it ended. Depp's acting was superb and I don't think other actors could replace him. It does looks like Depp and Sparrow is one person all this time. Another actor that surprised me was Bill Nighy who played as Davy Jones. Behind his tentacles you can still saw his crazy acting and that was amazing.Although the movie was good and entertaining, it took awhile for me at the beginning of the movie to make the connection between the first one (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  2003) with this one. I have to admit that I forgot some details from the 1st Pirates and yet I need to focus on details in the 2nd Pirates. It was minor though and your memory could easily got refreshed as the movie flows. As for the story, the 1st Pirates had richer story than the sequel, but the sequel had more fun and entertaining scenes, or I would rather say silly and entertaining, which it will make you excited. Anyways, this movie will surely surprised you, especially at the end.In summary, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was one of the great summer movies that worth watching. You may watch the 1st one before the sequel to enjoy this movie better, but that's not a must. Oh, I just want to give you a hint (not a spoiler). If you want, please stay on your seat until the end credit title finished. You will see a scene there, which was made for another laugh only, similar to what they have in Cars.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sad to say, I am rating on the lower end of a 7.So much repetition and too much time taken up with repetition. This is one of the few times I will say a movie was too long. But it is because of so much ""same ol', same ol'"". And I am not saying it the same ol' stuff from other movies but the same ol' stuff from the first movie.Jack Sparrow is still entertaining and so is his soul, Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom does everything right. He well deserves his own swashbuckling lead part. Keira's character is a nice ornament that I wouldn't throw out with the rum. But for the other characters, none held any intrigue for me. Don't get me wrong, they fit in but they had nothing spectacular going for them.I think the very best part of the movie was one long action scene that played out some of the best choreographed action I have ever seen. This includes the best 3-party face off since ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". AND this one far exceeds that face off.You should see the movie if you liked the first, but be ready for a very rocky boat ride. Too much dialogue, too little good action, too much ""filler"" action, too many old faces, not enough of anything new and way too long. This movie could have been done in 90 minutes or so - and probably should have. Enjoy it, but don't expect anything except for a lot of makeup. Oh and that reminds me, there is one very interesting make-up scene but not enjoyable as it reminded of a last ditch effort to mix it up just for the sake of mixing it up(sorry, but no spoilers here).I hope the end of the trilogy comes from the heart and not the pocket book as this one obviously did.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main characters were lousy: Johnny Depp was just average, Keira Knightley's character was loathsome, especially towards the end of the film, Orlando Bloom was the most likable, and most heroic...The movie's sole redeeming features were the unbelievable FX. Davy Jones' crew and himself were over the top and badass, but the film's main monster was kind of a letdown. The film was also too damn long, with some scenes growing monotonous even with crazy crap going on. Man, I was disappointed with this flick; all I wanted to do was be entertained, and I ended up hating Keira Knightley, and Jack Sparrow for that matter. Maybe the next one will give a little rehash on Sparrow's life, and possibly redeem the lackluster screen time he had in this FX laden, FX carrying, letdown. Did I mention the Fx were great?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you had glamour the first time around, it has to be MORE glamorous. The suspense must be MORE suspenseful, the gore gorier, the flash flashier...well, you get the picture.With the track record of such gems as INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR TREK 2: THE WRATH OF KHAN, I was hoping that the creative crew behind the first PIRATES would bear all of these in mind, and join them in their glorious achievements, instead of coming up with something as downright awful as, say, SPEED 2. I needn't have worried.The magic is definitely back, and DEAD MAN'S CHEST is probably the best sequel you will see all year. If MORE is what you've been craving, you'll have a full belly before this one is even half-over! No time is wasted jumping right into where BLACK PEARL left off. A morose Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) thinks she's been left at the altar by fiancée Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), but such is not the case. Soon she, Will and even her father, Gov. Weatherbee Swann (Jonathan Pryce) will all be arrested for aiding and abetting one Capt. Jack Sparrow in Part One. But there's more treachery afoot here than even a pirate could dream up. Certain ""agents"" representing the East India Trading Company want possession of Jack's mystic compass. The compass is the key to finding yet another key...the one that opens up that object of fabled myth, Davy Jones' locker. And anyone who can grab what's inside the locker can ultimately control the Seven Seas.And that's just going into what THEY want. Jack Sparrow wants the key to the locker to escape a fate far worse than death...an eternity of servitude as one of Jones' crustacean-encrusted crew, on board the hellish ghost ship The Flying Dutchman, to fulfill a debt that Jack never repaid. (BIG surprise.) So yes, MORE story is only the tip of the iceberg here. Bloom and Knightley as the prettiest characters in the cast have much more to do, but they also go through more changes. A lot of their naiveté has gone since their last misadventures with Sparrow, and a lot more will disappear before the movie's end. It's rather refreshing to see that even the ""good guys"" here can have some conflicted moral dilemmas to work through.And yes, dear Jack. What was shocking before has now become normal, even almost endearing, as this swashbuckling stew of Keith Richards, Pepe le Pew and maybe even a little Prince thrown in for extra flavor, slashes and sashays his way from one predicament to the next with a boozy, blustery bonhomie.Not to be outdone is Bill Nighy as the fearsome Captain Jones, who projects both melancholy and menace through some of the ookiest CGI layers since Andy Serkis got behind Gollum. You won't see a more frightening or fascinating villain this summer. And new addition Naomie Harris (28 DAYS LATER) as the eerie swamp witch Tia Dalma, sinks her teeth into the pivotal role like it was a seven-course gourmet meal. She HAS to come back for Part Three!I so want to go over how great each returning cast member and character was, but I'll let you plumb the depths of those surprises and pleasures yourself. Gore Verbinski, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and Jerry Bruckheimer will be happy to know that their sequel definitely goes into the Hall of Fame with the other heavy hitters, (and that's before you even take into account the dizzying box-office returns.) It does run a little long at over two hours, but for pure entertainment, you won't want to miss this one. And if what you're already getting wasn't enough, wait until you get a gander at the gasp-inducing ending. Not since EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or the first KILL BILL has there been a climax that has you climbing the walls and yelling ""NOOOO! What happens NEXT???"" See ya in about two years, when they answer THAT question...","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""Dead Man's Chest"" starts out great but somewhere near the end it loses steam and becomes ultimately disappointing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414564/?ref_=tt_urv","ScottDMenzel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1722042/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2006","In the sequel to the 2003 hit, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny ""The Man"" Depp) is being haunted by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a ghost pirate who wants Jack's soul unless Jack can get him 100 souls in exchange for his own. To make matters worse both Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must join Jack's voyage in order to steal Jack's compass for Commodore Norrington in exchange for their lives. A decent however disappointing sequel ensues Right off the bat, I am going to state that I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp. He is my favorite actor and I think he is great at every role he plays. I also really enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film which was a great and unique summer blockbuster that I personally own on DVD. With that being said, I have been looking forward to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" for many months now and when I finally saw it on opening day, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.Its hard to say what went wrong with ""Dead Man's Chest"" because I have talked to several people about the film before writing this review including my girlfriend and some of my friends at work and no one hated the film, but just felt disappointed by it. From what I gathered people found this movie disappointing for two reasons which I will address as my review continues below.Personally, I found the first 2/3 of the film to be every bit as good as the original film however when the film begins to show Davy Jones as a major threat, is where I feel the film goes down hill. The problem with the film at this point is that it begins to go special effects happy and shows this huge battle involving an octopus and every person who I asked about the film said this scene never seemed to end. The scene in my opinion reminded me a lot of the 3rd Matrix film, ""Matrix Revolutions"" which as we all know wasn't as good as we hoped. The scene I am referring to is the battle of Zion in ""Matrix Revolutions"" because that scene never seemed to end and neither did the scene in ""Dead Man's Chest"" where Jack Sparrow and the gang were battling the octopus. This is the first main problem and if this scene was cut down to say 10 minutes it would have worked quite well however it was overlong and became repetitive and boring.The second problem is the ending which basically without giving anything away leaves the audience unsatisfied and makes the entire second film seem like a marketing scheme in order to see the 3rd film. Personally even though the ending upset me to no end and left me wanting more, I know for a fact I will be in the theater when the 3rd one opens next year because I am curious to find out what happens. But this may not work for anyone because when everyone saw the 2nd Matrix film and was disappointed, the 3rd one was very poorly attended at the theater. I hope this doesn't happen with Pirates like it did with the Matrix but who knows. All the director Gore Verbinski had to do was create an ending that didn't seem like a tie-in ending and he could have literally made millions happy.Other then those two things I really can't say there was anything else wrong with the film. I still loved Captain Jack Sparrow and as I previously stated I thought that most of the film was great up until the last 40 minutes or so which just seemed so drawn out and repetitive. Seeing the fact that I really loved the first film and I am a big fan of Johnny Depp I was expecting a great sequel and although the sequel wasn't horrible or unwatchable by any means, it just didn't live up to the greatness of the first film. The first film is probably a solid 8 out of 10 maybe a 9 if you want to give it credit for being a solid summer blockbuster however ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very weak 7 because the film just seems to never end and when it does end it just leaves the audience feeling cheated.I will recommend this film because I think it was a decent sequel however be forewarned that it does not live up to the hype nor the first film. I am crossing my fingers for the 3rd one and hoping that the final installment will be outstanding and blow the other two films out of the water (no pun intended). Go see ""Dead Man's Chest"" for Capitan Jack because he is still without a doubt the best part of the film and is part of all the best scenes in this decent however disappointing sequel.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a 7 out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So, the movie in summation; Two thumbs down, $8.50 wasted, two hours wasted, and bombed expectations! It seemed as though they didn't make an attempt to create any irony during the whole film.

R.L Stevenson Swishbuckling Johnny Depp as pirate captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reprises a role that in its maiden voyage looked like a great vehicle for Depp to show his many mugging and voice talents. Now he is a caricature of himself endlessly repeating the ticks that once tocked.The pirates are looking for too many treasures, gold and human, so the film ends up being a stew of concepts looking for a rest. Thank goodness for easy-to-look-at Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, a damsel hopelessly caught between her need to save virtuous fiancé Will Turner and her passion for the reprobate Sparrow. The special effects are the same old quick cuts and malleable cosmetics, crafting a crafty Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with moving worms on his face and a kraken with tentacles worthy of Jules Verne but far more believable. Depp is the Errol Flynn of our time but with much deeper talent and narrower taste in women (Vanessa Paradis as a wife is enough for any man in a lifetime).I have little else to say. The original Pirates of the Caribbean was an original and Depp a most creative Sparrow. The second time around it's more of the same, not a stretch or a necessity for an actor of Depp's considerable talent. As for Orlando Bloom, a sizable paycheck for no challenge is a bit like a pirate finding a chest of goldhe doesn't deserve it, but it still gets the girls and the audience.","17 out of 72 found this helpful.

It's a total shot of adrenaline.They've provided stellar special effects, acting, and all around entertainment equally for men and women and have done a wonderful job building for the next one to be released in 2007 (thank goodness we knew that before seeing the movie, because I carefully paid attention to all the clues there might be hidden in this one which were building for the next one). Yes, they have done everything in this movie with something for everyone. They even sophisticatedly poked fun at the first Pirates Black Pearle in a few places.A couple of days later, I watched a History Channel presentation of ""True Caribbean Pirates"" which profiled some of the better known historical Caribbean/African/Etc. pirates of the era and have an even higher regard for the research and writing that Ted and Terry have done for Dead Man's Chest.Both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's characters have matured quite a bit in this movie and they command their own piece of it. Their characters face all kinds of ""real"" obstacles and are still dancing around each other in a wonderfully optimistic way.What can I say about Jack Sparrow, uhhh I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow; he is a brilliant mixture of daring, brave, chicken, sexy, careful, ohhh I could go on and on.

More is better, and yet more is even more better. Unfortunately, the action-packed plot-heavy movies don't leave enough room for the characters.While I enjoyed the light adventurous atmosphere of ""The curse"", ""Dead man's chest"" with all it's frantic tempo felt like a big mess. Plot moves at relentless speed never pausing to take a breath, one action scene follows another but surprisingly instead of taking me into its grip and not letting go it resulted in boredom. Sure I laughed at some jokes and enjoyed the action here and there but mostly I felt like I'm watching a rushed imitation of something cool. The whole experience was like eating a re-heated gourmet meal - all the right ingredients are there yet it doesn't taste quite the same, and you want to enjoy it but find yourself in constant desire to spit out the chewy cold bits. OK, getting a bit carried away with food metaphors there, but you catch my drift.Perhaps the thing I really didn't like is how ""Pirates 2"" more often misses then it hits the mark. Take the fruit ke-bob bit for example. Funny? Yes, but when Wile E. Coyote does it, for Johnny Depp it is quite embarrassing. Or how about the fact that the monster can sink a ship in a millisecond when only the extras are on board, yet conveniently takes a much more leisurely pace when our heroes happen to sail on it. Twice, for that matter. Or what the hell was with all that hatcheting and murdering? All the sword fights are basically bloodless yet prisoners freely get their throats cut and butchered up with axes? Am I the only one seeing something wrong with that picture? Or the small fact that the movie is not in any way self standing, but basically provides a convenient set-up for Pirates 3. Want to see how it turns out? Pay up, chum! They didn't even try to put up any kind of closure, you only have a weak twist (heavily advertised before the premiere so hardly a twist at all), a mid-scene cut and yay here go the credits. Cheap, cheap gimmick.Anyway, I cannot say I didn't have fun with this flick, but remembering how overjoyed I was with the first one the sequel just left me with a ""eh"" feeling. Not bad, but hardly deserving it's current reputation.6/10 - Disney, be thankful you got Depp, without him this would hardly be a 3-.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightley) marriage is cancelled when the two, along with Norrington (Jack Davenport) are arrested and set to hang because of their involvement in Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) escape. The arrests seem to be a scheming plan of new character Cutler Beckett (Tom Hallander) who offers Will and Elizabeth a pardon if Will sets out to find Jack and return with his compass. Jack, meanwhile sailing the high seas, has received some disturbing news from beyond the sea-grave; he has to pay his debt to Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy) who turned Jack into captain of the black pearl 13 years ago in exchange for his soul. Will Turner gets caught up in Jack's predicament, as does Elizabeth who is hot on the duo's trail, having escaped from prison.This sequel has received mixed reviews; and it seems there is no middle ground when it comes to audience opinion of 'Dean Man's Chest'  you either love it, or you hate it. I loved it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than the first film, but it was a satisfying sequel that left me anxious for the third and final installment. The CGI effects are phenomenal, Johnny Depp is (as always) an absolute delight to watch and the film really does very nicely set-up the storyline for the third sequel 'At World's End' (2007).'Dead Man's Chest' is notably darker than the 'Curse of the Black Pearl'  there's more horror, gross-out moments and violence  it isn't over the top, the darkness actually adds a mature angle to the film, and makes it stand out from the original. Where 'Curse of the Black Pearl' was decidedly family-friendly, 'Dead Man's Chest' is aiming for an older demographic.There weren't as many laughs in this film as there were in the original, and there are less quotable lines  understandably the best laugh out loud moments come from Johnny Depp, who is able to once again reveal the depths of his talent and show what an able comedian he is. Depp has particularly impressive command over physical comedy (as was evident in 'Curse of the Black Peal', but is absolutely fantastic in 'Dead Man's Chest'). Though they both really rose to fame because of 'Curse of the Black Pearl', Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom (especially Bloom) are no match for Johnny Depp who is the real power-house of the franchise. The writers clearly understand what an iconic character Jack Sparrow has become, with his own cult following and fandom; thus certain story lines are added to satisfy the throngs of Sparrow fans (like the tension between Jack and Elizabeth) and Johnny is given ample opportunity to give the audience everything they loved about Jack in the original, ten times over in the sequel. Which is great  Johnny Depp is responsible for making these films what they are. All in all a very satisfying sequel  not as great as the original, but plenty of Jack Sparrow screen time, a darker angle and fantastic lead-up to the final installment make this a very enjoyable film.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It has its share of laughs, romance and convincing CGI. It's a charming piece, a charming Pirate movie.Sadly, the lines above are about the only good points about this unnecessary sequel. It seems the rush to bring it to theaters resulted in a 150 min ""preview-from-hell"" that, although amusing at times, gets repetitive and incomprehensible very early in the game.It's very clear that there's no real storyline. All we get is another dumb McGuffin device (whoa, a BOX) and a collection of set pieces that barely relate to each other. There's no sense of purpose, no notion of continuity or consequence. Like a David Lynch pic - in a bad way.Gore Verbinski is a very talented guy. If Pirates is even watchable, that is a testament to his skill as a director. It looks and sounds amazing; Verbinki always picks the best shots. We can see he was trying very hard to turn this mess into a great movie. Kudos for him.Surprisingly enough, this time Depp was way off in his Keith Richards impersonation. Of course it's funny but soon enough we get bored of Orlando Bloom (aka ""the hero"") and eventually expect more from Jack Sparrow. We never get it. He seems uncomfortable having to repeat the same old tricks in the sequel. As for the rest of the cast, they do the best they can but there's no escaping a poorly written script.In the end, Pirates II is just another example of a franchise gone bad, much like The Matrix Reloaded before it. Today we know that the only reason Reloaded made so much money was that it had the momentum of the first one, not that the Wachowski brothers had found some new and improved way of hypnotizing an audience. I bet the third one will not do as well.So, for those brave enough, go see it and enjoy the special effects in a big screen with good Dolby or DTS sound. It's worth 10 dollars - and you might even have some laughs added as a bonus. However, expect nothing else or disappointment will ensue.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Too many plot lines, too many characters, however interesting they may be, too many story lines. My main problem with this movie is the length. 150 minutes is a long time for any movie, but especially one of this nature. This has huge entertainment value, in other words people come to see this movie for fun. It loses much of that due to some slow parts during the movie. Possible I need to watch the first movie again to get into the spirit. However the effects of Davy Jones and his crew are impressive.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I will not be looking forward to #3 coming out to the theater, I will wait for release on DVD. This movie had the same kind of humor and action as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" however, it becomes entangled in a lot of emotional grief that never comes to an end.

I was going to a 10:00 showing Friday Night, got there an hour early and the line was about three yards from the door. Before we got seated, it was out the door. And a group of six white-haired ladies cut in front of us in the line. It would have been funny if it weren't so incredibly rude.The movie itself was quite amazing, the makeup was frightening the special effects were awesome but we didn't expect any less. Even though the advertisements proclaim that Captain Jack is back, everyone else gets a lot more character development in this film, especially Will, Elizabeth, and Norrington-who looks much better without a white wig. Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg, and Kevin McNally all return to their roles, which have been greatly expanded.New characters appear including the shockingly horrible Davy Jones, and Bootstrap Bill Turner. And the Kracken, which I won't ruin by telling you about it.There's much more slapstick, which I highly enjoyed, to this one and everyone gets to participate. I warn you now, the ending is a HUGE cliffhanger.Overall, it was a wonderful film and highly enjoyable, and while it is two and a half hours long, it doesn't feel that way, because you never get bored.

This movie opens up the unanswered questions from the first, ie, how did he become the drunken pirate, where/how did he get the Black Pearl etc etc. It gives a great deal of anticipation for the third movie in the series.

I am a huge Johnny Depp fan as well as a huge PotC fan, but its sequel fell extremely short of meeting my expectations. Here are the pros, and unfortunately, more cons:Pro: Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow Con: He's not as original and his character seems a little dragged out. At times he can be difficult to understand as wellPro: Amazing Special Effects- Davy Jones' crew & the Kraken Con: Feels a lot like the first one, cursed ship, crew and captainPro: Keira Knightley Con: She's dressed up as a boy for nearly the entire movieSadly, more cons overshadow the pros in this sequelOther cons: -it's a true sequel, nothing new, and grew weaker then the first -Orlando Bloom can not act, he reminds me of a Keanu Reeves with a swaggering English accent (minus the fact he's saving a girl, not the world) -it fully relies on the fact that there will be a 3rd movie, unlike the first PotC (which was it's own movie overall), Pirates 2 abruptly ends without a real conclusion, just a lead on to number 3-the plot is poorly played out and drags on for nearly three hours-Johnny Depp has a lot less screen time than Pirates 1Overall, I was extremely disappointed in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and really hoped it would be at least as good as the first one. But leave it to Hollywood to keep the whole tradition of 'sequels never surpassing the originals' to its utmost meaning.Visuals: 9/10 Music: 8/10 Story: 6/10 Acting: 7/10 Flow: 5/10Overall: 7/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was looking forward to this sequel. It proved to be an adequate sequel in that it connected the first movie to a (yet unreleased) third, but that is about all. Don't get me wrong: I liked many things about this movie: the special effects were great, the diversity of the pirates was enhanced (I particularly liked the hammerhead guy), and the line between good and evil was blurred, which is a good thing in a pirate movie.The main shortcoming of this movie is that it has only two talented actors: Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy (Davey Jones). The rest give a bland, forgettable performance that does not even rise to the level of a caricature. Bloom and Knightley seem to have the chemistry of Bill and Hillary Clinton: during the fighting scene she doesn't seem to care her fiancé is in danger and doesn't come to his aid. It's each one for himself in this movie, be they engaged to be married, good friends or longtime shipmates. There is no camaraderie, there is no love, and there is no loyalty.The fighting scenes are good at times, silly at others (the watermill wheel sequence is a good example), and the plot line is very thin indeed. I got to hand it to the director, though: no one has ever had more pirates featured in a pirate movie: with the exception of a few British soldiers and some cannibals, every one in this movie is a pirate. Even those who didn't start out as pirates become so before the end credits role. Oddly enough none of them are ever seen robbing merchant ships or innocent civilians, but occupy all of their time pursuing hidden treasure chests and Jamaican-accented witches who know how to find them.But overall, I can't say I felt like asking for my money back. It was good entertainment for $9, and I will give the third installment a try. Who knows? They might introduce non-pirate characters and have Jack Sparrow and the Kraken live happily ever after (there must be SOME chemistry, Verbinski!).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even the name annoys the hell out of me. If it's on TV, it's a mini series, if it's on the big screen it's a saga!Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Pirates of the Caribbean. The second part is less funny and intriguing, has a lot of special effects, and the characters transform dramatically in order to make the link to the third part. Of course, just reediting the first part wouldn't have been good either. I guess what really bothered me is that this film cannot be taken separately from the first and (apparently) from the third. It's just the middle of something bigger and you can't truly enjoy it for itself. They went the Matrix way: the first film nice and interesting, then a two part second part which they name 2 and 3, just for kicks and which you can't really separate from each other.But it was also a good film. Johhny Depp does wonders once again, even if he lost that charming wavy way of standing. The evil spooks are not even more spooky and the human and mollusk look payed off. It look great. Keira Knightley... I really made efforts to like her. She even seemed sexy when she first rose to stardom, but for whatever reason I just can't stand the woman now. Orlando Bloom is co-starring. I can't put it any other way, he is there just for filling up space. He could have had a better and more complex role. I loved Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, captain of the mollusk pirates.I just have to say something about Naomie Harris. She is HOT! The cute Jamaican accent thing and the fine, yet complex movements of lips make her look terribly sexy. She plays a minor role, yet she does it in style.Bottom line: it's a nice continuation. Could have been better and it's more than a sequel. But since it is a fun movie to begin with, you will probably have fun either way.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The second time around, my hopes where much higher for this movie, yet unfortunately they were unfulfilled. Most of the humor of the movie was just run-offs from the last movie, beating the ""rum"" running gag to death. They seemed to spend all their time with special effects instead of investing it into making an easy to follow plot. The swash-buckling feel the first ""Pirates"" left you with seemed to be absent from this movie. Instead, you were just wondering how much longer was left in the movie.There were bright points to this movie, such as Jack Davenport as Norrington. Johnny Depp will not disappoint his legion of teeny-bopper fans that fell in love with him in the first ""Pirates"" though, it may make some more die hard Johnny fans disappointed to see him play the same character once again.Some are calling this the new age's ""Empire Strikes Back,"" but I think a closer association would be to ""Phantom Menace.""

Did they need to make a sequel though?!...Probably not buts its all about the $$$$$$$. The first movie did amazing numbers at the Box Office and DMC seems to be doing much of the same and BETTER.The problem with Dead Man's Chest compared to its predecessor is that its not a lot different and if anything its a wee bit inferior. Its become a little self indulgent in regards to Johnny Depp's character and has just become the CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW SHOW.The other characters in the movie do not develop any further from the first. The Villain is played wonderfully by Bill Nighly but is no match to Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa in Black Pearl, The plots not as quirky and is possibly a little complicated for the target audience. The CGI is spectacular but over-used and the running time is TOO LONG by about 30 minutes.Overall its a good effort for a sequel and I hope that the 3rd in the trilogy will continue this trend, but we will wait in see.6/10, Entertaining and enjoyable but a bit too long and inferior to the wonderful gem which is the first movie, Pirate's of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Good, but it's no Black Pearl...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1411855/?ref_=tt_urv","dunasmelly","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1638853/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2006","I must say I'm quite torn in regards to my feelings on this movie, and I'll explain why. The movie has equally good and bad points, and although the good outweighs the bad, the film as a whole feels quite odd. On the one hand the movie had a lot to live up to, the first movie was great. Great characters, great action set pieces, great villains, and great humor. So dead mans chest, like all blockbuster sequels had to try and out-do everything about the first film and in the end, that is it's greatest weakness. It feels like a popcorn movie in parts, but too often it is way too serious. It's entertaining when the action hits, but again, for a popcorn movie, it's too frigging long.Most of the cast from the first film returns and they are just as good this time around (except when they double dip on jokes which usually gets more of a sigh than a laugh). Jack Sparrow is funny as always, but it's getting harder for the character to carry the film, since there isn't much more to him than there was in the first. Normally I wouldn't mind with a popcorn movie but a lot of scenes in this one are darker, and his character is a tad too silly to fit in to them. Will Turner gets the most interesting story, and Elizabeth Swan gets, well the background really.As for the villains, they are possibly the movies greatest downfall. Davey Jones is not an intimidating character, and his crew of sea creature folk have little or no character. Full props to Bill Nighy for creating an interesting character out of nothing, but in the end he simply doesn't live up to the charm and menace that Geoffory rush brought to the first movie. The real villain of the piece is the Krakken and once that thing gets going, you know sh*t is going to hit the fan.The movie as a whole isn't all that bad, it's certainly better than most blockbuster flicks, and would work a lot better on it's own but following on from the first film it's just a slight let down. It could easily lose the first half hour as it's really forgettable. There's a side story involving, well I wont give it away but you'll know when you see it that it's really not interesting in the least. The general feel of the film also feels too broken up, there really isn't a proper flow to any of the proceedings and often, the story just feels like a mixture of cool ideas, but without one story to tie them all together properly.The movie does have high points, scenes which really make it worth seeing, but it's a case of too little, too late as they mostly occur much later in the movie. These include the 3 way sword fight on a giant rolling wheel, the Krakken scene, and the rather hilarious chase for the titular chest. Special note must also go to the special effects which are, simply put, the most believable CG shots ever put on film. The CG characters that reside on the Flying Dutchman (Davey Jones ship) and Davey Jones himself are so believable, you wont even find yourself thinking they aren't real.So, in the end, it's a fun ride (more so in the second half) with all the great character returning from the first, only hampered by slightly weak villains, a ridiculously long run-time, and a weaker story. The action is fun on a bun, and the twist at the end certainly brought a smile to my face. I can only hope the third film is slightly better and more fun.3.5 out of 5","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first movie was excellent and had really smart jokes. In the second all the jokes are falling down stairs, falling down into a grave, falling here and falling there. There are some funny bits though in the movie that give you a good laugh.When the men of Davy Jones roam around in the forest it reminded me more of Power Rangers than Pirates of the Caribbean. The movie relied too much on the special effects and didn't look like it cared too much if it looked good or not. A little same like Superman Returns (2006).The plot is interesting though, but the way it was made didn't make any sense. Appears that some people from the first movie didn't die although they ought have.My biggest disappointment was the end, that the movie didn't have a clear ending. You have to see the third movie to finish the second. It would have been better that either this was a clear continuation of the first film, or that they would all three independent. But this is only my opinion.Still, the Dead Mans Chest is a worthy movie to go and see.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's a franchise based on a ride at a theme park, so you do know what you'll be getting when you enter into the film, which is a story that is less palatable as the action set pieces and sequences. In fact, I'd say I found this sequel to be on par with the first, with maybe a couple of very nice touches with two of the sequences. And, of course, there's Johnny Depp who is like both the magician and the rabbit that's getting pulled out of the hat- you don't know what's up his sleeve, but his mannerisms and facial expressions are also so obvious and over-the-top. He's created one of the more endearingly nutty and more often than not laugh-out-loud funny characters in a Hollywood blockbuster with this and the previous film, and if for nothing else he's worth seeing.But getting back to the pros and cons of the film. To those who've written (and I've read a few comments) saying this is the next Empire Strikes Back have, forgive me for saying, a screw-loose. Dead Man's Chest happens to not be too unique in one aspect- it pumps up so much contrivance in the plot turns that one is asked not to take it too seriously, but to keep it all in mind at the same time. And it's also, like with the previous Pirates entry, overlong as well in trying to fit in every note, this time mostly for the sake of part 3 coming up (with a 'wtf' twist at the very end). But, of course, most will not go expecting that logical or coherent a story, the bang-for-your buck sequences are where it's at, not to mention visual effects, and the filmmakers don't lack too much of that. The two favorites for me is the sort of wild goose chase over the island where Sparrow and Bloom and the others run from a group of crazed natives, and the big climax involving Davy Jones's huge monster against the black pearl.These scenes, with a few minor specks here and there, do make the film entertaining enough for a good 'popcorn' movie sit through once over. And there are even a couple of very funny lines or physical gags that might be worth mentioning to friends once the lights go up (and Davy Jones and his crew are a nice step-up from the skeletons in the last film). It's shame then that the same good in what can come with shallow, big-budget flicks like these don't carry the same creds with a good enough story. 6.5/10","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

To me this was a lot Morey action and a lot less yammering. but then again the audience, if they saw the first film, didn't need much explanation. This was just pure dumb fun. It took me on a ride, just for the ride's sake. And that's why, where there might be holes in the plot, it really didn't matter to me. The look of the film is great, and I really liked the locations. Okay, bla, bla, bla , and some more bla, as I fill these ten lines. What can I say. See it. Turn off your mind and have fun, 'cuz that what this film is all about. Okay some more fill, blah, bla, blah, and furthermore, less we forget. Also the Davey Jones himself was a really technological feat. Where the prosthetic ended and the computer graphics began was seamless. ILM might actually win an Oscar for FX this year,...after a very long drought. And those of you into detail Jack sparrow's costume has changed from the last film to this.

This film just didn't deliver as the first did. The comedy was much more sharp and edgy in the first film and it just wasn't as clever as the first. The biggest disappointment though was Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He was turned into a bumbling fool where as in the first go around he was a good pirate and captain though a drunk and ever so slightly burnt out. In this he's suddenly gone daft with no explanation, it was irksome. My favorite character from the series has always been Will Turner and he has been given a far meatier role this time on an expedition to save Keira Knightley's Elizabeth from imprisonment. He has to team up with Jack to get the Dead Man's Chest from Davy Jones. I must say that the special effects in this film were nothing short of astonishing! Davy Jones, a big octopussy lookin' thing, looked absolutely real and life-like constantly moving with excellent fluidity, yet you could still tell that it was Bill Nighy. His eyes had such a penetrative presence, he really worked for me, he was vile yet likable. With the poor script that was lacking flare, it was the special effects and fantastic action sequences that saved the film. In my favorite scene, three of the film's heroes are having a tri sword battle in what appears to be a giant hamster wheel rolling across the island's forest landscape. It was scenes like this that allow me to nudge my star ratting to a *** out of four. Where the first half was lacking, including a ridiculous and unnecessary island scene reminiscent of King Kong, the last half more than made up for in terrific imagery and entertaining action sequences. So over all I give it a very mild recommendation.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

We see it often where they produce a good and successful film (the Matrix, Back to the future, etc) and then decide to create a double bill sequel. The trouble is that they don't really have enough story to make a second and third film so they have to pad out the script with dull and irrelevant scenes.Sadly Pirates 2 falls inside this category. Sections of the film are outstanding with Mr Depp's character of Captain Jack Sparrow probably rating as my favourite comedy character I have seen in an film. It also illustrates what a superb and versatile actor he is. Other sections of the film you just cant wait for them to be over because they just don't add anything to the story and arn't very interesting to watch.Sadly the film is let down badly by a script that has just been stretched too thinly over the two sequels and the result is a film that starts well but looses its pace and becomes a little dull. My least favourite part of these ""two parter sequels"" is that we have no ending. The film just sort of stops with out any conclusion.In conclusion I would describe this as half a film who's quality will depend heavily on how the third film concludes the story. It is worth a watch but I would save it for the half price ticket day at the cinema or perhaps even a video rental just before the third comes out. It is just not a patch on the first film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was so much fun. This second movie had more funny moments, but also still was able to make me cry and jump in my seat from getting scared! The acting was superb. I cannot believe that two and a half hours could go by so fast. It was amazing. We took our 9 year old son and there was a few times that he ""hid his face"" but mostly it was okay. Some of the scenes were intense and so I do not know if the movie would be okay for most fourth graders. But he laughed along with the rest of us and thoroughly enjoyed it. Over all I highly recommend this movie for those who love the swashbuckling fun, the laughter, the adventure, and of course the romantic slant of the Pirates movies. It was so enjoyable, I will probably go see it at least once again in theaters. The only other movie that I have gone back to the theater for was Spiderman 2!

That wouldn't really matter if this was a great film.... but in all honestly it isn't.Firstly lets take the best thing from the original - Johnny Depp's performance. in ""The Black Pearl"" it was fantastic, funny and curious. but in ""Dead mans Chest"" the film studio have really milked it too much. Every scene has Jack Sparrow stumbling/mumbling/cracking one liners. (some of which are very good) after maybe 45 minutes we have seen good ol' Jack being chased several times doing his silly lean backwards run...... it gets really repetitive and loses its humor. i felt this about his part for most of the movie.Other characters just don't develop at all apart from Norrington, Orlando Bloom still can't act and Keira Knightly is a weak leading lady. both of their characters have no new story to tell, apart from Will turners dad turning up..... but we learn nothing new about this side story at all. so what was the purpose of his dad being in this film?The comic relief characters of pintel and ragetti are brilliant, as they were in the first adventure. There are other things to enjoy here too, The SFX, the set design and score are all excellent.I think i was expecting a lot more and maybe the 3rd installment will deliver a lot of answers and tie the stories in together better. as a popcorn movie ""Dead Mans Chest"" works OK, but i left the theater with nothing much to think about other than a character from the first film reappearing at the finale, but even this twist felt like it was put in because ""you have to have a twist"".I am looking forward to the 3rd part, but i feel let down (not matrix reloaded style) enough to not get overly excited by it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There is plenty of great stunt work and even better plenty of plot with just the right balance of CGI. The actor who plays Davy Jones who was also in Underworld and Love Actually is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors. He carries a certain amount of charm and subtlety which one can see even through all the tentacles of the squid effects. Depp returns with all the great mannerisms that made Captain Jack Sparrow a household name. True he didn't exactly come out of left field as he did with the first movie, but one just has to love this character if not merely for the fact you never know what he will do next. Good supporting roles by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly although I would like to have seen Knightly's character be a bit more brash. Oh well perhaps in the third installment.

This is a really good movie and I loved every minute of it. The funny moments were hilarious and there were times when there were tears in my eyes for laughing. In fact i would say 'Dead Man's chest' was better even that the first and although this movie was a continuation of the first it could stand on it's own. If there were any negatives to the movie i was say that Keira was it. I don't know why but I just cannot stand her. I also hated the end because of the 'to be continued.....'. I really dislike when movies end like that because I am a very impatient person. Overall the script was great, the acting was outstanding and the sets and locations were beautiful. Without a doubt I will be the first in queue to see the 3rd movie whenever it comes out.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Peral was pretty good. This I had high hopes for, but found myself suspecting Dead Man's Chest was going to become a marketing vehicle for a whole new theme park of pirate rides.This isn't to say there aren't some good bits, I rather think Bill Nighy as Davy Jones delivers a delectable amount of menace, but Bill's an outstanding actor (see him in Love Actually or Girl in the Cafe.) The rest really fit into B movies in terms of credibility. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, however, is unconvincing as a pirate captain. He strikes me as a twenty-something in charge of a ship of 40 somethings. (Might this be a parallel to the way today's businesses are managed?) Perhaps Tim Curry could have reprised his Long John Silver from the Muppet caper.All in all, the viewer should know by now that PotC is another in a series of films with the second and third installments largely done at the same time to form a serial. There will be the culmination (one hopes) of this buccaneering (without ever actually looting one Spanish galleon of a single piece of eight) featuring Keith Richards as somebody'd father in 2007. Cheers to the juniour pirates who enjoy this sort of thing. I think I'll pass next summer and see something else.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

On the one hand, it was funnier, more energetic, more dark and scary and even more fun to watch than the first. On the other hand, right now I would absolutely KILL to see the next film (and happily fork out ten times the movie ticket price), as the ending of this one leaves things rather unresolved.The most amazing feat of the film is how it manages to tread over old jokes and still make them funny. Gods, human sacrifices, cannibals, slapstick, dialogue... Fortunately, we were spared translation jokes, but everything else you could possibly expect in a pirate movie was in it. There were also some fantastic jokes that felt fresh (especially during one big action sequence in the middle, the slapstick went into overdrive, and even Keira Knightley got laughs out of the audience) The acting, for the most part, was brilliant, too. Keira Knightley being the honourable exception, delivering her lines courtesy of a British accent rather than any acting effort.I'll definitely buy the DVD and recommend the film to all my friends - but with the warning that it makes the wait for part 3 almost too unbearable... 9/10 - one point being deducted for the cliffhanger ending.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A chest that contains the power to control the most frightening ship on the sea - The Flying Dutchman - and with that comes the ability to control the most terrifying creature in the sea - The Kraken. But Jack isn't the only one after The Dead Man's Chest.Following in suit with the original this is another highly entertaining summer movie, albeit with flaws. Though it does contain that same tongue-in-cheek tone throughout with Johnny Depp reprising what may become his most famous movie character.However, the mega-budget, expansive sets, multi-million dollar effects, rousing action and feel-good adventure spirit far surpass desired character development. Traditional and expansive adventure yarns like 'The Illiad' or 'Aeneid' and even films like 'Indiana Jones' had a good plot woven into them - it accompanied the escapist action and and spectacular feel. Here there is a plot, simple and quite predictable, but it's there all right. However, the effects are so expansive that the balance is teetering on total overkill. So much time and imagination must have gone into those effects and they are quite spectacular, but with the bare-bones plot they are really the driving force of the movie. Lucky for the viewer that at least the characters are likable so you can manage to forgive the lack of plot and enjoy the film, but it is definitely not as memorable or thoroughly enjoyable as the first entry. --- 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is in my opinion several steps behind his performance in the original(Which I consider to be one of the best ever) He is still quite good though. Keira Knightley has proved that she is a very good actress with two Oscar worthy performances in Bend it Like Beckham and Pride and Prejudice. Here she seems lost, and gives one of the films worst performances. Orlando Bloom surprised me with his best performance since his underrated turn in Black Hawk Down(Something he has failed to get even close to living up to) He actually gives a performance that could be considered decent. Bill Nighy should get Oscar consideration(If eligible) for his brilliant portrayal of Davy Jones. He is rather perfect. Tom Hollinder is extremely disappointing in the other villain roll, he was so good in both Pride and Prejudice and Gosford Park, and here is simply embarrassing. In all a extremely good adventure film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This time around, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and company are after Davy Jones'locker, which contains an artifact that will keep Sparrow from falling into the clutches of the undead Davy Jones. Davy Jones, who sports an octopus for a head, pilots the Flying Dutchman, which among other neat tricks can dive underwater. Along the way, Sparrow and friends (including a rather haggard-looking Orlando Bloom and the ever-luscious Keira Knightley) have various adventures including falling into the hands of cannibals. One eye-popping sequence involves a duel that takes place on a runaway water wheel! Now for the not-so-good news: P2 is considerably darker than the first movie. The (bloodless) death count is so high, PIRATES 2 truly is not suitable for small children. Also, the movie ends like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, a cliffhanger that compels us to catch the third and final installment in 2007. Other than some impressive visual effects involving the gruesome Davy Jones crew and a rather large sea monster, there's not much new here. Many of the gags are lifted from the first movie. Plus the film is easily a half-hour too long. If you are a fan, by all means see it. Just keep the kiddies away.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I NEVER expected to like the film, and from a distance, it was not a film I would have ever gone to see on my own. What I wonderful surprise it was that the first Pirates film was so fantastic! The whole story for Curse of the Black Pearl was excellent. It had a clear beginning, middle, and end. Also, potentially ambiguous areas in the story were quickly and identified and cleared up (I.E. Jack's prior involvement with Barbossa, the whole bit about the gold and the curse, Will and Elizabeth's background and friendship, and so on). This level of attention to detail made the rather long film entertaining and enjoyable for the full 2 ½ hours. Even the open-ended nature of the conclusion of POTC 1 left viewers wanting more. Dead Man's Chest however, fell VERY short in many ways. I have probably seen the first film 100 times, and I watched it before I went to see POTC 2. Thank goodness I did or I would have been totally lost! Frankly, a viewer of Dead Man's Chest would NEED to watch the first film in order to ""get"" all the repetitive jokes in POTC 2 since they all refer to events that occurred in Curse of the Black Pearl. Not only is the first 20 minutes of Dead Man's Chest a massive ball of confusion, but also after the first 20-30 minutes you want to say, ""wait a minute, could you rewind that?"" There is no clear clarification on the actual involvement/purpose of the new Lord Beckett. There is no explanation about Captain Jack and the disbanded members of the old (but familiar) crew. The sudden introduction of a Voodoo woman (Tia Dalma) speaks with such a thick accent that her words are barely discernible. Commodore Norrington's role is very different, and although Jack Davenport's acting is superb in POTC 2, we really don't know what happened to him or how he ended up where he did. Even the entire plot surrounding Captain Jack, Bootstrap Bill, and Davy Jones is blurred by spotty explanations and additional elements that just add to the confusion. One would think that with everything going on in POTC 2 that Elizabeth and Will would be fully included. It was disappointing to find that Elizabeth's character is flighty and exhibits little structure, and other than a few sword fights, Will is lost in the crowd. A very positive aspect of the film is that Captain Jack Sparrow is just as wonderful and swaggering as ever. However, witty and clever elements in the first Pirates flick become cheesy and cliché in Dead Man's Chest, which left this viewer thinking that the director ran out of ideas or was rushed. The ending of Dead Man's Chest was captivating enough to make viewers ""want"" to know what happens next, but everything that happened prior to the ending was choppy at best with little more than spectacular graphics to hold the film together.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Was it worth the wait? In a lot of ways, yes it was. The movie delivers in many facets: humor, action, adventure, and of course, detestable villains. The actors stay consistent in their roles, never catering to over-the-top caricatures of their characters.However, the movie suffers from overall plot structure. The first ludicrous twenty minutes is completely useless to the story (except if you consider the end at the credits). Dead Man's Chest feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back in plot, but that can be forgiven. What make me maddest about the plot though is the fact that it has to be told in two parts. This makes the first movie stand alone and the next two linked together as one self-contained story. Pirates is no longer a trilogy, but two films, much like a preceding ""trilogy"" like The Matrix.Dead Man's Chest also guises itself as a rehash of the first movie. Many jokes are reused and the enemies are very similar (invincible). However, this one is different in the fact that it is more of a cartoon. Jack and Will should have died in a few places, but I guess they were suffering from ""Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible III Syndrome"" (it's impossible to die!). Alas, these last trifles are minor and the movie is very entertaining for what it's worth. And it does make me excited for the third movie coming out in 2007. Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an enjoyable sequel, even if it is shadowed by the greatness of its predecessor somewhat.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I've read as much Joseph Campbell as the next nerd, but it gets tedious seeing the same romantic triangles played out over and over, and the same dynamic between the cursed and hideously-deformed villain who was turned to evil because he was unsuccessful in romance set against a young and pure-hearted protagonist.I swear to high heaven, if Will and Elizabeth turn out to be brother and sister in Pirates III, I will flipping throw my large Diet Pepsi--ice, straw, soda, and all--at the screen. That will most seriously displease me.Which brings me to my second complaint, namely--watching Keira Knightly vacillate between Will and Jack is rendered absurd by the existence of what a lamer Orlando Bloom is in one of three key heroic (?) roles. OK, OK...put the man in platform shoes, give him blond hair extensions and blue contacts, and he's otherworldly beautiful. But he. Can't. Act. His way out of a paper bag, let alone off a ship full of cursed sailors who look like walking, talking, barnacle-encrusted bits of flotsam and jetsam. He's just not got the juice, and you put him next to Depp on screen and it's clear that any reasonably piratical lass would opt for a dirty weekend and a trip around the bay with Captain Jack as opposed to a lifetime of boredom with nice-guy Will.But wait, there are glimmers of hope. Our plucky, lightsabre (I mean sword!)-wielding heroine turns out to have a rather machiavellian side to her, before plunging into regret for her actions. Will showed promising signs of jealousy and violence, before reverting to Luke Skywalker-esquire mastery of his anger. And Captain Sparrow seems to me to be ripe for the picking in whatever passes for a piratical version of a male midlife crisis, though Mr. Rochester-like, he's bound to be permanently maimed, first, before he's rendered fit for a lifetime of being press-ganged by anything in petticoats. The best dynamic in this movie wasn't (sadly) between the nominal villains and the heroes, it was between two of the heroes; Jack tells Elizabeth she will be tempted to try being truly self-serving because she is curious and will want to know what it feels like, and Elizabeth very pertly (because we're talking Keira here whose jaw is the only thing more aggressive and jutting than the toothily-armed prow of the Flying Dutchman in this movie) tells him that he will in turn wish to sample the joys of being a decent fellow doing the right thing, and enjoying the respect and admiration which comes from being a good guy and hero.I could almost hear Han and Leia bantering, or Rick from Casablanca saying ""I stick my neck out for no one"".Long live the antihero, and may he always get the girl, or at least stride off into the sunset with Claude Raines.OK, here's what you really need to know. The pacing is not good in this installment. There are parts which are just too loud and go on too long. The waterwheel sword fight, however, is all it's cracked up to be, and then some. The script neglects to give its most charming characters any memorable lines. Davy Jones is well-voiced, and beautifully (which is to say disgustingly) CGI-rendered, as is the Krakken. I thought I'd crave sushi after this film, but found I did not. I was pleased as punch to see Jack Davenport's Commander Norrington character return, mostly because I had girlfriends who dug him in the first movie. He has a heckuva voice, and looks better with a tan and some dirt all over him.And there will always be an England so long as there are superb British Character actors like Tom Hollander to add an elegant and silky menace to cardboard villain roles, and McKenzie Crooks to be alternately Gareth from The Office (BBC) and the austensible (sic) comic relief other than Johnny Depp in this one. And.............SPOILERS I'm thinking the real beating heart of the Davy Jones character is that music box. They didn't try to turn him into the Phantom of the Opera for nothing, IMO.Just please, please, PLEASE do not let his long-lost love be the unintelligible voodoo priestess. I not only have a large diet soda to hurl, but also popcorn.Jerry Bruckheimer, you HAVE been warned.And I don't appreciate you left the dog on that island to be eaten.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is quite gripping at times, as we see Captain Jack Sparrow in even more peril, Johnny Depp is still in great form the second time around, his grace and charm in the role is always the highlight for me. Will and Elizabeth's relationship is poorly developed here, which was the biggest let down for me. It was established very well in Curse of the Black Pearl, but we really do not get anything new about their life together here, it is the very same as the predecessor. As well as that, the plot is simply not as good, we are given so much in this movie, but it is lacking the magic of the first, despite all that is presented, I still finished it not feeling stimulated. It may be a let down, but Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is still fun ride, worth the watch if you are a fan of the original, or if you are looking for a good action or adventure. Captain Jack Sparrow heads on a journey with his crew to find Davy Jones' heart in order to avoid becoming his slave. He soon discovers he has many rivals looking for the very same thing.Best Performance: Johnny Depp","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Dead Man's Chest revives hope in the movie industry as it delivers action, humor, horror, a fun story, and more Sparrow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1416442/?ref_=tt_urv","diac228","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3387663/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2006","Who's up for another ghost tale involving the seven seas, pirates, the undead, and the forever cursed? Dead Man's Chest is a heavily hyped sequel to the original surprise hit that restarted the average moviegoer's love for swashbuckling adventures and also introduced us to Jack Sparrow, one of the coolest movie characters to come out in recent years. Most of the cast from the original came back, and this time the franchise was going to branch out into a trilogy. While the film clocks in at a long 150 minutes, Dead Man's Chest has so much going for it that you will not mind, even if the pacing is not that of the typical popcorn flick.The pace of the original Pirates movie starts out slow and then speeds up especially towards the end. Dead Man's Chest does this same thing, except its even slower in the beginning, and then really picks up in the middle and ends with you gasping for air after all the disbelief and unbelievable moments shown on the big screen. The story this time centers on Jack Sparrow as suddenly his time to end his debt with Davy Jones, a very-feared and legendary captain of an evil ghost ship, is running out. With this dilemma at hand, he once again brings Will and Elizabeth into the adventure, as well as some familiar faces from the original. In the meantime, conspiracies and mysterious circumstances are brewing up in Elizabeth and Will's homeland. The plot is much more constricted and tangled up the second time around, even though the writers were able to add some seemingly unnecessary scenes for some comic relief.Johnny Depp seems to be born to play the part of Jack Sparrow, because he does it so well, perhaps too well for his own good. He is just as funny, just as entertaining, and just as cruel and unusual in the second installment, as we get to see much more of him. Knightley and Bloom were not half-bad as the love struck victims of the entire ordeal, and while Bill Nighy is most certainly no Geoffrey Rush, not even close, he does a good job as the fearful captain. Unlike the average summer flick, the acting was decent, not Oscar-worthy (besides Depp), but passable. When the actors are not talking, its all the action-packed sequences and spectacular special effects that fill the screen. Without a doubt, some of the best-looking effects in recent years are displayed here, ranging from the disgusting-looking pirates, the Flying Dutchman itself, and the sea monster that gets summoned a few times. Davy Jones looks menacing and the staff does a great job in not overdoing the special effects and CGI.While the action may have been lacking in the beginning, its everywhere in the second half of the movie. The first half was the introduction to the conflict and to the enemies in the movie; the second half is everyone going at it, whether it's a ship against a monster, or a three-way fight, or pirates against an invincible crew of damned souls, or a silly humorous fight amongst a bunch of drunk pirates and convicts. While Dead Man's Chest is not for mindless action fans, the second half has so much carnage and swordplay and unbelievable moments that it will make the average fanatic drool with anticipation for the next big moment. The three-way fight hands-down is one of the best action sequences you will ever see, guaranteed. Starting with just three people going at it, it escalates into amazing lengths, as Gore Verbinski stretches a simple fight into a complex turn of events with fun twists and never-ending fights between the hero of the story, the main character, and a third person who will not be mentioned in this review.Like the original, Dead Man's Chest has a bit of everything: plot twists, action, humor, horror, drama, romance, and a lot of fantasy. The best part is, it has plenty of nods to the original movie, and plenty of references to the ride as well, and even to older literature. Has a bit of everything for the average viewer to enjoy, and while it is most certainly the most violent thing to garnish the Walt Disney name, it still has that bit of Disney magic that has made us return to Disney films time and time again. It is a ride through the open seas as you get to see it all, beautiful women, evil villains, colorful characters, huge monsters, treasure, and more stories to keep your thirst for nicely-woven sea tales quenched until next year, when we see the grand finale. Oh, the ending to this movie was grand as well, with a few pleasant surprises.Bottom Line: Not as fresh as the original, but just as entertaining, as it has a bit of everything, and more Jack Sparrow. Action, comedy, drama, and a hint of horror, Dead Man's Chest is in every way a good film, as it stacks up well to the original, and to action sequels in the past. This is quickly gaining potential in becoming the best action franchise since the masterpiece Indiana Jones movies of the 1980s. Recommend to everyone, and as long as you can put up with the slow pacing, you will not leave the theater disappointed. Dead Man's Chest: More Sparrow, more pirates, more fun, and more reasons to look forward to the 2007 summer movie season.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This being the case, I don't think it would've been possible for me not to have liked Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest at all. However, I was hoping to come away from the movie just as excited about it, as I was after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl, but I wasn't. The sequel fell short of the originality and nonstop excitement we got in the first.The biggest disappointment in Dead Man's Chest is the character of Davy Jones played by Bill Nighy. It seems ironic that Jack Sparrow's character was a sure sign of genius and ingenuity from the creative mind of Johnny Depp, and is what made Pirates of the Caribbean the phenomenon it is today. Yet in the sequel, someone came up with a repulsive looking Davy Jones who is half man/half sea creature. He had the characteristics of cross-between a Star Wars and Lord of the Rings monster with eyes befitting a mass murderer from some horror flick. I found it difficult to look at the screen when there were close-ups of him, which was often. Bootstrap Bill's character, played by Stellan Skarsgård wasn't as bad, but unimpressive as well. He looked like some kind of freak in a costume someone would throw together on Halloween night.Other than a few characters missing, the cast from Curse of Black Pearl was in Dead Man's Chest and it was enjoyable to see an ensemble of the old delightfully original and charismatic characters again.As for Captain Jack Sparrow, well as can be expected he was the star of the show; however, Depp appeared to play the character with less flamboyance and animation this time around. I wondered if Depp might have enjoyed pretending to be a real-life pirate more in Curse of the Black Pearl than he did in Dead Man's Chest. The thrill of it all might have faded just a bit, which wouldn't be hard to understand considering Johnny Depp's apparent need for unusual, offbeat and eccentric roles.The best part of the Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest is the ending which makes you leave the theater wishing the Part III sequel was playing the next day. There is an unexpected twist that will keep you wondering how it will play out in the sequel.Bottom line... Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it as good as the first? Unfortunately not. Will I see Part III? You bet!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There were swords; muskets; treasure chests; an assortment of characters and palm trees housing monkeys you could clip on at funny angles.""Dead Man's Chest"" essentially covers the plights of two separate lead characters, a good looking clean-cut civilian with an honest trade, in Will Turner (Bloom), and a roguish, smooth-talking pirate in Jack Sparrow (Depp), whom nobody ever seems to truly get along with within the confines of the film yet nevertheless everybody loved within the public domain after his debut in the 2003 original. In the Bermudan town of Port Royal, stronghold it would appear of the British navy some two hundred years ago, and certainly in an alternate universe, Turner and his love, Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) are arrested on grounds of treason for helping a condemned man escape justice. The local governor hatches a plan to let them both go, but only on the grounds that Turner venture forth and bring back a particular compass belonging to Sparrow...Sparrow, meanwhile, is busily making his own escape from a gruesome island prison which seems to be the sort of place that locks prisoners up and forgets about them, an early indication that the film is unafraid of going to some fairly nasty places. He is introduced as a resourceful chap prone to bursts of oddball comedy, playing dead and getting away in one of the many coffins prison employees are tossing away into the sea (something which calls to mind James Bond's escape from behind enemy lines in ""Octopussy"") before rather mercilessly shooting open the casket and wiping out a bird that had followed his vessel out to sea. Not too long after this, he encounters an island occupied by a tribe of cannibals who elevate him to a God-like status - a mere reflection of what the public did to him after Depp's initial performance.As Turner seeks Sparrow's compass, Sparrow himself seeks the key to a certain treasure chest to whit only his compass will guide him. Hot on his heels for mostly unrelated reasons is Davy Jones (Nighy) himself and a crew of un-dead body-horror inclined psychopaths who look to settle a debt with him. And what a crew they are: barnacle and rot-covered fish-like creatures, wavy tentacles and pained expressions, involuntarily vomiting up seawater - disgusting to look at but a technical marvel within the confines of filmic imagery. One of these monsters, played by Stellan Skarsgård, turns out to be Will's father and it is surprising how affecting the scenes are between the two characters as they converse about their respective situations.Broadly speaking, the film attempts to re-enact ""The Good, the Bad & the Ugly"" on water - vast, open swathes of desert become the open seas; horses are traded for boats and six-shooters become cutlasses. The American Civil War is substituted for some kind of battle for naval supremacy between rival factions. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun encouraging the audience to root for Bloom's character to succeed in his mission and save the day so that he may go home and walk off into the sunset with his soul-mate, but that means forcing the audience to go against the character they like the most, which of course is Sparrow, who will meet a grizzly end at the hands of Davy Jones should he fail.This interplay, like with the aforementioned Leone opus, between the varying sides keeps both the energy and interest levels high. It is something which culminates, of sorts, in a standout sequence involving three different characters sword fighting with each other across the beaches and forestry of a desert island; into the ruins of an old church and then on top of the most durable waterwheel in cinematic history. This is then further ramped up when members of Jones' gang turn up looking for something one of the initial three has on their person.""Dead Man's Chest"" is not great art, but it brings a smile to your face - whether that is through two pirates, who used to be un-dead, but are now alive, conversing about mortality, or via the head-spinning yet strangely steadfast logic of Jack Sparrow as he bargains his way out of another sticky situation, is up to you. For me, the film seemed to iron out all the problems I had with the first one, in terms of pacing and why I was supposed to at all care about those on screen, and run with a similarly magnetic approach, the likes of which I can't say I didn't enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't think it was possible that it could outdo The Black Pearl. I was wrong! The entire cast was wonderful! From Jack Sparrow's opening scene to his final scene in this movie, I was on the edge of my seat. Depp has perfected Sparrow. I caught myself giggling and smiling throughout! The action and special effects were beyond belief. I don't know what genre to put this film in: drama, adventure, comedy, romance? It has it all and then some! Seeing these characters again was like meeting old friends. Dead Man's Chest cleverly connects with the Black Pearl through intelligent character development. I will certainly add this film to my home library!","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Quite frankly, considering the film was easily identified with the famous theme park ride, who could blame those initially wrote it off? However, the ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" went on to surprise audiences with its stunning visuals, intriguing story and the introduction of a character so captivating that he single-handedly revolutionized Johnny Depp's career by finally putting him into mainstream public's eye. Considering that makes for one stiff bill, it is easy to understand why ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is such a disappointment.""Dead Man's Chest,"" which opened in theaters Friday, is the 150 minute follow up from where ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" left off. On the wedding day of William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) it is revealed that Will and Elizabeth are to be imprisoned and sentenced to death for their hand in helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) allude being captured at the end of ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" Will is given an opportunity, however, to avoid such a fate by hunting down Captain Sparrow and stealing his compass, which he can then exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom.As it turns out, Sparrow also finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he learns that a deal he made with the spirit of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) has expired and that Jones is coming to collect the agreed debt  Sparrow's soul. This all boils over with another misadventure at sea as Sparrow and company attempt to find a way to avoid an eternity of damnation and servitude to Jones and clear the names of Will and Elizabeth.Unfortunately, the film's plot doesn't pan out as smoothly as its outline would make it seem. Despite having what seems to be an interesting plot, much of the intrigue and mystery that made the original ""Pirates"" so popular gets muddled over to make way for numerous action sequences that lack originality and, to be honest, are downright pointless considering the film's plot. Rather than sticking to the original film's guns, director Gore Verbinski chose to make ""Dead Man's Chest"" action heavy rather than trying to focus on telling a good story.For instance, within the half-hour of the film viewers are whisked away to an entirely ridiculous visit to what can only be described as Cannibal Island, where Will, Sparrow and his crew must escape the man-eating natives. Not only was the entire scene unfunny, but also so childish and stupid that you actually begin to get the feeling that you're watching a kids movie and not a pirate movie that had an opening scene where crows peck out the eyes of prisoners.Possibly even more depressing than the mishandled plot would be in watching a great character in Jack Sparrow get ruined by bad dialogue and confusing side-plots. Sure Depp has some memorable lines that have the zest that the first film was chalked with and he again steals the show with another incredible entrance, but those positives are quickly tarnished as you watch Depp's character head into a new direction. Sparrow now seems more cowardly than dashing; choosing even to flee the Black Pearl while his crewmates fight off a sea monster. Ask yourself this: would the Sparrow from ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" have abandoned the ship he was so passionate about? Considering what he went through just to regain control of it, one could only conclude that the answer would be no.Depp's character also suffers from contradictions made in the first film. Back in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" Will and Elizabeth were willing to stand and die alongside Sparrow because they knew Sparrow was a ""good man."" However, throughout this current adventure an underlying theme between Elizabeth and Sparrow is that Elizabeth is convinced that Sparrow wants to know what its like to be a good person, which is why he is in capable of being completely bad. Now, that would have been an interesting side-plot had they not already concluded that he was a good person in the first film  leaving intelligent viewers wondering whether or not the original film's script was ever consulted before they went ahead and filmed ""Dead Man's Chest.""Its unfortunate, but the newest film in the ""Pirates"" cannon falls short (and sometimes fails completely) in so many ways that it is undeserving of its title. Rather than having another terrific story supported by superb acting and stunning visuals, we're given a bunch of cheap thrills, confusing side-plots, a few zesty one-liners, only one real bright spot in what will be known as the ""giant wheel fight scene,"" and another annoying Hollywood cliffhanger ending that'll leave audiences with a bitter taste in their mouth  much like that of ""Matrix: Reloaded,"" which ironically has a plot that is eerily similar to ""Dead Man's Chest.""Overall, people who can't look past their sentimental attachment to the first film will proclaim the sequel as a success. Unfortunately, the rest of us will know that isn't the case","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I guess it appeals to all, as a Disney made film. Swashbuckling and generally an energetic ball of adventure.Jack Sparrow gets all the best lines..and is great. The romance is fine, as is the pirate comedy. There are a lot of special effects, some of which are a little overdone. For example, the Goonies style pirates of Davy John. However, I think the plot lets this movie down, especially the laborious ending, which actually never ends but is just a precursor to the next film. How do writer's get away with this? It had so much potential and falls flat on its face in the resolution! With years of experience, I am just surprised that experienced writers cannot see where a plot begins to fall apart. I wonder if they are underestimating their audience.In summary, if you enjoyed the style of the first, then no doubt many elements will tickle your fancy... don't be too disappointed with the resolution and ending.

This is a fully and beautifully realized world of myth, magic, and voodoo and happily everyone keeps a straight face as they confront it. If the symbology is a bit too literal at times, well, the sea brings that out in people, particularly in this part of the world of three centuries ago. Where creatures, such as the Kraken, a beast of relentless fury, can be slowed but not stopped. Where the ""heartless"" Davy Jones collides with the Flying Dutchman (a conflation that I believe is a first). And where, despite the rich fantasy, the emotions, conflicts, psychologies are all too real, even in Jack Sparrow (the role Johnny Depp was born to play). He is heading for a terrible fall, as in truth are all the major characters. Elizabeth has come to understand that whatever the degree of her attraction for Jack, the man simply cannot be trusted. His core is hollow, which I suspect Jack himself now realizes and is at the root of his deep problem that he no longer knows what he wants. He knows what he doesn't want, to be sure, yet it is unclear to what degree he can fight back against even that realization. And poor Will Turner, clearly stretched to the limit, is in a situation nearly as bad. Others are also in supreme jeopardy. (One of the great things about this film is the taking of minor characters from the first film, such as Norrington, and putting them head to head against Sparrow and Turner -- and watching them hold their own as they come to grips with their own fate.)In short, there is the possibility for great tragedy here -- if the writers have the courage to follow through (no more rum and cross-dressing jokes, please!) Could we have a Hamlet on the high seas? I believe we could. The elements are there -- but will marketing permit it? It's anyone's guess. Following the analogy of POTC:DMC being the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy, we all know what happened in that case: will a great opportunity be lost as we endure the sea-going equivalent of ""Ewoks?"" Or worse? I am worried. As is well-known, shooting of the third film began before the script was complete, a bad sign. The next installment could go all the way (on the order of ET and Titanic), but it would be foolish to count on it.Still to have come this far is an incredible achievement. To those A-list critics (3:2 against) who either did not watch the movie or could not bring themselves to view the first film -- there's a reason it's called a sequel, guys -- for shame. But as noted, the public, and indeed the world, has spoken. Good luck to all people involved in the production of the concluding film : ""At World's End.""","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Most everyone from the first installment returns as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, arguably doing equal if not better work than in the original) has a debt to pay off to supernatural captain Davy Jones (the always outstanding Bill Nighy) or otherwise be condemned to an eternity of servitude on a ship of lost souls. Of course all this causes the wedding of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley to be crashed and they get thrown back into high stakes adventure in the Caribbean. Director Gore Verbinski's franchise works most because of Depp as he becomes a cross between The Little Tramp, Detective Clouseau, Indiana Jones, James Bond and even Wile E. Coyote. Depp's character is one of the most textured and likable the cinema has ever seen (even though sometimes you don't know whether to love or loathe the guy). State of the art makeup effects, visual effects, editing, cinematography and art direction cover up the fact that the stories in the series are just window dressings to put seemingly every star and role player in breathtakingly action-packed dramatic and comedic sequences. While flawed (like its predecessor), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a wickedly enjoyable summer blockbuster that does admittedly make me look forward to yet another inevitable installation. 4 stars out of 5.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first two movies are going very much like a book series. And whenever you have books or movies that make up a series it is essential that the main characters be endearing or likable. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a colorful character as is his crew, but I don't find much interest at all in William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). In ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" we were getting to know Jack, William, and Elizabeth, and it was creative how they were all tied together. With that aspect now gone the writers have to go a new route to grab the viewers attention. I wasn't that impressed with the route they went in ""Dead Man's Chest"".The adventure and the villains in ""Dead Man's Chest"" are intriguing but this movie failed to bring me to the edge of my seat. Of course they set the movie up for a part three, but I think they need to do something drastic and radical to maintain fanfare.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm going to right my comment in a critical and pleasant manner and not bash the movie just because a flaw is irritating to my mind. But I don't let flaws do that to me, unless it is a completely impassable flaw that ruins everything else.I realize that Dead Man's Chest was a pretty difficult movie to get through for the filmmakers, as for being years since it's predecessor and with no complete script, etc. But how'd they pull it off without completely messing it up too badly is inspiring.For me, the second one lacks some of the style and believability the first one had. Ha-ha, but it's been years since they did the first one, and that's why I think they should have planned a sequel from the very beginning. I mean, you can't just put out a Pirates movie with the most memorable, most treasured and hilarious Pirate, Mr. Jack Sparrow and not plan for a sequel, c'mon! That's where the filmmakers kind of screwed up, in my opinion, they wasn't aware the fact that Jack Sparrow was going to be so memorable and treasured, and will eventually become a legend in years to come that he would be worth a sequel! I'm just glad to see they did a swell job on this one and not a terrible job. The third one will be better than DMC no doubt, but I don't think any will stand up to the standards what made the first one which stood out on it's own without much attentions for a sequel.What gets me is how the second one and third one is back-to-back and the first one is a stand-alone while they are still in the same trilogy collection. Yeah some parts connect, but not fully. But there's just nothing else that can be done as of now. What is done is done, and the third one has already set sail, and I'm looking forward to seeing it! Anyway, before I close this comment off, I would like to lay out some slight flaws that would have made this movie a 8 for me instead of a 7 if they were avoided/fixed. But the rest of that 7% is full of nearly flawless sounds, amazing special effects, some good acting, fun action scenes, a fairly dark, stylish story, etc. I rate it 7 because of the lack of believable acting, sense of humor, and style that the first one did somewhat better on. But DMC beats TCotBP on the action/adventure part, no doubt about that.Bill Nighy who played Davy Jones, in my opinion, was the best actor out of all of them in Dead Man's Chest. Either he was flawless, or his flaws were well covered by the amazing special-effects. Yes, I even think he was better than Johnny as Mr. Jack. I mean, he was more worth the watch as far as acting goes and style. Johnny was only at times unbelievable, only some lines were somewhat lame, eye-rolling like jokes, whatever. But all else he is pretty flawless...don't get me wrong...he was just better in the first one, in my opinion, or flawless mind you. Keira Knightly wasn't too bad in this one, she was probably below Johnny's acting standards, but Orlando however wasn't as believable as he was in the first one, but just by slightly, he's nowhere near impressive but more along the line of just okay. All other actors and actresses were well passable and some were very believable and flawless, then some just didn't stand out at all, but nor were they in a big role.Over all I rate this 7 out of 10. If it weren't for the slight flaws, it would have been an 8. Believe me, I would love to give this an 8, but I went ahead and put my critical thinking to the test. But, no matter what, I enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean better than any film I can think of!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also, as an observation, it seems Keira Knightley was about half as skinny as she was in the first. In the first she was much more healthy, still skinny, but healthy. I personally didn't like her character as much in Dead Man's Chest. The whole "" i love Jack Sparrow"" thing was not very good, and how she fooled him so she could save Will Turner made her seem more evil than just a strong woman.

""Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."" -Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly. ""This sequel is appropriately named, because that's what you'll be staring at for nearly half the movie: dead men's chests."" -Diana Saenger, Reeltalk Movie Reviews. Oh, thank you critics. You make your misguided opinions so much easier to discredit when you think you're being funny. Aside from the obvious smear campaign these critics are trying (and will undoubtedly fail) to pull off, there was nothing about this film that didn't work for me.First thing's first. Did you like the first one? If so, you can proceed to ignoring half of the negative reviews already -- the people who ALSO did not like the first one. Do you like the character of Jack Sparrow? Then ignore the other half, who seem to have a problem understanding that in sequels, characters are expected to return and continuity problems would arise if the actor would change the way he played that character.Truth be told, this IS like a theme ride. But like the first one, it's like the best damn theme ride you ever rode on. The action sequences and special effects were top notch. The CGI didn't bother me so much because it didn't look like CGI. Most impressive was the way they handled Davey Jones. You really can't tell where Bill Nighy's extensive make-up becomes CGI tentacles. It's brilliant. I couldn't help but wonder why all Blockbusters couldn't be like this one. And the swordfighting? Well, don't get me wrong. These are among the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen on film. However, it seems to me someone forgot to buckle their swash. I don't know what that means, but evidently that got to SOMEONE.All the characters are back in pure form and then some. Jack Sparrow now deals with inner turmoil, and if anyone can do that, it's Johnny Depp. Not only that, but he still retains his charm and remains just as likable in this film as he was in its predecessor. Keira Knightley gives one of the best performances of her career (topped only by her performance in Pride & Prejudice). Orlando Bloom's acting has improved as well. New additions to the cast such as Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as another important character (not saying who) also add another layer of excellence to the film.The film's atmosphere is much darker this time around, and I gotta say I freakin' loved it. It was like all the fun of the first film with a sense of impending darkness. In fact, the film opens up on a pretty down note, and by the end, any shred of innocence the series may have had has been shot to oblivion... once again, making me glad they went for the PG-13 rating as opposed to PG.As I said before, the climactic fight scene is one of the greatest fight scenes ever seen on film. This is the kind of stuff that would make Errol Flynn say, ""whoa."" It was a beautifully choreographed triple threat swordfight in the midst of an epic battle, and let me tell ya, THAT was the most fun I've had within the last three summers.Sure, it's a lengthy picture. In this case, that's a good thing. Because in its entire running time, I never got bored. They don't give you a chance to get bored. When they're not fighting, the characters are always enough to keep you going. The story is NOT lacking as the critics will have you believe, it did NOT lose its heart, and it most certainly is NOT guilty of double-dipping. This is the best movie of the summer, and it's not Verbinski's fault, or Depp's fault, or the screenwriters' fault that critics are too thick-headed to realize that.And a note about the ending: not only will you NOT see it coming, but you will most definitely WANT to see the third one. Sure, it's a cliffhanger ending, but I assure you, at the very last line uttered in the film, you will cheer.100%","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Entertaining yes, but not half as good as the first one.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1538432/?ref_=tt_urv","Lent74","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur9086282/?ref_=tt_urv","6 December 2006","Well, of course stakes were high to the sequel of the wonderful and hilarious first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. After watching the second one now, I must say that I am a little disappointed. As always in those blockbusters they try everything to top the previous movie and so they did in this one, CGIwise. The CGI was even more elaborate than in the first movie, the ghost pirates ghastlier, slimier, whatnot. Thing is though, if you do a thing like that, don't forget to add the charme and inventiveness story-wise that made it all worthwhile watching in the first place!Seriously, the kraken was great. The ships and island design was marvellous. Davy Jones and his crew are frightening and creepy, but after some time you get tired of seeing another detail to a pirate-turning-into-sea-creature CGI and wish to have a little more story to hold on to. And that in fact is the biggest let-down of the movie. At times in the movie I was vividly thinking of the first Pirates movie and found myself wishing they had done some things different.The hunt for Davy Jones's chest is nothing more than a repetition of the story of the first movie in a slightly varied form. There's no character development whatsoever for all of the main characters, especially and sadly so, Captain Jack Sparrow. Heck, of course I loved Jack Sparrow in the first movie, but in this movie there's no new side to him whatsoever and even some of the jokes his character pulls off (some of the best in all the movie) only entertain because they refer to the first movie. I wish they had given Johnny Depp and thus Jack Sparrow a little more to do than just repeat the whole routine of the first movie. A wicked love twist, a turning point where he gets to reflect some of his motives of becoming a pirate, whatever... something that would have made him a little less shallow. Yup, the wonderful Jack Sparrow has become a little too flat in this one character-wise and that's my biggest complaint. Calling him a caricature of his own character in the first movie would probably go too far but I guess you know what I mean after watching the movie. God, it's Johnny Depp, give the man something to do and he'll shine so why not try something new here?Orlando Bloom as Will and Keira Knightly as Elisabeth get the plot twists in this one, which is nice to see and gives their characters sort of a more round feeling. I loved that Norrington was back in this one in a very different ""shape"" as in the first movie. And I loved the ending ""surprise entrance"" of one well beloved character no one was expecting to show up. But the cliffhanging itself was a little annoying as the movie was too obviously ending to make you go see the third one. A little more subtlety would have helped here.The movie does entertain, no doubt, and it was great to see the characters back in action. But all in all the first movie had much more to offer, most of all a heart and soul, which somehow was lacking in this movie. Sadly, because you think after making such a wonderful first movie, they would have learned what the audience cares about. Elaborate CGI, great. But the story and characters were what carried the first movie. I hope they remember that when they finish the third Pirates of the Caribbean.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Depp saves this boat from sinking","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1543479/?ref_=tt_urv","dnlcmch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13230370/?ref_=tt_urv","12 December 2006","It's a mere mathematical fact that most Hollywood sequels are languid rehashes of their predecessors, vitalizing in the same exact elements as if they were trying to give audiences the same exact experience they had with the original carbon copy of the story. In the case of ""Dead Man's Chest"", the second entry in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, what can be safely said and done is that a crowd-pleasing character that's in the ranks of Captain Jack Sparrow can do anything he wants whenever he wants and the audience will not squirm in their seats for a second. Without Sparrow and his crazy pirate antics, this sequel would be like rum without alcohol and butter-less summer popcorn.Starting off where the original ended, Dead Man's Chest opens on the wedding day of Elizabeth Swan and William Turner. Yet, their warm day of happiness turns ice-cold once Lord Beckett, a mysterious and rather cold-hearted sort of general, places the two under arrest for their relations with the infamous Jack Sparrow. We soon discover that Beckett is a man who is not interested in either of them, but rather in Sparrow's enigmatic compass, offering Turner a chance at freedom if he hunts down his pirate friend, retrieves the compass, and brings it into his hands. Will automatically accepts the offer and is off on a journey into the open world, in search of the eccentric pirate that can't help but be a magnet to trouble.As it turns out, Jack Sparrow is on the run from the villainous Davy Jones, a man trapped in a monstrous mollusk embodiment. On the verge of literally selling his soul, Sparrow makes a clumsy deal with Jones, offering one hundred souls in exchange for his. Selfishly, Sparrow allows Jones to hold William prisoner, making the young man captive on the demented Flying Dutchman, where he finds himself reunited with his long lost father, Bootstrap Bill.Throughout most of its lengthy running time, the film takes on a sort of ""Empire Strikes Back"" routine, having each of the central characters on their own and with their own amount of isolated screen time as we take the time to notice their own personal struggles and needs. Although this notion doesn't entirely work for every central character, specifically Elizabeth Swan, it does work greatly for the character of Will Turner. Will Turner is like a plain square when compared to his opposite, Jack Sparrow. Yet, the relationship between he and his father adds another dimension to both characters as we see how their rocky relationship turns into an emotional bond once they find themselves in the worst situation imaginable with the wicked Davy Jones. It may be a sort of lukewarm attempt to provide a subtle layer to a not-so-subtle summer blockbuster, yet, it makes the film a much more respectable effort nevertheless. This attempt is also utilized when it comes to the ""redemption"" factor of Jack Sparrow. Will he ever grow out of his selfish wits? And then there's the ""temptation"" factor with Elizabeth Swan. Is Jack Sparrow, the dangerously adventurous wonder, really the right man to fulfill her? The best thing about the original Pirates of the Caribbean was the fact that it was a freshly new adventure with a colorful character (Sparrow) that would prove to be of the most memorable of the decade. It followed that classic analogy of storytelling that parallels that of Star Wars, in which a self-less farm boy sets off on a grand adventure with a selfish pirate in order to save a beautiful princess. These nuances and factors worked terrifically for the film, preventing it from sinking into the mundane abyss of summer popcorn. Does ""Dead Man's Chest"" work on the same level? Not quite. Sure, it's a summer action film; yet, its action curiously lacks the same level of excitement that was built in its predecessor. What saves the film from becoming a languid and lukewarm effort are the colorful characters, specifically the ever comedic Sparrow and the treacherous villain, Davy Jones, who is wonderfully voiced by the criminally underrated Bill Nigh.Nevertheless, consider ""Dead Man's Chest"" to be a grand weekend rental and a movie anyone can have a good time watching with friends and family. Johnny Depp has found himself a role for the ages with Jack Sparrow and aces the character to uncanny potential. With Sparrow on board the ship, you won't have to worry about seat-squirming for a second.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"10","/10","And The Rum is Back!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1419201/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmSchoolWriter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6559193/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2006","I should probably put this out on the table right away: I'm possibly the biggest fan of Pirates of the Caribbean ever. Biggest fan as in: I know all the words by heart and I remember 99% of all the tidbits I've ever picked up. And it shows. End of story. Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, let me get on to reviewing POTC: Dead Man's Chest. I've read several newspaper reviews and most of them say the same thing, that although the critics enjoyed the movie, they found it to be rather rambling and they were irked by the ending (or lack there of). I can see the truth in what they say, but that doesn't mean I necessarily agree with it. Dead Man's Chest rocks. It's 150 minutes of pulse racing, jaw dropping, swashbuckling fun. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:+ Everyone has returned for a second time around on the ride. And I can guarantee you that this wouldn't work without the original cast and crew. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio create another wonderful script for our enjoyment, full of the same enjoyable banter that we had the first time around. Many of the funnier lines are jokes that you will probably only get if you've seen The Curse of The Black Pearl, but that's not a problem in the slightest. {Jack's lines: ""Elizabeth! Hide the rum."" and ""I'm still rooting for you mate""; Elizabeth fainting to get attention; as well as the constant correction that it's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow.} Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer return as director and producer respectfully; so the style is much the same, only a few shades darker. Hans Zimmer's score completely blows me away. It's not all brand new, which helps to link The Curse of the Black Pearl to Dead Man's Chest. The pulse racing music from the sword fights is redone, so that it's the same, but different. There are several scores using the organ, which adds this wonderful spine tingling atmosphere to the movie. A round of applause to whoever designed Davy Jones and his crew. And you thought that undead skeleton pirates were cool. If Dead Man's Chest is not nominated for Best Make-up at the Oscar's, it is a crime. + Captain Jack's back my friends. Johnny Depp delivers once again as the flamboyant, perpetually drunk captain of The Black Pearl. Some people may consider him to be TOO over the top, but I didn't see it that way at all. I doubt if he'll win a second Oscar nomination, but he's wonderful anyways. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner is much more self assured, and far less pathetic this time around. 99% pirate, we're almost there Will. Of our 3 main characters, Elizabeth is the one who's changed the most. She's learned to handle a sword, and she's much more independent. But man is she making the rounds! I have to say that by the end of Dead Man's Chest, I hate her  in the best way possible. Major snaps to Keira Knightley for her brilliant job. Not only does she deliver the most hilarious monologue in the movie, she's also an amazing swords-woman. Another brilliant return is Jack Davenport as the dethroned James Norrington. We encounter Norrington about half way through the movie, and he's no longer the prim sophisticated Commodore. Now he's a drunk, pot head, half out of his mind who's only wish is to regain what he's lost. Even going so far as to sign onto The Black Pearl. Kevin R. McNally's back as Mr. Gibbs and we love him. The gruffest, sweetest pirate around, he's wonderful. But the best performances would probably have to go to two new comers. Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy. Skarsgard delivers as Bootstrap Bill Turner, one of the few crewmen of ""The Flying Dutchman"" who haven't lost their humanity. His performance as Will's father is touching and if you're sentimental like me, parts of it are down right heart breaking. But Bill Nighy steals the show as Davy Jones. He just looks astounding! His range is amazing. He jumps from a cruel captain to a broken hearted romantic in a second. I don't know if he's applicable for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but I really hope he's nominated. + Just like its predecessor, the sword fights in Dead Man's Chest are spine tingling. If you thought that a sword fight in and out of the moonlight was cool, check out this three way sword fight  part of which takes place on a detached water wheel. It gave me chills.I understand why some people may not be completely enthralled by this movie. Like all movies, it is flawed. But they don't detract from the finished project in the slightest. But here they are anyway:And you've probably heard it by now, but I'll repeat it: Dead Man's Chest doesn't really end. It is the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers. Bah humbug. There's the huge shocker, and then the credits roll. So your sitting there, thinking, ""What? It's over? No way. They can't do this! No! I want to see it now!"" But alas, we will have to wait until Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opens. Still the more I think about it, the happier I am about it. It's a ploy to get you to see the third movie, but who cares! It works, while still rocking the house. 10/10","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The best bit of the film was the end credits scrolling up the screen and the realisation that after too long sat in a cinema seat wasting time watching this utter drivel that it was thankfully time to go home.Unfortunately, it's going to be necessary to watch part 3 to see if it can redeem the trilogy by being as good or better than the first film.

It's good to see the actors or actresses enjoying their roles, but that seemed to be mostly the main aspect of this movie. In fact watching this movie was like watching the characters running around a theme part and getting on crazy rides. But that just isn't really enough to engage the audience or make the story interesting or all that entertaining. In fact the main flaws of this movie is the plot, I know the creators are saving it for the 3rd movie but this one just lacked plot. It has one but it mostly revolves around Jack Sparrow and the other characters running around and acting all wacky in the jungle that seem a lot like some cool theme park. Some say the subplots in this are overlong and I sort of agree, but it wasn't really irritating to watch or anything and sort of had it's moments. This one has a bit more action compared to the first movie and I can see why it was a huge hit in box office.

The original Pirates film didn't seem to click with me when I first watched it and I couldn't quite understand the hype around it - however, the more I watched it the more I liked it and I ended up being quite excited about the sequels coming out. Last night as I sat in the cinema, I surrendered myself completely to the film and was completely blown away by how wonderful it was! Here, finally, is a film that has IMAGINATION to back up the special effects. So many movies lately have been about ""hot"" actors and ""special effects"" with very un-imaginative story-lines, very little plot, and bad acting. This film is the complete opposite. Though the actors are in fact considered by many to be ""hot"" (Depp, Knightly, Bloom etc) it isn't the focus point of the film - for example, you watch Kiera Knightly and think ""Wow, she's really stunning"" but you don't really care because you are more interested in what she is doing as a character! The story is Beautifully convoluted, outrageous and over-the-top it is totally refreshing. The many and various twists, and changes in loyalties and objectives by the assortment of characters is so old-fashioned that it just might be avant-guarde and therefore it is genius! At no point in the film can you predict what each character is going to do so everything that does happen takes you completely by surprise. The fighting too is taken to a whole new level - set in almost impossible locations and yet the wonderful imagination of the writers (and most probably a collaboration between the production designers and stunt choreographers) manages to produce breathtaking and hilarious fight scenes that you totally believe! The film is also LOADED with special effects, and yet they are totally justified (which is a point that the big studios seem not to understand these days.) There is a reason for each CG shot, and each special effect that you forget you are watching special effects. But that is also because they are done SO well! you buy into everything you see - nothing makes you think ""boy, that looked fake"". The acting is fairly solid, even from Orlando Bloom who I have never really thought of as a good actor. He is probably the weakest actor in this film but he is much better than in previous work of his. Bill Nighy is one of the most outstanding members of the cast - he plays the new character of Davey Jones and he does it marvelously, albeit he is mostly obscured by tentacles. Naomie Harris, who plays another of the new characters (Tia Dalma) is excellent - so much so that I wanted to see more scenes with her in it. Kiera is solid, as she always is. It isn't her best work but then its not a film that requires her best work - she does exactly what is needed for the film and therefore is totally competent in the role! As for JONNY DEPP...he is talented. Even though he is such a legend, even though he is my idol, I completely forgot I was watching JONNY DEPP...I believed him from start to finish and my admiration for his talent grew even more. His performance was even better than I could have imagined, and if this doesn't get him that illusive Oscar, I don't know what will! (the academy will probably be politically correct and give it to him for the third movie!) Having said all of that, I now want to go and watch it again. Its not Shakespeare (as the saying goes) but for this day and age in movies, it just as well might be! The only reason why I didn't give this 10/10 was because it ended...if I had it my way it would be a never ending movie! Oh, and P.S.: Gore Verbinski, you are a legend mate!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The movie's producers, directors, and actors had to make a film that would stand on its own, as there was no guarantee that it would be as wildly successful as it was. But once that first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, became so well-loved, Disney immediately shifted its focus from creating a great sequel to managing a great franchise. Thus we have a Dead Man's Chest which extends, rather than advances, the story. It is filled with the high-quality graphics, fun characters, and self-effacing humor that we loved about the first, but can hardly be called a ""movie"" in its own right. What actually happened over the course of 2 hours could have been 20 minutes of set-up at the beginning of the real sequel, which will be the final piece of the trilogy: At World's End.The bottom line is that Pirates 1 was a great movie, just as Pirates 3 will be.

(If you consider rotting, undead corpses on a ghost ship merry, that is.) What's less obvious is this movies beating heart, which lies at both the literal and figurative center of the story. Old characters are back, and although some reviewers accuse them of being well, out of character, I didn't notice a great change. Will is still noble, slightly bumbling, deadly-with-a-sword-ready-to die-for-love-and-honor-Turner. Jack is still a drunken scoundrel with a decent streak that often lands him in trouble, and Elizabeth is still torn between being proper and being Elizabeth. If the character have seemed to have lost something, it was probably innocence. And quite frankly,who can blame them after everything they had seen? There is a plot, of sorts. Granted, it won't win a guild award, but it doesn't have to. Like a dime store romance (or a great swashbuckler) the plot(having something to do with an angry squid named Davey and a magical compass)only has to serve as a means of getting our hero(s) into one pickle after another. But it does more than that, giving us more history about the first movie (origin of the Black Pearl, The nature of Jack's broken compass)and moments that surpass the first in impact ( watching Jack come face to face with the Kraken is worth the price of admission) All in all, if your looking for the next ""Citizen Kane"" (or another ""Curse of the Black Pearl) you'll be disappointed. But if your looking for a swashbuckling, arse-kicking sequel, you'll enjoy it from beginning to end.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And so he did. When I saw the sequel yesterday I said to my friends: Depp deserves an Oscar for this wonderful performance! And I do believe it! You should agree that despite all the effects, the story and the funny characters, without Johnyy Depp it would have been just another Hollywood blockbuster. But I certainly do not underestimate the power of Gore Verbinski's production. It will grab you from the beginning and won't let you even in the end, simply because the adventure hardly begins. Now we are waiting for the final of the trilogy, hoping to be even longer than 150 minutes, because lately there are not many movies that can make us both laugh and admire the effects for that long.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This time Jack is on a search for the the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop ""comedy"" and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality it's a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. ""I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on"", said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

From the incredibly amazing action sequences, to superb performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Bill Nighy, to an unpredictable climax, 'Pirates' 2 is a spectacular piece of film-making from Gore Verbinski.The plot is simple enough. Jack Sparrow (Depp) must repay a debt to the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones (Nighy): his soul. Eventually, Jack barters with Jones so that Jack can be spared if he provides 100 souls as his replacement. Meanwhile, back on Port Royal, Elizabeth Swann (Oscar nominee Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) have been arrested for their actions in the first film (aiding the escape of a pirate). Will negotiates a deal with the new ruler of Port Royal, which is to retrieve Jack Sparrow's mysterious compass, in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom. And it appears Mr. Norrington has vanished without a trace since resigning his post months earlier...This movie is full of twists and turns, which do not stop until Gore Verbinski's name appears on the screen. I could tell you them, but that would be nothing short of torture. What stands out most to me is the fantastic writing and direction, because without this, everything short of Johnny Depp's performance are impossible. The action scenes are utterly fantastic, and in terms of 'wow factor', they compare with last year's best visual effects film, King Kong. Incredible sword fights are ripe here, much moreso than in 'Pirates' 1.The acting is nothing short of phenomenal. Johnny Depp is in prime Oscar form, and to say another nomination (or possibly a win) for playing Captain Jack is not only possible, but probable. The way he can make this character his own is unbelievable, but every movement, every line...it all seems like Depp has it premade in his brain. I don't think I've ever seen someone play a character like Jack this well. I actually enjoyed Orlando Bloom's Will Turner this time around, because he didn't mess around. He gets straight to the point, no hesitation. Good acting on Bloom's part. Keira Knightley doesn't have as much screen time as before, but still flourishes with what she's given. She does lose a little bit of fanfare for her 'actions' later in the film, but her performance is well done, and I know this because I couldn't picture anyone else in the role but the young Oscar nominee. I absolutely loved Bill Nighy as the film's villain, Davy Jones. He has this certain presence about him that is in effect BEFORE he appears for the first time. You keep wondering when this fearsome villain will appear, so I will not tell you when he does, for that would ruin the suspense of his appearance. He does an excellent job, despite having little to no face to work with. Another performance I thought was very well done was Stellan Skarsgaard as Boostrap Bill Turner, aka Will's dad. 'Wait, wasn't he dead?' His mysterious survival is explained very early on in the film, and it makes a lot of sense. Skarsgaard does a great job of making the audience feel for him, feel his pain. He and Bloom only share a handful of scenes together, but you can definitely feel the chemistry as father and son between them. All the performances are great, even the creepy one, Naomie Harris (28 Days Later...) as Tia Dalma.Gore Verbinski has constructed an epic masterpiece that is good for everyone above age 9, because there are some scary jumpy moments that made me shudder. The humor you've come to expect is right there, complete with plenty of rum jokes...'why is the rum always gone?'. 'Dead Man's Chest' is one of the best films of recent memory, and surpasses 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' in every aspect comparable. You must see this film, because it's one you'll never forget.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST 10/10 --spy","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","CGI smothers plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1415362/?ref_=tt_urv","koohoolin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6070616/?ref_=tt_urv","9 July 2006","1) I got the very strong impression that Disney was more intent on promoting new additions to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme park ride, rather than articulate an adventure to us. How many more scenes of huge structures containing people, rolling through the jungle, can one endure in a single movie? I say again, ""huge structures CONTAINING PEOPLE, rolling through the jungle""(get ready to ROLL, Disney theme park fans!) The one involving the water wheel was a bit too long, especially following the rolling CAGE in which the pirates had been held captive. One gag depicting a large object, rolling through the jungle, filled with disoriented characters (still not getting it?) per movie is quite enough, please. 2) This is a classic example of CGI effects overwhelming story. There were way too many distracting, living sea creatures, popping out of the bodies of characters who surrounded a speaking actor, for me to keep up with the unfolding story. Many times, an actor would deliver his/her lines in desperation as antennae, eels, tentacles, etc., waved about his or her face, in the background, as well as the foreground. This was fascinating, but distracting. On further reflection, I had the identical feeling of confusion experienced after viewing ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (I was tempted to go see the Riddick turkey again, in the hopes of clearing up the confusion). Sorry, some may find this comparison insulting, but the problem of CGI domination held sway in both of these movies. The single responsive word in my mind as I left both flicks was, ""Wha...?"". 3) As for the voodoo woman in the swamp...what the he** was she saying? Her accent was too thick; authentic, possibly, but too thick, and delivered in a tone which was too soft. What might be more important here? Authentic accent, or successful communication? I simply caught little of what she said, except the part about the jar of dirt, a very weak gag that was just a flash in the pan. 4) Ditto for the squiddy Davey Jones character...just what the he** was HE saying? Under all those fleshy, invertebrate protuberances, his lines were almost impossible to discern. 5) Just as Johnny Depp's character rose out of his throne to address the issue of a larger fire, watch as he seems to suddenly remember to employ the Keith Richards characterization of his body movements. Watch in particular his hastily extended right arm, just as he rises from the throne. It was as if, ""Oops! I almost forgot to move about like Keith Richards! This production is killing me, and another is yet to be wrapped!"" He seemed to jerk himself into character. I think that during shooting, Johnny had been enjoying his rest upon that movie prop, and suddenly, the director shouted, ""Roll 'em!"", or, ""we're not paying you all that money to sleep on the job, Depp!"", totally taking him by surprise(don't get me wrong...I'm a Depper, myself...) I made a point to carefully observe the audience, once this overly-long movie had ended. By the looks on their faces, they were as confused as I was, and in quite a lot of pain as they rose stiffly from the chair they had been seated in for well over two hours. Also, the reintroduction of Captain Barbossa at the very end seemed to be a slap in the face (What's this? You add yet ANOTHER twist to this already convoluted plot?) POTC seemed to be in competition with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy at this point, an effort to one up THAT most excellent trilogy. It should have been acknowledged, however, that the LOTR trilogy has been thoroughly time-tested. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now seems to be running a marathon (weighed down by carelessly applied CGI, as well as a patchwork plot), in direct competition with LOTR, a strange ""keeping up with the Joneses"" phenomena in movie-making(""We gotta have OUR trilogy too, Frodo!"") This time, my ticket had been free. I will likely return, though, paying for a ticket this time around, hopefully in order to clear up some of the confusion. I will try to listen far more intently to ""voodoo-woman"" and ""squid-man"", endeavouring to filter out more of the waving sea-fauna/flora which fought for my attention. Maybe this is just another case of ""organized confusion"" to persuade me to purchase a ticket. You got me, Disney. I'm there.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Must admit that the first POTC was one my favorite films of 2003. Filled with action, humor and freshness, it brought a unique approach to the screen. Of course, sequels are always challenging and usually a let down. Although, I hesitate to call Dead Man's Chest a let down, it does lack the spontaneity and spark of the first. That said, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie-going experience and one not to be missed.Director Gore Verbinski returns with a bit darker, less tongue-in-cheek approach as Captain Jack Sparrow (the amazing Johnny Depp) searches for the key to regain his soul. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also return with a lame love story that luckily gets very little play after the first 15 minutes. The darker approach this time includes a fascinating pirate character named Davy Jones, who may be the most eye-catching creature ever captured on film. You simply can't take your eyes off of him! Jones is played by the totally unrecognizable Bill Nighy (who everyone remembers from ""Love Actually""). Watching Davy Jones play the organ is itself worth the price of admission.Also new to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard (""Good Will Hunting"") as Bootstrap Bill, Bill Turner's (Bloom) lost soul father forever banished to serve Davy Jones. The scenes with Skarsgard and Bloom lacked the punch one would have expected. Actually most of the scenes with Bloom lack punch. Maybe we have grown a bit tired of his simple eye-batting method acting.Depp, of course, is the real star. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the more popular screen characters of all time. Kids and Adults love him. He is not quite wicked and not quite a good man. We can tell Depp has fun with the character, but it is easy to take his performance for granted the second time around. Try not to. It is a real pleasure to watch.Yes, the story is pretty weak and very little character development occurs. But that's not what this series is about, is it? The new sea creatures are remarkable (putting the first of the new round of ""Star Wars"" to shame). This is a visual (not an intellectual feast), so enjoy it for what it is ... and try not to have tentacle nightmares afterwards.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The main story - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must come up with 100 souls to satisfy a debt to supernatural Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), while Will (Orlando Bloom) must retrieve Jack's compass to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from certain death - happily takes center stage, relegating the latter's romance to second-banana status. And that's a jolly good thing, too, because if there's anything to sink this wave-soaring vessel, it'd be a treacly kissy-kissy subplot.From the outset, bad things are afoot. Jack finds out the time's come to repay his debt to Jones, who commands a huge kraken to destroy ships. So Jack sets aground on a small island, which unfortunately is the home to a cannibal tribe. It's okay, though, because they think Jack's their god, but not so okay when they decide they need to free him from his fleshy existence - by killing and eating his crew.Will's sent by the new Lord, Cutler Beckett, to grab Jack's compass, else Will and Elizabeth will be killed. See, the compass leads to a key, which leads to a chest, the chest of one Davy Jones, and isn't it nice when the plot kind of comes full circle like that? I've always loved Johnny Depp. This is his first time in which he plays the same character in more than one movie; he's long been known as a stylish character actor, and the original Pirates made him more of a leading man. His Jack Sparrow is at once iconic and iconoclastic, daring you to like him and root for him despite all evidence to the contrary. Is he a treacherous scoundrel, or will he fight for his friends? Depp is clearly in his element here, making Sparrow his own - I don't think Disney would be able to find a suitable replacement, should the need arise.Bloom his more than his equal as Will Turner, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him in the original, of course, but I thought he was a bit overshadowed by the nuanced Depp performance. Bloom's Turner here, though, is more commanding and charismatic, idealistic where Sparrow is ambiguous, a powerful performance.Knightley could have been just another pretty face, pouting and showing off her gleaming choppers, she instead is every bit as towering and rambunctious as her male counterparts, slashing and dashing about in a mad frenzy of catlike grace. Compare her work here to that in Domino, which featured a modicum of violence of its own sort, and it's a favorable comparison indeed. Where's the mouselike Knightley I see on red carpets? The final big star of the movie is the special effects and action scenes, from the massive kraken to sinking boats, from plenty of swordplay to chases through jungles and forests. It's a true testament to the on screen magic that while one never stops to think, ""How could this possibly happen?"" one is also never overwhelmed by the bigness, the spectacle, the exasperating premise that louder is better. But the Whoa factor is in full effect, make no mistake.Full of spit and verve best suited to an angry pirate, Dead Man's Chest is full of what The Curse of the Black Pearl gave us. More of the same, in this instance, is well worth it, matey!","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I didn't look, but I'm sure he puffed out his chest as he said it, too. While I'm sure that I am guilty of something like it from time to time, there is nothing that irritates me more than people who walk into a movie like this, sum it up with some cliché, and then fold their arms triumphantly, sure that they are superior to everyone involved in making the movie. What a tool.On the other hand, my reaction may have something to do with the fact that the story in this movie is so huge that I think I would have to watch it at least three or four times before I really caught everything that was going on. The plot is hardly Shakespearean in its intricacy, but for a summer popcorn blockbuster it's pretty intense. The movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but for sheer entertainment it resides comfortably near the top of the list of the current releases. Granted, it's too long by about 45 minutes, Keira Knightly has not done much to shake that pompous Britishness that made her role in the first movie (and this one) goofy almost to the point of being intolerable, the great Johnny Depp comes dangerously close to overacting once or twice, Orlando Bloom rarely stops overacting from beginning to end, and the action sequences are so long and so CGI and cut together so dizzyingly fast that there will be times when you will want to close your eyes, not to mention that some of the action setups are just ridiculous. Captain Jack's rotisserie situation, for example, shocked me because I didn't think I would see something this soon which would outdo the stampede sequence in King Kong for absurdity.However, the CGI effects are certainly impressive, Davy Jones is a phenomenal villain (the effects that created him and that make up his facial expressions remind me of how impressed I was with Gollum in Lord of the Rings), and like I said, I was highly impressed with the depth of the story. I think the movie definitely suffered from an obviously exploded budget, there are times when it seems that they didn't know when to stop spending money on the movie, but for the most part I think they were able to keep it in check (the swordfight on top of the rolling water-wheel, however, is not an example of keeping limitless spending in check). I didn't love the movie as much as I had heard I would, I liked Captain Jack Sparrow a lot better in the original film, and by the time this one was finally over I was numb from the waist down (and around the eye-sockets, somewhat), but there is a hell of a lot of movie here, and the closing scene will have you jumping out of your seat for part 3","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

They are searching the seas and isles for a special key that leads a chest of an unusual nature. All that stands in their way in another grisly crew of another haunted ship, not to mention the mythic creature that is trying to swallow the Black Pearl.Overall, I will say, that this film is entertaining. Johnny Depp shines brightly and just as in the Curse of the Black Pearl, makes this film much more enjoyable. Keira Knightley puts in another solid performance and Orlando Bloom does fine as well. Dead Man's Chest is a bit darker than the first, but maintains much of the spirit that a Disney film offers (see scenes with bone cage and again with the big wheel).Although I was entertained I was underwhelmed by the film. I thought the story was loosely put together and was not driven by a solid plot. It did not seem like the writers did not put much thought into how they were going to bring Jack, Will, and Elizabeth all back together and that lack of thought continued into much of the film. They tried to cram too much into the already long 2 1/2 hours that the film runs. Contributing to this problem is the plethora of characters. Although the plot centers around the main cast they bring back a lot of characters we did not need to see again from the first film and many new characters that did not add anything redeeming.As previously stated, I enjoyed the movie and would not tell anyone to not go see it. I just think that it had too many faults and that not enough time was put into the thought process that led to what we saw in the theater. I am happy people are going to the movies, but not worth achieving the status as top grossing film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was the slapstick version of the original. What if we all acted like the Three Stooges and re-made the movie. And it's not the actor's fault. It's probably Disney's fault...certainly the writers and directors and the folks that could have said Stop! The character of Captain Jack disappeared somewhere in the bad comedy though he did a great job with what he had to work with. Orlando Bloom was in it wasn't he? With a few excellently delivered lines (he can't do otherwise) he seemed to be kind of melded into the special effects. And for anyone who saw Underworld...come on Davy Jones! get a new character! we could see you through your huge makeup and we wanted to see someone else. Too much CGI. Too little of what we watch Pirates to see...Johnny Depp...acting...being Captain Jack... I was greatly disappointed. Sorry. I hate saying bad stuff about people I love.

What's so refreshing, is that it actually delivers on the motto and gives audiences exactly what they want.Unlike the first film, which benefited from originality and lengthy exposition to set up the action and humor, ""Dead Man's Chest"" gets off to a clunky start with the reintroduction of just about every character and theme both major and minor from ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" It makes for a somewhat confusing first hour, as I honestly hadn't watched the original since its theatrical run three years ago and didn't quite remember who everyone was and why they were in their current convoluted predicaments. Once the action gets going, and you settle into the preposterous plot that involves plenty of double-crossing, pillaging, tall tales from the sea, and some sort of hocus-pocus involving the mythical Kracken, the audience is treated to a visually stunning ride full of healthy doses of action, humor, and spookiness.Once again, what makes the film stand out from the rest (aside from Johnny Depp's now iconic Jack Sparrow role) is how director Gore Verbinski handles the material and stages the freak show. He's probably the only commercially trained for-hire director who knows how to sustain a beautiful shot. It's also nice to see him get a little more artistic with his direction, as anyone who has seen ""The Ring"" or even odder his more recent ""Weather Man,"" will pick up on concurrent themes in his breathtaking visuals. More developed in this film is his classical take on dissolves and dolly shots that are nothing short of fantastic. With a bigger budget (upwards of $200 million) he's also one of the few big time blockbuster directors who makes sure every penny is seen on screen. The special effects were shockingly detailed and crystal clear, especially the insanely creative and unique look of the Davey Jones Crew and the aforementioned Kracken. The visual effects team has taken computerized images to new heights beyond even the superb work done with Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The amazing effects dance across the screen hand in hand with sweeping natural vistas, brilliantly staged action sequences and elaborate sight gags (witness the human shish-ka-bob scene) that seem as equally inspired by old time Serials and the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy as they do by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and other silent film classics. Despite sometimes the humor falling flat, this infectious combination of old-style film-making with new fangled state-of-the-art technology translates wonderfully into audience satisfaction and perfectly calculated box-office gold.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

HA! A lot of fools wasted their money on this. 435 million box office receipts! What the hell is wrong with this country. Only a brainless fool would like this mess. I can't understand moviegoers would go see this. From the previews I knew this was going to be bad. I hated the first film, so there was no way in hell was going to see this pile of dung. So after all the chaos died out, I just rented it this weekend while many more fools were flocking to see the third film of this overrated trilogy. Everything I expected, plus more garbage. This makes the first film look pretty decent. If I saw this at the theater I would've been swearing to myself for weeks on why I wasted my money, gas, and time on such crap. Well, after renting it I don't feel the same way. Four dollars down the drain nothing more, nothing less.The movie itself now is a complete washout. It's awful, pathetic, and just bad, very, very bad. Same plot. Looking for some stupid treasure, fighting the baddies, and once again the baddies are from the depths of the sea. Decomposed bodies that aren't the least bit scary. The whole movie consists of endless, painful comedy and very far out action sequences that aren't the least bit entertaining. I found myself laughing at two jokes and both came from the parrot. The movie's running time of 2hrs and 21 minutes, not counting the 9 minutes of end credits is a complete waste of money and time. About two hours of the movie feature scenes of running and chasing from the natives and ships being brought down by the kraken and none of it tells any part of the story. The movie also features way too much gross moments of make-up and special effects. Especially the scene that features Noami Harris. YUCK! That face with that make-up is ultimately gross. Now Harris also was in the crappy Miami Vice movie, and that film sucked badly. But compared to this it's a pretty damn good film. The whole movie consisted of endless parody from other films. Especially from The Mummy Returns, the Indiana Jones films, Captain Blood and other pirate movies. However, the movie that it was highly influenced by was 20,000 Leauges Under the Sea.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, now that's a terrific film and a classic. Great special effects, breathtaking underwater photography, and a wonderful cast featured in a action packed pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest was a remake of that film. In fact Davey Jones reminded me of a mutinied Captain Nemo with his ship and men and his organ. But Nemo had a motive and was a genius. Jones is a buffoon and an idiot, along with Jack Sparrow and the rest of the cast is this awful, soon to be forgotten piece of garbage. One of the worst films I've ever seen. You want a great pirate movie. I recommend these classics: Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. Nobody beats Errol Flynn the king of all swashbucklers. Also take a look at: The Black Swan and of course 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The classic one with James Mason and Kirk Douglas.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, this film is over two hours of special effects and needless events. If you look past the sword-fights, weird characters, and Depp's popular pirate impersonation there is no plot development. Quentin Tarantino once said ""Good movies tell a story and bad/poorly written ones describe a situation. Unfortunately most movies that end up in theaters fall into the latter category."" ""Dead Man's Chest"" puts the same lovable and unique characters from ""Black Pearl"" into a very very long string of meaningless situations. After the first 90 minutes or so, even the characters from the first film (yes- they are all back) lost their luster. The director quickly overused the character traits and quirks that made the cast of the first movie so unique. My father (also a fan of the first film) and I compared our reactions and both drew the same conclusion: This movie is nothing more than a setup for the third, with an ending that cheaply ensures you'll be back next year. If you like Depp's face, computerized sea-creature-men, and battle scenes, then this is the one to see. However, if you are looking for substance, character development, or a plot, then I'd recommend something else.","23 out of 44 found this helpful.

The two are facing the death penalty unless they can get that magical compass from Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and so begins another overblown storyline. I wasn't the greatest fan of the original movie but I thought it had enough good moments to make those summer blockbuster fans happy. I read a few reviews of this sequel and noticed that it too made a killing at the box office but for the life of me I can't understand why. It's fair to say that I'm just not a fan of the series. It's also fair to say that I'm wrong in my thoughts on it. I guess it's fair to say that I'm being overly harsh towards this type of movie but for the life of me I can't figure out who could be entertained by a 151-minute ""B"" movie that seems to forget to be fun in the first place. I wasn't too happy with the extended running time for the first film so added even more time just hit me by a complete surprised and I just don't see why it was needed. It's not like we're dealing with an epic story or something series. We've got a ""B"" adventure film that used to play to kids at matinees each Saturday back in the day but for some reason they take this simple genre and try to make it something bigger and in my opinion they failed big time. There are countless problems with this film but the biggest is the fact that both Bloom and Knightley have their characters cut down to the point where both are incredibly boring and neither adds a thing to the picture. Bloom seems to be sleepwalking through the part and for the most part Knightley just stands around waiting to be rescued. Depp is back and needless to say he's the best thing about the picture but at the current running time I was even growing tired of him by the 90-minute mark. Depp at least seems to be in on the fact that this is a ""B"" movie and makes his character fast and fun. The rest of the supporting players were all rather bland but I will say Geoffrey Rush was good in his few moments. Once again the film is full of CGI, which is both hit and miss as there are times where it completely overtakes the story with outrageous and unrealistic action scenes. The monsters this time out are rather unique looking because of how strange they are. I'm not sure I'd call them good looking monsters but I found the visual look of them to be interesting. Again, I'm sure DEAD MAN'S CHEST has a ton of fans out there but I'm clearly not one of them.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

I have to say that the film is a slight bit darker than the first, but it all fits together very well and the roller-coaster ride style of the film is sprinkled with constant comedic timing just like the first. I wouldn't recommend it for the extremely young crowd (there were a couple loud groans from the audience during certain slightly gory bits), but other than that it is an amazing film.

Personally, I never was the impressed with the first one. Depp, of course, scored big with his acting. I, however, was less than enthused by a few of the other big names in the film. I think I would probably like this movie better if it wasn't made with all of those one liners for the cheap laugh. Although, I am aware that that is part of a Captain Jack Sparrow's character. My last point is that I feel the ending of Dead Man's Chest was left way too open. I mean, come on, they might as well of just call it Dead Man's Chest part 1. They did not leave the first one that open. I think that was a disappointment to everyone in the theater.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

While it lacks the originality and ""surprise factor"" of the first film, it's safe to say that Gore Verbinski's new entry on the series fulfill the expectations nicely and delivers its fair share of entertainment and adventure with a joy rarely seen on screen. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one of the most entertaining and funny adventures of the last years.The story begins with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)'s wedding canceled when the couple is arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his escape. Sentenced to death, Will is offered a chance to save their lives, he must bring Jack Sparrow and his magic compass to the hands of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Company. At the same time, Sparrow faces troubles of his own, as he has a debt to pay to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the supernatural captain of the ghostly ship named ""The Flying Dutchman"". Will and Jack's interests will conflict and a quest will start for the Dead Man's Chest, a mysterious artifact that holds the key to their salvation.Written again by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the film continues delivering the same style of swashbuckling action and light-hearted comedy that made the first one successful. With the advantage of having the characters already established, the film goes straight to the action and turns the ""Pirates"" series into an epic quest that without a doubt will be fulfilled in the third entry of the now trilogy. This is probably a two sided blade, as unlike the first film, this one serves as a build up for the third and could be said that it lacks a proper conclusion following the style of movie serials of old or more recently, the ""Star Wars"" series.Director Gore Verbinski once again becomes the mastermind behind this ambitious sequel, and carefully builds up the epic adventure taking it to the realms of fantasy with the aid of very good special effects creating incredible monsters and supernatural creatures. This mixture of historical setting and fantasy elements is nothing new, as the first one had its share of it, however, here the effects are bigger and of greater importance, although surprisingly, not entirely overwhelming. Verbinski's daring mix of special effects and extensive plot is risky, but fortunately it ends on a positive note.Johnny Depp once again leads the show, and while certainly both Bloom and Knightley have improved, they still look overshadowed by the imposing presence of Depp's talent. The addition of Bill Nighy is an excellent one, and he manages to challenge Depp's domain of the film and successfully steals every scene he is in. Even with his face completely covered with Computer effects, Nighy delivers a performance on the level of the best swashbuckling villains of all time. The rest of the cast remains basically the same as in the previous movie with few improvements, although Stellan Skarsgård surprises as the ghostly incarnation of Will Turner's father.""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very entertaining and well-done film, but it has some severe flaws that by now most critics have pointed out. For once, it's the overlong runtime, that wouldn't be a real problem if it weren't for the fact that some unnecessary scenes are the ones that cause this extensive runtime. Particularly the introductory scenes seem to go forever making the rest of the film look rushed and some character's decision seem out of character. While some have criticized the plot as ""incoherent"", personally I think that it's very good despite its slow and overlong start.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" may not change the world of cinema, nor leave an everlasting impact as the previous entry; but at least it serves as the beginning of a new adventure that explores this romantic idealization of the pirate's life. It's great escapism and healthy entertainment that hopefully will have a terrific conclusion in part three. 7/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This film however was not a worthy sequel. Plot ? There isn't one. I could put spoilers in this review, but it would make no difference as the plot is essentially a device to go from one CGI scene to another. It's a shame when there is acting talent available, big budgets but the most important thing - a story - is completely missing. I would advise anyone with more than 2 brain cells to avoid seeing this film; and as for other reviewers who have compared it to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I'll have some of what you are on, because you must be out of your mind. This is at least as bad as the second Matrix film, which says it all; if I could have walked out without upsetting my 10 year old daughter, I would have done.

I enjoyed it so much I paid no attention to a goof or two. I was so caught up in the adventure, that when Jack was back running in the wheel,I just thought the metal bar had fallen out when he did, after it cracked him in the heat. The bloopers only added to the fun. Romance, mayhem, treachery, fantasy, mythology, adventure and much more, but especially the comedy made this film worth seeing it more then once. To me, this movie was ever bit as good as the first, and I will be waiting anxiously for the 3rd to come out. I would be extremely difficult for me to pick a favorites part of Piarats.

Johnny Depp also shines in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow and is great for comic relief. Keira Knightley is a slightly haughtier but more tough version of her character in the first movie and is impressive with a sword (or two). I really could have done without all those sea creature/men hybrids (the octopus one was especially disturbing), but all in all it made for a very enjoyable film.

Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest is the first movie I've seen in a long time that I didn't feel like taking my 8 bucks back after seeing it. I've been watching a lot of movies recently and they've all been sad disappointments. Not this one though. This film was funny, intense, emotional, and much better than the first one in my opinion. The writers deserve awards for the beautifully scripted storyline that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat as the main plot unfolds through a plethora of intriguing sub-plots. Every character wanted their own thing and while that may sound like a basic dramatic rule, many movies have lacked that recently (watch the movie to see what I mean). Excellently written characters were brought to life by phenomenal actors. We all love Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, let's face it, but Davy Jones was the best computer-animated character since Gollum in Lord of the Rings. I own the soundtrack which contains a palette of moods from deep-villainous organs to lofty circus music to tribal dance beats. Simply put, I have to thank everyone involved with this film. I am BEGGING for a third one. This movie definitely got me in to the pirate fever. Arrrr!!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A thrilling tale of Pirates, buried treasure...and the horrors of the sea","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1429161/?ref_=tt_urv","j_gamesmaster","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11129299/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2006","Well, what can I say? Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest has made a tense, action-packed, scary, and devastating sequel to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" For a start, the locations are fantastic; not only was this film shot at such exotic places as St. Lucia, the Bahamas, St. Vincent and Granada; the film includes a wide variety of settings which are compulsory for a film about pirates; a tropical island with hostile natives, a filthy pub populated by drunkards (an ideal place for a riot scene), as well as a ghostly shipwreck.The characters in the film are also great, or greatly developed from the first film such as Elizabeth Swann becoming skilled with the sword and the unfortunate new fate of Commodore Norrington. They even restored the two comical pirates, Pintel and Ragetti (Ragetti is the one with a false eye) from the first film, which I think is great, as they are two people who are, although evil, funny and lovable. There is also an ethnic Caribbean wise woman, who was clearly thought up with great imagination, as well as her home, in which Ragetti stands beside a hanging jar of eyeballs, here we see an example of hilarious surrealism. What I would say were especially intriguing though were the villainous phantoms of Davy Jones' crew; unlike in the first film, these monsters are actually themed with the sea, i.e. barnacles growing on the faces, crab's claws, squid tentacles. The other great thing about the crew is that they are all individually unique (again, unlike in the first film, in which they were all just skeletons); a member of Davy Jones' crew is not just one of many ugly monsters, but he has something special to show to the audience, one pirate for example has the head of a hammer-head shark, another has a head that comes off and is able to follow its body by becoming a hermit crab. The portrayal of Davy Jones furthermore speaks for himself, and has been gruesomely but skillfully made by the costume designer to stand out as the authority amongst his crew. The conceptual artists of this film had a very gifted imagination I must say.The music score for the film is great, they kept the action theme tune from the first film, but added an extra 'B' part to the music, which, I think has been a success, as it sounds good and goes very well with the 'A' part. As I recall from one scene, as Captain Jack, Elizabeth Swann, Norrington, Pintel and Ragetti are walking across a vast beach towards the camera, the zoom focuses in quickly as significant beats of the music strike. I don't think I have seen this sort of correspondence before in a very instrumental, ""thick"" piece of film music, so I think the director Gore Verbinski was good in not being afraid to try something new. The script of the film is also brilliant and is very funny. Lines come up which you wouldn't really expect as well. These are too hilariously unexpected that I will not mention any examples (it will spoil the moment).A few aspects of this film are comparable to Steven Spielberg's version of ""The War of the Worlds"", namely towering tentacles rising and swirling themselves high above ships crow's nests, snatching the odd extra and flinging them through the air now and then, and the dreaded roar of 'the Kracken' (The Scandanavian grim-reaper of the sea), who is comparable to 'the sarlacc' from ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" in a way with its infinite teeth circling its whole mouth. Believe me, Walt Disney knows what he's doing here, as they did a version of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", which, as we all know contains a giant squid. The other great thing about the Kracken is that we don't see its whole body at first. The sight from a distance of enormous tentacles dragging down a helpless ship is enough to send a shiver down one's spine. Furthermore, we have a sense of overpowering mystery when we don't see the whole thing. We see it underwater briefly through the eyes of Will Turner as he watches the fate he brought upon an innocent merchant ship.For thrill seekers, fun lovers and film lovers, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a god-send. Although it doesn't have all that much of a plot, it contains all the classic aspects of a true piracy film; a treasure map, buried treasure, chases, hostile island natives, sword fights and plenty of them, sword fights on top of big rolling wheels, a snifter of romance and drama, a crew of pirate monstrosities, and even a terrifying, tentacled sea monster! All of these aspects lead the audience to a thrilling climax, which gets the audience eating their popcorn quickly. Trust me on this, if you watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, your eyes will be glued to the screen! A film that I would recommend to everyone.-Reviewed by James Ord in the United Kingdom","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The original fare was a massive success and loved by all; with this said, it is unfortunate that I have deemed the sequel only slightly above average.First the pros: the CGI is top notch and the sets and cinemotagraphy are beautiful. The costumes are also top notch and should be given a nod come Oscar time. But now to the Cons: in my opinion, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the character everyone came to fall in love with, fell short in this movie. It seemed as if his purpose was minimized as only to provide comic relief. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) does fairly well as he has certainly matured since the last movie but Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is nearly nonexistent in this movie. Though the parts were acted well, the three stars did not live up to the first.The secondary characters had an excellent opportunity to shine in this one, which I felt was a great addition.Long....this movie clocked in at around 2 1/2 hours - I felt much of it could have been cut out.But through all of this, I will say this: I am guaranteed to see the final POTC. Like the Matrix trilogy - though the second one may not live up to the first, maybe because the first set the bar so high, or because it simply fell short on all angles - I, like others, will want to see the final chapter; to see how it all ends.But in conclusion, I'm not saying don't see the movie, but don't let the hype get to you. I feel as if so much hype was around this movie (I mean I went to a premiere in which +100 were dressed as pirates) it couldn't live up the bar which was raised. So go into this movie w/ the goal not to judge it against the original, but by itself. And by itself, its above average.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I looked forward to it so much and I have to say, it was past my expectations. Being a sequel to the highly successful first Pirates film, many people thought it would just be a shadow of the first film, but I am happy to say, it was not. The acting of Johnny Depp (Captian Jack Sparrow), Keria Knightly (Elizabeth Swann) and Orlando Bloom (William Turner)was just as good, if not better than the first. Also, many new and old characters did well in making the film very enjoyable. The plot unfortunately was all over the place and difficult to understand, you could see the writers wanted it to be a little bit more depthful than the first. I guess you could say though, 'depthfulness' Dons't really suit the film! The humour was up to its standard, just as hilarious as the first, but they seemed to use many jokes from the first film which sort of ruined it a bit. I will tell you this though: Captain Jack Sparrow's entry into the film is just as funny as in the first one! I think the main thing that pulls you into the film is the uncanny darkness the other film Dons't have. It was a bit overwhelming at first but you got used to it after a while. I'm sure many people would agree with me when I say that there was not enough action at the beginning and too much at the end as well, but I guess it all adds up to the next Pirates film, which I am so looking forward too! Overall, The characters and ideas of the film are still the same but the film is sort of hammed up with too much information. I guarantee though, you will leave the movies totally satisfied and hanging off your seat for the next film- which is the other half of the Pirates trilogy!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

All that, while the actual story didn't really move on. It's a common scenario in trilogies when it comes to Part II. Look at The Matrix and even Lord Of The Rings. The complete story has been written, part one was stunning and part three contains all the clues. But part two is used to create questions which are answered in part 3.Therefor, a trick is to suggest there's happening a lot of things, while actually the movie only contains fillers. A lot of action, jokes, special effects, massive destruction, but when you sum things up, very little is told. The action is good, have to admit that, and a couple of jokes are indeed sharp though it sometimes hits the edge of slapstick. But yet, That's a shame, for it makes the movie a little bit empty in my opinion, and not worthy watching it a second time.Spider-man 2, good example. That did actually work, because it was a totally different story. The sub-plot was interesting enough to create a hunger for the final part, but it wasn't the main storyline.My conclusion: you need to see Dead Men's Chest, if you're a Pirates lover, but one time is enough (well, women might see it hundreds of times for Johnny and Orlando...typical). But prepare for a lot of questions at then end, and a whole year of waiting in doubt.Oh, and I gave it seven because of Johnny Depp, the music and the wonderful sets. And Keira. A little bit.Remember, it's just an opinion. From a Dutch person. So what's that worth, right?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's no secret in Hollywood that sequels are usually pretty bad compared to the original movies. That was my fear for Pirates 2, all up until actually seeing the movie.Reading the reviews before the movie, the critics were mixed about it. Some though better than the original, some though total waste of time. Yahoo's average critic rating was a B-, MovieFone's was a 52/100.That helped sky-rocket my fear even more. Until I saw that MovieFone also gave Pirates 1 a 60/100. So I realized, what do they know? But going to see the movie allowed me to give my own opinion. And let me tell you, the movie DID NOT disappoint.Most say the movie was somewhat slow in the beginning, I say it was character building. Most say the movie was too long, I agree it could have been shorter.That's about it though. The movie had stunning special effects, great characters, more humor, and more Captain Jack than in the first movie, which after all is the reason we see it right? :) While the first is still better, the second is enjoyable, as long as you make your bathroom trip before the movie.Some people say waste of time. I say look at it this way, if you walk into the theater expecting to be blown out of your mind by the amazing sequel to '03's hit, you will be disappointed. But if you enter the theater expecting to watch a movie based on a theme park ride (just like most did going to see the first), and...get this...have pirates in it, you will be satisfied.Just my two cents ;)","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sure, it's your standard special-effects filled action packed hilarious film. Johnny Depp is amazing in it and Jack Davenport does a bang-up job, but until about 40 minutes from the end (of a 149 minute film!) the plot has little discernible continuity, and jumps from one storyline to another WAY too much to hold much concentration.It definitely pulls together at the end, leaving hope for a promising 3rd film, only to be almost completely ruined by a completely god awful slow-motion shot of Jack Sparrow..Certainly worth seeing, but don't get too excited. Look forward to the 3rd!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The CGI was fantastic, the ships and over all feel of the era was clear, the story however, took a wrong turn. In comparison to the first installment to the now Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, the movie feel episodic and epic. It had story and character development and everything flowed smoothly. The Curse of the Black Pearl was amazing when it came out and still is to this day. The main problem that I found with Dead Man's Chest was that the story seemed to drag on, only trying to keep the audience interested with special effects, versus story plot. The characters, minus Jack Sparrow, have all evolved into something completely different from before. They don't act the same, and really don't feel the same. Not to give out any spoilers but Elizabeth's character was the one that upset me the most. You will have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about. Don't get me wrong, it was a fantatsic movie, but I wanted to see a franchise built out of this, not a trilogy, the world has enough of those already. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is worth seeing, just don't expect a great sequel.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First in line to get in, and it was well worth the hour long wait.The movie starts off with a gruesome beginning, I don't really understand the whole reason, but just watching the first five minutes, you are just flown into the beautiful camera-work, as opposed to the first film, where the slightest move and the camera went shaky.All the actors are amazing, beautifully portraying their characters, and so much detail into their personal lives. You learn secrets, betrayals, and loyalties during this movie, which leaves your head swimming by the time the credit rolls.I must admit, I went and watched this movie again, trying to figure out exactly all that went on. Be ready to ""jump in"" and try to piece the puzzle together. This movie was very long, but very entertaining. It took another go for me to figure out all the details that the movie gave for this and the next film, but I will gladly suggest you go see it, if you haven't already.The movie is a lot of good vs. evil, and there is a lot of religious symbolism, or at least I thought so.

Even more slap-stick, far-fetched, & outrageous than the first. For these reasons, it is a great ""I-need-a-break-from-my-daily-grind"" movie. So, sure, the plot was a little underdeveloped & so they stuck that extra little bit about the natives in there at the beginning to make up for it, & so what if the cutting back & forth between the story lines was a little chaotic...I still loved it, even though it became rather difficult to understand the dialogue occasionally. I had heard the ending was a frustrating cliff-hanger, so I expected the credits to roll at any crucial moment towards the end of the hefty two & half hours; however, when it did come, it was by no means as maddening as the Two Towers, or an Alias episode finish. So, not to worry. Go see it, laugh all the way through at the flawed, over-confident Captain Jack, & most of all, enjoy all the little scenes from the ride. This film deserves your six bucks more than any others at the moment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm inclined to question this ""film's"" authenticity as a real movie because movies are actually supposed to have plots. A plot includes a beginning, a middle and an end. An end does not just mean, OK let's throw some confusing crap at the audience then show the credits, it means a conclusion. This movie had no such conclusion. I understand that this is because there is going to be a third movie. but, if they had done a better editing job and not made the movie a painful 2.5 hours long, they could have put both the 2nd and 3rd ""movies"" together and given it a satisfying ending. this movie was just a teaser for the 3rd. it was a scam to get money, and that's it. Watching a trilogy is supposed to be enjoyable. like Lord of the rings or star wars, or even batman, though those movies sucked mostly. POTC wasn't enjoyable. it was boring. the acting sucked. the movie makers overcompensated with special effects in place of reliable and relevant themes. what happened to good plots, and good stories that unearth the depths of human emotion? movie makers have out done themselves, and now they just rely of special effects to make money. creating those special effects must be difficult, but not as difficult as it is to write a truly meaningful story. this movie made me so angry. it wasted 2.5 hours of my life that i will never get back. and now I HAVE to see the third one, otherwise i'll never get this bitterness out of my soul. why did they do this??? Walt Disnet rolled over in his grave when this shitty movie premiered. mickey mouse was created to entertain and to bring joy to people, not to scam them out of their money.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

It started well and had a good grip on it from the beginning, but thirty minutes or so into it I just wanted it to be over. Yes, Depp was excellent, Knightly was entertaining and Bloom wasn't half bad (I'm not a fan of the Bloomster) and Bill Nighy was brilliant as always and made Davy Jones seem like a real bad guy who you hated so he did his job well. But the problem I had was with the length of it, it just seemed to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and just didn't seem to know when to stop. However, when it did stop it left me dying for more so roll on the next instalment, I just hope that they don't make it an epic at 3 hours+ and leave out some of the rubbish filler that made this one just that little bit disappointing.

Knowing that and the rule of sequels, NO ONE should be expecting great cinema here.What we SHOULD be expecting is lots of silly adventure fun, good terrible puns, cute jokes, subtle-enough-that-the-kids-don't-get-it innuendo and Johnny Depp to be Johnny Depp.While Captain Jack's groove is somewhat subdued in this film, the flip side of this is that all the other characters are a bit wittier, and Orlando Bloom has gained a milligram of acting talent since the first one.All in all, it was a fun, family film.

They had to make a sequel -- and probably another sequel, and another, and another. You get the idea. What to do about a plot? After all, the first movie didn't have a story to draw from, no novel, no play, nothing. So they hired some writers and concocted a tale involving lots of pirates, British soldiers, a beautiful damsel in distress, -- a piece of cake. Voila, huge success beyond their wildest dreams. We were ready to forgive the cookie cutter plot drawn from all the pirate movies since Erroll Flynn plied the trade, because, ...well the girl was soooo beautiful, and Jack Sparrow so quirky in a charming sort of way, and everybody else was so earnest, the monsters so scary, etc. We just bought it, big time! Enter the second installment. What to do now? No problem, just bring back Jack Sparrow, only make him ten, no twelve times more annoyingly quirky (I swear he was on drugs through the whole movie) and throw in lots of pirates, the same beautiful girl, and lots of British soldiers, corrupt politicians, monsters from the dead, etc. Another piece of cake.And, judging from the box office, I guess it really is just that easy. Another huge success for a movie... based on an amusement park ride. Who needs an engaging story, or clever plot devices, or great acting? Hey we have scary monsters and lots of computer animation! I have to admit I did enjoy the ride. I just wanted more. I wanted Daniel Defoe. I got Billy Silly Bones instead.It isn't a terrible movie. It is, in fact, the 2nd best movie based on an amusement park ride ever made. It just confirms what everybody already knows: It takes more than lots of sword fights, swashbuckling, sea monsters, cannibals, and pretty heroines in peril to make a really good pirate movie; but if you have enough computer graphics, it won't really matter -- you'll still make a ton of money.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

One may assume that those expectations could have ruined the movie, but I don't believe in that sort of thing.I remember seeing PotC 1 and I also remember having the time of my life. I bought the movie and have watched in many many times since. The movie perfectly captured the essence of a good pirate film. Unfortunately, the sequel has few of those characteristics.Lets start with things I disliked: 1. The movie is just way too long. I saw it with 3 of my friends and my girlfriend, and I found myself waiting for it to end. I was bored! In a action-adventure movie! Don't get me wrong, I just looked at the lengths of both movies and there is only a seven minute difference. The fact is, the movie did not keep my attention.2. The action sequences were too CG, edited, and complex. Some scenes were OK, but the majority of them were just too much. I miss the (comparetively) simple fight scenes in the first one.3. The plot skips around all over the place. From ship to ship, different islands, it was just hard to keep up with.4. What happened to the classic theme and the epic scenes of the first movie. See: The beginning of PotC 1, Sparrows entrance.OK, now for the good stuff: 1. Of course, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job of portraying the delightful Sparrow. Sometimes it felt like his part wasn't as cleverly written.2. Absolutely amazing special effects. I didn't even think that Davy Jones was CG, and found out after the movie that he was indeed.Overall, a terrible disappointment that I won't see again. Of course I will see number three, hoping that PotC 2 was just being an in-between film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not much to say beyond that, other than I'm looking forward to the third (and final?) installment of the series to see what our beloved Captain Jack Sparrow is up to!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But if u read the plot of the next movie it doesn't really follow up. This movie is a thrill ride. There are ships sinking and people dying a horrible death. There is love and anger and deception. Jack appears to die at the hands of Davy Jone's Kraken and the Lord of the islands now possesses Davy's heart. There is a creepy voodoo like lady living in a swamp. The original Captain of The Pearl is back ready to lead Will and Elizabeth to the corners of the earth and beyond. I give it a 9.5 out of 10. P.S. The man who was originally engaged to Elizabeth is back as a scurvy mate on Jack's crew (Jack secretly wants to sacrifice one hundred souls to Davy Jones (to save his own soul). The former man of honor wants to deliver the heart to the new Lord and he does. Will meets his father on Davy Jone's ship "" The Flying Dutchman "" and vows to save his soul from the Dutchman by stabbing the heart of Davy Jones. Jack wants the heart to control Davy Jones. If you are wondering, Jones put his heart in the chest because of his one true love that isn't revealed in this movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Probably expecting too much from it, I was bored and unengaged.Second time around, though, it was actually very enjoyable. Once you know what's going to happen, you can start to see how it all fits together. The plot is still pretty slender, and most of the characters are much more cardboardy and less interesting than the first time round, but if you know that before you go in and don't expect too much, it's good fun. Worth seeing, at least as a precursor to film 3.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Gore Verbinski, who directed this and the original (as well as the next in the series) does the pirates well with stunning visual effects and well put together story-telling. In this installment the audience catches up with Captain Jack Sparrow as he becomes forced to pay back a debt he owes to Davy Jones.With the introduction of the legendary Davy Jones, the audience is thrilled by the cutting edge costume design, make up and visual effects that dazzle the mind. Don't think that visual effects are all that drive the film, the story is both solid and laugh-out-loud funny. As Captain Jack's adventure unfolds the movie proves that it can please on all levels from comedy to drama. Captain Jack as well as Will Turner, reprised by Orlando Bloom, are thoroughly delicious characters that the audience come to care about and delight with each plot twist. Johnny Depp brings Captain jack Sparrow to life with an acting job worthy of his many memorable past roles. Depp has proved again and again that he can bring any character to life and stun audiences with his in-depth performances. With cast accomplices of Orlando Bloom and also the return of the gorgeous Keira Knightley who plays Elizabeth Swann, the cast is strong and even the secondary characters are memorable in this terrific Pirate romp.In a summer of what should have been hefty competition with the likes of ""Superman,"" this pirates movie has hijacked this summer's box office. With an opening weekend over $100 million, the film is on track to be this year's biggest summer blockbuster. ""Pirates"" is going to be with us a long time. An ""A"" movie this fun film will leave movie-goers thirsty for the next installment. Yes, there will be another Jack Sparrow adventure. Depp is already filming the sequel to ""Dead Man's Chest,"" currently titled ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" due out for the summer of 2007.

It was great fun - everyone from the small children, teenagers, university students, adults and on up were good natured and enjoyed the film. This film shows us a new darker side of Captain Norrington, introduces some interesting new characters, and brings back a few old favorites. There's also lots of action, plot twists, great ""one liners,"" and a wonderfully choreographed sword fight. Downfalls to this movie? Johnny Depp seemed out of character (just not the same Jack Sparrow) and my favorite two British seamen were not in the movie. However, it seems there may be a reason for Depp's different portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow - so I'm looking forward to next year's Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to see just what is in store for the audience and Jack Sparrow!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Every single frame was brilliant: the framing of the shot, the shot sequences, the sets, the makeup the wardrobe, the unbelievable Caribbean vistas... for example, a simple reaction shot of Beckett's face is imbued with surreality. Or the way Sparrow prances around like Bette Davis... a riot! Everything was brilliantly thought out and realized on the screen.The story is complex on many levels, but the story is perfectly clear in the telling. It never skipped a beat from beginning to end. (In contrast to monstrosities like KONG... YIKES!) Seeing this movie affects you in the way the Treasure Island must have captivated boys in the 19th century. It just sucks you in, and makes you want to be part of its world. You could watch this film over and over and I think it would just get better with each viewing.As I left the theater, all I could think when I let was ""WOW! How did they ever come up with all those great ideas!?!?"" And all this from a superlatively lame DisneyWorld ride! My ONLY moment of ""awww, I don't buy THIS!"" was when we first meet Gibbs (Sparrow's first mate)... He seemed too well groomed: I couldn't ""smell him with my eyes,"" like all the other pirates. Luckily, he got gamier as the film went on! I didn't give this movie a 10 because that score I reserve for one-of-a-kind or ""life-changing"" films (Annie Hall, My Dinner With Andre, Brazil, Mulholland Drive, Sling Blade).But it was definitely a summer blast, every bit equal to if not better than the original.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I must say that after seeing the movie last night, I was very disappointed. However, not all of it is bad; the acting was great, for the most part, and the special effects were top-notch.It is important to view this film and the upcoming movie as one. As a story, the movie does a good job of setting us up for what is going to happen in the third film. However, as a stand-alone movie, I don't think this movie is as good as others are saying. I remember watching a half-hour in thinking that the movie would get better. It didn't. Mindless action sequences (and some were downright stupid; the prisoners inside the bone-cages reminded me of human hamsters on wheels) did nothing to help this film, and there was very little plot development--at least not enough for my tastes, considering the length of the film.However, I am going to refrain from passing final judgment on this film until I see the third movie. If the purpose of the movie was to build up the plot for the series's climax, then Pirates 2 did an excellent job. I think my problem was that I went in with higher expectations than I should; contrary to what others are saying, this movie in no way equals the first. However, concerning the series as a whole, it is paramount.Not great, but we'll see what happens next.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having seen Superman Returns the night before, this movie was a total bore. The movie went nowhere. I don't think there was one part where I really laughed or really enjoyed part of it. It was very canned viewing, very stereotypical pirate/island fantasy story. The whole sequence with the natives was absurd, and hugely playing upon other movies with island natives, no original thought( I know this was a movie but I couldn't help notice the large rock formations and high cliffs that are definitely reminiscent of Thailand or Indonesia, definitely NOT the Carribbean.) There was no real flow to the movie. The plot was sorta there, get the compass, get the key...not gonna spoil it, but it seemed like it was too simply executed. The creatures on The Flying Dutchman were totally stupid, Urchinboy, blowfish man...etc. The only character or actor for that matter with any merit was Bootstrap Bill Turner played by Stellan Skarsgard. While I'm on the topic of actors sorry to all those 13yr old Orlando Bloom fans, but HE SUCKS! He can't carry a lead role in a film, that's why ""Kingdom of Heaven"" did so poorly( what could have been a great film with Ridley Scott and Liam Neeson).Johnny Depp's character was not nearly as good from the first movie, he must have said ""Bugger!"" 30 times. All in all it was too thin of a movie with Michael Bay's best in fake action and CGI. Keira Knightley someone with a good deal of talent had too few scenes, including probably the best of the movie, the bar fight. This movie is nowhere close to the original. It seems its only use is as a minor conveyance to the next PIRATES Movie.All in all I was totally unimpressed, especially since 2 of the 6 of us who went FELL ASLEEP!","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

As a film maker I take into consideration all sorts of things that many other movie goers might not really think about too heavily such as lighting, editing, CGI, writing and plot development. The first Pirates movie had some of the best cinematography I have seen in recent years. Dead Man's Chest however didn't repeat it's spectacular art direction and cinematography seen in the first film. My biggest complaint was the CGI used for the main ""bad guys"". The CGI characters just weren't ""believable"". The textures were off, the lighting didn't match up, even the water for the opening sequence looked more like liquid metal than water to me. I noticed the same problems with the first Pirate movie, but this movie relied on CGI so much to carry it that it really ""sunk"" the movie (man I feel corny). The writing was a big disappointment this time around. Either the actors didn't make it believable, or the writers were trying to push some new ideas too hard. To avoid spoiling the plot I'm going to redirect subjects... The overall length of the film left me anxious at the end to finally get it over with. The climax point comes and then you are left in your chair asking yourself ""what now""? Rather than dragging it out to finish off the story they leave you hanging for next year's Pirate release to finish the story from this release. It's the Matrix all over again! Seeing how many kids were in the audience and taking into consideration that this is a Disney film I was surprised at how much suggested violence there is in this movie. There's one shot that pulls away just as a bunch of captives are about to be killed on their knees. Not something that I would complain about, but Disney usually doesn't let any content of this sort on their films (they usually re-brand it as Miramax or Touchstone).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

If you can accept that fact then this is a very entertaining and rewarding 150 minutes. Of course it isn't as good as the first one, at least not by itself. Dead Man's Chest, the sequel to Curse of the Black Pearl is actually part one of a two-part deal, and therefore it can't be compared fairly to the original Pirates movie until both parts have been released. Black Pearl managed to tell it's entire story concisely in just 153 minutes, and that is where the Dead Man's Chest falls slightly short of it's predecessor. In places it does feel a little stretched-out, for no good reason other than to split the story across two full-length films. Dead Man's Chest just isn't as concise as Black Pearl. BUT, the action scenes never drag, the pacing is for the most part pretty fast, and the characters are all as compelling as in the first movie. I would recommend this wholeheartedly. It's ending is actually far more satisfying and ""conclusive"" than the rather unsatisfying Superman Returns (which was a great film until the ending which left every major plot point unresolved. This is especially annoying as we are expected to wait until 2009 for the next installment!). Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a very entertaining movie, and one which lived up to expectations, well ""half"" lived up to them anyway. I can't wait for the other half!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

However i felt the acting in this movie was below par and that the acting was better in the first one. I didn't believe the characters in a sense. I also feel like the writers of this movie took advantage of the viewers. Anyone who loved the first movie felt compelled to see this movie because they expect it will be just as good. However i think the writers realized the plot of the sequel wasn't as good so they found a way to ensure people will see the third one, the ending leaves you with too many questions and i feel this was wrong. I despise when a movie ends in a way you know anothersequel is coming, if it turns into a Jason and or Freddy series i will be annoyed, stop ruining the integrity of a good movie and rather then be lazy and milk a good movie, think of something new. Despite my dislike for certain aspects of this movie, i will see it again, simply because i love Davy Jones army/ship/Kraken.

"8","/10","I have to admit...I really enjoyed Dead Man's Chest","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2949423/?ref_=tt_urv","C22Man","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47682215/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2014","I'm going to present a somewhat 'unpopular' opinion when I say that Dead Man's Chest is probably my favourite of all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The film is frequently overlooked, seeing as it is sandwiched between the surprisingly brilliant Curse of the Black Pearl and the confusingly bloated At Worlds End. Does it have faults? Of course it does, but it doesn't take away too much from the extremely enjoyable adventure that it is.This time round Captain Jack Sparrow is informed that he still has a blood debt with the legendary Davy Jones. Jack realises that he must find Jones' heart in order to rid himself of Jones and potential damnation for all eternity on the Flying Dutchman. Both Will and Elizabeth are roped into things when they are arrested and told that they will only be released if they find Jack's compass for the seedy Cutler Beckett. Believe me when I say this, there truly is a lot going on within the films plot. It's good that it doesn't get too complicated to follow, but it is constantly building upon itself. It could get away with a flimsy plot due to the concentration on adventure, so I'm glad it is trying to create an interesting storyline.What I really enjoy in the film is that it is just shamelessly entertaining, you don't get the feeling that the film is trying to do anything but keep you entertained and tell a gripping adventure tale. Sometimes films like that can feel pointless or forced, but the film has its heart in the right place and it never tries to be something it is not. It does remind me of swashbuckling films of old that simply relied on offering you some fun.After his Oscar nomination from the first film Johnny Depp returns and is just wonderful as everyone favourite pirate Jack Sparrow. There is just something so likable and entertaining about the character that Depp manages to play out to perfection. His slightly surly confidence and clumsy attitude is what does the trick, Depp just has the mannerisms that fit the part and even the slightest actions is made hilarious by him. When he is on screen things light up and I cannot help but laughThe supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy adds his usual quirky ticks and style to Davy Jones under heavy CGI, making an intimidating and complex villain. I really like Kevin McNally as Sparrow's superstitious right hand man Gibbs, it's a very likable and laid-back performance again. Jack Davenport is back the now run down drunkard Norrington adding more layers to the character. Stellan Skarsgard is solid as always as Will's haunted father and Tom Hollander is enjoyable are the slimy Beckett. The whole crew of the Pearl are always very amusing and have some very funny traits, like Cotton's parrot. The only actors I really have issues with are the other two leads. Orlando Bloom hearkens back to the good looking leads of old adventure flicks, but the guy is just plain dull. He just a bland actor and his stifled delivery always comes off as awkward. Keira Knightly is not much better, she just comes off as annoying and is also just a bland actress. I don't think the characters are bad, just the actors weren't right for the roles.The visuals of the film are extremely impressive. The locations alone look fantastic, whether they be at stormy sea or a white sand beach. The sheer amount of money the film cost to has clearly been used very well in order to make the film a visual feast. The CGI is amazing. The crew of the Flying Dutchman for example are all CGI added on to actors and the details look so lifelike is it hard to believe it isn't. The CGI on Davy Jones looks incredible and the sheer detail that has been put into his creation must be applauded. The seas look vast and dangerous, adding levels of suspense as the crew travel from place to place. The Kraken is another CGI piece that is used well and looks amazing. The action set- pieces are excellent as usual. The triple sword fight inside a rolling water mill is absolutely superb, both from a visual standpoint and as an entertaining action scene. The climatic ship battle is also outstanding. The films tone manages to be balanced nicely. Is the humour still here? You better believe it. Jack's first appearance and escape from a native tribe are truly hilarious. It's the small amusing things that complete the comedic sensibility. Depp's spaced out expressions, the quirks of the Pearl crew and even Tom Hollander's droll delivery are all small things that add to the humour. There are some darker elements, but the film only concentrates on them slightly which is understandable. Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent score which creates a sound that evokes the perfect balance of excitement and tension.Dead Man's Chest is the example of a middle film done right in my eyes. It doesn't try anything too different to the first film, but it does move away enough to feel like its own entity as well as a continuation of the story. The film was by no means perfect, the plot does have a bit too much going on at times and the large amounts of CGI can get excessive. Yet the pure entertainment style is very welcoming, the action is spectacular, Johnny Depp is hilarious once again and all kinds of humour are present here. I think Dead Man's Chest is as good as the first and an exceedingly enjoyable adventure romp.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

These guys had no real plot and chose to fill the time with really valueless retreads from their own lives and much better films. I believe that: 1.

She wanted to see it because she likes the story; I was more focused on make-up, special effects and computer generation. Neither of us was disappointed.Positives: excellent costuming, great make up and special effects, and some very good computer generation. Captain Jack's First Mate pretty much stole the show, as far as I am concerned. Very strong, solid performance. Choreographed fight scenes VERY well done - lots of fun to watch.Bitter/Sweet: lots of silliness in this film. If it was intended to be silly and dumb, success. If the filmmaker was serious with his silliness, he blew it. Silly IS fun, though.Negatives: TOO LONG! Could easily have been whacked by 1/2 hour - EASILY! Editing was amateurish; choppy. Johnny Depp seems stalled out in his creativity and execution: ""Pirates"" I & II and ""Chocolat"" seem to be rubber stamp characters, though there was more heart and depth in ""Chocolat."" Overall, I consider Mr. Depp a marginal actor.Additional Negative: Keira Knightly. Difficult to look at, from a physical perspective (facially unfortunate), but more difficult to watch as a performer. Miscast in this role, to my way of thinking. It was a chance she took in her career, one she should probably not repeat.Overall: see the film. No one under 12 should see it, for several scenes are inappropriate for younger children (quite gory and graphic). 12 and over? Yes - see it as a family and enjoy!

This time, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley re-team with director Gore Verbinski to create a wild and crazy extension of the first film which includes more intense fight scenes, special effects, and (of course) a dabble of rum and romance.In the film, Sparrow is the target of the slimy, squirmy Davey Jones; Sparrow owes him his soul and the only way to avoid serving a lifetime on Jones' ship is to find the chest that contains his heart. And what other way could this all be accomplished without the help of his friends Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner? Familiar faces and fresh ones as well round out the roster, including a run-in with a tribe of cannibals.As expected, Johnny Depp performs above and beyond as Captain Jack. His comedic performance, as well as his serious one, set the tone for the film and keeps the audience rolling with laughter. Orlando Bloom still seems a bit stiff in his character, but it's definitely an improvement from the first film. And Keira Knightley blows her role out of the water, especially in her scenes with Depp. Finally, Bill Nighy's performance as the stunningly CGI-ed Davey Jones was incredible considering the fact that he was almost unrecognizable.If anything, this sequel proves that Pirates can do no wrong. With a comedic darkness and a wonderfully tricky ending that only Disney could get away with, it's lucky that a third film lingers on the horizon for summer 2007. Until then, die-hard fans can settle for seeing the film multiple times this July. Take it from me- I saw it twice in the first 24 hours it was released. Yar matey!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But went to see the movie, it was much better than I thought it would be.However, the film was way too long and it became hard to concentrate on what was going on. Also, the plot had so many parts to it, and was so completely muddled, that you spend most of the film trying to work out what the hell is going on.But it's not all bad, as with the first movie, it was'nt the plot that was important, but the visuals and Johhny Depp. (ehehe) Firstly, the CGI effects are amazing, especially on the squid-like Davy Jones, who's tentacles move around in different directions; his fishy like crew are also very cleverly done.There is also much more humour in the DMC, compared to the first film. Many hilarious laugh out moments provided by Jack Sparrow, which were probably the highlights of the film.The fight scenes are very spectacular too, combining humour and amazing stunts, one scene included a sword fight on a rolling waterwheel.Johnny Depp on top form (as usual) as Jack Sparrow, as is Kevin McNally as Gibbs. However, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom did not act very well, and they did'nt do much in the film except stand around look nice.Overall the movie, was too long and too complicated, with some poor acting. However, stunning visuals, comedy and piratey fun make this movie, good, light entertainment. Just make sure you've seen The curse of the Black Pearl first, or you won't get many parts of the film.see this if you love the first movie and Johnny Depp, but prepare to be slightly confused.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The only thing that I have to say against it is that you with all the different plots it took me a couple of times of watching it to understand what was going on (also the battle between The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman was a little iffy to me in how it was thought up but when you think about it, it's pirates so what do you expect). The movie actually reminded me a lot of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back in how something happened to the hero in both movies (Han Solo got put into carbon freeze and Jack git sent to Davey Jones' Locker) as well as how the main characters were constantly pursued by Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. One thing that I noticed the first time watching it is that you see a different side of Jack in this movie than in the first movie in that he's not the quick-witted, mad, rum-drinker but more of an urgent, sort of cowardly and sometimes ruthless individual trying to get away at all costs. To be honest the love plot between Will and Elizabeth was really getting on my nerves but the idea of Norrington coming back as a drunk was hilarious. But overall the main reason why I liked this movie was because of Davey Jones who in my opinion is the poster-villain from here on in as everything he said and did was just ruthless (I still can't get over the first line he says in the movie when he threatens the dying sailor and he's smoking a pipe as he says ""Do you fear death?"" and even worse when the other sailor declines his offer to join his crew and he signals his second-in-command to kill him)- whoever had the idea of inserting DAvey Jones in the sequel was a genius because that separated the second from the first and in effect possibly made the second into its own movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

You may remember my review of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" whereby I had mixed feelings at the start, then grew to love it and give it the ultimate blessing by adding it to my elite DVD collection (read ""economic"" - erm...small). I started getting the same mixed feelings as this one started, this could have been something to do with the countless, riotous teenage girls running around the cinema in their little hooker outfits, clutching their Nokia's and texting their mates sitting two rows behind. Then five minutes later running and giggling to another part of the cinema, the last place being directly in front of Sarah and I - a few strong words and they disappeared, leaving us to enjoy the film.I think it was my inability to relax for the first 30 minutes, after which I settled into viewing mode, abolished all criticism from my mind and enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining reintroduction to the old faces.Johnny Depp continues to amuse with his drunken drool and carefree attitude, while Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly appear to be acting in a completely different film all together, while Depp eases into his eccentric character, Bloom and Knightly look like they are better off playing Romeo and Juliet at London's Palladium.The over-dramatic portrayals are very soon forgotten though, as we see some great favourites grace the waters from the previous film. Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg & Mackenzie Crook) play a much appreciated, larger part in this story and add their usual hilarious antics. We also see the return of Norrington (Jack Davenport) as a washed up drunk, after losing his honourable standing as Elizabeth's intended in the previous instalment.What really makes the film are the new characters. With new consequences, predicaments and locations, we meet people like Tia Dalma (The black witch), Bootstrap Bill and a tribe of hungry cannibals. But without doubt, by the far the best treat has to be Davy Jones, his crew and his ship, the Flying Dutchman. Bill Nighy, unrecognisable, portrays the idiom in octopus/man form who, along with his frighteningly fantastic crew have spent too long at the bottom of the sea and are barely recognisable as humans, more so as aquatic beasts. The ship itself is a sight to behold, like an organic mass of seaweed and barnacles, the whole effect makes for excellent viewing.I do have to mention the scene on the white, sandy beach where Elizabeth is trying to break up the testosterone induced sword fight -a pointless and embarrassing viewing experience. Certainly one for the cutting room floor in my opinion. Perhaps the story line itself could have been improved upon, but as a Walt Disney, 12A film I didn't expect this to be up to much and it is more than made up for by action, fantasy and hilarity.The film ends on a cliff hanger, ready for the next instalment, next year, where I am sure we will be served up more of the same, comfortably entertaining performance. Oh, and Keith Richards, apparently!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The jam-packed story picks up relatively soon after the point where the last one left off with spunky Elizabeth Swann about to marry adventurer Will Turner. Complications come in the form of British East India Trading Company's Lord Cutler Beckett, who charges the couple with conspiring to help Sparrow escape from the company's clutches. Death is their fate unless they can secure Sparrow's magical compass for Beckett. Sparrow has troubles of his own as he has sold his soul to the legendary dawn-of-the-dead pirate, Davy Jones, fabled captain of the Flying Dutchman, in exchange for the right to command his vessel, the Black Pearl. Sparrow's one option is to find the key to a chest containing Jones' still-beating heart.The story lines eventually collide but not before the main characters run into a voodoo woman, Tia Dalma, full of mystical advice on how to get the key; Elizabeth's jilted swain, Commodore James Norrington, out for revenge against Will; Will's lost-soul father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, somewhere between life and death; and a mammoth, octopus-like sea monster named Kraker. After a shaky start with far too much exposition, director Gore Verbinski gets the momentum finally going in the second hour with heart-racing action escalating in both scope and absurdity, although screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tend to layer all the developments in a most convoluted manner. Despite the pacing problems, what I do like about the film is its persistently irreverent tone and the way death is treated not as the final end but as a relative inconvenience. From my perspective, this is what makes the movie's spirit come alive for a contemporary viewer.Beyond Depp's devilishly clever performance, the real star is unsurprisingly the CGI-generated special effects, whether it's Jones and his ocean-morphed crew of half men/half sea creatures (the hammerhead shark is a particularly creepy figure to watch); Kraker and its engulfing destruction (though this gets repetitive in the story); or the variety of memorable action set pieces, such as the Black Pearl crew swinging in a ravine to escape their suspended spherical cages, or concurrently, Sparrow precariously maneuvering a pole where he inadvertently becomes part of a fruit shish kebob. My favorite set piece is the runaway waterwheel on the island where Will, Norrington and Sparrow are preoccupied with their swashbuckling and the search for the chest. The audacious silliness of these action sequences is what keeps the movie afloat.Both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return from the first film as Elizabeth and Will. Looking beautiful, even disguised as a boy, Knightley has been promoted into more of an action role here and handles her part with aplomb. Bloom is still a relatively colorless presence but fulfills the heroic dimensions of the part almost by default. As Davy Jones, Bill Nighy is able to create an intriguing character underneath the CGI-generated visage of octopus tentacles, and in a tribute to Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", has a great scene where he plays the numerous keys of a pipe organ all at once. Granted, at 150 minutes, the epic movie does run too long for the story it tells, and the lumbering series of climaxes seems excessive. Regardless, it's still grand fun thanks to Depp and the oozing, barnacle-encrusted realism of the CGI effects.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not to worry. Cast and crew of this second in a BRAND NEW, never before read or seen trilogy, have catered to fan's hopes and beyond.The movies' incredible eye-popping details shock, confound, amuse and at times send audience members cringing in unison with Captain Jack himself. This movie follows our favorite characters from the first Pirates film as they continue on with their endeavors and their destinies are woven out before them. With Sparrow restored to his command as captain of the Black Pearl, viewers witness what a pirate's brutal life plundering at sea is all about. You might even find yourself feeling as if you are aboard the long loved Pirates of the Caribbean ride a couple times.Unlike previous trilogies such as Lord of the Rings, the makers of the Pirates films have no book to lean on whilst scripting and designing sets and scenes. Even so, an impossible amount of innovative detail was poured into this film as tastefully as hot maple syrup over a stack of pancakes. The originality and creative particulars are undeniably refreshing when so many movies continue to flow onto the big screen void of any resourcefulness and harboring painfully obvious plots.The makers of Dead Man's Chest have delivered a spectacular and captivating film that will keep the wheels in your head spinning without being strictly serious. This movie's got humor, action, horror, adventure, fantasy, heck, even a spot of romance. It's a must see, and if anything will leave you entertained and poses the threat of drawing you back for more next year.WARNING!!!

We missed out on the first day and part of the second because there was others who felt the exact same way! Even though the movie did run a bit long, the action never stopped and by the end, I was ready for a break to catch my breath! The movie is what I was expecting with more CGI characters and over the top swashbuckling sword fights! I wasn't disappointed! The whole movie is set up to lead to the third installment and I can only imagine what craziness has been thought up for that! You will need to see the first film to follow the characters and their motivation and get the ending of this one!!! Oh yeah, a surprise ending made me, and every one else in the theater, have an aha moment! I won't spoil anything about the movie if you are planning on seeing it. Just know that the action is quite over the top and the story is pure fantasy as are the characters, but we aren't going to see this movie for true to life historical fact now are we? It's like a ride at DisneyWorld on the big screen! Grab your popcorn and make sure your arms and legs are in your seat before the ride begins!!! ENJOY!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Orlando Bloom rises to the occasion here in DMC, and is given a great deal more to do -- mostly rescue Elizabeth, Jack and the rest of the crew who have fallen into the clutches of Davy Jones. Kiera Knightly has her way with the men and manages to kick-a$$ while doing it.All in all, a terrific summer blockbuster, well worth your money, that will send you away with a grin on your face and a really bit desire to see the third movie asap !!!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Do not get me wrong, but I am totally in love with the way Johnny Depp portrays every character he plays, and he did fantastic with Jack. However, the movie was wrought with overzealous action scenes, such as the Kraken attacking the boat 3 times. A bit too much I think. It is not likely to earn any specific awards or outstanding achievements, but it is still a good movie to just chill out and watch. Also, I have never particularly liked the way Orlando Bloom acts, it's always stiff, with little facial emotion/expression, and it is hard for me to be enraptured by him, unlike Johnny. Though, Orlando did do significantly better this time around. Keira Knightley was quite good, yet I was disappointed in the little screen time she had. And I was completely and utterly surprised by what she did towards the end. Of course, I won't spoil it for the readers, but to me, not a very commendable attribute. I also thoroughly enjoyed watching Lord Beckett, played by Tom Hollander, because every time he spoke, I was reminded of his character Mr. Collins in the movie Pride and Prejudice. It's quite amusing to see such a small man play such strong characters. There were many times I laughed, but sometimes, the endless amount of hilarity was still a bit too much. But, even with it's torrent of clichéd jokes, it will become a classic, and I would recommend it to anyone. I heartily enjoyed many parts of this movie, and good healthy criticism never hurt anybody.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Missing from the film was the charm and dry witty humor of the first, which was sadly replaced only by rum jokes.

So i had high hopes for this sequel. Although sequels are often spell disaster, it seemed this one would be like spiderman II or x-men II. When i watched Pirates II I was frustrated by two aspects. One, the decidedly dark overtones that throw our main characters into a love triangle. Two, the fact this movie relays so heavily on a third installment. The first movie i think succeeded because because it ran with a rather fantastic premise and was self referential enough that you actual become comfortable with the movie and just enjoy the adventure; which wraps itself up by the end. i did enjoy this movie, but felt that it hurt itself by losing the lighter elements and concise plot line of the first movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Although I was afraid this movie would struggle because the story almost concluded in The Pearl, I was surprised to find that it was done quite well, having a great new plot with two completely new villains Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones and his crew of waterlogged miscreants. The story involves Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and Will (Orlando Bloom) setting out on a quest to find Jack (Johnny Depp) to save their marriage and their freedom. Dead Mans Chest, although taking a while to warm up, has a much deeper and darker plot, exploring and deepening each character, twisting comedy, romance, horror and adventure all into the one movie. The last 10 minutes is very intense, and the end is a cliffhanger that makes you want Pirates of the Caribbean 3. Apart from this, the movie still has its funny bits and the same great humor form Cpt. Jack. It's a Great Ride, doing Black Pearl the justice that it deserves.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Also, if you enjoy long movies, this is for you. The film is one of surprises and tense scenes, rather surprising from a Disney movie. The film is also rather dynamic, and quite expansive on the geography, which gives the feel for these pirates because you feel you've sailed the same waters that they have. The beauty of this is that, to some degree, you can choose a character to make a reference from and you still get the same experience from another character.

Don't hold your breath for realism (but then if you saw the first one... you'd know better).All your favorite characters are back, doing more of what they're good at. It's more fun than the first one - but like so many sequels, it excels because it doesn't have to do all the character exposition of the first, it can spend more time on frivolity because you already know the characters and their relationships.Probably one of the best movies of 2006 - enjoy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Luckily the sequel retains the sense of fun of the prequel. However, it lacks the surprise the unexpectedly brilliant first did. That's not to say that this is a poor film. Not at all. Indeed, the central action sequences (the island escape near the beginning and the climatic big wheel sequence especially) are terrific, with an excellent sense of humor that had me laughing out loud, to use that annoying internet phrase. The CGI is excellent, especially Davy Jones himself. And of course, Johnny Depp. What can I say, this man deserves an Oscar for his wonderfully campy Captain Jack - he was so cruelly denied one first time around.Yet this film is not perfect. The film begins very slowly indeed, taking a good half hour to really kick off, with some confusing plot strands required to set up sequences of events (indeed, the whole cast is not reunited until well past halfway into the film). Yet the major problem lies in the poor casting of Orlando Bloom, whose quite frankly irritating hero struggles to hold the screen when Capn Jack is absent.Overall however, this is a fine film. The surprisingly lengthy running time flies by, and Pirates is many times more enjoyable than 90% of other blockbusters due to it's sense of humor, style and fun. I must admit I'm looking forward to chapter three of this continuing quality franchise.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I believe that the main problem with this movie is that it felt as though it was going on forever. Further, the director made the decision to forego significant and interesting plot points for, at best, mediocre special effects. In the first movie the special effects jumped out at you because the characters were ""normal"" for most of the movie as appose to this movie, which is more like Star Wars in that the monsters are always monsters. Also the characters were portrayed abysmally. For example in the first movie Elizabeth Swan is totally revolted by Capt. Jack Sparrow and is the perfect lady throughout most of the adventure; however, in the new movie she becomes a pirate like character in very little time and goes so far as to kiss Capt. Jack Sparrow.

Keeping in mind that this is a Disney movie, there are no complex story lines or plot twists. Yet it was a great time. Johnny nailed the part of Captain Jack Sparrow perfectly and he is just too funny. We laughed the entire time both times we went to see it. If you are a loyal fan of Curse of the Black Pearl, go see Dead Man's Chest. If you haven't seen CotBP yet, watch it before you go see DMC or it wont be quite as funny because you wont understand the jokes.This movie fully lived up to its ""Summer Blockbuster"" tag. I plan on seeing it again and again and again. It's fully worth the $7 to get in and see it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I found it disjointed, confusing at times...... Bummer, because the special effects were fine and Johnny was fine, and the characters also, fine. I felt as though scenes were created just for their effect and dragged on too long and did not necessarily move the story along.I find it confusing that the dead can feel a whip and drink rum and need rest, when in the first movie 'the dead' could not taste food or experience the feelings of living. I appreciate a script that considers that audience members have intelligence. Any fantasy needs a touch of realism to pull you into the story so that you can suspend thought and believe. I was too often made to realize that I was in a theatre","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Jack's entrance was predictable yet still good, the story was going well (a bit random, too) and then in the middle of the movie, it sank.I am a huge fan, I waited over 17 hours to get screening tickets for the first movie. But I tried not to get myself too excited about this one since sequels usually eat it. Around an hour or hour and a half into the movie, nothing made sense. The monkey still had ""the curse"" yet the others didn't. Jack was acting like...well not really Jack. He lost ALL his morals and loyalty which in the end he usually comes around but didn't. The first minute I heard Will Turner talk, I thought ""You pay him millions of dollars to say lines like a soap opera star?"" (I am a fan of him and I love him but this wasn't his best movie) And Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) was acting like a lunatic slut. Everyone was out of character, mostly, except the bird on that guy's shoulder.Then after about 3 million twists, you practically want to die. There were wonderful scenes in there but they were stretched out to the extent of making me want to fall asleep. It was about 20% lower in quality as for the all around movie itself compared to the original. I did like the idea of the Crack'n (not to much of those stupid squid people) but the movie really didn't follow the rules of the plot. I wish I saw more of a PIRATE movie then a Squid-meets-Final Fantasy X. BUT THE ENDING IS AWESOME. I really hope to dear god the next one is better or I feel like I wasted over 24 hours of waiting in line from the past 2 movies.See it if you're bored and have 2 and a half hours to kill. And don't mind watching disgusting humor.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This sequel proves to be an even less attractive commodity: the epitome of the empty-headed and over-produced summer blockbuster, the film is tiresomely long while providing nothing that's remotely new, very little plot (with the much-sought titular object coming to little purpose!) and an over-abundance of effects (there are about four separate attacks by The Kraken alone!) to make up for its lazy scripting.While the original was supposed to evoke the Saturday matinée' adventure films of old, this one has little real feeling for the genre; the accent is on the supernatural (what this has to do with a pirate film in the first place is baffling to say the least, and doesn't work quite as much as the film-makers seem to think either!) which allows the make-up department a free hand to create the silliest-looking creatures this side of the ""Star Wars"" saga! The stars seem to be merely going through the paces this time around: Johnny Depp overdoes the roguish charm (again!), while Orlando Bloom is as bland as ever; Keira Knightley, after her star-making turn in the original, is under-used here (as if the film-makers didn't quite know what more to do with her!). As for the 'ghosts', we have a ridiculously-tentacled main villain played by the little-known Bill Nighy (who had previously appeared in another saga which vulgarized a myth {or two}, the ""Underworld"" films) and Stellan Skarsgard (making little impression) as Bloom's 'undead' pirate father.The film ends on a cliffhanger on the lines of the first entry in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" saga and also features an uncredited bit by Geoffrey Rush (turning up at the end to reprise his role from the first installment in the series, whose third episode is already being filmed...which means that we have to suffer through another Summer of this). Mind you, the film is entertaining enough in a mindless {sic} sort of way, but it's all overkill in the end...and, really, the creators of this franchise ought to think more of their audiences rather than merely thinking of how to fill their own pockets (this film's phenomenal box-office performance is preposterous)!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is a sequel that begins a new quest, this time to find dead man's chest. It ends set up for the third film that is its conclusion. The first film stands alone, but sets up many of the characters in this new adventure.The special effects are just as good and there is a new villain, Davy Jones, whose tentacles have a mind of their own. The new dead pirates on Jones' ship were cool, there was the one with the hammer head and shell head, just really cool. We don't get to see much of the Kraken until the end, but when we see it's mouth, wow! Also, Johnny Depp is once again great and the humor is back. I thought it was almost as funny as the first. And I thought the plot made sense. I don't agree with all these reviews saying it was too long, plot hard to follow. I thought it was very entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first, this is a must see. I will go see the third film in the theater. It opens this weekend.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The personalities of the characters are even different, often noticeably so. A complete waste of an amazing cast.I own The Curse of the Black Pearl on DVD, it's one of my favorite movies. I plan on going to see Dead Man's Chest once more just because I feel like I must have missed something, but I sincerely doubt I'll purchase it.After The Curse of the Black Pearl, I was expecting another exemplary addition to the Pirates of the Caribbean saga. In that, I was utterly disappointed. In my book, Dead Man's Chest goes down as another horrible sequel that never should have been attempted since it's obvious no one cared about getting it right.In closing, please note this is my personal opinion. The friends I went to see the movie with loved it, I often tend to hold movies to higher technical standards than the average viewer.You know what's even worse than watching a horrible movie? Knowing it could have been so much better. There was so much potential here... ruined.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

I hoped the movie would be at least as good as the first one, and in fact it was. Not better, nor a terribly memorable movie; not much to think about after it ended, but while it lasted it was very funny and enjoyable - a worthy follow-up to the original.Well, one thing to think about might be the subplot about Elizabeth really being more interested in Jack than in Will... but we'll have to wait until the next movie to see if there's some real meat on that hook.I did think this movie was a bit too long. It had many great scenes and sequences, but at 150 minutes there were also some passages that were too long and boring. But it did have a lot of details, which was good.Johnny Depp was of course the spice of the movie, while Bloom and Knightley, as in the original, were adequate. Not great, not bad, but all right. Jonathan Pryce was good (as he always is), and I did wonder if Davy Jones was actually played by someone, or if he was fully CGI. Turns out he was being played by another brilliant Brit, Bill Nighy (hell, what would Hollywood do without all the British acting talent?!), which explains why he was so good.Next movie, I'm primarily looking forward to the return of Geoffrey Rush's character - and another generous helping of Johnny Depp's inimitable Jack Sparrow, of course!A pirate's life for me! Nah, not really! :-)My rating: 8 out of 10. Same as the first.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There are some scenes of violence that are not grotesque, but questionable. There is no sex, some kissing, but very clean. Some jokes are little ""grown-up"" for some kids, but the adults will definitely like them. I give this movie as thumbs up as I can.... which is only two, but if I had more I would give more!

It's running time is unnecessarily long at 2 and a half hours.

Some films, such as Kill Bill, have plots designed over two films and it works fine for Kill Bill. However, the plot for Pirates 2 is rather convoluted and consequently, the ""to be continued..."" tag seems to mean ""we want you to pay to see the next film"" or ""we've messed up this plot and will finish it later"". Quite simply, unless you go to see the third film, you will not discover what happens.

But Dead Man's Chest is, in comparison, quite ugly.The film itself is quite long, which is the first problem I had with it. When watching it, I found that there were scenes that either dragged on or were just unimportant that had been included in it, consequently making the film to be quite a chore to watch. I'm also speaking in terms of the actions sequences, in particular, one sequence, which lasted quite a few minutes longer than necessary.Secondly, I didn't feel the characters as they were in the original. They seemed to lack the emotion, with the exception of Depp, who made a magnificent return. Bloom was quite bland in his acting, as was many of the other characters. Knightley was average, I suppose, but her performance was outdone by Depp's, but that's no surprise.As far as the plot of the movie is concerned, I believe it was quite satisfying and entertaining, and rather simple to follow. The plot twist and cliffhanger ending makes up for it, in the end.However, one thing that dragged from the film significantly was it's concern with being aesthetically pleasing, above all. Though the camera has captured some magic, it only highlights the rest of the film's faults.But, I loved the movie.

Funny, Interesting, captivating and spectacular are all words that could be applied to the latest instalment of POTC. There are so many trilogy's that have failed their audiences at the second helping but I have to say that this movie was not one of them. There is more action, better special effects and a well written storyline that beautifully follows on from the first one. The humour is still present and correct, and further development of the characters only serves to make you love them even more. This movie feels more in depth. The first only served to skim over the surface of what these movies are about, setting up a taster of what is ahead. New characters enrich the movie and all of the actors (with the exception of Depp who is always captivating to watch) seem to have got better at what they do. POTC - Dead Man's Chest is a fantastic movie with an unexpected ending that leaves you begging for more - I personally cant wait until next summer and if I could I would book my seat now!!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

HOWEVER, don't be fooled, as i almost was. just pay attention to all the seemingly unfitting pieces, and your patience will soon be rewarded with one of the few sequels i've ever seen that truly matches it's original's greatness.the humor and lines of the first film that have fast become a staple of pop-culture, especially those of Captain Jack, are most certainly not skipped here. nor are the magnificent sets and effects, the in-depth history set behind the plot, the unpredictable twists and turns, or the intense action sequences. you will either find yourself laughing, mesmerized, attentive, surprised, or teetering on the edge of your seat for the entire length of the film. i guarantee, no dull moment is to be found.all the characters were perfectly acted (no squirming in your seat from a horribly over-acted scene) and just as you remember them from the first film, if not better and improved to just the right extent without seeming obvious. (one character especially, and you will love him/her all the more for it.) they all, of course, change a little according to the new plot, as any character must. but the personality we know and loved from each is still there, matured to just the right amount for a seamless and believable fit to the passage of time.specifically the supporting cast, all the characters you loved and expected from the first film, and a few you may not expect, take the stage once more. it's as if none of them have even removed their pirate garb; so in-character is each one kept. and plenty of new characters also await; their stories told just as masterfully as the old ones first were, you soon know them and they blend perfectly into the new on-screen family they occupy.the verdict? take everything that you loved about the first Pirates film, expand it twice over, and you will have ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; truly the original's greatness put to justice, as all sequels should.big screen's the only way to see this one mate. Can't wait for the third installment! i hope you all enjoy! Chef13","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is also very funny at times and has a couple dramatic moments as well. It may get a tad overwhelming at times with everything it has got going on, but fortunatley that also makes its two and a half hour running time flow by. It doesn't exactly captivate you as much as the first one did, but it adds the cherry to the sundae with an excellent, semi-cliffhanger ending that gets you twitching for the third enstallment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Was fun to see the characters back in action against a new enemy ( a big sea creature amongst many other horrors from the deep). Was saddened that Barbosa wasn't in this one. I enjoyed it but I did not rate this as high as the first. All the way through the film (and I hope I was the only one), I got the sense of seen it before. I actually could easily go to make dinner and come back to find I hadn't missed much. Two of the characters are actually starting to annoy me. Miss Swan and William Turner. Try hard was all I could think of. The film did have some nice touches but the sense of adventure was pretty much lost when you could predict what was going to happen. Nice touches being the excellent CGI (the sea captain, I could even tell who was acting it). Some excellent stunts and huge ship fights didn't fail to disappoint. Still I'm looking forward to the next film, and who wouldn't. It's like Harry Potter.

I absolutely adored the first movie, and was somewhat disappointed with this one. Johnny Depp was superb in this, as usual. Davey Jones is disgustingly incredible. One thing that I think was the main reason I was displeased was because they didn't make the scenes blend nicely, they kind of jumped around a bit. A friend of mine phrased it nicely ""By the end of the movie, I felt like I was on a very long ride that I wanted to get off of soon."" I agree with that statement. Some of the scenes were those that were better suited for a video game than a live action film. They were very unrealistic. The costuming and make-up of the film, though, were some of the best I have seen in years. Davey Jones and his crew looked as though they have just spent the last 50 years on the bottom of the ocean, became mutated, and crawled back on land. Very nice. Captain Norrington was also spectacularly costumed. Johnny's make up was perfectly suited for his character. Over all, the film was pretty good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","My diagnosis is blockbuster-sequelitis","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1531548/?ref_=tt_urv","Flagrant-Baronessa","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5513934/?ref_=tt_urv","26 November 2006","I can impossibly outline the plot of Dead Man's Chest so I will just say that the story centres around finding the titular object with all the detours and diversions that this quest entails. Owing to these, the film is a chaotic extravaganza, puffed full of story lines, and camp as a row of tents. It scores higher with me than the original did simply because this adventure knows how ridiculous it is and how much it suffers from blockbuster-sequelitis  and Gore Verbinski makes no pretense about it. The result is fun, big, bigger, epic. Although I never saw Dead Man's Chest in the theatre, I can easily imagine what the atmosphere must have been like during the premiere week. The responsive contingent of tittering and giggling teenage girls must surely have elevated it about generic adventure movie formula. What's more is that the vivid CGI extravaganza of special effects not only merits a big screen, but demands it for the optimal experience. Dark City/The Crow cinematographer Dariusz Wolski takes a big gulp out of the lush murky jungles and the epic marine battles, creating an unspeakably captivating setting through aerial shots. There are two aspects that follow Wolski's style: polite nods to horror and shots so dark you can hardly make out the action. Nevertheless the cinematography is arguably one of Dead Man's Chest's goldmines.Conversely, the acting side of the tapestry is wristslashingly poor. This is quite a feat when employing the skills of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy, Stellan Skarsgård and Johnny Depp  so kudos on that. I don't suspect I need to comment on Bloom and Keira, but let me debunk the myth that Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Jack Sparrow. If unforgivably over-the-top and staged is your cup of tea then maybe you will enjoy his style of acting. In fact Depp displays the theatrics a high school drama student would resort to in the annual Christmas play. Perhaps Jack Davenport who reprises his role as Norrington is the light of the film. For one, he no longer looks like a Popsicle, but a scruffy, rugged pirate. Yarr! The backlot backstabbing that goes on in the triumvirate of Depp, Davenport and Bloom proves inexplicably entertaining at times.But the script is one big sketchbook mess. It is the type of thing that a 12-year-old boy would conjure up whilst scribbling down a few ideas in math class. Dead Man's Chest is bursting with the flair, comedy, fantasy, action, horror and (backseated) romance of an impatient author. Even if you are a token Disney dog you will get your own storyline. This tells me someone in charge just needs to pause for a second and reconsider serious condensation storywise  lose a few characters. Another fatal flaw in the script stage is the laziness that it applies to crafting its characters. It becomes apparent within minutes of the film that it relies solely on Jack Sparrow for comedy  and worst of all, it does not even bother to give him good lines or situations, but expect the audience to find the mere facial expressions of Depp 'hysterical'. If you are a fawning fangirl you probably will.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a dizzyingly fast paced and complex film (it gets so complex that at one point there is a pause and a comedic sidekick gets to explain the plot to the audience) with numerous layers, except when it comes to its one-dimensional characters. Some of these prove quite smirkworthy with their assigned quirks and undoubtedly little time is left to reflect on the quality of the whole spectacle. Even remotely 'serious' scenes are interrupted by pratfalls or whacked-out action sequences that boldly transcend the boundaries of logic (rolling wheel and rolling ball comes to mind). The good news is that amidst the fast-paced navigation of the marine action world, time is a non-issue. 150 minutes? Feels like 90. Still, if you want perfect adventure camp I highly recommend The Mummy (1999).6 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can honestly say that we were all entertained throughout. It's just that the first movie was very character driven - yes, I know it had tons of good special effects - but, it was the characters, their development and relationships, that formed the connection between the audience and the movie. This movie, with its action and special effects, is a little like having a really sweet, chocolate desert for dinner. While you enjoy it and relish every bite, when you are finished there's just a vague sense of being left unsatisfied.... of wishing your meal had had a little more substance, a little less fluff.

I love movies but hate theaters. But I was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball, it was 95 degrees at the nearly shade-less softball complex, and the small town theater had $4 matinée prices. About midway through I got a headache but that could have been from the 32 ounce slushy rather than the film. Considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theater. Basically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one. It was really too long (most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this point). The assembly of the film was horrible, making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense. But it works fine as a comedy. Knightley's character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny. You could say the same for Depp and Bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast (a good thing in the cases of Davy Jones and the bubbling pair of Black Pearl crewman-a bad thing otherwise). While certainly better than recent CG mega-movie like ""King Kong"", the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand. These computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers (""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost 50 years ago) and the CG scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

After the final ""Pirates"" film comes out next year, I think I'll be saying the same about ""Dead Man's Chest"", and for essentially the same reasons. Which, of course, doesn't mean it's a bad movie, just not as great as its bookends.Actually there are quite a few similarities between these two films, but it would be extremely difficult to go into any details without including any spoilers. Suffice it to say that Captain Jack Sparrow and Han Solo have more in common than their roguish ways.DMC seems to suffer a bit from ""middle movie syndrome"". It has everything the first Pirates movie had -- action, adventure, comedy, romance, undead monkeys -- but it doesn't seem to always be sure of where it's going with it all. The characters and sets are, if anything, more colorful and impressive the second time around, but pacing problems make this longish movie (at 2 hours and 30 minutes) seem even longer. Fans of the series won't much care, though, especially as the third film is a certainty, and Dead Man's Chest sets the stage for a truly epic finale.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Over all pretty funny, and I did scream like a little girl once! I think it was special effect wise better than the first one. And much funnier than the first one. But I thought it left a lot of questions unanswered and forgot to fully explain new characters. So, you're watching scenes between these 2 or 3 people who are supposed to have some kind of meaningful past, but you don't know what type of relationship they had. So, you spend time trying to figure out what type or relationship it was instead of listening to the dialog they're having. And I'm not going to give away the ending, but I just think it was a bad ending.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Prevented from marrying Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and accused of piracy, Will (Orlando Bloom) leaves Port Royal with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in order to seek the heart of Davy Jones, the fearsome commander of the ""Flying Dutchman"". But Sparrow hides that he has more selfish reasons for that search: try to catch the man whom he promised his own soul. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other Collaborators.As often happens with big blockbusters, this is the predictable and awaited sequel to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The cast brings some new faces: Bill Nighy will play Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgård will play Bill Turner, Tom Hollander will play the villain, Cutler Beckett, and Naomie Harris will give life to Tia Dalma. But the most interesting is the evolution of the central characters, inherited from the previous film. Will reveals himself increasingly a true pirate, as his bride that, in this film, will take part in the action scenes, leaving skirts behind. Jack, on the other hand, is increasingly ambiguous and unpredictable: sometimes a hero, sometimes a villain, liar and deceiver, we never know what he is doing or thinking. The plot is fun and very interesting: each character has its own interests and reasons to find that heart, reasons that may be conflicting. The rivalry comes to the point that it's every man for himself and every fighting and deceiving each other. In technical matters, characterization and computerization deserves a word of congratulations. If they make a great job in the previous movie with the undead, now they surpassed it with the powerful and intimidating visual effect of the ""Flying Dutchman"" and its eternal crew.This film is, in my opinion, one of the best sequels I've seen so far, not only managing to maintain the continuity of the story, as becoming it more interesting, thanks to the evolution of characters, making clear the imminence of a third film also.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It gives everyone space to refresh the ideas and develop the characterisations. That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time, we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits, so can head straight to the action which for the next 2½ hours follows ""Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful ""Davy Jones"" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to enter hell. Meantime, ""Will"" (Orlando Bloom) and ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) are having problems of their own, and when he has to try to kidnap ""Jack"" with his compass for the dastardly ""Lord Beckett"" (Tom Hollander) in return for her safety he, en route, becomes reunited with his rather curmudgeonly (and barnacled) father (Stellan Skarsgård). It seems that both ""Will"" and ""Jack"" cannot both get what they need - but can they find a solution? It's end-to-end stuff this, with loads of mythical creatures from the depths, a tiny bit of romance and a Johnny Depp very much at the top of his game. The story is solid and entertaining, as is much of the quickly paced dialogue and David Schofield turns in a good effort as the malevolent ""Mercer"". I could have done with Geoffrey Rush but otherwise this is a fun fantasy adventure with some cracking visual effects and Hans Zimmer's music adds richness to the jollity too. A big screen must, really. It's just not so good on the telly.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

OK, it's probably better than a 1, since gems like Manos Hands of Fate are getting around 2, but I had to drop the average score a little bit. There is no way this movie is above a 5 on any scale. I was a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, and I love Disneyland - this one just failed to capture the swashbuckling and fun that the first one did. It just kind of dragged on for me to the point where I was ready to leave.First off, the pacing and storytelling are just plain awful. There are entire 30-40 minute scenes of the movie that could have been deleted and there would be no effect on the coherency of the movie. Maybe they were there just to show how cool Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were - but I didn't buy it. There are at least 5 different story lines, not one of which is really explained in any detail. There are also so many unexplained parts to the movie that you just wind up giving up and getting frustrated with it.Maybe I'm just jaded, but I couldn't find any suspense in this thing either. The focus is haphazard and you wind up not getting a feel for any of the characters. Johnny Depp, while a cool actor and character, I thought his character had no redeeming qualities about him. The other characters are pretty forgettable, and the performances are mediocre. The relationships between the characters were rushed and superficial.I didn't find myself connecting with anyone at all, and I didn't feel the characters connected with each other on screen either.This movie is total flash with about zero substance. If you love special effects and can overlook good character development, plot lines, and emotional development, this is the movie for you. For me, that's fine for an hour or hour and a half, but 2 and 1/2 hours is asking too much if you're above the age of 10.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Oftentimes, in the lore of adventure fantasy films, such a trait is met with disappointment. But not so with this one; Dead Man's Chest is a captivating, alluring and, coming out of the slightly fairly-tale air of its predecessor, pleasantly dark. The darkness issues from failed love, a man's inner torments which he wants to inflict upon others, and the visual gloom of the great ghost ship. Captain Jack Sparrow is as full of his paradoxical wits as ever. He is in his primes. We come to meet some of the aspects of his ""truer"" self which were too elaborate for the first film. Overall a tour de force of computer graphics and its manipulation to tell a human tale. Director Gore Verbinsky is masterful in telling his magical dark story. And without saying something about the soundtrack, all of this would be vain: the wrathful organ playing of Davy Jones is, in my opinion at least, one of the greatest pieces ever composed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As soon as he is not seen the narrative drops and is comprised of linking narrative so how this franchise expects to make a sequel without him is beyond me, he lights up the screen.However back to this film, it is full of CGI that actually stands the test of time. For instance many of the actors performed in grey training type pyjama suits with only their voices and motions used in the final film, even their eyes are CGI. You would never guess this even in 4K, so the film stands the test of time, and then some.Whilst firmly based in the authentic history of the time in terms of the weapons, clothing, choice of drink etc it is full of imagination so whilst the mythology rings true it is more from the Disney writers playbook than history. And who cares, take it for what is: a great romp of a story, wonderful acting, humour, slapstick and some fantastic old swashbuckling pirates. And who says we need a new female captain the we have always had Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly).Compared to more recent films, this film is simply brilliant.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was extremely lucky and managed to snag tickets for the 11:20 pm showing at El Capitan in Hollywood on opening night, July 7. There is no better place to see this movie, but that's another story.I loved, loved, loved the first Pirates. However, we all know that sequels almost never live up to the expectations of their ""parent."" This one completely and utterly falls into that category. The story is laborious, hard to follow (thanks to loud music overriding some key dialogue) and far, far too long.But the characters we know and love are back and doing their thing, to some nice laughs and gasps. The visual effects are mostly breathtaking (although a key shot near the end just screams green screen) and the locations enviously tropical. The non-dead ships look completely authentic at all times, unlike the unfortunate cardboard-cutout Dauntless of the first movie. I am almost sure the sets for Black Pearl were the same used in the Horatio Hornblower movies ""Mutiny"" and ""Retribution."" Keira Knightly looks hot, tanned, and nothing like the porcelain doll of the first movie. She looks just like she ought to - a bit roughed up and out of sorts, which is nice for the kind of people who hate it when women in movies pop out of bed at 3am and look like they've just stepped out of a salon. Johnny Depp is babe-a-licious as always, despite the effeminance of his character. I am not sure effeminance is a word, so let me just say he is not a tenth as macho as dear, dear Orlando, who completely stole my heart in this movie. I wasn't ready for that. The guy is gorgeous, gorgeous, and more gorgeous. I went expecting to have Johnny Depp reclaim me, but the movie mostly centers around Orlando (Will Turner) and he carries it deliciously well.Jack Davenport is back, but ladies, you'll be slightly disappointed at his rag-tag appearance. The guy with the wooden eye still yearns for a real one and chases his around a few times (thankfully not as often as in the first movie, which became tedious and repetitive). Stellan Skarsgaard, although hidden behind some nasty marine growth, is passionate and moving in his brief appearances. There is no mistaking that the cast, including all the new characters, was perfect.Now for the bad part. The action sequences. Except for the part in the jungle in the beginning (inside the cages), I was tired of being beat over the head with ""wow look how cool this is"" stunts. Gentlemen, you needn't extend an already visually overloaded movie into one of total incoherence. There are two subsequent shots near the end that nearly sent me vomiting from vertigo (I know, tmi) and the rolling wheel thingie seemed like it would never end. There were so many spots in the movie that would have benefited from a bit of snip-snip, or perhaps just not so many quick shots jumbled together so that we can't see which end is up and who got shot where and when and by whom.All in all, the action sequences involving our non-CGI characters did not seem plausible to me. They were given almost superhuman strength and endurance, which is something I would rather see in Fantastic Four II than Dead Man's Chest. The first movie managed to master realistic choreography, but this one did not. Quite unfortunate.I promised to not spoil the movie, so I won't go any further. See it and judge for yourself. There are many pleasant surprises. I enjoyed it immensely but perhaps it was because I had three cups of coffee that I could stay awake all the way through it. Four people in my row in the movie theater briefly fell asleep because they could not follow the story. And these were die-hard fans who got tickets for opening night, mind you.Bottom line: Would have been better if it was shorter and less action-packed. I really needed a moment to breathe and I never got one.Still, I can't wait for the third movie!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Is a summer adventure movie supposed to feel like this? I think not. This trio simply doesn't stand up to the greats I'm afraid- remember Luke, Han and Leia- 'nuff said.I simply didn't have a great deal of fun watching this movie- everything seemed to contrived and cynical- big set pieces ham-fistedly tacked onto one of the most poorly developed story's I've come across in recent blockbusters. I went to see this with my bro and two friends- I and one of my buddies fell asleep about 3/4 of the way in for a good 5 or 10 minutes only to wake up to find that nothing had changed, still the same boring, joyless movie. All 4 of us were deeply disappointed come the end.Even the comedy fell short of the mark. Depp did his best, but didn't have same quality material to work with this time around.

I was confused almost the minute the film began. The plot of this film rushes by in a whirl of action and excitement. The scenes and stunts are spectacular, aided by the incredible performance of most of the actors. I was greatly impressed, but a lot of things in the story just didn't make sense to me. To give the filmmakers a little mercy, there was a huge storm the day I saw this film and the power went out twice. Add to that a few minutes absent from the theater, and I really shouldn't complain about constantly feeling I had ""missed something"". But I just got the impression that the filmmakers did not make everything as clear as they could have. I have no doubt that many of my questions will find answers come the release of the 3rd film. As an after note, I was rather annoyed by the character of Elizabeth Swan. She had a very abrasive personality. Whether this is a fault of Keira Knightly's performance, or an intentional addition by the filmmakers remains to be seen. But I don't remember her being that obnoxious in the 1st film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some parts around the beginning just felt unnecessary.But when Jack and co. are finished with fooling around and the plot of finding the chest to get rid of the infamous Davy Jones gets going, then the good stuff begins. And the Flying Dutchman and its crew are highlights in here, because never have I seen CGI that made me feel like it was real.Davy Jones is voiced brilliantly by Bill Nighy who makes his mark as a dispicable and merciless captain of the ship that's doomed to sail the seas forever.The visuals are the biggest highlight of Dead Man's Chest, because even though I enjoy the presence of Captain Jack Sparrow, the movie falls victim to a common fault in sequels of repeating much of the same seen in the previous movie. In this case it's only in the rather weak beginning until the main plot gets going.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is disrupted when a bloodthirsty corporate pipsqueak demands that they locate a compass in Captain Jack Sparrow's possession which he imagines will give him domain over the seas, while Jack finds himself forced to repay a debt to the ghastly Davy Jones - captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman - lest he become the latest ghoul addition to Jones' crew. One certainly cannot accuse the plot of sitting on its laurels...and that is the problem. The plot is overly busy and laden with unnecessary exposition which slows down the pace and allows the charm and fun from the original to wane. There are definitely comic highlights - such as a couple of madcap chases. The cast members are still in top form even when the screenplay fails to support them. Depp is chronically watchable in this role and nothing can change that fact. Jack Davenport gets more notes to play this time around as down-on-his-luck Norrington and Naomie Harris is a delightful addition as the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. Keira Knightley gets much more to do this time around and is fortunate enough to be thrown together with Depp. Orlando Bloom - who functioned as the heart of the original film - is saddled with a tiresome subplot, which finds him stuck for much of the film on the Flying Dutchman trying to ""rescue"" his father, played by a shell-shocked Stellan Skarsgard. It is a subplot that we cannot get behind and fails to have much impact. Similarly, the screenplay has characters that we should support betray each other repeatedly on a dime - including a late act development which is really hard to buy. Bill Nighy is visually impressive as the squid-like Davy Jones, but neither he nor sniveling Tom Hollander as the corporate stooge resonate with the viewer as strongly as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. The final moments set up the next installment and offer a glimmer that it may surpass this effort.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp wasn't as talkative or indeed around for as many scenes this time but as witty as usual. Looked less like a pirate this time - teeth too perfect, face less gaunt - too healthy altogether! Orlando was less 'Legolas' this time - growing in his role as Will Turner. To comment on Keira Knightly - what is she up to? Not acting anyway. There's a scene on a beach which should have been cut - when she had a temper tantrum - irritating to watch. I've seen her in King Arthur and of course Pirates 1 and thought she did a good job. I have only seen the film once yet so maybe I'm a bit early with my comments. Stellan Skarsgård makes an appearance - though not exactly a pretty one.

Also, Davy Jones' tentacle beard was way too creepy and it moved too much. It was all I could look at when he was in a scene. The plot was under-developed and I didn't really care for the characters.

However, POC's intention is to make three films the last two of which had to be connected to complete the adventure and resolve the characters. So, they're big challenge is to provide enough story and interest to not only entertain people with the second film, but carry their interest over into a third film.A point of potential story hazard is that POC 2 opens with some time passed between the first film and this gap has to be filled. Unless it is a film such as LOTR: Two Towers, which picks up exactly where the Fellowship left off. So, re-establish the characters and progress the story without being clumsy or losing people's attention within that period of lost time that exists outside the frame of the film. POC 2 does this effectively. The opening of the film not only establishes all the major characters and new ones, but it introduces a sustaining conflict that connects the sequel to the first film. Sure, the connection is a bit sparse and maybe not as strong as one could hope, but is nonetheless strong enough to push into the adventure. It's the consistency of this initial conflict that provides insight into the new character's motivations later. Although, the character in question becomes slightly too movie villain-ish and doesn't show any higher purpose other than greed. I often find this to be a constant in sequel villains, with the exception of Empire Strikes Back and Spider-Man 2. Villains are often given fewer dimensions than their predecessors which only hurt the viewer's involvement with the major struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. A good villain not only has reason, but also possesses moral and ethical attributes that lend sympathy to the character and make the actions of a villain not justified, but understood. POC 2 lacks this character. The opposition in the film is constantly doing wrong without an indication as to the reasons why from any human perspective. For example, the villain in Serenity does wrong to build a better world and has a strong sense of purpose in what he is doing and why it all has to be done. In Titus Andronicus, Queen Tamora swears to avenge the death of her son by General Titus's hand in the opening of the play. It is in that moment the audience is shown a relentless and pious Titus perform a cruel ritual to appease his Gods; in contrast to a rational and compassionate Tamora pleading for logic and apathy to prevail and her sons life to be spared. Throughout the play the characters trade place before arriving at neutral place, where both do not see humanity, but vengeance alone. Now, with that said I am not comparing Titus to Pirates of the Caribbean, but am suggesting that if we have something to learn from Shakespeare it is the dire need for a layered antagonist that views themselves as just in spite of everything around them. This is what POC 2 lacks, a villain with a true arch that shows the audience a duality they can diffuse in themselves. This shortcoming doesn't make the movie less enjoyable from a shallow entertaining, novelty aspect. It simply displaces the depth of the story in combination with the adventure. The villains are still grandiose, larger than life and nasty. They just lack the sympathy of even Captain Barbossa from the first film.The next pitfall in sequels is characters and their arch. Is a character starting from one point and shifting enough for the audience to see the difference. POC 2 indeed does this successfully and even embellishes a few hero moments for the core characters. All with the exception of the Elizabeth character which has grown from the pretty trollop of the first film that was merely a place marker for male lust to be projected; into a peer and fighting colleague of the boys, but at points, is still the trollop. The objection I have with the Elizabeth character is that she doesn't evolve consistently from the start of the movie. She actually regresses to the spoiled Governor's daughter that was introduced in the first film, just in a different gaze. Aside from some inevitable character embellishment Johnny Depp is poignant and engaging as Captain Jack Sparrow. Bloom is predictable and sympathetic, hits the few comedic moments he has quite well. Stellan Skarsgård is watch able under any amount of makeup. Jack Davenport (Norrington) is just as good, but his character isn't fully fleshed out, especially since the character was left on a sympathetic note at the end of the first film. I am not sure I understood the logic of his arch, but was watchable and earned more screen time in this film.All in all the film was really quite entertaining and fun despite its few embellished character and cliché moments. The climax of this film actually left me quite curious about the next film. If not for just the movie, then for some more of Depp's brilliant characterizations of his rock star Pirate. Plus the action scenes were really engaging and well thought out and only added more to the story rather than hindering it. This is even rarer these days. In a storm of trilogies and movie serials POC might hold to be one of the better ones.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is more like Matrix Reloaded than Empire Strikes Back.Now I cannot stress enough that Dead Man's Chest is NOT a bad movie. It is just a very different film to the original, however, there are quite a few problems. The first being the characters. Far too many pointless characters returned from the original, and although it is nice to see them, there are no where near enough new characters for us to get to know. All of Jack's crew are those from the original, no new pirates, apart from the enemies.Davey Jones is no where near as good an enemy as Barbossa, there does not seem to be much point in him, not many explanations as to why he is the way he is, he just happens to be there, and wants Captain's Jack's soul. At least Barbossa had a purpose and a goal. There are also very few scenes between Sparrow and Jones, making the whole chase seem a lot less personal.There are also far too many jokes related to the original. No new material, such as a joke referring to Jack always being slapped by women, the dog with the keys and strapping sea turtles to their legs. Some new jokes would have been nice, although it is nice to be reminded of The Curse of the Black Pearl.Those are the bad points, but it is still a good film. There are some amazing sequences, such as an amazing watermill based sword-fight and a hilarious chase between Captain Jack and a group of cannibals. It is a good action film, but not quite the fun fest of the original.But...with an amazing ending scene, and plenty set up for the third movie, perhaps all these problems will be nearly ironed out by the end of the trilogy. Let's hope. A good film, but if this was the first film, it would not have been well received.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This one not so much. THe plot for the entire movie could have been adequately told in a twenty minute movie, complete with fun action scenes and effects. Instead they extended every action scene far, far, beyond what it should've been, resulting in the gags getting old and boring, and spread the story out over far too much movie. After a while of this I found myself constantly wondering when the current scene was about to end, and eventually just wanting the whole damn movie to be over.The one thing about this movie I found anything approaching good was the effects. The effects teams did wonderful jobs and deserve their due.In the end though, none of this matters. The fan-boys and girls of Depp and the Pirates franchise will ogle over it and things it's great, the rest of us who enjoy more than mindless action scenes will find it dull and forgettable.Here's to hoping the third is better.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Orlando keeps his combat flair which is excellent in this movie.I would especially comment on the use of cgi in the movie. The creation of the character of Davey Jones and his crew on the Flying Dutchman is fantastic. The creepy, realistic looking octopus head with its tentacles and the crewmen's barnacle infested looks really give you the heebie jeebies!

He must seek the Captain Jack Sparrow whose compass points the way to a notorious dead man's chest. Not long after, they find themselves running from a bunch of undead pirates and a mythical creature known as the Kraken.We follow the adventures of the protagonists of the first installment as they must face once again a couple of supernatural creatures in order to achieve their goal. Once again, old tales will come to life and our heroes will have to do what it takes to make things right, at least for them.To start with the beginning, we have the same main characters as in the previous movie, but less developed and apparently, less involved in the outcome. Thus, you don't get to care so much about their fate, making the actions somewhat pointless. To make matters worse, the part which made the whole adventure a real treat, which is the comedy, somehow faded into the fog. It wasn't as present, as funny or as intelligent as it was before. They somehow expected it to be funny out of the box, through stupidity, irony or basic gags.Fortunately, the visual part is very good, doing its job well in animating the story. Speaking of which, following the trend of the other features, it lacks substance, depth or some sort of spark that might make it a bit less linear than it is. If its predecessor required a bit of polish in terms of storytelling, this one definitely required plenty more attention which it didn't quite receive.Overall, what you get is a big downgrade in terms of amusement, thrill or suspense. It's kind of predictable and it seems to not put much effort in maintaining the quality of its predecessor. It's a shame from my point of view, as I really enjoyed the first one so I had high hopes regarding this one. Too bad...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Furthermore, because the third portion of the trilogy was filmed simultaneously, there's an odd feeling of sadness and discord in that the film is merely only a bridge to the third, a whetting of the appetite if you will until the final resolution.In other words, it's ""Back To The Future, Part II"" all over again.Not that that's an entirely bad thing. Johnny Depp is pure eye candy on the screen; no matter how ridiculous the plot, how implausible the situation, he holds our attention, and rightly so, because he IS Captain Jack Sparrow, and he's so wonderful at it. Keira and Orlando are in fine form too, with both quite possibly looking even more lovely than they did in the first film. And, oh, are they all having fun up there.So when you see it in the theater, and everyone should see this on the big screen, just keep in mind that BTTFPT was the weakest of the bunch. But rejoice in that our favorite characters are back and happily cavorting on the big screen once again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Gore Verbinski)After preventing the capture of a certain Jack Sparrow, both Elizabeth Swan and her fiancée Will Turner are arrested and sentenced to death. But Cutler Beckett has other plans, and sends Turner out to retrieve Jack's compass. This isn't easy for Turner, as he must now help Sparrow track down the Dead Man's Chest, which contains the beating heart of Davy Jones. Stabbing the heart, would not just destroy Jones but also set free Turner's father, Bootstrap Bill. The mission becomes even more difficult for everyone when Elizabeth escapes and tracks down Sparrow.The first Pirates movie was an enjoyable film. The sequel is not as successful in terms of storytelling, but it is still both amazing and fun to watch. All the characters are back with the wonderful characteristics which made them legendary in the first movie. One of the additions to the trilogy is Davy Jones, played by Bill Nighy. This is once character which really needs to be looked at, when looking at how visual effects have improved. The character is just amazing in every way and looks so realistic. It could easily look like prophetic make up. The rest of the action and special effects are impressive with some cool looking sword fights happening. 'Dead Man's Chest' further helped the trilogy be cemented as one of the greatest trilogies of our time.""What, do you think i wear this wig to keep my head warm?"" - Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's been open since Aug 3 and I only got to see it tonight. I think everybody must've seen it, but for those who haven't, go see it before you miss it.I never liked Johnny Depp the way everybody did. His type.. his looks... he's just not my cup of tea! I mean, yes, he's funny and witty and enchanting and has that charisma not all actors have but... what did I say about not liking him again? Wait, SCRAP that. I love him as Capt. Jack Sparrow! Aye aye, Captain! The movie, at 153 mins, could've been shorter though. I was sitting through the action packed sequences, and midway through I had to shift butt cheeks (ooh.. i'm getting better at this review thing~!).Love it when Jack Sparrow got into the satay form, meat between exotic fruits, trying to ""roll"" away from the cannibalistic tribe. Love it when William Tucker (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley) kiss Jack Sparrow. Oh!!! The heartbreak! Love to see Jack Sparrow running funnily across the beach. Sounds cliché, huh, but Depp just has this weird chemistry (and body language) to make the scene plain funny.OH and the CG!! OMG!!! Those are the best tentacles I've ever seen stuck on a man's face!!! Sheesh! How the heck did they do it?!?!! Did Bill Nighy wore a mask during production and then the tentacles added on in the computer? (If you read the trivia, it's: Yes, he did.) And I love the new Disney logo! Very pretty!!

Some negatives to this movie however, in which it cannot compare to it's predecessor. First of all, I felt ""the kraken"" effects in some scenes were quite unrealistic - I won't mention which scenes to avoid spoilers. Also, I don't know if it was only me, but I did notice that Johny Depp's performance in this movie was nothing compared to his performance in the previous Pirates of the Caribbean. Seems he didn't put a lot of effort into it this time, didn't seem like he was really ""Jack Sparrow"" anymore. The movie was quite good, but the end was quite disappointing. I would have wished to see the conclusion of that - but I guess I can wait 5-6 months to see it now. Other than that, great work and great acting by the cast.

Dead Man's Chest is a typical sequel; clichéd. It alternates between being funny and irritating. The plot lacked substance and draaaagged like you wouldn't believe. The characters sometimes overdid their roles, but this is expected of a sequel. The movie was one action sequence after another and never reached a climax. Furthermore, everything about the movie was just so.. convenient. For example, a character would conveniently show up at the most opportune moment, even when said arrival defies logic and possibility. The film is incapable of standing up on its own. Fortunately, it doesn't have to. This film is buildup to the third, and in that respect Dead Man's Chest was highly successful, leaving the viewer anxious for a third installment which by the looks of it is GOING TO BE AWESOME.All in all, I did enjoy the movie. It was nice seeing ALL the characters back at it and the ending, predictable though it may be, is wicked. Or at least it made me VERY happy, and I was about to be disappointed in the flick. So despite all the film's VAST shortcomings, it's a decided 'must-see'.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Focused on whites and Earth tones, the opening was ominous and brooding. That is not the case for Dead Man's Chest, where it opens in blues and greens. Sadness and horror both are the main focus of emotion for the opening sequence. Opening with a dreadful wedding day, that sense of dread is heightened past the first couple of minutes when the real horror begins. Dark, dreary, and truly horrifying, the prison scene really sets the mood for what is to come. Dead Man's Chest is dark in a literal sense, but not so much in the story. There are many points throughout the film where it does explore some dark themes, especially with the introduction of Davy Jones' character. This character seems to be the main focal point of the darkness, which he brings throughout the entire film. The rest of the film is much lighter than the first, still maintaining to throw in some jokes, even during the darker parts of the film. The CGI is remarkable, especially with the film's release date. 2006 was when CGI really was starting to get good, and this film shows just how good it was able to be. Seeing the images before the computer images were introduced are remarkable, with the artists doing a beautiful job creating the characters that are part of Davy Jones's crew. Even the kraken does look realistic, especially with the first introduction. It's remarkable to see where CGI has went, and this really is one of the first films that I can recall that shows just how good Disney's animation was at the time. The biggest problem with Dead Man's Chest wasn't anything with the plot, but rather, the focus of the film. The focus of the film was very broad, as it introduced many characters. Out of all of these new characters, there is one the stood out the most, which would be Davy Jones. Throughout the film, any scene with this character was amazing, which is due to Bill Nighy's electric performance. This one character outshone every character, especially the returning characters. The focus should have bee more aimed toward the characters that were the main characters, not the new villain. Dead Man's Chest may not be as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it is still an amazing adventure film. This is the weakest film out of the original trilogy, mainly due to the introduction of so many characters, where the focus seemed to shift from Jack Sparrow and crew to Davy Jones and crew. Nonetheless, this film still is a fun pirate adventure that was a landmark for CGI.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Oscar-winning effects are also amazing, surpassing anything I've ever seen before in a film.The acting in the film is great, similarly to the first film. Johnny Depp is, again, hilarious as Jack Sparrow. Keira Knightley and Jonathon Pryce also give good supporting performances, though Orlando Bloom is certainly not phenomenal.The laughs are everywhere, along with the twists and thrills. There are sword-fights, burnings, and a crew of ridiculously stupid pirates. The villains in the film are much more intimidating than Geoffrey Rush's character in the first and third films. Bill Nighy is great as the cruel Davy Jones and the Kraken was one of the greatest creatures ever created on camera. If for nothing else, see it for the laughs and the effects.

This review is NO SPOILER. I don't tell you the end, but it is open. And the open and is so open, like the ending of a season you see in series. So you MUST see the third PoC, and I think if you want to see the third part of PoC, you MUST see the second part. But no worry, when the third part plays in the cinemas you have definitely the chance to see a triple feature in the cinemas like the matrix or lord of the rings features. :-) What are the odds! But all in all the (half) film is a very good film, i think you don't regret it, if you go in the cinema to watch it. And Johnny Depp and the rest of the crew is excellent. Also the special effects are superb. And if you haven't seen the first PoC, shame on you. Now go to your video store, rent a the first PoC and in the evening go in the cinema to look the second part. And then wait one year and pray that the third part is as good as the others and much more important pray it has an end.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

In other words whatever was happy is sad and depressing in this movie. Jack seemed to be a different person in this movie, except that they used a lot of the same humor as the first movie. There is no happy ending in this movie and actually there is no ending, which I disliked most of all. There were a lot of cheesy parts to this movie and even more unrealistic. I loved the first movie you can almost say yeah that is some what realistic, but this is just plain unrealistic. I wasted my money and wish that I would have known. If anything, I would suggest waiting till the third movie comes out, listen to the reviews and if the third movie is good then rent the second movie and watch the third.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

The long-awaited sequel is pointless with a very difficult, hard-to-follow plot. Characters keep appearing, disappearing then reappearing again, randomers are flying left, right and centre and Keira Knightley is one of the most annoying women ever. She tries to act manly in a sexy way which doesn't work and is just embarrassing. Johnny Depp does keep Captain Jack Sparrow up to his usual standard but the script lacks many of the brilliant one-liners that made the first film so great. Orlando Bloom has improved though, Will Turner is a more believable character and his acting has improved. Bill Nighy is brilliant as Davy Jones but it's not actually explained who he is, why he has a squid as a head and why Jack Sparrow is in debt to him. The many sword fights are entertaining, but I still feel Jack wasn't as brilliant as he was in the first movie, there was just something lacking which i feel was more the script's fault than Johnny Depp's. Going back to the plot, it was be impossible to follow if it wasn't for Gibbs giving a running commentary throughout which helps a lot and is a touch of genius form the writers. I don't think Davy Jones is as good a baddie as Barbossa, who just seemed that slightly more ruthless. And the guy who plays Cutler Beckett is so annoying (but then again, you're not meant to like him) Go and see the film just to say you've seen it, but don't expect the humorous one-liners from Jack, the riding of the seven seas or anything that will explain what the heck is going on.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Becket makes a deal, if Will finds Jack then he would pardon them and more importantly, Jack's compass. Jack is on his own mission when Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) wants to recall Jack's debt for raising the Black Pearl. Here Jack has to run to land before having to play everyone involved against for him to get his own way and save his skin. A sub-plot of the film is Will finding that his father (Stellan Skarsgård) is alive, working for Davy Jones. Bootstrap Bill sets out to do all he can to protect his son.I will get the problems out the way first. The plot is too convoluted and mixed up. It can lead to confusion and loosing interest. The convoluted plot also leads to the film being too long and a number of faux endings. Finally Orlando Bloom can't act (except in Lord of the Rings). Now to the positives. The action is excellent and you get a lot of sword fights and flint-lock gun fights. An excellent mix of action and comedy is the free way sword fight on the bench. There is comedy which people should enjoy. Johnny Depp is very good in the film, but Bill Nighy does steal the show. Nighy is alway excellent, being the best performer in Love Actually and very good in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Guest House Paradiso etc... Nighy made a brilliant villain. The special effects are amazing, some of best put to film and I expect most of the people involved will not struggle to find work. Another element I enjoyed was the sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth throughout the film and how she uses it as a weapon against him. I would have like to see more of that.It's an enjoyable enough film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yet I thought the script was a bit cheesy, even for this film, and some of the sequences were far too over the top. And Orlando Bloom put in another wooden performance, though I believe his acting was better than other times I have seen him on the big screen.Jon Depp was great as usual as was Keira Knightly who just gets better and better. The confusing thing for me is who does Elizabeth Swann like? Jack or Will? Because all through the film I couldn't decide.The action sequences were on the whole very well done, and the humour all the way through the film made it easily watchable.As pace and action go the film was well directed and when it finishes you'll already be counting down the clock for the third film! And if you wait long enough... right through the closing credits, there's a very short scene at the end just like there was in the first film.Well done Mr Verbinski because after I had seen 'The Weather Man' I was slightly worried. But you don't need to be. Fans will love it. Just don't go into the film expecting realism. It is fun fantasy adventure!

When I came into the movie, I was excited because I thought it would be better than the first, but as most sequels are...it wasn't. I was disappointed. In a nutshell, I think that some people may find this movie as a ""setup"" for pirates of the caribbean 3, because nothing actually ended (there was no real resolution for a LOT of things that happened). Still, it was entertaining and if you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one, though maybe not as much.

With a long-running franchise, character and plot development are key components, however this film remains so focused on the characters themselves that it greatly impacts the pacing of the film. There are moments that cause this film to be a bit of a slog, feeling far too long than absolutely necessary. Again, however, that doesn't make it a ""bad"" film, because in this particular case, the positives do far outweigh the negatives.The action sequences are fantastic, as expected. The CGI holds up relatively well with the age of the film. Johnny Depp once again shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, in a role that felt criminally reduced in this film - that is to say, there are many moments in the film that could benefit from more Jack Sparrow action, wit and sarcasm. This film focuses more on Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann. Granted, they were a central part of the original film as well, but it feels like this film focuses a little bit too heavily on their story and neglects some of the elements that made the first film so fantastic. Another great performance was Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, a menacing (if rather one-dimensional) villain. His scenes provided fantastic acting, but ultimately lacked a lot of the depth that I, as a viewer, enjoy.This film would easily be a 10/10 for me if it were about 30 minutes shorter. All too often, action and adventure films neglect to follow the quality-over-quantity formula when it comes to runtimes.Ultimately, the film was still an enjoyable enough experience, neglecting the dragging moments that, one can only hope, will rise to relevance in the subsequent sequels. It was far from the highlight of the franchise, already falling behind The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the film offered enough of substance to warrant continuing rather than skipping entirely.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Except for a chance to practice some virtues, like patience, forbearance, long-suffering, etc.However, what does all that matter? It made a fortune!!!

""Dead Man's chest"" is another Masterpiece like the first film by the brilliant visionary director Gore Virbinski, a stunning piece of filmmaking with some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie!!!
This time Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth are mixed up with the Mystery & Legend of Davey Jones Locker & what we get is an Amazing swashbuckling, Cannibal, Jungle & sea creatures action adventure flick.
The look of the slimey octopus mutant Davey Jones is just amazing & his sea creatures mutated crew all look fantastic & scary & so richly detailed they are a work of Art.
The first time we meet the Deep sea monster crew is an incredible sequence that feels like a Horror movie it's done so well with such a creepy atmosphere, i loved it.The performances are all great again & Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was actually better this time around as he was toned down i felt with his bizarre ways & it was better.
Orlando Bloom is great again as the real action hero of the movie Will Turner & his beautiful bride-to-be Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley is funny & cunning. The real star of this show goes to the Amazing performance of the main monster himself Davey Jones performed & voiced by Bill Nighy under alot of c.g.i effects but an incredible creation.Dead Man's chest is a such a fun & beautiful looking Gothic monster movie with beautiful cinematography & richly textured & detailed sets & characters.

Here's the bag of chips : PotC : DMC took in a record $130-something million dollars for its 3-day opening, billed as the ultimate 'summer' film, and nothing but good, action entertainment. Yet, in the haze, not all opinions are of perfection. So to say, more than thought possible are actually con-Caribbean. I went into the theater with an open mind, especially since I can enjoy a good film that isn't aimed at a guy named Oscar.When the Disney fireworks hit, and the DEAD MAN'S CHEST text fades over dark, murky waters, my mind becomes at ease. When Bloom and Knightley make their first appearance, it is just as expected. The straight men, for the eccentricity to follow. As so it did, at the expense of a woodpecker. The film waves hello. Hi film.Here is where things get complicated. It has all the elements of an entertaining film. It pushes off the massive success of its original. It also carries its attributes, as well. Long dialogue sequences may prove pointless. The actors do a good enough job, that if the film were silent, we could pick up on their motives. Early on, that appears to be the case. What is the payoff for it in the first third? It doesn't have to do with anything. Just your admission ticket at work, to see Jack in action again. Thoughts rise from this. Could the film possibly be a little full of itself? Now, no complaints about the special effects, for dang sure. Two major sequences with a 'large' conflict, and the villain himself, Davy Jones, showoff just what the future holds for film. All stops were pulled to make 'Pirates 2' looks as gorgeous as possible.Besides that, even with it being a Disney film, and Johnny Depp matching his 'Curse' performance equally, the film somehow lacks personality. Ending at the 2 hour and 45 minute mark, with long dialogue sequences, even lengthier action scenes, and a plot that seems like one big set up, things tend to get dull. By the time money scenes arrive, some people may have traveled off into Neverland. Or sleepy land.But everything is there, in full form. A good prefix to describe Dead Man's Chest, would be 'Over'. Over-hyped. Overdone. Overzealous. But the series is sure not over. Which was, if anything, the point of this second film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5780410/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2020","After the resounding success of the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", it was only natural that Disney started planning sequences for this great phenomenon. The two sequences to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would last both films. Filming took place from February to September 2005 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Palos Verdes, Dominica and the Bahamas, as well as on the sets built at Walt Disney Studios. The film was recorded together with the third film in the series, ""At the End of the World"".Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Weatherby (Jonathan Pryce), is about to marry blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). However, the event is hampered by the threat of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the haunted Flying Dutchman, who owes blood to Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the couple's friend. Fearing being cursed to an afterlife as a slave to Jones, Sparrow must find the mysterious chest of death to escape the threat.This second part of the sequence manages to surpass the previous film in quality and scale. The combination of humor and adventure worked so well previously that it was maintained and expanded. Although the option is for a darker film than the previous one, the chemistry between the main actors still exists and this time even entitled to a climate of love triangle - mainly reflecting the change in attitude of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, more mature. Another aspect of the franchise is the way the legends of the sea are used to compose this universe that mixes fantasy and reality. The first film had done this with the cursed gold, and this second did something similar with Davy Jones and the Kraken. With the absence of Geoffrey Rush in the cast (at least until the final minutes), the writers, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, needed someone to match Sparrow to meet the pirate and Jones was the perfect choice, both for his characterization, as for the man who lives the character.Fortunately, the script of the duo Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott is right to bet on a different film in structure and narrative progression, by avoiding thematic repetitions of the damsel in distress or cursed treasure, preferring to keep the characters separated in different subplots and offer a much more macguffin interesting in the shape of the chest that names the film. The entire arc of Jack Sparrow running to save his soul offers more dangerous risks and really brilliant ideas from the team, from the convict crew that slowly fuse with marine elements and the structure of the Dutch Flying Ship to the imminent threat of the monstrous squid mythological giant, the Kraken.On the other hand, the duo's script does not show such care in all its parts. Inheriting one of the problems of the first film: the prolonged duration, Dead Man's Chest extends for two and a half hours, making this an exhausting adventure. Although they are probably the funniest and most creative parts of the film, the part on the island with cannibals will be totally dispensable to the story narrative, serving only for distraction and adding nothing to the main plot. This is one of the examples of the increase in the scale of the film, but the extra time is not used to delve into the machinations of Becket or Jones, but with expendable passages that have no influence on the story. As a result, some aspects become confused, since they do not receive the necessary focus, while others sound too busy, see the whole interaction between Will and his father.Since this film was shot with the third, much of the plot of Death Chest serves to explain concepts and characters that will gain more prominence and depth in the next chapter, as well as letting the film end on a devastating hook and perpetuating it as a work with no end, but which is part of a whole. Other problems include some inconclusive cores, such as the forced and artificial development of a ""love interest"" between Jack and Elizabeth, which yields only a turnaround during the climax, in addition to disposable moments of jealousy between the girl and Will - not to mention the presence of ex-commodore.
Regarding the cast, Depp maintains all his detailed physical construction and the character's mannerisms, such as the staggering gait and his arms always in motion, as if the character needed a lot of concentration to be able to stand. The character's wit and irony also return, but it is remarkable how Jack is much more comical here, see his hilarious performance when he is elected ""king"" by the cannibals of a local island. As for his scene mates, unfortunately Bloom maintains his striving performance on a single note, with Will's determination and willpower, while Keira Knightley benefits from the improvement in his character to bring more toughness to his performance, even though he maintains a femininity. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is the highlight here. A tragic and heartbroken villain, Jones is a ghostly presence that we are both able to fear and admire at the same time, and much of this is due to Bill Nighy's impressive performance capture mix with Industrial Light & Magic's photorealistic visual effects., deservedly awarded Oscar for his work here.From the first frame of the film, Verbinski's care in establishing a beautiful and realistic world can be seen, with the beautiful and melancholy image of a deserted wedding ceremony punished by a heavy rain, taking us immediately to a terrifying dungeon where we see crows pulling out the eyes of living men ... until breaking it all up with an appropriately hilarious introduction to Jack Sparrow, demonstrating his incredible control of rhythm and pitch variation, something that is crucial to the success of the production. Not to mention the Kraken's gradual appearances. The first is something practically out of a terror, with a violent suction that sinks a small fishing boat in a matter of seconds, gaining a much more elaborate resourcefulness when we get to the second attack. Here, we see the filmmaker's ability to control the spatial geography of events, keeping our focus on Will Turner climbing a mast while his camera roams the chaos on the deck and all desperate men are grabbed by the creature's giant tentacles.Verbinski and director of photography Dariusz Wolski know how to work with night scenes without making them excessively dark, using wet scenes and characters and moonlight to justify the presence of light. They capture the naturalism of the beautiful landscapes and locations where history walks, which include the colorful island of cannibals, marked by the green of their tree tops, to the climax at Isla Cruces, where we have a duel of swords on a sandy beach very white. Indoor scenes involving candlelight, especially the ship's cabin and the sequence in Tortuga, bring a typical orange of the light source flame and a remarkable contrast between the other scenes, with the color changing drastically to a heavier shade and bluish during the moments in the Flying Dutchman, creating a terrifying environment that really looks like a marine hell. In fact, the memorable characterization of the Flying Dutchman and his crew is a spectacle by the production designer and art director. Merging crustaceans with marine beings, they all gain strong visual identities, not being as forgettable as the skeletons of the first film.Hans Zimmer, Oscar-winning composer for ""The Lion King"", returned to the post of composer of the franchise's soundtrack and did the unimaginable: he surpassed the quality of the tracks shown in the first feature. With all the mythology suffered by Davy Jones around his love and hate for Calypso, Zimmer tried to compose the character's theme in a way that showed all his feelings, and succeeded. Not to mention the Kraken scenes.With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance in the right measure - but a decision was wise enough to guarantee the good result: the characters and the plot are attractive enough to guarantee the viewer's attention and make him anxious for the third part that will end the arc of this first trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Five year olds could have come up with a more cohesive and entertaining script, and certainly could have written something less disgusting. A hodgepodge of gratuitous scenes that can't distract the viewer away from the fact that they have yet to be given any reason to care about any of these characters or events. NO humor whatsoever, and for something so poorly glued together, it takes itself way too seriously. The first one didn't even try to be serious, knowing everything was silly fantasy, but the tone this one tries to keep is that this is actually straightforward and not tongue-in-cheek! As it jumps abruptly from one ludicrous scene to another, it fails to make any sense or entice the viewer. Constipated overacting, ham fisted direction, and if it has a plot, you won't see any sign of it for a good long time. My husband and I walked out after a totally unpleasant half hour and got a refund. Don't waste two hours of your life. This is the typical sequel scenario, where they KNOW most everyone who saw the first will see the second, so they don't even bother trying to make it good. I used to have respect for Johnny Depp, but I guess he was either contractually obligated to do a sequel, or just sold out for a buck. He's not really the problem here; it's the lousy writing and direction.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Less personality and more focused adventuring makes for a tighter popcorn swashbuckler","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1536000/?ref_=tt_urv","oneloveall","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10251315/?ref_=tt_urv","3 December 2006","When version number two of the expected Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy came out it was near universally met by critics with dumbed-down groans, the usual lamenting done for a sequel that sells itself short on the personality and originality that thrived in the first place, and puts instead in it's place the over-bloated, inauthentic substitute for personality through mindless action sequencing, peppered with the franchise mentality of sameness, repetition, and reiteration. Not surprisingly, these critical warnings issued by our film protectors were amply ignored by the film-going public, making Dead Man's Chest the surprise top grossing movie of last season. For once I must admit the general public seemed to have gotten it right. Pirates II may not be as authentic, personal, or charming as it's predecessor, but in my experience it was a more fluid, well plotted, entertaining excursion out to sea. Whereas part one seemed to lack direction in it's script, gleefully bouncing around from one local to the next without doing much to justify the transition, Dead Man's Chest seems way more the traditional adventure these pirates were meant to have. I also have heard complaints in Johnny Depp's declining authenticity in the lead role of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, and must also scratch my head. While the lines that were written for him may have been layered on a little too thick, Depp almost seems to be more subdued in the role now, which helped take the focus off of his every drunken stumble and peculiar facial expression that the first concentrated on heavily, to a fault of the plot. Here, Sparrow and company seem to have a more clear cut purpose which helps viewers engage in the adventure all the more. While we are still dealing with essentially the same misadventures at sea (continuing right where the original ended), the arc here feels more like the big budget, high seas extravaganza the franchise wants to be. Of course the over-utilized Orlando Bloom does not help make things any easier on us, especially when asked to accept Mr. Bloom as the heroic savior certain scenes wish to implement, of which the boyish actor simply does not have the gravity to convey. Despite less focus being on the actual characters, helping to fill out the script are the budding moral conflicts arising in these main protagonists , giving the fun affair an extra shade of dimension not present in the original's straight-forward presentations. All in all, if you liked the original you should most likely enjoy the sequel. Where many have disappointingly pointed out the lack of personality and indulgence of set action pieces that Dead Man's Chest sinks to in place of authentic and rousing pirate personalities prominently portrayed in Curse of the Black Pearl, I would argue that POTC:DMC knew what it was even more then it's predecessor, and for that created a more cohesive, engaging adventure that does well to set up anticipation for it's forthcoming last round.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Bravo! It took four writers to create this sequel that so goes beyond the normal shoddy standard of sequels. This Pirate is worthy of ""Two Jolly Roger's Up,"" maintaining a high level of comedy and tension so intense I was actually tense through most of the film, holding my breath during the many expertly choreographed and carried out duels and fights on land and sea. Lots of tributes to other great adventure-thrillers, from Indiana Jones to Peter Pan to Star Wars to Saturday afternoon swashbucklers.The make-up, costumes, and sets were absolutely tops. I don't care if it was special effects or animatronics or all-things man-made... those actors earned their keep! Stellan Starsgard as Bootstrap Bill (Will Turner's father) has said he spent 4.5 hours in make-up every day. He's probably doing that now, as the third installment is currently filming.Depp and Bloom are ably matched with an international cast -- Brits Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy, and the Swedish Skarsgard were a treat to watch. Lee Arenberg and Tim Hollander as the equivalent of Shakespeare's Rosencrantz and Guildensterne were highly entertaining... especially Hollander's delivery of pithy dialog.This is a gorgeous period piece of eye-candy that never, never, never takes itself too seriously.

Of course, this time it isn't a surprise as was the first one, it also has a very choppy flow to it that doesn't help. The plot goes here and there, to many characters introduced when all we came to see (well most of us anyway)is Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly return too and there is to much focus on them for my tastes, don't get me wrong they need to be in it, but more Jack please. Still you get action in the form of a rather cool sword fight in a water wheel, an aquatic sea monster attack, and other scenes like this and you get your comedy, the best bit coming near the start of the movie where Jack and his crew are in the clutches of a group of cannibals. So while this movie is not as good as the first for the most part, it is still a rather fun film that would have benefited with a shorter running time. It could easily be edited down a good fifteen minutes or so. Still there was a nice surprise at the end, at least for me, however IMDb kind of ruins it. Thankfully I didn't see that till tonight. So if you liked the first Pirates go see this one because while not the first one your still in for a treat, but be warned it ends in a cliffhanger.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan have been arrested and Will Turner escapes and to free Elizabeth Swan he needs to give Captain Jack Sparrow's compass to someone else. With help of her father, Elizabeth Swan manages to escape anyway and steals on a ship disguised as a man. An exciting adventure is about to enroll...For people who like pirates, exciting films with quite a lot of fights, gory bits and pretty good humour, this film is for you. 6 and a half out of ten.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Definitely put a more cut throat feel on the movie than the original without seeming over the top. There does come a point where the movie becomes less comical than the original but the transition doesn't ruin the movie but instead allows it to expand. I was really hoping that this Pirate saga wouldn't turn out to be all laughs like I figured Disney would probably do. I was afraid that before I went to see the sequel I was going to see Goofy threatening someone to walk the plank. One other thing, it was great to see a Pirate movie where much of the action takes place on the high seas. It's always good to see the parts where there's a dark and scary cave or a dingy bar or a tropical paradise but I always wonder what's going on over at the boat and this one stuck with it. It would take a hardcore landlubber not to like this film. Anyone else with any kind of interest in tall sea tales needs to get to the theater today!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I actually boycotted CotBP for a long time because absolutely EVERYONE was talking about it, and I have this rebellious thing, I guess. Anyway, I finally saw it and loved it, and I went to see DMC the second day it came out. When we were walking out of the theater, my friend asked me which one I'd liked more, and we both agreed that we needed some time to absorb the second movie before we decided.And of course this movie has good parts--I bought it, I will watch it again and again, and when we had a Chinese-food-and-DMC-watching party tonight, I packed up and was out the door in two seconds, and not just for the food.But this movie has gotten SO MUCH HYPE, and I really don't believe it deserves it all. In typical sequel form, I don't see that it has lived up to its predecessor, mostly in that it tries too hard to live up to it. Every time you turn around there is a recycled joke, most notably the rum joke (probably because of its original success). One subtle reference might have gotten a laugh, but they totally beat you over the head with it. ""Why is the rum always gone?--If it were, there'd be rum.--Hide the rum.--Then use the rum."" The dog-and-keys joke, the ""hello, poppet"" (although that didn't seem so annoying to me as just odd when they said it), even the ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" line...I like it to a point, but after we know it, it's tiring to continually be reminded of it. I suppose they were trying to make a point about Elizabeth's character with her interjection at the beginning, but that was definitely an instance of overusing lines.I don't think that Jack's line of ""You will always remember this as the day..."" gets old, maybe ever, since he always says it with such bravado, and because of the context of the line itself. They only use that line once, anyway, and it's a line that's been known for its changeability; Ted and Terry keep coming up with new ways to present it, so even though it's brought up again and again, it's never the same twice.This is a great movie as far as action goes. I won't, can't, dispute that. The action starts at the beginning and goes right on through to the end--maybe without enough pauses for the more tender audiences, I guess, but it's not boring. It also mixes humor with its action, which makes it more enjoyable to watch. The big three-way-duel comes very specifically to mind here.I won't bother too much with the cast...if you saw and liked the main cast from the first film, then you will probably like them again here. Knightley returns as a much more tomboyish figure; I'm still not entirely sold on the plausibility of this drastic change. Norrington's return really gives Jack Davenport a chance to show off his acting abilities. And Tom Hollander, a new addition but one I'm growing to like, appears as the smug Lord Beckett, an interesting change from his last film with Knightley, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.I have heard some complaints about the overall feeling of this movie, though, its sort of fantastical world. It's true, in CotBP we start out in a very reality-based setting and move into the fantasy world; here we're in the fantasy from start to finish, and the best ""reality"" times are in Port Royal, with Beckett--until, of course, we get to Davy Jones's heart at the end, when the two worlds meet.In another way these action sequences do detract from the film. Without ever slowing down for a break, it's hard to step back and think about what's happened, and it's a great deal more difficult to really characterize anyone, I think. The main-main characters (Jack, Will, Elizabeth, even Norrington and the Governor, to an extent) have been fleshed out nicely, between this movie and the last, and I see that Beckett is on his way, but our villain--what happened to our villain? We got a story, albeit an interesting one which implies there will be more, but he still seems rather remote to me. There was so much to-do made over the heart, the key, and Jack's part in it all, that the motive behind it all (supposedly a woman) kind of got left out except in the convenient backstory. So if we're supposed to believe he's all bitter over a woman, it doesn't come across very well. Just a few more introspective scenes could easily solve these questions of character, but we're so busy watching ships blow up and people swashbuckling that we kind of forget about everything else. The Kraken, I do admit, is impressive to watch. Someone give Special Effects a hand for that one, especially at the last scene.It's a fun ride (ha, didn't mean that as a joke...), so I believe you will enjoy it. I highly recommend seeing it at least once, if only to say you've seen it. Don't be like me and miss out on a good film because you feel like you're jumping on a bandwagon--even if it doesn't deserve all its hype, it does deserve a great deal of it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I felt it ruined the flow of the film. *END OF SPOILER* If that scene were cut out, I would've given it a higher score. Also, there were a few plot holes which didn't really make sense.

I seem to have missed it.After the first half an hour I found myself staring into space, that really isn't a good sign. Orlando Bloom was tedious in the first one but now he's just pathetic.

If it wasn't for Johnny Depp being so funny and gorgeous this film would have felt like it dragged on even longer (if that is possible).I love the first one, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have gone to see the second.

Yes, I admit that some of the more intense actions scenes were a little corny, and maybe the plot was overly complicated, but remember: this is an ACTION movie. People come to movies like these not only to see something entertaining, but also something exciting. Pirates 2 is an excellent example of this. Instead of the too-common problem of not enough plot and too much hitting, Pirates 2 has the perfect mixture. Enough plot to keep you focused, and enough action, special effects, and fancy swordplay to leave you feeling satisfied. People can be critical and say ""That couldn't happen."" and ""In real life they wouldn't have survived that."" but this isn't a reality show. Consider the plot of the first movie: cursed pirates that roam the seas forever looking for Aztec gold. How is that more realistic than this movie?

It brought back to life what Disney can do for family viewing. Growing up in the days of ol' time movies being rerun on the Disney Channel, I grew to love Disney very much. With classics like Old Yeller, Summer Magic, Swiss Family Robbinson and the like, I loved family type movies with no gross nudity, a story line that is not only enchanting, but also engrossing and will keep you on your toes.Now, with the second ""Pirate's"" movie of the trilogy having just come out on DVD today, I just had to go out and rent it. (My husband though had the ending ruined for him when his manager accidentally told him what happens just a mere three days before it's release.) So, I got to the store to ensure that we got a copy (no problem there, still over 60 copies when I left--with 200 for Miami Vice gathering dust, ha!) I rushed home, the excitement on his face! We put it on as soon as our PS2 stopped being a punk and started playing, and with many ""shhhs!"" to our 4 year old, we were able to watch the movie.We loved the first movie. We thought it was funny, greatly casted and even to this day we spout many of our favorite lines from the movie. ""Why's the rum gone?"" The sequel however falls short slightly. Don't get me wrong, we both really really liked it. Some of the fight scenes were just awesome; choreographed perfectly, the visual effects up to par with other great films as Titanic (think of the switchover of the ship from Rose's retelling and then the shots of it underwater) and the Matrix trilogy.However, even though the film is supposed to leave you knowing there's a third coming, it seemed short. Yes, it's 150 minutes long, but the story dragged at times so when you got to the ending, you were hopping it would continue. I guess they wanted that so you can't wait for the 3rd and rush out and see it. Just keep that in mind as it ends, that there is more to come.I'm just glad it's not like the Harry Potter series where it's years between films. Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End is to come out in the summer. I'm sure I'll be back with a movie review of it for ya.*****- for cast *****-for scenery and visuals ****-for story ******-for Johnny Depp","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I felt that the first movie was over-hyped, but good. This one is also good, but over-hyped beyond comprehension.Will and Elizabeth are finally facing the consequences for their actions at the end of the first film. The punishment? Death. There is a chance that one of them can receive a pardon (it's never made clear which one exactly would actually get it) if Will brings to the new leader of the East India Trading Company, Lord Beckett, the compass that belongs to Captain Jack Sparrow.Jack meanwhile, is trying to find the key to the Dead Man's Chest when he gets an unexpected (and rather creepy) visit from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. He informs Jack that the deal he made with Davey Jones thirteen years ago to raise the Black Pearl from the depths of the ocean and make him captain of it has reached its limit. His soul now belongs to Davey Jones, or else he must suffer the wrath of the Krakken. He rushes toward land, any land. Which happens to be Cannibal Island. There's a bit of a ruckus, but in the end Will has found Jack, Jack takes him to Tia Dalma (a voodoo priestess) who informs them of the importance of the Dead Man's Chest and where they can find the key to unlock it, revealing an item that might just save Jack's soul. There's much more to the plot, but it would take too long to give even a brief description of it. Long story short, Will gets the key from Davey Jones, and gets to meet his father. Norrington has had his life destroyed due to Jack Sparrow, and Elizabeth is torn inside trying to decide between Jack and Will. All this while everyone is trying to get the Dead Man's Chest and the treasure within.This can get very confusing. The plot is a mish-mash that could have been split into another two movies. The action is what carries the weight here, and it does get very exciting (and half the time it's also very humorous). Jokes from the first film are used again, but it seems more in line of continuity then lack of originality.The big problems with this one include some slow pacing (we really didn't need the whole Cannibal Island sequence), some rather violent images (sometimes this felt like a sailor's horror movie), and the general darker tone to this compared to the first film. It's just not quite as fun.If you're a good ol' rumrunner that is looking for adventure on the high seas fighting against the paranormal of the briny deep aided by astonishing visual effects and can follow many, many plot lines woven (loosely) into one that feels like it relies on two big names and tremendous action sequences to be a success, then this is a movie for you. If, however, you prefer a story that focuses more on characters, is easier to follow and has a more upbeat tone to it, I recommend you sail for different waters. Savvy?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, shiver me timbers, me buckos! $600 million later, a genre was given new life! ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" showed the movie-going masses the kind of innocent, rip-roaring, swashbuckling fun that isn't easy to glean from many of the films getting passed 'round. And to boot, if one didn't know any better, he wouldn't be privy that the movie was even based on a ride at Disneyland.Comes the second installation in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" saga: ""Dead Man's Chest"". So, what now that Cap'n Jack Sparrow has regained his long-lost prize, the Black Pearl? Well, we know he can't just up and get away with making a mockery of the Royal Army, and especially not the East India Trading Company. But who else is out for a piece of Jack? And...just how many pieces of him are there to go around? ""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely no failure to the established summer movie formulas. Fencing, fighting, torture, monsters, chases and escapes via special effects abound. Like its predecessor in 2003, it's all put to good use with extremely witty and inventive storytelling. And it's all out on display on such lush, extravagant backgrounds and movie sets. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, effort was obviously poured into making the story so compellingly gripping, you'd almost forget that in the heat of the action, you're really still sitting in a movie theatre.The most stunning success of ""Dead Man's Chest"" has to be the realization of a magnificently fantastic soundtrack, worthy of any mega epic. Great though the soundtrack of the original was, Hans Zimmer has come aboard and created a masterpiece symphony - Hornpipes to accompany us on a journey into the seedy underworld of Tortuga - a massive pipe organ played by none other than Davy Jones himself...and even a little dinner music to muse our appetites.Alas though, the Chest isn't completely chock full of gold and treasure. Likely, ""Dead Man's Chest""'s most obvious pitfall is one present in many movie trilogies: The dreaded Volume II syndrome. It has no real beginning nor does it have much of an end. This tends to make the story drag just a bit since there's so much room to continue the saga's progression to the third volume. It could even be argued that the movie's 143 minute running time is at least 15 minutes too long, but once the slower pace picks right back up to full-bore, that sentiment fades. And know ye this...there is a quite darker undertone in this Chest. It's not quite the glorified, happy-go-lucky nature that the little kiddies ate up in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". Better squeeze the little ones a little tighter, 'cause dead man REALLY tell no tales...It's well-known by now that Johnny Depp is quite keen to keep donning the costume and make-up of the Cap'n. And with the awe-inspiring inventiveness and the vivid imaginations of the POTC crew on display, I'd be willing to bet there are many meager souls willing to pay a few more gold coins to hop aboard the Black Pearl another time or two and set out to the open seas of the Caribbean.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" gets 8 of 10 stars.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

There were also a few unexpected moments in the film, like when Commodore Norrington appears with the heart of Davey Jones or when Captain Barbossa is back and wants to help the good ones. This film is definitely as good as the first one, maybe even better, except for the story. The story (and title) of the first one were a bit better.

It was huge. So, the usual is done with Hollywood sequels here, more of the same, but bigger. And I felt it, it was quite a heavy first part of the film, lots of information and detail before the ball really gets rolling and the whole thing starts to flow. The plot changes all the time so would be frivolous to try to explain a plot that encompasses the whole film. Needless to say, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan all get dragged into another adventure and meet friends and enemies, old and new along the way. The film is big, it's long, it's crammed with characters, some of which suffer due to the amount of screen time they get due to there being so many. But the film's appeal is in it's sheer spectacle, the sets and costumes and special effects are all of an absolutely incredible standard. This surely is the reason the big screen was made, and too see in there enhances the film to a great jaw dropping sight at times. Perhaps the only thing that the film didn't have going was a feeling for the characters, with so many of the new ones given screen time it was hard to feel when the main three got into perilous situations, or maybe that was just me. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 was an enjoyable, likable film, that demands a big screen viewing, but the main stars are the art and effects departments.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I already thought it looked good in the trailer, but it turned out a lot better! This movie is filled with more violence, more pirates, more laughs, and more suspense than the first. Johnny Depp did a great job as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) did great too! I was glad to see them again. The only thing I didn't like was how the new characters like Tia Dalma and Marty weren't introduced very well. I loved all the characters' costumes. I thought those were amazing. For those of you who are planning on seeing it soon, you might want to watch the Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl to recap your memory. Davy Jones was the perfect bad guy for this movie. Even though Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest is 150 minutes, it definitely WASN'T a waste of time. This movie is now my favorite movie. Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest was so stupendous that no other movie can even compare. I can't wait for the third one.

It's hard to make a sequel worthy of such an extraordinary work of art as the original ""Pirates"" was. However this movie more than does it. Everything about this movie is incredibly done. And I believe that if it were not in fact, a sequel, it would be considered even better. But don't look at this movie as a sequel, it's not really much of a follow up on the first movie except for some famous lines taken from it and a couple of cameos and familiar names that show up but I won't ruin any of the surprises. As always in this movie you never know where allegiance lies, that is why both movie will be a success.If there were any mistakes in this movie it was trying to make Orlando Bloom funny. It's not the writers' fault, he's just not funny. He does a good acting job other than that, he becomes a bit more like a pirate as well which is good to see. Kiera Knightly is stunning and delivers the goods as usual. Her character develops more into someone who takes charge as you will see in this movie if you haven't already seen it. You'll be surprised at the incredible effect she has on this movie. And as always Mr. Depp delivers and this time he delivers coming back as the witty, drunken, ladies man, pirate, yet courageous good man Jack Sparrow. The character is a gem of a character that has never been matched before in any other movie ever created. The other thing about this movie that may anger some is you'll wish there was more of a resolved plot, it's a bit sketchy but pay attention, and it'll all make sense. The reason the plot is unresolved is because the movie is a complete set-up for the third movie.All in all, this movie is terrific, go see it. 9/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The only reason that I have not seen it more is because none of my friends want to sit in a two-and-a-half hour movie and listen to me rave on and on about Johnny Depp. The first time I saw this movie was the second day that it opened. If I had it my way, I would have seen it at the midnight showing that Thursday night. I knew there were going to be tons of people there so I just decided to stay away until the second day. As soon as it started, I could not stop watching it!!! This movie is by far the best movie in the entire world!!! I absolutely Loved Jack's entrance in this one! As soon as I saw what the bird was doing I screamed out loud... ""Oh My God..... it's Jack!!!!"" I wouldn't have been surprised if they kicked me out of the theater but I am so glad that they didn't! I was absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in this one!!!! And the whole thing about curiosity between Elizabeth and Jack was like one of those Whoa! hit you in the face kind of moments! I am so anxious and overly excited about the third and final installment of Pirates that comes out next summer.Of course the main question to be answered here is...... Does DMC live up to the original? My answer: Oh My God yes!!! Furthermore, I think that Johnny Depp is amazingly remarkable!!! I think he should win a bazillion awards for the Pirates movies. He really does do an amazing job!!!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

But I couldn't. As far as I could tell it was rambling, incoherent and it was hard to understand what everyone except Bloom and Knightley were saying. And the film can't make it's mind up as to whether it's comedy or gross-out horror. In the UK it has one of those farcical '12A' certificates, and I have to say that there is no way I'd consider letting my two children (8 and 6) see it - they'd be really disturbed by so much of what goes on. Which doesn't make it bad film-making (it's the bad film-making that does that!), but does make the whole issue of certification very questionable.Depp is back as the ambivalent Sparrow, mincing and wearing make-up for all he's worth. Bloom and Knightley are there as well as the star-crossed, rather dull, lovers. And all the others are there too, including Jack Davenport to add an 'interesting' third way to the film. Their performances are all OK, but then again this isn't 'Come And See', one shouldn't expect ground-breaking thespianism.I know it's only a film, only a story, but I was bemused by the whole Flying Dutchman thing. I thought it was fairly well known that the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman was a Dutch sailor called Van Der Decken. Maybe Davy Jones sounded easier for the mushed-out brains of Hollywood's perceived target audience to understand. But I was disappointed - Van Der Decken sounds far more mysterious. And how come that someone with a name like 'Davy Jones' sounds so darned Scottish? I think you can tell I didn't like it. I thought the film was aimless, chaotic, rambling and totally annoyed me by leaving us with a cliffhanger ending that I really didn't care about. I was very angry about that actually. I had no idea and was fed up that I'd wasted an evening watching a film I didn't really like that didn't even have a satisfactory ending.But I guess that any film based on a Disney theme park ride is never going to be high art. I did quite like the first film (although the sword fights went on for far too long), but I really do believe this film is a mess, confusing and non-sensical. But, I suspect many of those who loved the first one will enjoy this and the prospect of more to come. But, the cynic in me can't help feeling that much of the popularity of this film (borne out by the presence in the cinema of so many teenage girls) is due at least in part to the presence of Messrs. Bloom and Depp.Shiver me timbers!","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was great to see some good old fashioned adventure and pirate story! The plot was good, although a little confusing and I think I would have to watch it again to fully appreciate it! The idea was similar to the 1st film - a curse that had to be broken and double crossings, bluffing and general confusion!! However, in this case, there was no happy ending and the story was left far from complete obviously laying the way for the next film.Johnny Depp was superb in maintaining his 'Keith Richards-style' and taking centre stage! He was hilarious to watch and by far the best actor in the film.Orlando Bloom's character remained a little under developed and lacked backbone while Keira Knightly went slightly 'over the top' in places - particularly with the unnecessary part she played when Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and the Commodore were in a three man duel.The three man duel itself was spectacular (only spoiled slightly by Elizabeth's excessive shouting which was not at all natural and obviously done so she could have her back turned for a key part). As usual the special effects were brilliant and the fighting scenes clever and entertaining although they did go on for a bit long! Particularly when the sea monster attacked for the 4th or 5th time! Overall, the film was brilliant! Although not as good as the first one, it was still better than many other films and definitely worth seeing! I don't really like films when the ending it TOO incomplete, as you feel the whole film has led to nowhere and therefore I am much looking forward to the third instalment. I think Disney have lived up to their reputation and I would recommend everyone to see this film.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Same old fun with greater depth. Fantastic sequel!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1413335/?ref_=tt_urv","pvtbob","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3821869/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2006","The first film made me believe that there is a pirate in all of us. A lust for freedom, adventure and a treasure, be that of gold or not. With its dark, comical and 'blockbusterish'fun it proved that you can combine these types of films with enough depth to give purpose of character and enhance the storyline. The second film has proved each again. this time they've gone deeper showing a darker and more sinister view on the pirate front. The acting is what you would expect, bloom being wooden yet seems to suit the role perfectly attuned to the style of the film. Keira also what you would expect but towards the end brings a lot more feel and versatility to her role. Depp. well come on, what do you expect? He has a lot of great moments in the film. Most of the best. Of course this franchise would be cut in half without his performance yet this film doesn't squeeze every last bit out of him by giving him the most screen time. Each character gets enough needed to give a decent pace to the storyline. Davy Jones makes and excellent bad guy showing no mercy. The plot is fairly easy to follow, on par with last film but is a great setup for the 3rd.The special effects/stunts are exceptional. With these sorts of films the special effects wont stand the test of time but with the comical scenes and and general characterisation they don't have a great effect. Look at star wars. It still is great fun to watch. Where as something like The latest King Kong is all about the special effects. Don't get me wrong it is a fantastic film with a lot of depth. But it will be hard to feel for the same ape in 30 years when the visuals are outdated.There are lots of memorable scenes in this film, more than the first. Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry. Some may make you scared ( if you don't like slimy things ). All in all this has the same wide audience attracting variety of goodness as the first. Greater sequences, greater characters, greater depth. Everything is consistent or an improvement. There are some scenes in the first film that are well crafted and cannot be compared with but as a sequel this does seem fresh, re -introducing the same old guys we love and what i consider a great ending. I cannot wait for the third. I'm hoping for even more memorable fun that lets us see other sides of certain characters. Worthy sequel, If they make the third even better....then this will be one of the greatest trilogies ever made.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

By the end credits I thought my fears of the next two pirate films doing a matrix 2&3 and being lesser than the first one, but after thinking about it more and more, the better it became. All the humour of the first was there, as were the characters (not overplayed at all) it was just more of the same. The film is certainly a lot darker and more serious in this one(not sure if we need to see an eye being pecked out...bit much for a 12a),with the villains being a lot more threatening in their behaviour. It was beautifully shot (opening shots in the rain, amazing) and the wheel chase was great, some cgi was iffy in places (davy Jones, could swear is real, kraken...haha, where's the blue screen) but as a whole it's wonderful stuff. As with the first, Depp steals the show while Bloom and Knightly look pretty. it was my girlfriend who made the comparison to Empire, so the credit's all hers, (you'll know what I mean once you've seen it and have seen the original star wars trilogy) the film is dark, and you definitely want to know what happens next. Let's just hope there's no Ewoks.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects on Davey Jones and his crew were great, the fight scenes were remarkable. And the love triangle between jack, Elizabeth and will got a lil but more juicier in this film. The return of some of the characters in the first movie was a great surprise. It made things get a lot more interesting.The ending is terrific the way they left you hanging on anticipating next years release on May 25 for the third one. After the movie ended I sat there like OMG this was great I want to see it again. No telling how many times I gonna watch that one on DVD when it comes out.

It runs about half an hour too long, and my impression at the end was that I was owed not just one cliffhanger ending, but five. Gore Verbinski, Disney, and Jerry Bruckheimer all owe me five endings. Not like 'things are done, but this is what happened next,' actual endings. The movie simply stops at what is apparently the middle of the story. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun film to see. Johnny Depp is amazing, as always, as he saunters around half-drunk, half-homosexual. Kiera Knightly also puts in an impressive performance, having much more to do in this film than in the first, where she mostly just looked scared or pouty. In the end however, it's just not as smart and fresh as the original was.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I saw the first movie, enjoyed it and then saw this. If you are an avid fan of Pirates, this is probably a sequel that will satisfy your craving. From someone who is just a regular viewer it was at least a fun movie to see once in the theater if never again. The only thing that really sort of wore me out was the constant unrealistic action that rivaled that of the Die Hard movies. For me at least it seemed like they tossed in sword fight here and there whenever they felt filling up time was necessary. That, and the 2 hours and 40 minutes of that particular content made me a bit restless in my seat. However if you are an advocate of Pirates of the Caribbean or you are a family looking to have a night out or movie viewing, this movie may be perfect.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Instead let me highlight one positive and one negative aspect of this movie.The good: The special effects in this movie are honestly the most impressing thing I've ever seen. The movie is worth seeing just alone for this reason.The way they present the ghost pirates, the huge octopus and the impressive surroundings is breathtaking. This is a heroic effort! The bad: This movie suffers from the ""this is second part but we already know that we will do another one""-syndrome. The first Pirates movie felt a lot more fulfilled with no annoying ""see you later"" ending. The last 30 minutes in this one, are basically a setup for the third movie.If you're not sure what I mean, compare this with the Matrix trilogy. The same thing happened in Reloaded.Overall, this is great movie that is a worthy follow-up to the original Pirates of Carribbean. I'll give it 8 out of 10 Molotov cocktails.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

About how beautiful they are and about how everything feels like a dream when you visit them. I think it's almost the same with Disney's films: the sensation that everything is a long colorful dream or, and I don't say it to underestimate the films' quality; a long and entertaining Disney ride. In ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", as in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", you realize that every scene is done in an arranged set, where, sooner or later, every element present, will become something useful for the scene's development; because it is all carefully thought before. Whether the element will work as something that will explode or fall down it doesn't matter; the point is that everything is alive. With this lively environment, ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow and his crew into the sea again. This time there is now Geoffrey Rush, but a new villain called Davy Jones, played wonderfully by Bill Nighy. The storyline follows the events of the first movie but what's slightly negative is that you will not understand everything correctly if you haven't seen ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".The 'Pirate's' writers give too much credit to their audience (and I wonder why they shouldn't, 'Pirates' being such a high-grossing film), expecting them to keep up immediately. This, for the general public is problematic, because usually sequels find a way for the viewer to understand what has happened before, in case they weren't able to watch the first installment. It doesn't occur that way in ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.Personally, I find the writer's decision risky and I like it so I don't mind; mainly, because the script is so well written and the connections with the first picture are intelligently placed in it. This trilogy has been blessed with incredible writers, capable of generating humor, adventure and drama not only for the children, also for the adults. This is worth analyzing: Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the writers, are responsible for ""Shrek"", the best Dreamworks' computer animated film and one that finds the balance between kids and grown ups, with something for each. They're responsible for ""The Road to El Dorado"", one of my favorite animated films and Dreamwork's best film in 2-D animation. Finally, they crafted the script of ""The Treasure Planet"", one of the few good Disney animated films after the change of working team; where they also found the balance I mentioned above. The trilogy has also been blessed with incredible actors. Johnny Depp reprising the one and only Captain Sparrow, disappearing in the role and owning the film as is his custom. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth comes back and, although not as important as in the first movie, she makes the character look more real, with fewer make up and more dirt in her face; showing that she's not a 'princess' and that she is a woman with determination; I'm looking forward to the final growth of Knightley's character. And Orlando Bloom, maybe not as incredible at the rest, but accompanied by an incredible cast.Lastly, the trilogy is been blessed with a gifted director: Gore Verbinsky; who was chosen for the franchise after having made only a couple of films. Completely different in genre, the comedy ""Mousehunt"" and the horror remake ""The Ring"" were both equally complex to direct. Verbinsky took the risk and didn't fail Bruckheimer with 'Pirates'. He's also widened his versatility by directing the arty ""The Weather Man"". Going back to my main point, you can take ""Dead Man's Chest"" as a long colorful dream or a long and entertaining Disney ride. Whatever the case, one thing is certain; it is entertainment for all the family. Oh, I almost forgot: Hans Zimmer is a genius.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What a letdown. First, it is entirely too long. 2 1/2 hours is too long for most movies, and in this case, the movie feels as if it is 4 hours long. It has been a long time since I wanted so badly for a movie to end.Second, it is a very dark movie. Disturbingly dark. The lighthearted banter and adventurous feel of the first movie is nowhere to be found. Spiritually, it has very dark themes, and it left me with a creepy sort of dark, depressive feeling - not what I desired or expected, after the humor of the first movie. The dialog is much too gloomy, and unlike the first movie, there are no great lines to be found. All the good ones are in the previews. There was nothing to add.Finally, parts of the movie are entirely too disgusting. I was disgusted and put off by several scenes. Any fun there might be in the movie is overshadowed by grotesque and gratuitous parts that were extremely distasteful.Overall, the movie was a terrible disappointment. I liken in to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" another disappointing second movie in a trilogy. I can only hope the third movie, like in the Indiana Jones trilogy, comes to the rescue of this series.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

After the first film, high expectations were raised among many people. In this adventurous action movie, Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow. Also the other characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) return to the screen. So the film has got a well-known cast, which makes it a success beforehand, which can turn out either positive or negative for the film. It's set on the Caribbean around the 1750s. The film contains elements from a lot of different genres, for example: action, comedy, fantasy, romance, etc. When Will and Elizabeth are ready to get married, Elizabeth is thrown in prison for helping Jack Sparrow escape. Will Turner has to go to Jack Sparrow and get his compass. If he gives this to Lord Beckett Elizabeth is set free. In the meantime, Jack Sparrow owes a blood debt to Davy Jones, the half-octopus sea captain of the Flying Dutchman. The only way to escape from his duty is to get help from the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. She is able to give him the information Jack Sparrow needs to find the key of the magical dead man's chest. Even though the plot isn't very well-written and quite lengthy, the humorous actions of Captain Jack Sparrow, as well as of some of the other characters, make the film worthwhile and funny.The plot of the film is almost the worst written plot you can imagine. It goes from one subject to another, leaving the viewers completely puzzled. One moment everybody is looking for the magical compass of Jack Sparrow, and the next they are suddenly looking for the key of Davy Jones's chest. When Elizabeth enters the room of Lord Beckett, the audience is likely to get confused how she got there. And if this isn't enough, Elizabeth starts a love triangle with Will and Jack, all out of the blue. It also seems like the characters themselves don't even know what they want and what they are doing. An example of this is that Captain Jack Sparrow has the compass, but he doesn't know what to do with it and how to read it. Neither is there any sense of direction established, just until you watched forty minutes into the film. But the worst thing about this film is that it takes the director two and a half hours to complete nothing. There is a lot happening in the film but in the end everybody ends up with having the same as they had in the beginning: nothing. Except from bad aspects it also contains various good aspects. For example, the good old humor from the first film returns in the sequel. And of course, Jack Sparrow draws a lot of attention to him again with direct, sarcastic and funny comments. This makes the audience want to keep on watching the film and it makes boring scenes amusing. Another positive aspect of the film is the great amount of spectacular stunts and special effects. This keeps the viewer awake and entertained. For example the numerous sword fights and battles keep you on the edge of your seat. Also the use of CGI is magnificent. The character of Davy Jones is beautifully made, just like the other crew members on the Flying Dutchman. The giant-tentacled Kraken, which appears halfway through the film, is also made by CGI. The appearance of this enormous beast adds some action and amazement to the film. Another good aspect is the use of mattes, during the film it is hard to see what is real and what isn't, this makes you think and try to figure out how they did it. It also makes you get absorbed into the film more, because you accept it as a reality. For example the part when the Kraken appears behind Captain Jack Sparrow, and they also used this technique when the crew members of The Black Pearl swing, captured in the bone cage. The lighting was used effectively in the film: every scene on The Flying Dutchman was quite dark, this created a gloomy mood, also at the wedding the light was quite dim, which created a sad mood and in both cases you could expect some action or drama was about to happen. The sound however is very characteristic for the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, so when you hear it again you will immediately recognize it and link it with this film. The acting is very good in this film, because although the plot is horrible, they are able to make it a film worth watching.Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a lengthy film with a dreadful plot, but the humor and spectacular events keep you entertained throughout the entire two and a half hours of the film. Because the first film was such a success, Gore Verbinski is likely to get away with the bad plot, but he probably won't get away with it once more. The use of special effects in this film was amazing and it really got you absorbed in the film. Although it didn't fully meet our expectation that we got after watching the first film, we would still recommend it to our friends and family. Because of the humor, the fights and the stunts.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I hope they put out a special edition with deleted scenes, I wanted this movie to go on and on. The blend of characters and the way they work with each other is exceptional, and, having the first movie to set up with, creates a familiarity with the personalities of each returning character which adds to the enjoyment of watching this film. Loved the way the ending was setup and the final scene was so great! I cant wait for the next movie, it should be incredible to watch!

Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is known for over-the-top movies that defy belief so much it's distracting to the story, but perhaps director Gore Verbinski has toned him down a bit. Pirates is still over-the-top excitement, but it really doesn't distract from the storytelling the team of writers maintain.This installment of the Pirates trilogy pits the Keith Richards inspired Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed skillfully by Johnny Depp, against the under-worldly Captain Davy Jones. I'm not sure what went on in developing the final two chapters, but Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, end up in the adventure somewhat as an aside - Dead Man's Chest is really Jack Sparrow's movie. I could go into the story, but it seems pointless, the story is linear and the characters seem to develop almost forcefully. There are detours in the film that seem to only exist for spectacular adventure and could easily have been cut from the movie, especially when it ends at over 2 and a half hours in length. The cannibal island act didn't do anything for the story except to bring together four characters from the previous film. It seems like they couldn't figure out how to get these people in the story any other way. Honestly, the characters all come from different places and all end up on the same island together just to be chased about by cannibal tribes-people (some of which looked like Irishmen). Some of the characters were introduced in this film seemingly for no reason, but our main characters seem to be quiet fond of them.Besides some weak elements, as mentioned, everything was amazing. The story drew you into it with compelling drama, suspense and adventure. The action was exciting and big (true to Bruckheimer's pedigree). The vistas were amazing; filmed on location in the Bahamas. The most impressive part of it all was the innovative, cutting-edge CGI effects. It is amazing to see how far computer generated images have come over the years.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's not vulgar in anyway (good for the younger breeds!), had some humor, tons of action and adventure, and it wasn't chock full of mushy gushy kiss scenes. Jack Sparrow returns in this epic tale of greatness! And the ending (which I won't spoil) leaves the viewer desiring more and more action! The movie was like 2hours long or somethin, and there was never a boring moment. I was on the edge of my seat for a ton of it, and sitting there for as long as I did, there was never a time when I wished it was almost over. It was great! I loved this movie so much, it was everything I had hoped for and more!

The problem with expectation is that it is easily disappointed. That's why it's that much more amazing that this movie surpassed my high expectation.Once again, the story is fantastically written. I was held captive in my seat throughout the entirety of the movie. And the ending was so compelling that I wish the third movie came out tomorrow.The creatures were kind of weird bringing this trilogy even more into the fantastical realm, but due to the quality of the storyline and how well they fit with the plot, I couldn't imagine the movie without them. This was the one thing I was unsure about in the previews.The acting was excellent also. This cast was so well chosen.Some people have complained about the lack of ending in this movie. However, like any other good trilogy (i.e. Lord of the Rings) the second movie shouldn't have an ending. A trilogy is best done when one story is spread out over multiple movies. This is what makes it a trilogy and not just three separate movies which share a similar name. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is best when seen in conjunction with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. That's what makes it good. The first Pirates can stand alone as there was an ending of sorts. In the second one, they've done a good job of connecting it with the first one. Still, once the third one comes out, everyone will be happy that they did the second one as they did. It's tough to rate a trilogy when you haven't seen all 3 parts. People tried to do that with X-Men. It had a good first movie and amazing second movie. The problem is that the second movie was so good, the third one seemed bad in comparison. They made the mistake of climaxing in the second installment. The third movie should always be the best in a trilogy and the second the ""worst"" or else it just won't work. If At World's End is amazing, everyone will speak of how amazing the trilogy is and no one will complain about Dead Man's Chest.Then only question which remains is will the third live up to the hype due to the amazing quality of the first two. That question will be answered at world's end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot was still great just....quite different.The jokes and action was pretty good. You got a few pretty hard laughs out of the movie and it happens at really good times. Also the fight scenes or the action scenes are pretty good and well choreographed.The special effects and costumes are amazing. Making people look like the coral, or like fish was awesomely done. The craken was a little weird looking at times and a bit disappointing at times. But still making the people look the way they did was amazing.Overall I loved this movie, the movie of the summer unless something else comes up.

Dean Man's Chest came as close as I could expect. Johnny Depp's performance was astonishing in the first movie because all of the other characters lived in the real world. Jack Sparrow is less effective when everyone takes for granted that there are ghost ships sailed by Octopus looking half dead sea creatures. Bill Nighy was wasted under an avalanche of special effects. I didn't buy that Elizabeth would ever have any real connection to Jack. Her undying love for our hero is what makes the story old fashioned Hollywood fun. Jack would have to stop swaying for me to believe that Elizabeth would be conflicted about her feelings for him. What would be the fun of that? I love watching Orlando Bloom play a sword fighting hero though the action was too cartoon like. The swords might as well have been made of rubber. I never felt anyone was going to get hurt. Nothing hurt these people. This movie is a nice ride and worth the price of admission. However the first movie was such an unexpected pleasure that part of me wishes that they had just left it alone.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

So when i watched the Dead Man's Chest i can say that the action in this movie is far less than the first one. So sometimes the movie's pace slackens a little bit but the comedy in this movie keeps you glued to the screen. The laughs in this movie is more than its predecessor. If the comparison is done to 'black pearl' then it can be said that black pearl was better than the dead man's chest in terms of the action sequences but dead man's chest provides you more laughs than the black pearl. But where this movie is far ahead of the 'black pearl'is its climax. The way this movie has ended is simply superb. The climax would keep one waiting anxiously for the third part in the series. All in all this movie lags behind in some aspects and is far ahead in some aspects of its predecessor. But still because of the climax it is a proper sequel to black pearl and now lets hope in the third part also the good work is continued.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Brilliant and a lot of fun to watch Jack Sparrow running to keep along with it etc. The only one thing i can moan about is the acting from Orlando Bloom and keira Knightley can be very wooden at some points but not to bad so its OK i suppose.

I really thought that's what this franchise would end up being like. And even on the writer's commentary they acknowledge that this was an option but instead decided to try and unify the movies and turn it into a trilogy where each one was strongly connected to the others. I think this was a mistake. Soooo much time is spent finding excuses to get the characters back together and keep them tied into each others stories. And perhaps if it had seemed more effortless this would have been okay. But it feels like they're grabbing at straws and relying on your love for the first one. But nothing in this film is as clever, funny, or awe inspiring as COTBP.But it's certainly not a total failure either. The cannibal island sequence, while having nothing to do with the overall plot, is an amazing piece of film-making. The stunt work there is just phenomenal. And it's the perfect balance of humor and breathtaking action. I believe it's the strongest chunk of the film. Which is odd considering it does little to move the plot along. I also love the three way sword fight near the climax. I've heard complaints that it goes on too long but I was too enthralled to notice. I thought it was expertly devised and executed. These two moments made it feel as if I were watching something I'd never seen in a movie before.But the exposition scenes seems endless and it hinders character development because so much time is spent talking about what's happening. And then talking about it some more. And some more. And then some more. And then when the characters are given new places to go it just feels off. The biggest offense being Elizabeth's sudden attraction to Jack. Their dynamic in the first film was perfect: him thinking she was hopelessly in love with him and her being completely repulsed by him. It seemed like a lame attempt at a love triangle. And while the commentary did clear up their intentions a little bit, I still feel this was a mistake. I just never bought into it.I was secretly hoping they'd shy away from the supernatural stuff this time out. In the original, aside from the curse itself, it felt as if this was all taking place in a some kind of real world. In this one that's impossible. This is like a whole other universe. While I dig Bill Nighy as Davy Jones (and WOW is that CGI incredible) I don't think he holds a candle to Barbossa. And with Barbossa's crew we had unique characters with their own personalities and not just cardboard cut out villains who are pretty much indistinguishable from one another like Jones' crew. And the whole thing with the Kraken just felt like it belonged in some other movie. That was really pushing the supernatural elements. At least for my taste.There's still A LOT to like about the movie, but like I said... I don't think it comes close to the original. It's too bloated, overly-complicated, and shamelessly steals most of its humor from COTBP. I hope At World's End fares better. But I still wish they'd concentrated on making stand alone films instead of relentlessly winking at the audience with in jokes to the original.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Fun, Solid Sequel that doesn't hold a candle to the first film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1413633/?ref_=tt_urv","austxsun","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2201073/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2006","I've just returned from the theatre where I witnessed the heralded return of the witty Captain Jack, beautiful Lizzie Swan, and honorable Will Turner. This second installment is nonstop fun action and is loaded with great special effects.The basic plot is one that does good to pull the same characters back for us to enjoy and does some at providing a further glimpse into Jack Sparrow's past by giving some background around his rise to Captainhood.All that said though... I am still a little disappointed. I watched the 1st film last night to refresh my memory prior to tonight's viewing.Most sequels fail to live up to the original (and with Disney's recent run, I probably should have expected even less) yet, after returning most of the cast from the first (strongly noted exception: Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa), the director in Gore Verbinski, and the same writers (from what I can tell), I let my expectations soar. My ship's sails fell a little flat... to me, it seems that much of the entertaining banter from the first flick was gone, lost in special effects and action sequences. There are undoubtedly efforts made, and even some successes, but the original really kept the dialogue fresh and clever - a smile rarely had time to vacate my face. Whereas the dialogue itself was the primary source of comedy in the original, I felt that much of that magic was replaced with action scene after action scene in which the viewer was bombarded with situational humor and with long sequences without much of a smile.I don't want to sound like I'm trashing this version - it really it quite fun. Looking at it now, it's almost unfair to draw comparison's to the original but sequels do invite them. I am sure that the second viewing for me will be more pleasurable as my expectations have been re-established so that I can enjoy the film for what it is: a very fun, solid sequel lacking much of the magic of the original. It will surely live strong if only due to it's predecessor's genius. Savvy? 7/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought it was good, but seemed a bit too long. Too much reliance on CGI, and seemed down right slow at times. I think this was due to so much action that you get numb to it after a bit. Depp's performance was a bit over the top, but the rest of the cast, especially the two pirates that seemed to follow everyone around, made up for it.It's a fun movie, and worth watching, but I'd have been happy waiting for it to come out on DVD.. My movie going experience may have been colored by the crowded theater, crying children, and endless commercials. Also the people who show up as the movie is starting, wandering the aisles looking for seats for their 12 person entourage.I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available and watch this again, right after the Black Pearl.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went into the movie very tired and not in the right mood. Knowing that I couldn't review a movie correctly after a tired day I went and saw Pirates again on a better day. I was glad I did. This movie was actually fun to watch, and though it is not quite as good as the first film, it is still very watchable.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp in one of the roles that will soon be one of his best) owes a blood debt to Davey Jones after Davey Jones helped him become Captain of the Black Pearl. Sparrow of course is not ready to fall into Davey Jones servitude as one of the ghastly sea creatures of the Flying Dutchmen, so he finds a way to avoid it, and this means trouble for poor Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley).Of course both Elizabeth and Will already have their own troubles for when they allowed Jack Sparrow to escape in the first film, and their wedding is interrupted and Elizabeth put in prison. Now Will must find Sparrow and make a bargain to get his compass, which leads the way to the heart of the same Davey Jones mentioned above. If not, poor Elizabeth will face the gallows for the rest of her life. Of course Elizabeth herself has other plans, and so the story continues in the second part of what is to be a three part series.The story in the second film is more confusing then the first because there are so many plot threads. That was probably why I had such a hard time seeing it the first time, however upon seeing a second screening it was much clearer. I was able to relax back and watch the entire movie without being distracted and found it to be quite an experience.Just about all the actors and actresses return in the second film, and then their are some surprise appearances that nobody, well those who haven't seen it, will suspect. All the performances were pretty good once again, and Johnny Depp is as great as ever as the pirate with the very bad hygiene. He really is enjoying this character he created, and by the profits that this movie has already made, so is everybody else.The special effects are top notch, and the scenery was quite enjoyable as well, but it is still not quite as good as the first film. I think it was because the first film had a feeling of mystery about it, whereas this film doesn't. The tale of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman just isn't as spooky as the undead crew from the Black Pearl, even though Bill Nighty gives a bravo performance as the villain just as Geoffrey Rush did in the first film.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Captain Jack Sparrow can somehow rally his troops, and travel across the ocean five minutes flat, no matter what. Restrictions like time and space are of no interest to Captain Jack Sparrow.2. Captain Jack Sparrow has no Achilles heel in this installment. No secret weakness beguiles Captain Jack Sparrow.3. Captain Jack Sparrow is not funny anymore. Neither is the Villain. No humor from the crew either. The movie is not funny at any point.The inevitable recap you'll get prior to the third installment is all you'll need to keep pace with Captain Jack and his gruesome gaggle (read: boring brigade) of cronies.

The original is fresh, inventive, utterly hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of all time. This go around is stale, tedious and blends between overly cheesy and simply odd. However for all of it's flaws, it remains a massively entertaining piece of Grade A blockbuster action. Johnny Depp provides another wildly outrageous and charismatically riveting performance, but the rest of the cast ranges from dry and repetitive, yet still insanely beautiful (Knightley) to some of the worst I've ever seen (Bloom, of course). The story is completely insignificant and wildly convoluted. Jack owes a debt to Davey Jones. Something about a beastie. Sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth. Just ridiculous reasons to keep letting Johnny be eccentric and hilarious, to provide some perfectly amazing action that is among the most entertaining I've ever seen and, ultimately, to bring in more money. Despite all of the flaws and repetitiveness of the film, the beauty of watching Johnny Gone Wild and the massive quality of entertainment that the film contains makes it completely worthwhile in my eyes.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had quite high hopes for this one as well, but tried my best to not expect to much. And thus I got almost exactly what I expected. This is a entertaining piece, fast, loud (not to loud, just right) and with some outstanding special effects (they are really, really great actually).I would seem this film had big potential for a higher score from my part, but unfortunately it plays it safe (as custom is in formula-A-feature film these days). What raises the grade from an average (5-6) is the marvelous performance of Johnny Depp and the improved (not yet perfected thought) performance of the other lead actors. Also the very nice, and progressively enhanced CGI helps the grade. This film contains more humor, which in my book never is a bad ingredient if done in a proper way, as here is.What lowers the grade is the safe-play, as mentioned. And I just can't give to much credit to a producer with dollar-signs in each eye (he himself a modern pirate, but less entertaining and more self-denying).So all in all, a mediocre film, with some shining details and fewer flaws then it's previous installment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is the perfect role for Jack Sparrow. The acting is great. The visual effects are great, at first rate.Now another problem of the film is that the film drags along. Some of the action scenes are too long. Although many didn't like the ending, because there is no ending, I liked it. We know they'll continue on for the third film so just get use to cliffhangers. There are good and funny jokes in the movie, many of them involving Johnny Depp. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) make up is amazing.Kracken, the infamous cool-looking sea monster, also drags the film.

I thought perhaps Disney had sailed off course and decided to make a monster movie rather than a pirate movie. But, shiver me timbers, Pirates skillfully ties in sea faring legend and myth to create a mysterious back story for Jack that leads to an exciting supernatural adventure.There's a treasure-trove of amazing swordplay action--- incredible three way sword fight scene, plot twists, special effects --- one word, Kraken, a bit of romance, humor and surprises. The movie is rated PG-13, and there's definitely some intense scenes that may be too scary for younger audiences.The ending ***no spoiler *** made me want to shout.

But NOTHING could have prepared me for the wild adventure Dead Man's Chest turned out to be. It was, for me, clearly the best movie I have ever seen and has officially pushed The Curse of the Black Pearl into second place on my list of favourite movies. The movie still has the same, warm ""Pirates"" feel about it but is packed with lots more adventure, hilarious laughs, and an all-round great movie which is DEFINITELY worth seeing. Don't be fooled by what other critics have said about it being a flop and a disappointment; I was nowhere near disappointed, if anything, it was BETTER than what I had expected. Towards the end of the movie are three major shocks, some of you will see some of them coming, but mark my words: Nobody will leave the cinema and say ""I saw all that coming"" because nobody could possibly foresee the great work that the POTC cast and crew have done - yet again. I give this movie 10/10, without the slightest doubt in my mind. Go see it. It is truly enjoyable.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a sort of 'plea bargain' Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander)informs Will that he will give Elizabeth and Will a pardon if he is able to recover Jack Sparrow's compass. When Will tells Jack that he wants his compass to give to Lord Beckett in order to get a pardon for him and Elizabeth, Jack agrees but only if Will gets him the key for Davy Jones's locker. Jack wants to get to this locker as he believes that it will bestow untold benefits for the person who unlocks this locker. However, Jack isn't the only one who is interested in what's in Davy Jones's locker. There are several parties who are desperate to get their hands on the key for the locker and each person/party has their own reasons for desperately wanting to 'unlock' the locker - but who will get there first? There is no doubt that this is a more than satisfactory entry into the franchise. All the elements from the first film are very much present -there is humour, great effects, the story was good once again and the cinematography was also fantastic. Johnny Depp once again stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow - he had me in stitches at times (sometimes without evening saying anything). His mannerisms alone made me laugh.There are a couple of minor negatives to this entry in the POTC franchises; Firstly, there were a couple of times when the film seemed to drag and there was the odd occasion when it got a tad boring (something that definitely couldn't be said about the first film). Secondly, Davy Jones just wasn't a particularly good villain (Captain Barbossa was fantastic in the first film and seemed to have a bit of character). I just didn't feel the same way about Davy Jones, for me he was a pretty forgettable villain). There were a couple of scenes that were completely ridiculous (sword fighting on a rolling wheel & Sparrow pole vaulting head first between two cliffs) but to be honest those scenes were so funny that I really didn't care about how silly they were as I was too busy laughing to care.Overall then this film is still entertaining and the acting was good by all involved - but the lack of a good villain and a couple of boring moments in the middle of the film let it down slightly. If you're a fan of the first film, then you'll enjoy this film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The acting is overdone. The action is overdone. The comedy is forced. There are way too many sub plots that barely make sense. Even the main plot doesn't make sense. Its an extremely unnecessary sequel just trying to cash in for Disney. It baffles me how everyone seems to think this movie was a triumph.In addition, remember in the first film how interesting Sparrow was.? You were never sure if he was good or bad, and just when you thought he was bad, he had an ingenious plot that proved he was good. There is none of that in this film. I daresay that Captain Jack wasn't likable in this film. He was completely content on sacrificing 100 souls for his own including Will.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! The cliffhanger at the end was incredibly stupid just trying to get you to see the third movie. Captain Jack dies and a voodoo woman tells everyone to look for jack Sparrow but they'll need a captain who knows those waters. Enter Captain Barbossa who says: ""So what's become of my ship?"" then bites that unnaturally green apple from the first one.Not only did this cliffhanger make no sense but the line and apple thing was horrible. The apple was like if Barbossa had a catchphrase like ""Kiss my grits"". Bitin the apple was like having him say a stupid irrelevant catchphrase like that.Basically, this movie ruined the magic of the first one.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The storyline was great, but the darkness of this film left me with a sick stomach. Davy Jones looked good, but his evil character was too over the top. The scenes on Davy Jones' boat were gross, with all the sea creature humans doing hard labor and getting whipped. The opening scene with Jack Sparrow was also quite troubling, at the Pirate Prison. Seeing men being tortured, eaten by crows, and dragged off screaming is not my cup of tea when I'm expecting a fun-filled Pirates Of The Caribbean adventure. Jack Sparrow leaves you feeling unsatisfied with his wit, when you compare it to the first movie. The good thing, however, is that the ending leaves you with a hope of the next movie being much, much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.This was appalling drivel & I'm staggered so many have rated it as high as the first. What were you watching? Sparrow's character was one of the greatest in movie history. It was nothing here, he lacked any of the charisma or lines of the original and to paraphrase another critic here the ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" characterisation was flogged to death. Knightley seemed far too cocky in her role and Bloom was given a lot of screen time for a plot which never bordered on interesting. Although the latter could've been avoided had they merely removed the entire 45 minute tribesman / island scene near the beginning which served absolutely no point to the rest of the film whatsoever.Whereas in the original the plot was simple & yet brilliantly effective this was a complete mess & merely a selection of incoherent & unnecessary scenes lumped together and seemingly decided on 1) how much they cost to film & 2) how loud they were as opposed to whether they added anything to the film at all.The target audience seemed completely different to the first. The original seemed to be written towards intelligent adults but with consideration to younger viewers. I mean no offence here, but I got the feeling 90% of this was aimed at the average three year old, bar the concept of Davy Jones which would be asking a bit for a 12 or 13 year old to take on board first time. If you'd gone more than a couple of minutes without a good line or scene (which it frequently did) throw in a few ""man gets hit on head with rock"" or ""man trips over"" gags & all will be forgotten. Granted in my cinema they got a few laughs, but they sounded like children's laughs in comparison to the original.I'd accumulated about 250 questions & points I was unsure of within the first half hour and while some were answered later on (too late usually - as you'd got past caring) the key points were usually glossed over so quickly, presumably so the plot holes & plot jumps were not questioned. Much of this was brought about by too many characters in the film as a whole, particularly early on.A good sequel IMO, is one where you imagine the original had never existed and this was it instead. Regardless of whether the plot is better or worse does it still offer the originality & core values of the first film. This never came close. The plot was dull & sacrificed for noise & effects & the characters had nothing likable about them. The major ones never evolved at all, the minor ones just recycled the same gags & lines from the first film, which were great then but not again.I still await the 3rd film with anticipation. There's every chance it could be another classic like the original, especially if they take on board the faults of this one. Lets hope Pirates of the Caribbean follows in the mould of Die Hard with two classic films at ever end, with a pointless one sandwiched between them.Sorry but 1/10 - no redeeming qualities at all.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp comes up with another scintillating performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, as he tries to overcome his greatest fear, to undo himself of the bind of Davey Jones of the Flying Dutchman. And we are left to wonder what will happen at The World's End next year, will Jack Sparrow return with the help of the treacherous Barbossa ?? Or shall the East India Company reign supreme now that they have Davey Jones at their side.Gore Verbinsky leave the movie with full of riddles and thoughts, but indeed like the previous movie, this one is also all about Jack Sparrow. Although the plot is based on Will Turner, by all necessities Jack Sparrow is the one who controls the entire speed of the movie. Johnny Depp is again mind blowing as the wily pirate. Orlando Bloom is a huge disappointment, although the script didn't actually give him much scope too. Bill Nighy is good, but I felt, he could have been better if the needs be. Keira Knightley also gives a heart warming performance as the luscious Elizabeth Swann.The entire movie is full of action. Whether its a chase of two ships, or some great sword fighting, or some hilarious escapes. Gore Verbinsky sets the pace of the movie early, and gives us a great movie. But the only drawback of Dead Man's Chest is that it didn't give me the complete movie experience. Because the story remains incomplete. Unlike Black Pearl where the story became complete, Dead Man' Chest clearly gives way to a sequel. Although unlike other trilogies (Matrix, LOTR), here the second part is equally good. The camera work is good, original score by Hans Zimmer, isn't flashy but still well appropriate. Visual Effects will also score a point.Overall, its a good movie, but its all Johnny Depp through and through.A very well deserved 8/10 !!!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

To be honest, before I wasn't even really thinking too much about seeing the second Pirates. Not that I didn't enjoy the first one, Pirates: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a fantastic film. Just I thought that Jerry was probably going to take full advantage of it and just want to make some money off of these movies.While some jokes are recycled, the movie is still so great and breath taking. The special effects alone are incredible and my mom and I were just raving about them to other people who haven't seen the film yet. Johnny once again has stolen the show with his incredible wit, sense of humor, and quirkiness as the unforgettable James Sparrow. Orlando added the drama and heartbreak to the story, you can't help but feel for him when he finds his long lost father who is now cursed to a lifetime of slavery. Kiera as Elizabeth though, ticked me off a bit. Despite knowing this is a fictional story, her character is a lady of stature and would never know in a million years how to sword fight.Still, while there are some little tiny flaws, you quickly get past them. Pirates of the Caribbena: Dead Man's Chest is one of the most highly anticipated and best movies of the year! I would highly recommend this for a great flick to catch! 9/10","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have to admit I never actually got round to watching the first POC until 2 weeks ago. Shame on me. I went to the premier, and what an amazing experience to see the whole audience- ranging from young to old totally mesmerized with the film. Johnny Depp as captain jack sparrow was amazing, kiera knightly was extremely good and played the spoilt rich girl very well... but I have to say that I found Orlando a little disappointing. I can't help but feel that every film he is in he always seems to play the same characterand its getting boring. Unlike Johnny who goes from being a children's fantasy chocolate factory character to a cheating scheming pirate The graphics in the film are overwhelming- especially that of Davy Jones. The graphic artists have pulled out all the stops and believe me it blows you away! I won't tell you too much about the story line as I wouldn't want to spoil the film for you but the compass idea is amazing especially when he is in the boat and he realizes what he really wants! You will understand what I'm going on about when you watch it! Overall it is without a doubt the best film that I have seen all year and I think it will remain that way for a long time its going to take something EXTREMELY good to out do this marvelous film! Go watch it or else! Savvy!!!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This film is a lot of fun and very exciting throughout. Yes it does follow the star wars format for trilogy's as the x-men series did and this is dark like the empire strikes back. There are a few minor down points like the cgi isn't always up to scratch and some characters don't get enough screen time, but for me this film is all about great action set pieces and watching Johnny Depp do his thing as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom does a much better job as Will Turner this time around, i felt he was one of weak links in the first film, i cringed as he delivered his line ""goodbye"" after finishing off a pirate. After watching a very satisfying film such as Dead Mans Chest the only bad feeling is knowing i have to wait until next year for the third instalment.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Also the opening scene wasn't as breathtaking as with the first film, it could have been the scene with Captain Jack Sparrow after that. Captain Jack Sparrow was awesome yet again and he was great when he visited Disneyland Paris a few weeks ago (I wasn't there though), Jack did a great impression of Johnny Depp!!Honestly, my expectations of this movie where so high it couldn't possibly live up to it although it came close.

The film distinctly lacks pace and often grinds to a dead stop. Scenes which should be rolling along with the velocity of a runaway train, stagger and falter like a drunk. For example the overlong scene between Jack Sparrow and the cannibals. The main characters boarded and left the Flying Dutchman so rapidly I lost track of what ship they were supposed to be on after a while.I'm afraid the film has fallen into the Star Wars trap of replacing plot with special effects.Watch the first Pirates and then this one and you will see what I mean.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

The makers of the film will do their best to milk out the success of the original. This film is no different. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and film distributor Walt Disney, have done that to the maximum. On it's way to the financial success of this film they managed to take any freshness from the first film and left us with one boring, long and chaotic film. Everything that was working to the advantage of the 1st film has become a disadvantage of this sequel. The characters are as shallow as the sea level after the high tide(and when you see they are credits for 4 writers for characters, one can wonder what were they paid for). The jokes are not working. The action sequences are too long and make the film longer than it actually is. Its 150 minutes playing time seems like eternity. You want the film to end but had to endure more and more of this nonsense. The script is full of holes and can be summarised in one sentence(as 2 of the characters do, somewhere in the film). The script and therefore the film has no logic and serve only as a point to promote the Disney's attraction its based upon. The film doesn't even try to explain why some of the things happened it basically says: That is how it is, live with it. You want logic, look somewhere else. The open ending(and not only ending-some plot-lines remain unresolved) suggest that this film is a long exposition for the 3rd installment of this franchise(logic when you know that part 2 en 3 were filmed simultaneously).In 2 sentences: A waist of time and money. Ignore this film and you will be rewarded.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp again did an awesome job with Jack Sparrow, I loved Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. The character who surprised me the most was Elizabeth, in the first movie I thought she was a little irritating. In this film Keira Knightly portrayed a strong independent woman. Orlando Bloom was a bit stiff but he portrayed Will appropriately. Davy Jones' crew, in my opinion, were far more disturbing that Barbossa's cursed crew in the previous film.

I wasn't expecting much going into it, because I also disliked the first Pirates film. This one was worse. And why was it so bad? you may ask. I am a very picky person who does not enjoy most films anyway, so this is quite normal for me. The film simply tried too hard to make people like it. And you know what? For the most part, it worked. The film has lots and lots of action, and lots and lots of yelling. Lots and lots of ugly creatures, and lots and lots of the good-looking stars. There was never a dull moment. Aaaaaand that's why this film bored me so. The whole time I was in the theatre, I was thinking to myself, ""Calm down, Pirates movie! It's okay! The audience isn't going to walk out of the theatre if you take a breather!"" It was just too much. Too much of everything; trying way way too hard. Therefore, I was completely and utterly bored in the theatre, angry that I had come to see this silly little film. All I know is that at the end of the film, I really didn't care about what happened next...so much of everything went on EXCEPT any reason to like any one of the characters. I hated them all for being so one-dimensional. Action, yes. Likable characters, not to me. Maybe I just prefer the simple things in life, like the quiet.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

I didn't think they would be able to make a movie as good as the first. I thought they would go the safe route and simply remake the first one, only have a different backdrop.I have never been so glad to be wrong.For the first 30 to 45 minutes, I was cringing. They kept referencing the first movie in such a way it seemed to me they were saying, ""We had a huge hit with the first movie and it was a lot of fun, so don't forget it!"". It seemed they weren't sure this movie was going to do well, so they had to keep reminding people how well the first movie did. But it slowly and surely started to change. The first sign of the change was the arrival of Davy Jones. You know an actor does an amazing job when someone can recognize who they are, beneath prosthetics and CGI. Bill Nighy plays Davy Jones, and does a wonderfully brilliant job.The next sign was the characters started to change. Elizabeth and Jack Sparrow in particular. Both of the characters were explored in such a way that it showed them to be real people, and not one-dimensional movie characters. They were real people. Jack Sparrow was a pirate and made decisions like a pirate. The only character that wasn't memorable was Will Turner. The reason for that I believe is that he was exactly the same character as in the first movie. He was static, nothing changed with him, his character wasn't pursued. Jack, Elizabeth, and a third character were dynamic and changing, and therefore interesting. Will was not. This third character arrived, and at first, I wasn't sure why he was in this movie, but it was a very good choice.The story takes this Pirates far beyond the scope of the first. It is much more epic, but at the same time it is more focused on the characters and their fights and inner turmoil. Perhaps that is why it seems so epic.The music, though not done by the original composer, is very much a credit to this movie. It still has some of the recognizable themes from the first movie, but takes it further.This movie has some funny parts and very well done scenes. Several of the fights are very memorable, as are the characters faces during those fights. Johnny Depp stated that he purposefully took Jack Sparrow in a funnier direction. Despite all of this, however, it is a much heavier movie. The last hour of the movie is a continual desperate life or death fight.I'm sure you've heard that this movie ends on a cliffhanger. I tend to disagree. This movie ends with all its loose ends wrapped up nicely. It had closure, but opened the door for the third movie. Go into the movie thinking this, that Pirates of the Caribbean is a series. You've watched the first episode, and now you're going to see the second episode. Don't take it as a standalone movie, because it's not, and it wasn't made to be.In conclusion, this movie did everything a sequel should do. It is not the first movie, and that is a good thing. If you go into it wanting it to be like the first one, well, just go watch the first one again. You most likely won't like this movie. I prefer a sequel to be new and interesting, not old and predictable. This movie did build upon the first, but expanded the storyline and made it more epic. It took (most) of the characters into new and uncharted territories, delving into their humanity. It nicely answered most of the questions, but left a few unanswered until the third. And lastly, the final scene makes you excited to go see the third. I wholeheartedly recommend going to see this movie","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

How did the two fools, on their own, drag the ship back into the water? For that matter, how did a ship like that come to be fully out of the water with no damage in the first place? (It must draft at least 12 feet - there was no way the tides on that beach rise and fall over 12 feet.) 5) Ending - two and a half hours, with no ending - not even a partial ending.

Fantastic actually. I really enjoyed it.This second installment in the trilogy was easily the best so far. Once again, Johnny Depp delivered in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley provided outstanding performances as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. In addition to the main cast, Bill Nighy gave a spectacular performance as Davey Jones.Dead Mans Chest keeps you laughing and always wanting more, which it does deliver. As I said, Dead Mans Chest is better then the first, and I highly recommend the film to everyone.And remember one important thing mate... He's Captain Jack Sparrow!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My expectations were met, and more, in places. The effects are incredible, the sword fights are intense, and it just is an all-around fun summer flick. The main problem, I think, is with the plot. I had to look at the little kids book to get the main idea of it, and I still have to look at it to know who is going where, and who has what, etc, etc, etc. (This is why I gave it an 8) Still, I think it's a teensy-weensy better than the first, even though the first has a better plot. It kept me interested and excited through the 2 and a half hours, while the first left me bored in some places. The humor has been hyped up a lot, which made the film, for me, much more enjoyable. The score is about the same as the first film. But the cinematography is stunning, and the shots are incredible. The acting, well, about the same as the first. Depp is excellent as always, while the rest are satisfactory. Not great, but definitely not bad. I had a wonderful time seeing this film, and wanted to cheer and give a standing ovation, but didn't since this audience was a lousy one and just left the theater. But I digress. I heartily recommend you watching this film without soda. It is so exciiting you will not want to leave to use the restroom, believe me. It does end on a cliffhanger, and I can't wait until the next one releases. P.S. Listen closely to Naomie Harris (Tia Dalma?) because in the theater I couldn't understand half the words she said.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's the STAR of the park. And Pirates of the Caribbean. Dead man's chest, is the main attraction of the box office.The strong point of this movie is its entertaining flavor. You should watch this film without any prejudice against blockbusters: Pirates is an attraction. The whole cast and crew were aware of that, and that's its strong point. Except for its extended running time, Pirates doesn't contain any mistake for a blockbuster: a thrilling plot, a few brush-strokes of drama, attractive main characters and a whole world of adventure are its top qualities. The art direction, make-up, costume design, music, cinematography, sound and special FX are excellent as expected from a $225 million movie.The plot sets off inside an event, a wedding, and finishes in another one, some sort of funeral. It doesn't matter, believe me. The excellent story was written by screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (same tandem of the first Pirates) so we should not talk about this at all: it is pure entertainment. It's a master class of ""How to make a good entertaining screenplay and not to die in the attempt"". In ten minutes we're in the roller-coaster, and we won't stop before 150 minutes. Too much, I know, but the comical 1920's slapstick movies style mood and the fascinating creatures of this world are enough to hook us to the seat. These are the safety belts of the attraction. You will forget about the WC, the thirst and the hunger.What about the cast? It's simply excellent. Johnny Depp is unforgettable as Capitan Jack Sparrow: so dirty and bad, he really is a pirate. The Orlando and Keira team is fresher than in the first movie, and the rest of the cast is absolutely hilarious and comic, as the movie needs.In the next Academy Awards ceremony, I hope to hear the name of Pirates a minimum of five times for the technical departments. To find Pirates in the final Five would be a dream come true, it really deserves it.More information: www.box office.es","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But Kiera and Orlando are back swashbuckling. The actions Secns are really cool. the have great advanture. but be warned if you are under 13 there is a lot more blood and guts and this movie is much darker from the first one. which is surprising for a Disney movie.

What do you think of? You think of the wonderfully witty, humorous, fun movie that came out in 2003. Not the piece of garbage that called Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.I walked in thinking it was going to be a great movie, and I was ready for it. Walking out, I realized all the money was spent on special effects and not enough on the actual screenplay. There were too many plot twists, and the lovable characters from the original Pirates movie were gone. Jack barely had any parts, Will was in it way too much, and Elizabeth (the best one out of all of them) wasn't given enough to do.They tried too hard to incorporate real history so it all seemed fake.I am terribly disappointed in this movie, and am not going to see the 3rd one in theaters (if it even goes in the theaters).

Just absolutely fantastic. Much more entertaining as the first. It had great action, great scary moments, but they were more like jump, not get grossed out. Great romance, but it was obviously just a setup for part 3, at the end of the world. But overall i loved this movie. The theater i was at was absolutely packed, so a lot of cheering and clapping. I loved the movie. The biggest problem was the way it explained things, the movie starts off, you don't even know how long after black peal, and they never want to really explain what happened, you know will and Elizabeth were going to get married,d, so they were engaged, but they couldn't. And then some new governor guy, you don't even know where he came from, it was trying to explain ahead, taking no time to explain behind and at the current time. The sea monsters weren't as cool as the undead pirates, but they looked cooler. There is a 4 part fight that takes place, ( it's the only super cool fight. ) That's just amazing. The flying Dutchman was cool, and Davy Jones was just awesome. There is a huge cliff hanger ending, and some one returns from the dead, and someone dies. So yeah, honestly, as good as it was it was setting up for the last part of the trilogy. But i really enjoyed this movie. There is 3 seems with the Garrik or w/e, the giant dragon octopus. Well, he's fighting the black pearl in one scene, and it's crew, and i was just sitting there on the edge of my seat thinking, so when is Toby gonna show up in the red and blue suit? ( if you don't now what that means, your just dumb. ) But i loved the movie, funnier than the first, and the monkey is back, Johnny doesn't have as much funny lines. But he does a lot more funny actions. This is NOT a kids movie, don't take any one under 10, they will be scared to death! But if you read the story books for the movie, don't worry, it's a lot better. But overall i loved this movie.Characters: 10/10, great,! Acting: 9/10 Johnny Dept didn't do quite as good a job as in the first.Character Development: 9/10 The main character development was perfect, but the other characters you only saw for about 10 minutes of screen time max.Story: 8/10 : Obviosly setting up for at worlds end, but it stayed strong, and lots of great plot twists.Feel to the movie: 10/10: Just edge of your seat, laughing, cheering, great movie.entertaining: 11/10: Most entertaining movie i've ever seen.action: 8/10: It was great, but only two really long sword fights, and the style of the sword fighting i didn't prefer, i prefer more of a star wars episode 3 battle kind of fighting, you know, Jedi and what not.CG: Amazing, best ever Period! 10/10 Scary: 9/10 As scary as it could be for a PG-13 family movie... Well, teen family movie...Appropriateness: 8/10 I found a lot of scenes that would scare little children, so don't take them to it.But overall i loved this movie, 9.8 out of 10, and it can't win an Oscar, because it had no gays, it was entertaining, had good acting, good story, great CG. Seriously though, go see this movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The locations were great and the action, even if the movie was a little long, was well worth seeing it in theaters. I know a lot of people are iffy about the ending, but I found it was well done. It's not like it leaves you in the middle of the adventure, you still get a sense of it being an entity on its own.The only things I didn't like about it were 1) the make-up (ok, Keira's beautiful but does her face have to look pristine after a fight?), and 2) the big difference in accents and ""level of education"" between characters.If you approach the movie like you're going to see a movie version of a book - and you know the story could have been better - you'll still like the experience.

And the original characters develop so much more from the first movie, showing you more of their motives and reasonings. Jack is still a humorous, swashbuckling, stumbling, pirate; but he definitely shows more of the compassionate, and human side of his personality that you don't see in the first movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is fun. Lots of fun.It's a long movie. At least 2 hours. It feels long but it doesn't drag. This is the main difference between this Pirates movie and the last one, The Curse of the Black Pearl. Black Pearl was becalmed in the waters of excitement by the end; Dead Man's Chest does whatever the opposite sailing analogy of 'becalmed' is.It is a British movie. The cast is lots of fun and all the supporting players are talented. British actors everywhere. One actor who is not British is Stellan Skarsgård. He is superb. He's always superb, he's a great actor. Jack Davenport brings the humour and coolness that Coupling fans expect. Orlando Bloom is less underwhelming than in his last Pirates appearance. This seems to be partly from being given less dialogue and partly from improvement in his acting. Keira Knightley is also good.The two main actors are Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. Depp had everyone in the theatre laughing and Nighy is so good as the voice of (and presumably the CGI model for) Davy Jones that he isn't recognisable. Davy Jones is all you see and he seems very alive and convincing.Speaking of Davy Jones, the special effects in this movie are good. They are not completely realistic but they are less comical and obvious than the effects in the last Pirates movie, even when the effects are trying to be comical and obvious.The music is clichéd and stale but it would be weird to have genuinely moving music in such a silly movie.The movie is absurd. Just like the last Pirates movie there is all kinds of comical action. It is very amusing.This movie is worth seeing. The entire movie is fun. A packed theatre suits the movie well.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was TOTALLY worth it.The excitement throughout the theater was amazing. Every time one of the original characters appeared for the first time everyone cheered. (Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, etc.)People from the age of (what looked like) 80 to 10 were there. I Guess Johnny Depp got exactly what he wanted. He wanted every person that went to see the movie, regardless of age, to enjoy it and get the same thing out of it.I went with my best friend and my dad. My friend and i are absolutely obsessed with these movies and, well, Johnny Depp himself. Now my dad on the other hand, has never really been a Johnny Depp fan and never saw the Curse of the Black Pearl. Although, about 10 seconds after the end credits (which reminds me, watch all the way until the very last person is credited in this movie.) he told me that we were watching The Curse of the Black Pearl this weekend because he never realized why i loved these movies so much and why i begged him to drive us all the way out to Universal at 10:30 to get good seats and make sure we got our reserved tickets.This movie is just as funny as the first, and a lot of the jokes from the first movie are revisited (making them about 5x funnier).Overall, this movie surpassed the expectations that were set, making it one of the best movies of (quite possibly) the year.So what are you doing?

So much for Johnny Depps reputation as an independent actor, now officially having sold out for multi millions of $$$, happy meals, Disney toys, etc... Can't say I blame him now that he's supporting a family and paying the bills like the rest of us, but this could have been a much better film if a real investment in character development, the forbidden love story, and Capt Jack's dilemma were made. I'm sure the kids will love it though and happily shell out a weeks worth of allowance to see part 3 next summer.","16 out of 32 found this helpful.

But Dead Man's Chest manages just that... From start to finish this is nothing short of breathtaking... All the characters that we've come to love from the original make a welcome appearance too with a few new additions - this most notably being Bill Nighy's outstanding and scene stealing take on the legendary Davy Jones.Jonathan Pryce also has more screen time I feel which is a huge plus to me (he's my favourite actor) and brings more depth to the character than we had previously seen.Orlando Bloom does a so-so performance as Will Turner - the sort of performance that we come to expect from him. Nothing spectacular but good nonetheless.Keira Knightley as Elizabeth is a sensational turn - and how the character has progressed! Simply amazing! But it has to be Johnny Depp who steals the entire film with the return of lovable rogue, Captain Jack Sparrow.The music is also a step up from the predecessor and helps to add to the tensions, trials and tribulations facing the Black Pearl crew. At times even being literal edge of the seat moments - none more than the appearance of the mythical Krakken - Davy Jones's hit-man.In short I can't think of a possible bad thing to say about this film - I loved it from start to finish! And if you're anything like me having loved the original then you too will love this film. I only await next year's release of the third installment - and it's the way I felt with the LOTR trilogy! Roll on next year!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I would love to tell you a little of what goes on in the movie, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. Oh and one last thing, I would highly recommend NOT waiting for it to come out on DVD before you see it, as the theater experience adds a lot to it I think what with the surround-sound and the big screen.Happy viewing to you.

"10","/10","The best movie of the summer...savvy?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1413084/?ref_=tt_urv","LemonyShepard","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3962532/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2006","I've seen many great movies this summer: X-Men 3, Cars, Click, Superman Returns...but one of them blows the others clear out of the water (no pun intended). Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is, by far, the ultimate summer movie, being even better than Curse of the Black Pearl.The movie begins with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (played by Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly, respectively) arrested for aiding the roguish Jack Sparrow (the ingenious Johnny Depp) in acts of piracy. Meanwhile, Jack is reminded of his debt to the ghostly Davey Jones (voiced by Bill Nighly). In order to save himself from Davey's locker, Jack must find the key to the Dead Man's Chest and steal its contents.The movie is highly action-packed and introduces many great characters, along with bringing back some old favorites (Pintel and Ragetti returning for some amazing comic relief). The special effects are top-notch and Davey Jones, though completely CGI, looks 100% real and still sends shivers down one's timbers. Kevin McNally does another remarkable job as pirate Gibbs, having a slightly larger part in this movie. A nice addition to the cast is the somewhat freaky-looking Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), who shares a humorous scene with Jack involving an undead monkey and a jar of dirt. Classic! The story never seemed rushed and was never dull at any point. Johnny Depp is as amazing as ever. People actually applauded in the theatre when he appeared on screen in his hilarious introduction. Orlando Bloom definitely seemed to have taken some acting lessons or something because his performance in this movie was a lot better than the first. Kiera Knightly is, of course, as beautiful as ever, but that doesn't mean that she can't kick a little pirate booty. Norrington makes another appearance and, man, were people shocked to see him and hiscondition. Sadly, Cutler Beckett and Bootstrap Bill Turner are supposed to be important characters, you never feel a strong attachment with them. Maybe if they got more screen time? One of the best scenes involves Will, Jack, Elizabeth, Norrington, Pintel, Ragetti, and Davey's phantom army fighting for the Dead Man's Chest. It was probably the best scene in the movie.And then, there's the ending. The last ten minutes had everyone in the theatre on the edge of their seats, and the last ten seconds left everyone breathless and crying out for more. The great thing about this movie is, no matter how long it is, you never seem to want enough. That's what makes a great movie.Phenomenal acting, a great story, and a cliff-hanging plot-twist that makes Pirate-fan's hearts skipping, this movie promises to be this summer's biggest blockbustersavvy?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

After seeing the movie myself, I am still confused.This movie lacked any of the originality and fun that the first one possessed. While the first movie was a pleasant surprise, this was a disappointment. All the jokes were merely references to the original. It was funny the first time, but if I wanted to laugh at rum jokes, I would have rented the first one. I wanted something new and dynamic; instead I got re-runs and a convoluted plot that made no sense.This movie has some upside, it looked great, there was a lot of action, and the acting was pretty good. However it suffered from an unoriginal script, and absurd and confusing plot, and massive, unexplained changes in certain characters. Not to mention it was much too long and nothing really happened. I can only hope that the sequel to Dead Man's Chest is the better half of this two-act play.I don't understand how everyone can be praising this movie other than blind love of Captain Jack. This movie brought almost nothing to the table and left me bored. It is visually stunning, and the actors are good, but there is too much flash and not enough substance.5 out of 10, you will see it, but you won't be happy you did.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

The plot serves the special effects and the fight scenes rather than vice versa. it seems as if the movie was about what and how the actions took place, then a connector story was built to put all those special effect scenes together.

A bustling entertainment, pure and simple. The plot is, in the most simplistic terms, not the point. Like a Dashiell Hammett novel it's all about the aura and dialogue. Not to mention characters, trust me the film has MANY of those.But, I'll attempt a brief plot summary. Jack Sparrow owes a debt to the ultra- heavy of the sea, Davy Jones... the payment... his soul, well that or 100 other souls. To slight Davy Jones Jack gets assistance from Will Turner. Little does Jack know Will and his fiancé Elizabeth are being hunted for helping Sparrow, a known pirate escape a grizzly fate. The only way of achieving freedom is retrieving Jack's compass for the evil Lord Beckett. Will gets involved for more than he bargained for and has to battle against Jones at Sparrow's side.Acting wise 'Chest' has nearly no rough patches. Depp brings undeniable comedic energy to Sparrow and though un-recognizable physically, Nighy's Jones is a wonderful villain. Plus, Bloom has seemingly improved since the first outing.The effects are dazzling but that goes without saying. As to the detractors who complain the entire film is setup for number three, I tell you this: It's the best damn setup money can buy!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I must say that I owe those naysayers a vote of thanks, as I was so anticipating this work, that it had no way of fulfilling my hopes. Thanks to their dire condemnations and overly enthusiastic tongue-clicking, I had a marvelous and unexpectedly thrilling movie-going experience.The best most well-done element of this movie? The WHOLE movie! I'm serious. There wasn't a moment of wasted film, there wasn't even one time when I was wondering what time it was, and there wasn't a single performance which was found lacking in any way. This was a 3 hour film which felt like it was over too soon. And, if you've been one of the millions of fans who have kept up with this work through its production, then you also know the original cast is back, including the nefarious Barbossa (NOT a spoiler, he's listed in the credits), in addition to an entire cast of new characters, thrilling action, mahogany storyline, superior sound, and stellar awards-quality effects.The Verbinski/Bruckheimer marriage seems to be a good one; a profitable one, but more importantly, a creative one. The story incorporates each and every element of a successful well-loved classic. There is romance, action, adventure, horror, fantasy, monsters, pirates, chases, betrayals, escapes, treacheries and deceits, honesty, and love. All set before breathtaking vistas, and finished with completely realistic, top quality effects.With the benefit of virtually no time taken to redevelop the principal characters, the story kicks in from the beginning, and the character development is devoted to the new cast of characters. What a twisted darkling lot they are!Make sure you stay for the bonus scene after end credits!I was most impressed with this work, and rate it slightly above the original for its story and a slightly superior adventure experience, at an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's at the same level as the first one, which everyone seemed to love. Yes, there are some things to complain about, mostly that there's just way too much going on. Characters from the first one that, if you last saw it when it was in the theaters (as I did), you won't remember pop up at regular intervals. There are several separate plot lines going on at the same time, and once in a while one character will be away on his or her own adventure for a long time and then come back to the main plot line without explaining where they've been or what they've been doing, and requiring no explanation for what has happened with all the other characters. But, really, so what? There's more than enough exposition elsewhere, and as long as the audience understands what's going on, it doesn't matter too much. The story may be overcomplicated, but it's generally very good. The bottom line is that the movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Of all the movies this summer, this is the one that doesn't disappoint at all. It's a thousand times better than Superman, that's for sure. Where Superman was slow and dull and ponderous, Pirates' action never stops (which I'm sure will annoy some) and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than a really fun ride. There're a lot of cool monsters, too. If you liked the first one, definitely don't miss this while it's still on the big screen.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Thinking about it, nothing in the plot makes any particular sense.While the first movie had at least some of the swashbuckling adventure air you'd expect from a pirate flick, I found it lacking from the static and mostly dark settings of this one, felt more like a bad horror movie afloat on a studio pool. The special effects are professionally done, but as usual these days they are way overdone. I still wonder why the flying dutchman, originally a legendary ghost, had to look like Cuthullu with a hat. As for laughs and entertainment, I simply fell asleep about one hour into the movie.I recommend that anybody who likes classic pirate movies or has any knowledge about what a real ship sails like should not make himself suffer through this one.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

And I'm a computer geek. Even if a movie isn't great I can usually find something good.What happened to Johnny Depp? He seemed out of sorts and his character was really not very interesting. And certainly not very pirate like.Kera - beautiful but seemed unnecessary to this movie. Sure she's beautiful, but I didn't see the need for her.The octopus scenes were just stupid being repeated so many times. I hope the director and editors learn from some of the comments from the people here at IMDb.I fell asleep for a bit, which I never do in a movie. Geez too bad. The scenery was nice on the islands, and of course the leads are easy on the eyes... but man.

A grand adventure of escapism and it succeeds where so many sequels fail, fantastic digital effects combined with the action and enough inside jokes for the fans of the original to be pleasantly pleased, and new comers both to enjoy this grand feature.Although Orlando Bloom fans might have wanted some more, the back story is also added to, and Kierra Knightley's Ms. Swann take on a slightly more..uhm, physical role, but Depp goes about his scenes with the distinctive air and flair he first portrayed in the original movie. Which is precisely what he needed to do, rather than overplay his role Depp again shows that grand ability he has often shown, by being bigger than life by showing restraint in capturing the essence of his character once again.The opening night audience of course, perhaps the hardest of all film goers to please, enjoyed moments throughout the film from beginning to end, and I highly recommend any fans of the original to see this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is better than the original in my opinion on all fronts. The Effects are tremendous and live up too the reputation that Disney has set up for this franchise. I particularly enjoyed dead mans chest for the real old fashioned good pirate story in the flick. In Particular I enjoyed the performance of Bill Nighy under the tentacle adorned Davy Jones. The film is a little long in the tooth at 2 1/2 hours but is worth every minute, the actors here are the film , and to think that Disney exec's were terrified when they saw how Depp portrayed Jack Sparrow ... I think the real scary part of that is those exec's all still have jobs ... this was a truly inspired performance . Rumour has it we will be seeing the mentor of that performance in the third installment very soon ... Three Guesses ... and the first two are both Keith Richards.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Now, admittedly, it is not up to Curse of the Black Pearl standard but it is still a 10/10 film in its own right. Maybe if we were talking out of 100 Curse's edge could be shown in the rating.I think the main place that DMC falls down is that it is TOO funny. CoBP was very dark - Sparrow had been written as a straight character and then was played comically. In contrast, Sparrow has been written as a comedic role in DMC and this makes him a bit OTT on the funny stakes and it does feel a tiny bit forced at times. But essentially this is more of the same adventure and fantasy.However, this is still an excellent film with brilliant performances all round - the development of Will and Norrington stand out as the main growth/change in character.The ending is frustrating - but only because you want to see what happens in part 3. Here's hoping it carries on in the same fashion and keeps the high standard.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There *IS* a lot of action, and as action movie action goes, it's pretty well-done.

Ah clever people at Disney hope it works for them because the ride like the films deserves success.Jokes a plenty based on the first film. And having watched the DVD I noticed characters and events from the Disney park adventure. But it don't matter it works its fun its ENTERTAINING.Roll out the barrel of rum roll out the next Pirates of the Caribbean film number 3.They have filmed 2 & 3 back to back and looked like they had just as much fun making the 2 & 3 as they did making the first film and more important we enjoy it also.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

We bought tickets at 10am for a 9:20pm show and we still had to stand in line for an hour, but it was worth it. So much happened that I wouldn't even know how to summarize it. Let's just say that every character gets 100 times cooler. I would put the Pirates of the Caribbean series above the Matrix and right on par with Star Wars. PoC2:DMC even has a few 6th sense like moments where you don't believe what's happening until the end.If you liked anything at all about the first PoC, you'll love this one. If you haven't seen the series, you'll love it. It's like the Mask of Zorro on steroids meets Lethal Weapon meets Star Wars topped off with the 6th sense...and I wouldn't be exaggerating.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie really has got it all, from action (lots of it) to comedy (again lots of it) to romance and thrills.I've seen a few really good movies over the last months but this one beats pretty much all of them hands down. The characters are more developed, Knightley's more of a kick-ass; Bloom is so manly and tough but still very lovable and well Depp as the great Capt. Jack Sparrow well he's...Capt. Jack Sparrow (on it's own a reason to see the movie). I don't know what else to say except that this movie is really really good and you definitely get your money's worth when you go to see it. Also see it on big screen, the special effects are truly mind blowing! And by the way, the ending will leave you wanting more, no spoilers but really very nicely done. To sum up, see this movie, see it on big screen, this movie rocks!!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The actors and actress did wonderfully. I will say on the minus side of things that I did feel like it was drug out a little but thats is OK. And its OK about Jack dying in the end because you know he will be back, and when he does come back it will be awesome grand entrance! My friend was really mad about the ending and I was a little upset about it but I think I would be even more upset if they did not make another one.

Johnny Depp superseded himself in this sequel. I found that the role of William Turner (played by Bloom) was not his finest. Kiera Knightly outdid herself in this movie, by far better than her last role in Curse of the Black Pearl. I enjoyed the great action scenes and hilarity, but i was not particularly fond of Davy Jones' accent. I did not imagine him to have an Irish accent but i thought his role was well played.

It's hard to decide what was messier - the dialogue (which gets only marginally better throughout the film) or the action sequences, which only had a handful of 'Cool' or 'Surprising' moments.Where before, we had witty dialogue punctuated by clichéd but well-choreographed action sequences, we're now left with a few reasonable lines, one or sight gags (of many) that actually worked, and perhaps one or two memorable action sequences.Also missing here is a villain we might be interested in. We were engaged when watching Geoffrey Rush as the powerful, unhappy and driven Barbossa... but poor Bill Nighy has nothing to go on here, so I don't think even a better performance would really have helped.If someone had taken the few good concepts and images from this script and beaten it about a bit more, this might have been less of a snoozer.There's no magic here.My rating: 2/5 stars - vaguely entertaining.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

Orlando Bloom revisits his role as the ever-gallant, quick-thinking, intelligent, (and need I mention --WAY HOT) Will Turner, a young man once again torn between his father's past and his own destiny -- where does piracy begin and can it really be avoided if it is already in your blood? And gorgeous Keira Knightley is back with fiest, finesse, and a fiery kiss (but for whom and to what purpose is it truly given???).And as if those three characters couldn't deliver enough laughs and side-splitting comedy on their own, Pintel and Ragetti (played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, respectively), are back in their roles as the play-well-with-other-pirates pirates, Ragetti intent on keeping his wooden eye intact and trying to live a ""good"" pirate life now that he is a mere mortal again (""It's the Bible -- it doesn't matter if you can read it or not.

Long, boring, and uninteresting. This sequel tried mightedly using all the past comedic, action techniques of past movies. There was the cannibal scene from King Kong (2005), there was Romancing The Stone (1984) action-comedy, there was even the now tiring and worn out Johnny Depp replaying his comic one-liners using a weak script. There was only warmed over character development, a scattered smattering of connections. The movie by attempting to be everything ended up being too thin on most everything. The violence level was raised far beyond a family movie. The comedy was forced and lame. The only new movement was the rather new action scenes for action scene sake without really contributing to the plot. Most of this movie has been seen before in one form or another. And like Star Wars trilogy there is the romantic triangle at play here leaving for the third installment a much darker psychological conflict. Missing from this movie was the light hearted fun (that was seriously attempted) that didn't seem to balance the more darker, sinister forces at work here. Five out of Ten Stars.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

There is a good deal of exposition going on in the movie, so there are some slow parts, although the movie didn't seem long to me. There was enough action and special effects to keep even the fussiest children in the theater still in their sits and riveted to the screen. I saw it with a friend who is not particularly partial to Mr. Depp, and she enjoyed it as well. Sit and wait patiently through the lengthy end credits for a small ""easter egg surprise"". I definitely think you should see this on a big screen as some of the scenes may indeed lose some impact if you wait to see it on DVD. As Shakespeare would say before every one of his performances began ...To enjoy this performance fully you must permit the suspension of disbelief to take over..in other words..it is a fantasy just go with it and enjoy the ride.

This allows character development for ALL of the characters before they finally reunite for the stunning conclusion in the last act.It's a true film triumph. Don't believe the critics that are panning it. It's darkly humorous and filled with very entertaining characters. We are introduced to the darker elements of piracy: betrayal, jealousy, mutiny, and avarice. At the same time, we see heroism, loyalty, courage, and we see that every human comes to a point where they have to make a choice.The final scene's grand surprise had everyone in my theater cheering and applauding -- chances are you will too! See it, and stay past the credits for one final scene!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Lord Beckett soon divulges the real reason for his visit. It is mostly economic. He is looking to expand the powers of the East Indian Trading Company by procuring Captain Jack Sparrow's (the Libertine himself - Johnny Depp) ""broken"" compass. He offers Will Turner a deal to find Jack and offer him a letter of marque (pardon along with a contract for the company) in return for the compass. Off Will goes in search of Jack, meanwhile Jack is in search of a key that opens a chest (yet we know not of the key nor of the chest) with Keira following closely behind. This movie will definitely not sit well with those looking for ""meaning"" or profound messages. What this movie does, it does remarkably well. It entertains thoroughly. As compared to the first movie, Dead Man's Chest never takes itself too seriously, while at the same time distancing itself from the original in terms of content and pacing. I found the first movie a little uneven in terms of the pacing of the story and too much time wasted in the other characters. It also was a little bit ""dark"". Dead's Man Chest has more actions sequences, more comedy, and lots and lots of Jack. This movie greatly succeeds because it flows. Action sequences flow into action, which flow into comedy ,which flow back into action, and so on and so forth. This all leads to the end, of which you cannot believe that the ride is over and yet you are eager to get back on the ride. The combination of pirate lore, action and comedy is in perfect balance. The difference between Empire and Dead Man's Chest is that we know a sequel is coming, while vice versa was not necessarily true. The franchise so far has had some key elements. First and foremost is Johnny Depp. Without his performance and presence, these movies would be lusterless. Jack Sparrow has also evolved from a relatively black & white, two dimensional character into a more fleshed out character in bright, vivid Cinemascope. He is so big, bright and larger than life, that he ""explodes"" onto the screen. Amongst the other performances, key would be Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) who is proving quite capable to playing the often-in-makeup villain (remember Underworld). Orlando Bloom provides another uni-emotional performance (think of Zoolander's one look), while Keria Knightly provides a freer spirit and the new hot cabin boy look. Her character has also developed sword skills, which makes for a more flavorful dish. Mackenzie Crook (the one-eyed Ragetti) and Lee Arenberg (parley Pintel, whom I memorably remember as the sleazy manager with a q-tip problem in the Tales from the Crypt episode) play the comedy relief to a key.The special effects are also key. Industrial Light and Magic has done a superb job in Davy Jones (especially), along with the Kraken and Davy's crew. The special effects isn't all there is. The fight choreography is also key in its uniqueness and comedic aspects. The locations are equally entertaining. In some instances it looks like scenery from Lord of the Rings and at others I am expecting a giant gorilla to jump in and stomp on people. The scenes of civilization (town, savage village and swamp town) look very theatrical. They almost look like they could be part of a new amusement ride at Disney Land. The combination of all the elements makes this movie better and more enjoyable than the original. Here's hoping to a successful third movie, without any Ewoks.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And an impressive one in my opinion. I find Dead Man's Chest - in terms of humor - better than Part 1. I caught myself laughing out loud at some points, which I hardly do when I'm watching a movie. It's just fun to watch, really! Keira Knightley is again wonderful and a tad bit bold, which I like about her character. Fearless, almost. And I have to agree with some other comments: Hottie Orlando Bloom looks kind of stiff in his role. He totally gets away with it, because he's cute. Johnny Depp continues his class act, as expected.And then.. Bill Nighy. That guy is great. I've seen him in numerous films and series: he' capable of a lot. He must be proud of his role as Davy Jones. The only part of Bill Nighy's body we get to see without some CG-work on it, are his eyes. I'm impressed by the special effects and choreography in this movie. When I saw the end titles and all the people who have been working on Davy Jones' face alone, i just thought: KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! It looks great. Big compliment to them! You just have got to go see it. Not because of the great story - because it's rather simple - but for what it is: a feast for the eyes!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I dunno why but I kept getting the feeling that Johnny Depp was almost over acting, and was trying too hard to be like Jack Sparrow from the first movie.

I've seen it twice even though it is really long. I never got bored once, Because it is so long however you may want to reconsider taking a young child to watch it if they are unable to sit still for 2+ hours.There's just so much to love about it. Captain Jack is his usually rum drinking self staggering around and delivering some of his brilliant one liners. Johnny Depp delivers a brilliant performance once again. That man can do no wrong. Absolute genius. Orlando has grown as an actor and Keira is great as the leading lady.The visual effects are great, Davy Jones is amazing to look at and the detail that has been put in to his crewman makes me smile. The action sequences are long but impressive and well choreographed.Glad to see some of the old faces from the first film, Ragetti and Pintel are back as the odd couple. Nice to see them all back to their pirating ways. No loyalty amongst thieves.The ending is brilliant, the twist made me gasp and grin. I wont say that it is better than the original, that stands on it's own, but as the second part to a trilogy it's amazing!The thing is I am now fidgeting in my seat itching for the next film just to get my next dose of high sea swash buckling adventure.See it on a big screen or miss out.""'ello beastie""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Again there is a lot of humor in the movie as there should be in a well told tale of the sea, a real pirates story, with amazing creatures and supernatural things.And the ending leaves every pirate film lover with a real big smile on his face, and just cant wait until # 3 comes, also the casting will include Yun Fat which i will look forward to, and also the return of Rush will be great.the two not so great performances i think is from Orlando bloom and Kira knightley. bloom doesn't seem to be able to really change his role too much, looking at films like kingdom in heaven, and to a smaller extend LOTR, he just seems to have a lot of those parts in this one, his whole attitude and the way the lines come out.Kiera knightley just isn't all that good in it either, but i think she will be a very capable actress in time.The physical stunts however i think that knightley, depp, bloom and davenport are amazing, and give 110% in making of this film.This is simply the action adventure of the year!!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Some classic Sparrow moments there too! Some may think, uh-oh, this might be Overkill, a spin off to get some cash. It's really Really not. This film has the depth of the first, a great plot that makes you think the first film is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.

The characters are as good as always. The ending holds a handful of different surprises... All of which are good. Most might complain about the ending, but I found it to be highly cinematic.Once again, the PG-13 rating is thoroughly taken advantage of and it helps the overall mood of this film. The score is butchered and basically remixed. That's my only complaint.In this film, Jack Sparrow is much more of a pirate and less of a do-gooder friend, it all works. Will Turner is less of a straight hero and more of a gritty swashbuckler. Keira Knightly is hotter than ever, with her painted on fake cleavage. Bill Nighy (Billy Mack in Love Actually) steals the show as Davy Jones with his incredibly amazing make-up/CGI combo. Also, points fr bringing back every single characer from the first...The film is worth admission, alone, for the last half hour. It totally hit this film out of the park. I won't give any spoilers, but it's one heck of a ride. Jack Sparrow will never be looked at the same.The next film takes place in the Caribbean and in Singapore with Chow Yun Fat at an Asian pirate. So... only ONE YEAR left till we see what happens next in... Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's EndThis film's old fashioned feel and homage to sea tales and legends is wonderful. The cast shines. The story is even more entertaining and mind blowing than the first.Best film of the year, along with United 93.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

There are so many weird imaginative stories in the film, but it feels unnatural. At the end you can say nothing really happened. Don't think I am generally negative.

It has an entertaining storyline, lots of subtle and outrageous humor, daring sword fights, awesome special effects, and fun with Orlando, Johnny and Keira. In short, it's a perfect summer movie.Although I was attracted to original movie because of Orlando Bloom, I join those who applaud Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack. I was not familiar with his work until POC but am happy to say that he continues to entertain me with his over-the-top performance. The mannerisms and subtle facial expressions he uses are fun to watch. Kudos also go to the writing team (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert)for giving him such wonderful dialog. Captain Jack has to be the most literate pirate on the high seas.Orlando's performance as the straight-laced Will Turner is terrific. He's handsome and heroic ... and, of course, a pirate at heart.Hans Zimmer has created an excellent musical score for the action, the adventure, and the fun. I've already added it to my music library.I'm definitely looking forward to POC3 in May next year.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not only is Johnny Depp the only man alive to perform the role of Jack Sparrow (Captain! Jack Sparrow), he is the only actor able to give the role the shades of complexity it demands. Everything from the first film, with the expected progress of each character, becomes twisted and utterly unexpected. And with more...a lot more. The nature of each character is Byzantine, as are the turns of plot. It's no longer just the ride at the Magic Kingdom coming to life.The humor is both light and dark--but all of it leaves you laughing and crying aloud. The effects are spectacular, the action a gripping tale every moment. Guaranteed this will make you more excited about installment three than you ever thought possible. As you leave the theater, you immediately discover yourself speculating and debating. For me, I left also with a sense of wonder and a little concern: the wonderful magic of the first movie, the likes of which had never been seen, is still here--but with complex character development and storyline, will that still be true of the third? You find yourself asking, ""what 'is' Jack Sparrow? Fabulous film!

Sadly, it was a tremendous disappointment. I can't believe that Disney was willing to sell out those great characters from the first Pirate for the sake of pounding the audience with tedious, excessive and overblown special effects. The plot, which was actually quite good, was totally over-shadowed by this ridiculous display. A full half-hour of beast tentacles activity could have easily been cut, and would have been a major improvement. Some scenes were so slimy and gross that I wanted a shower the second I got out of the theater.

I love all the little character moments, but besides that there's whole heaps of plot to cram in, too. I had a nagging sense of doubt for a good portion of the film because it has much more story than its progenitor, and maybe slightly less exhilarating hijinks that seem to arise just for the fun of it. Although such necessary subplots threaten to stall it in some spots, things are threaded together skilfully enough in the end to make me suitably forgiving...Depp's accomplished turn is no surprise, given that this was what had me so hyped up to see it, in the first place... I liked the fact that most of the roles of the returned were expanded, which may account for the length, but on the other hand it's at least trying to be an inclusive experience for both the cast and the audience, alike. The decision to promote Keira to 'one of the lads' was on the money, since she's in possession of a distinctly tomboyish natural charm which now no longer need be concealed. I understand why Orlando is most often stuck being the straight man, since he would no doubt look uncomfortable if asked to be anything but the upright exemplar of a human moral compass.I'm still heartily enthusiastic and on board for the next voyage in under a years time. Mild curiosity - even for casual fans - should be enough to have them exit feeling the same way...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

While the film starts off a bit confusing and slow. After a brief 5 min the movie kicks off and the action never ends until the last frame. The humor runs along just as smooth as the action. Not stopping there is the awesome visuals. From spot on CG sequences to amazing shot on locations. In fact, these are the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie. Even better then Lord of the Rings or even Star Wars 3. Lets not forget that the the acting is spot-on. The only thing I can't stand is how the plot seems to have some holes (how the movie opens). Easily this is just overlooked just by the sheer volume of a quality in this film.

Will and Elizabeth's wedding is halted when they are both arrested for aiding Jack Sparrow in his hunt for the Black Pearl. Will is offered a pardon if he can find Jack Sparrow and retrieve his magical compass. He finds Jack running in fear of Davy Jones, whom he owes his soul. Jack and Will are joined by Elizabeth, who has escaped capture, to find the heart of Davy Jones and destroy it. Dead Man's Chest is far more action packed than the original film, but it is a darker, more serious film.Everything that was good about the first movie is good in this film. Once again, Johnny Depp is hysterical as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom does very well returning as Will Turner. The dialogue is just as witty and cool as before. Some parents might not like that this film is darker than the first. Some scenes might even be considered frightening. The character of Davy Jones and his crew aboard the Flying Dutchman are amazing. The CGI in this movie is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen in a movie recently. One of the only problems I had with the movie was the character of Elizabeth Swann. She has changed from the first film. Keira Knightley's performance was just as good, but her character is strongly downplayed. She doesn't have a lot to do with the movie. I personally enjoyed this movie just as much as the first film, but some people may not like the fact that this movie ends in a complete cliffhanger, due to the fact that this was filmed at the same time as the third film. Nothing is resolved at the end, because it's all going to end in the third film.The acting is just as good as the first time around. As for new characters, Bill Nighy is amazing as Davy Jones, even though his face is completely covered by CGI effects. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Will Turner's ghostly father, Bootstrap Bill.Overall, this is an awesome sequel, and the third film promises to be even more amazing.8/10","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

First, let me start with the positives: the special effects were great and Johnny Depp portrayed (once again) a clever Jack Sparrow. That's about all. The story was what really disappointed me. At 2 and 1/2 hours, I was checking my watch and counting down the seconds until it was over. The plot was full of useless plot devices and pointless, mindless scenes which only served to make the movie longer. It seems that other reviews on this site ""have many unanswered questions"" about the movie. The reason a lot of questions go unanswered is because the movie never takes a clear stance on any direction it wants to go in and chooses to leave the audience (myself included) slightly confused. The plot seems to go in circles and nothing is ever really resolved or understood. I know many would say that I should just wait for the next sequel to answer my questions, but shouldn't a movie at least be able to stand on its own without one? Perhaps sequels 2 and 3 should have been made into one movie...oh wait that would have just made it more unbearably long and pointless. In the end, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of Barbossa seems to be only redeeming factor and hope for another movie that will be as good as the first. Not Recommended.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

I could write this like a nit-picky reviewer, who pays constant attention to every detail, but I'm just your average person, so I'll look at it that way.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has all the basic elements that makes up a good adventure movie: Fun moments, action-filled moments, a few love moments, and just plain jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The gist of the film is as follows: Jack Sparrow is reminded of the fact he owes a debt to Davey Jones (or Davy Jones, I prefer the former), his soul. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Swann and William Turner are set to be married, but their plans are (of course) wrecked, by Lord Cutler Beckett, from the East India Trading Company. The visual effects in this movie are the some of the best I've seen, ever. One example is Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy), who's appearance is achieved by CGI alone, not with prosthetics as it would (very much) seem. And the soundtrack was done very well (actually, very well is an understatement) by Hans Zimmer, with my favorite bit being Davey Jones' theme.Overall, Dead Man's Chest is a great film, surpassing the first movie, and is one of the few good sequels. If you haven't already, I suggest you see it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Elizabeth had definitely a bigger part and Stelan Skarsgard was just incredible. I didn't recognize Bill Nighy but his performance was flawless as always.

This was not only a great sequel, but I would dare say almost a great stand-alone movie.I will go ahead and concede some of the negative aspects first: 1) The originality of the first film is gone. That is always a given with the sequel. You can never out do such a great experience as a perfect part 1.2) The villain, while great at being a menace, was not fun or funny the way Geoffrey Rush was in the original.3) Depp himself seemed less committed to the part.4) And yes, there is that issue with the open ending.But these things aside, this sequel was still loads of fun! One thing the filmmakers did not do was try to stuff this movie with humor, as often happens in sequels. Instead, if anything, this one is a little darker. The plot can be hard to follow for a long while. Essentially, Jack apparently has sold his soul to one Davy Jones, and Mr. Jones has come to collect. This sets Jack off on an attempt to find the one thing with which he can undo his bargain with the villain. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth have been jailed for their previous efforts in freeing Jack, and Will is offered one chance to save themselves - find Jack and bring him in. Along the way, all our favorite surviving characters from the original find their way back into the plot, and the usual twists and turns ensue.For about 30 or 40 minutes I was waiting for the movie to really take me back to where the first one did. Then, somewhere near the end, I realized that I had really been enjoying myself immensely the entire time! It's that kind of movie! Just a lot of fun and excitement - nothing too deep for a summer film (unlike the over-heavy SUPERMAN RETURNS).As for the ending - well, hopefully you know by now that this is really just a first half of what is still to come next year. I was wondering how the ending would feel - if fragmented like BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 or MATRIX 2, or more of a preamble to the conclusion such as EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and TWO TOWERS. I'm pleased to report that, with one of the best final reveals in a long time, the ending and the film as a whole will have you salivating for next years release! Not quite a cliff-hanger (which would be annoying) but more of a, ""Ok, we've covered all that ground, now take a breath and prepare for what comes next!"" Stop reading this and go see it! I myself plan to see it at least one more time! Congrats to the cast and crew for catching the magic again!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The redeeming feature, almost, was Naomie Harris in two pivotal scenes. She injected her character with the sort of energy Depp did his in the first.

As in the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" Jack Sparrow makes a water-logged entrance. From that moment on, you're hooked. Johnny Depp's and other cast members' performances are very much entertaining. In a era where many movies are derivative, the film has several refreshing creative scenes and action sequences. The movie is enjoyable and takes the time to tell the story, which includes several subplots and twists and turns. What is great about the movie's script is that is not all ""about Jack."" The movie is ""big enough"" to encompass and develop story lines for other characters -- and that in itself is refreshing.If you are a true movie fan, this movie is highly recommended. In the end, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may be among the best palatable pirate genre films in Hollywood's making.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I believe the relation a movie going friend of mine, who is a harsh critic and felt significantly less enthused about this movie than myself, compared Depp to Marlon Brando in that Depp is able to do to make a legend out of a single character.

If you liked the first one, you will be disappointed in this, as I was. Why do they keep making making 2hr movies that last nearly 3 hours, this basically shows that no matter how much money you spend on making a movie, you must get the storyline right. The acting was great, I usually like every movie that Jonny Depp is in, but they were having to act very well to improve what was basically a boring screen play.

Everything seemed to be thought out by the directors, especially the fight sequences. However, the plot was a bit shaky and confusing, much like the first movie. This one was much darker and more frightening than the first. It's definitely not a movie for young children. As for the actors, Depp was great as the classic ""who's side is he on?""

Definitely NOT a disappointing sequel as it sometimes might happen. It's extremely refreshing to meet the old characters again and see the new ones as well. Davy Jones & co looks really creepy and unpleasant. The filmmakers have scored right on making the bad ones really frightening. Johnny Depp gives once more an incredible performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Have you ever seen a bad movie when Johnny Depp is around? All the jokes are once more extremely funny. Keira Knightley is once and again lovely as always. And she also gets some action! What I personally really liked is that this time they gave Jack Davenport a bigger role than on the first movie. Yes, Norrington is back, but this time he's character is so much more than on the first movie. I totally loved his character now. And Orlando Bloom, who honestly isn't the best actor around, this time seems to have developed a bit. He's started to give more nuance to his performances. I already noticed it in Elizabethtown. That deserves a bit of credit also. If you loved the first movie, then you don't want to miss that one! And you might also want to see something that's after the end credits. I can't wait to see the third one, because it's going to be a great final! Excellent movie in a great visual package! 10/10","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sparrow has to find a way to save himself from becoming one of them by wrecking William and Elizabeth's wedding plans and forcing them to join Jack on another adventure. This is an exciting sequel that have made fans across the world happy. I enjoyed the film pretty well and I thought all the actors especially Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow to be the best just like in the first one. The only actor I thought was kind of boring would be Orlando Bloom and his overacting. Although, I thought the film was entertaining and funny, I don't think its close to being better than the first one. It felt way too long on some parts and I thought some scenes shouldn't of been included in the film. Overall, I thought Verbinski's sequel was good and had some pretty funny parts. But if your saying this is better than ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" I think your pretty wrong on that answer.

Depp brought something fresh and original to the character of Jack Sparrow. This film, clocking in at just under 3 hours in length is probably one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. Gone was the whimsical charm of the first film. Orlando Bloom is quickly proving how limited his acting ability is, and Keira Knightley just doesn't do it for me anymore. The special effects were very good (props to ILM as always on that) but it felt like the Star Wars franchise had overtaken the proceedings with Davey Jones and his crew being a load of over CGI'ed mutant forms of Jar Jar Binks. I recall seeing the initial preview for this film and thinking ""What's the deal with the hammerhead looking thing?"" and worrying that the film would be a mess of CGI monsters and the like. I was right. The plot was literally all over the place, the characters weren't nearly as likable as in the previous film, and the running time was painfully long. Even my two nephews who I took to see the film thought it was only ""OK"".... I seriously think I will not see the third one in the series, and my DVD rack will stay with only the one Pirates movie in the collection.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Not as entertaining or fun as the first but more than enough other things present to compensate for this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1419636/?ref_=tt_urv","Boba_Fett1138","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1416505/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2006","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was an unexpected huge hit and success. It of course would be impossible for a sequel to top this success, mainly because of the reason that every originality and surprise is gone. This is also definitely the case with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"". We already know the characters, we already know the style of humor in and we already know that it has supernatural elements in it. It makes ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" a less refreshing and surprising movie but luckily the movie is well made and has more than enough stuff in it to still make this movie a thrilling and entertaining one to watch.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not a better movie than ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" for several reasons. As mentioned before, the freshness of the movie is gone with as a main result that the characters don't impress or entertaining as much as in the first movie was the case. Not even Jack Sparrow does. Another thing is that they wanted too much, as often in sequels is the case. The story is unnecessary complex, with unnecessary many characters in it. It also causes the movie to be unnecessary long (2 and a half hours!). But no of course the movie is no bore. It's a real roller-coaster ride of a movie, even though it takes some time at the start to find the right pace. The new main villain gets perhaps introduced a bit too late in the movie (about half way through I think) but once he gets introduced the action and fun really starts. The movie has countless spectacular and well executed moments in it, especially with the immensely large octopus named Kraken. Especially the last couple of minutes 'are heavy' with good and fast non-stop action.This time the main villain of the movie is Davy Jones (half man, half octopus) and his 'The Flying Dutchman' crew. So rather than having an army of undead pirates, we now have an army of undead fish. Sounds less scary but the way the fishy crew looks is highly convincing and intense. Unfortunately Davy Jones (played by the always great Bill Nighy) is no captain Barbossa and I really missed him as the villain in this one.The rest of the characters are mainly the same. Jack Sparrow is still as crazy as he is entertaining, thanks to Johnny Depp of course. It was also great to see how Keira Knightley's acting had matured. It was obvious that she is a more experienced actress now, when compared to the first movie. Her acting is more adult-like and she impressed and surprised me more as in the first movie. Orlando Bloom gets less interesting to do in this movie but he still is good and convincing enough as the heroic Will Turner, although he still is a bit boring as always. He just isn't as charismatic as Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks who did similar movies as he did but only about a century ago.Best thing about the movie are its visuals. Not only the locations and make-up are great but also especially the CGI (Oscar win guaranteed I predict). It makes the movie a feast for the eyes that is just as entertaining as thrilling to watch.So its not as entertaining or fun as the first, mainly because everything is not as fresh and surprising anymore but the action, CGI and better acting still make this movie a thrilling and entertaining roller-coaster ride that is just as good to watch as the first movie, because of this very reason. Also the cliffhanger made me excited for part 3; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"". I'm not going to spoil anything since I don't want to spoil the surprise for you.Definitely a movie worth seeing that of course is best and most thrilling to be viewed while its still in cinemas.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action was great, the cast was great, and the creation of a new spin on old sea characters was the best.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It is action-packed with solid dialogue and impeccable characters. The plot is simple, yet the actors, writers. producer etc have taken the story beyond words. There is plenty to keep you from dozing off, although Miss. Knightly sheds little clothing. It is quite obvious that Depp has spent considerable time (and propping up the bar) with Keith Richards, and adds, no enhances, Depp's laid back persona. The effects, costumes, CGI and the other stuff is well constructed, and emanates in every sequence.Unlike 99% of those in the auditorium, I stayed through the credits (I do anyway) and found that a new king had been appointed. A great touch for those who wondered what became of the dog, and whether he/she was lunch for the natives.A well deserved 9/10, a classic in the making, a film that can been viewed over and over again, and each time notice something new.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The ""He"" I am referring to is a spoiler but if you've seen the film you know what I mean. The film was a mismatched of half written screenplays that seemed to be patch together by 5 year-old's. Don't get me wrong this isn't brain surgery by no means but give me a plot that I can follow. The filmmakers tried to get everyone from the previous film--screen time and a subplot. I gave up on the last hour trying to figure out who was the good guys and bad guys. Yes the special effects was great but that does not make a good movie. This should have been a simple story...the good guys trying get something from the bad guys or vice versa. I think I've had enough of these Pirates I'll pass on the third film and reread Treasure Island.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

The plot was weak and difficult to follow through much of the film, the dialog was equally difficult to follow in several scenes, and the cinematography was awful.

The action is at times 'silly', even though I understand this is not a film to be taken seriously.The special effects are excellent, especially the costume/CGI of the crew of the Flying Dutchman. Some original thought has gone in to some of the action scenes so you will never be bored.Depp is of course brilliant. Bloom is easily forgettable and Knightley doesn't get to do all that much. Bill Nighy is unrecognisable under the octopus costume however you can't mistake his voice or mannerisms.Pirates is a bit too long, some scenes seem to drag on but the ending sets it up nicely for the third installment.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer did a fantastic job getting this story thought all the way out. Trying to get a step ahead of this film is basically impossible. Keira Knightley turned in a great performance (and several great kissing scenes). Johnny Depp became one of the greatest pirate characters ever, and lightened up on the swaying. And of course, Orlando Bloom looks great wet (yes, he acted and fenced brilliantly too).Hans Zimmer must get an Oscar for his truly epic score - it got better than the first, if possible. The special effects guys also deserve tons of credit for their spectacular work on all the creatures and and battles. 'Pirates 2' deserves all the money it's making, and if 'Pirates 3' takes more than a year, I for one will be protesting.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I am a big ass when it comes to movies, rating them and such. I am a film snob and a jerk. I look at movies as art and it takes a lot for me to say a movie is good. This had a few parts that I thought were stupid. The whole thing was awesome though. It was so intense and just put me through a great catharsis, which is what movies are all about. I wouldn't say this movie is best picture material or anything, as far as the movies I've seen this year, all of them. The best one is Brick, but this movie was incredibly fun to watch and enjoy. Catch it in theatres, it will not be nearly as much fun watching on DVD. It isn't really related to the first one; in fact, this and the following one are more of their own movie rather than a continuation of the first. The first was complete in itself; this is just a new story in the adventures of a group of swashbucklers!!!!!!!!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I think Johnny Depp was actually fantastic in both. I don't find Bloom's acting interesting, he is even a bit wooden. At any rate, this movie was disappointing in most every aspect. The high points, which there were but few, came too infrequently. Whereas the first movie pulled you in and kept you in rapt attention, I found myself drifting, constantly checking my watch. I suppose my two biggest gripes with this movie is that it was too long. The script and material could not handle 2+ hours of movie. It seemed to plod on endlessly. The second problem is they weren't up front about the fact that this movie is simply a setup for the 3rd movie. If I have to sit through that long a movie and not get a resolution at the end - I want to know beforehand. What is worse, this did not make me wish to see the third one, at all. In fact, I may want to see the third one less now. Jack Sparrow is still a fantastic character, but I fear the Pirates are heading down the same path as the Matrix...expectations need to be readjusted. This will not be a classic Trilogy.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

You actually have to take some time to look at the scenes to really get a feel for it all. The sets are just one part that make it worth seeing.The plot was also amazing. It has that comedic twist that the first one had as well, but even better. But it has some drama, and some other kinds of twists that no one would expect. Over all, the plot was well-written and acted out perfectly.The characters are just as they were in the first, except a few. There are, naturally, some new ones, that have a personality all their own. They play their parts with as much fervor as they can. They gave the movie a personality all its own, and then some.Now, add some of the most heart-racing scenes, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and a hint of romance, and you have Pirates of the Caribbean 2.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I saw the first movie in theaters for free, thought it was pretty good, but far from a great movie. I honestly couldn't believe all the hype.Since I work for a cinema, I received a free early screening for ""Dead Man's Chest"". It is amazing. The acting is good, the computer effects are brilliant and eye-popping, the writing is entertaining and fun, Hans Zimmers score is better than ever, you have your action sequences that are superb, and perhaps most importantly, the stories all tie together. That's right. You have to watch the first to truly get all of the second. And you will need the combined knowledge of the first two to see third.That is how you can separate the good trilogies from the bad. Good trilogies (LOTR, Back To The Future) seem like one big ongoing story. And now ""Pirates"" will join them.I was really surprised by this gem. Good job Verbinski and Bruckheimer.

It sets in motion perils and obstacles for our heroes. It further embellishes upon the characters that were introduced in the first film. It amps up the action and brings in new characters with flair. All of this equals to a really good follow-up to one of the biggest surprise hits of 2003.Jack is back and he has never been better. Depp brings him full on and you love every minute of it. Knightly and Bloom are given much more dramatic meat this time and they feast aplenty. Both are in fine form. Majority of the main supporting cast from the first film are here and they again deliver. There are some new baddies introduced, the best of those being Davy Jones. Through the great character work of Bill Nighy and the fantastic craftsmanship of the ILM folks, Davy Jones is a wonder to watch.If there is anything that could be complained about is that there is so much more of everything, it leaves you feeling a bit like Jack after a night with his beloved Rum.

Painfully lacking in key elements, such as visible acting skills and a strong plot, Dead Man's Chest is a very ordinary follow-up to a great movie. Certainly audiences flocking to see the comical swagger of Johnny Depp and the handsome face of Orlando Bloom won't leave disappointed, despite Orlando's wooden acting. However I am in doubt that a lot of movie goers will be enthralled by the slapstick, somewhat juvenile attempts at humor the film produces. The action in this movie is thoroughly overused, and becomes quite boring towards the end. Indeed, I was sitting in my chair in the theater growing increasingly tedious at the endless roaring action scenes, and honestly couldn't wait to see the back of this movie.If you completely base a movie on how good the CGI is, then this movie is for you. If maybe, you need a plot and some character building, then perhaps consider spending your money elsewhere","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I followed the status very closely, and did what I almost never do, I didn't watch any of the clips from the movie. Why? Because I wanted the entire movie to be a new surprise to me, which it was.I went to the midnight showing of it last night, and was almost worried about it being 2 and a half hours long, but I discovered that I really didn't care. You get so wrapped up in the action of the movie that you almost become a part of it. The sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth was so great in this one that you just wanted to cry a little (I won't say anything further on that, it might be considered a spoiler). The script was well done and the actors all did a fine job (including Orlando). When Jack came on screen for the first time the theater erupted in cheers.I have done something I have never done in a movie theater before, and that is nearly stand up and scream at the screen. I was yelling a the screen during some parts, and my heart was racing during many of the intense battle sequences. This movie had an amazing storyline that sucks you into it and won't let you go because there is constantly something happening. It was a good pace and easy to follow,(I don't know what the critics were on about) of course there is some thought needed to understand the move (like all good ones; you do need to think), and it leaves you on edge for the third movie.But like all movies it does have some flaws but that's okay, you just can't think to yourself ""well that could never happen"", well neither could Barbossa and his crew being cursed and never being able to die like in the first Pirates. But it was a great movie overall and I want to see it again and again!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Don't watch this film to see Depp act, since he doesn't get much time to do any acting.THE BADCamera work is to fast, making items on screen blurry and difficult to follow.

Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is also one of the best things about this movie, the whole cast in this movie is more sour and without some of the limitations that they had in the first movie, Will is a great example of that, great character in this movie, the actor's design with the character was great, his way, everything combined, I liked this character a lot; and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann is the biggest show of how limited the cast was in the first movie, great character that even though she's not the super character she's much better than in the first movie, the character has evolved a lot since the first movie and she's showing who is not just a princess but can be a high-level pirate was great! I really liked that character trait even though I'm not such a fan of hers.The movie has so many good moments, in the beginning with them on the island, they are looking for the trunk, the final scene of the ship which is fantastic, and the last scene which is so funny, I think the only problem with the movie itself is the villain, I didn't like the villain at all, he's a very stupid villain without motivation, he's not threatening, just that fact makes me lower the grade but it's still an amazing movie, super fun, very good fight scenes, great adventures, and it's really worth it.

One of my biggest complaints in movies, and a lot of movies that are parts of a series (this being a 2-parter), is that they don't take their time to develop conflict and resolution. It's all just given to you like BAM and there you have it, it's a movie. This one took its time, gave all the characters meaning, every single one. That's a real rarity in movies, but because it didn't need to focus so much on its core cast, the writing allowed the movie to expand its cast. Suddenly the crew is doing more, is more interesting. Your villain is interesting. And the conflicts are all over the place to be resolved in the 3rd movie. I think the big complaint is just that it was long with a bunch of exposition to a bigger story, rather than just being itself. I think the critics and critical fans have to step back and say, ""Review this movie as if it were the first half"". You all sat through Return of the King, this was easy. But when the third movie comes out, then watch the second one and decide if it really was so bad or so hard to watch. All it did for me was go, ""Oh, I wanna see the next one!""","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I can't remember a great deal about the original since it was around four years ago when I saw it, but at this moment in time, I think Dead Man's Chest is an overall better film! There's not really much of a plot to speak of, but this isn't important as director Gore Verbinski packs the film with amusing stunt sequences and sword fights, which more than makes up for the lack of plot. This film once again follows the fortunes of the three main characters from the original: Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow. They find themselves on the trail of a treasure chest containing the heart of monstrous sea pirate Davey Jones. Jack wants it so he doesn't have to join Jones' crew (which is made up of a motley assortment of fish men), Will Turner wants it to free his father from Jones and then there's The East India Trading Company, who want it too.There's some really great stunts in this movie, and mostly they're great because they're completely unexpected in the way they're put together - examples include a sequence that sees Captain Jack's crew traversing up the side of a mountain while contained in a wooden ball, while another features a sword fight on top and inside a giant wheel. The locations are great too, as the film capitalises on the 'Caribbean' part of the title and dishes up the action on numerous mysterious Caribbean islands. The film seems keen to add a good deal of horror into the mix too, which is always welcome. Davey Jones' crew is truly nightmarish, while the character of Tia Dalma (one of the film's biggest highlights!) hints at black magic and voodoo. Then there's the mythical sea monster, the Kraken, which provides a number of major highlights as it drags men and ships to the depths. All the major players from the first film return and do well, while new inclusions such as Bill Nighy and Naomie Harris add to the fun. Overall, this might not be a brilliant masterpiece - but it's a hell of a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it, so it gets a big thumbs up from me!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They were amazing. Davey Jones's tentacles especially. Some of the pirates on Davey Jones's ship looked a tad 'cartoony' and out of place, but other than that, the graphics really stood out.Getting on to the soundtrack, something which the first film was well known for.

That's why I think that it is a masterpiece. Its low rating is not understandable for me. Critics don't like blockbusters, because probably they cannot see art in those movies and there is one more reason, because they think that those movies are rather 'products', in other words commercial. Other audiences found this sequel very disappointing in comparison with the first film. The problem here is Dead Man's Chest is not such a movie, so is it a bad hype? I guess so. It is entertainment, everyone knows this. and yes, the movie is not an art house film may be, but it does not mean that there is no art in it. Gore Verbinski is a very good director, even if I did not like all the works he made. As said, according to many people, Dead Man's Chest is far inferior in comparison with Curse of the Black Pearl. This is very funny, because I think just the opposite. Black Pearl was overrated. I slightly enjoyed it, but in my opinion, Dead Man's Chest surpassed the first one, because it improved it. As mentioned, direction is very outstanding, coasts, sea, islands, a sunny entertaining experience. One of the best and most enjoyable parts is the part that we see Jack Sparrow as the chief of the tribe! It is a bit meaningless, but welcome. Visuals, the set design are great. As for Johnny Depp, he makes this sequence more colorful. He looks very interesting. I watched the escape attempt part tons of time, it deserves entertainment anthology in cinema. I love everything in this part with some paprika and exotic fruits. Musics are coherent with the content which does not happen often, it seems audience driven may be, but I just did not care about it. The music winds us up. The only problem is that the dog humor is dated and naive. The ghost sailors in the first movie were fun (but with a little cheesy visual effects. This time, we see various very interesting sea creatures with outstanding CGI. Personally, I enjoyed much more. Davy Jones. I liked that character and also yes he looks disgusting, but in a good way. Some of my friends could not look at him when I showed them a picture of him, but he is not that disgusting. I was very impressed by the music box scene, it was brilliant. If there had been no art in the movie and if Verbinski had been a bad director, we would not watched such a scene, believe me. I have not seen a better sea battle so far than the ones in this movie. I can't describe it more, it is such great. It does not finish. The sword fight in the white sand island is my all time favorite sword fight. I watched it hundreds of time. This part is my favorite in the movie I guess. Great fun. Musics, the flamboyant forest. I just love it. Like the sea battles, this fight is very long also. There is one more big sea battle with Kraken. The best Kraken is here. It is so exciting and bothering at the same time. Again, there is a moment, moire by sun, it seriously impressed me thanks to Verbinski, brilliant. Ohh, I forgot to talk about Johnny Depp himself. His performance is outstanding, but also Jack Sparrow in this movie is much more colorful, eccentric, funny and interesting than Jack Sparrow in the first movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As soon as I heard they were making it, I quickly assumed the worst would come of it. Then recently when I started seeing all the commercials and previews I thought ""well... it actually doesn't look half bad"". What an understatement! This is probably going to go down as what I consider one of the best sequels ever (I'll wait until the third installment before I make the call). In fact, on the way home from seeing it, I got in a chat with my friend about it possibly being the best trilogy ever, beating even Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I love both of those, but PotC just seems to have that rewatchability that I usually require.The same friend said before we got there that he heard it was going to be a much more serious movie, to which I replied ""we'll see"". Thankfully, he was fairly wrong as they never failed to keep the laughs coming. They can take the most serious of situations like, oh I don't know.... a man about to become barbecue, and turn it into a hilarious bit of comedy.In general, I think Dead Man's Chest is a much grander movie. Everything seems bigger and badder (as in Michael Jackson's ""Bad"", not bad like the Buffalo Bills' Super Bowl record) and wilder and funnier. The visual effects were pretty much mind-boggling. The costume/character design was amazing to the point of I would seriously be infuriated if they don't win every award for it. Everything is so superb as far as cinematography goes.A smaller detail, if you needed convincing, this movie will no doubt prove to you that Keira Knightley is one of the sexiest people alive.The rest you can probably assume. The plot was great and somehow worked out well, The acting was nothing horrible, etc etc etc.You might be asking how I have all these great things to say about the movie, and still give it an 8. Two reasons. One, I reserve 10's for what I think are the absolute best movies (by my standards, which aren't normal), so this is starting at a 9. Two, it took a little while to get going. The first 30 or 40 minutes just had some seemingly desperate attempts to connect random things to things that happened in the first film.If you only had time to read one sentence of this review, I hope it will be the next one.

This years choice was one I'm sure, hundreds of fans decided upon to part with a small fund to get the experience of the Pirates story that has already exceeded expectations in a legendary manor with the first instalment. The film was magnificent! It catered for ever possible need. It consisted of side-splitting comedy to mild horror, with the promise of a consistent storyline that remained true to the first film and the consistency of the first film. Although at some stages the film's plat became hidden somewhat, you were promised particularly with the last hours darkening sped up pace, a darkening storyline with a sudden and VERY unexpected climax at the end. The characters were as stunning as ever of course. Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp held your attention with his outstanding acting skills, and pleasing manor and looks (as I know from myself and friends that he was particularly sweet on their eyes). While of course being as funny as ever before if not better. He is the primary foundation of the film I conclude holding it spectacularily together. Of course there is still Elizabeth and Will. Will still a very good performance by Orlando Bloom if not tremendously outshined by Johnny Depp and the gorgeous and skillful Elizabeth Swann played by Keira Knightly. The film not only had great acting but it had fantastic stunts. What a star studded fearless stunt team, and the commitment made by the actors too was astounding. I find it exceptionally important that I mention the new characters-(Bootstrap) Bill Turner played by an actor with such a commanding presence and voice, and of course the Legendary Davy Jones of the Seven Seas, played to perfection with an astounding power on screen. I can't wait for the next film, particularly because of the new approach to the characters in this sequel. Every character was seen to show their own agendas very subtly and beneath the normal exteriors of the characters the actors managed to portray the complexity of feelings and conflicts going on beneath the surface of not one, but all the characters. I particularly loved the scenes with Elizabeth and Jack, because of the true conflict with in Jack to either stick to his double-crossing, past caring ways or succumb to the nagging good honest side within him; and the conflict Elizabeth begins to strongly feel, as fate (inspired by cracks in the her relationship with Will increasingly forming)begins to push her and Jack together in a way that I for one could never have expected. After all she had loved pirates as a child, maybe, just maybe her heart lies in the future, not in a ruled marriage with kind sweet Will, but a swashbuckling adventure with a pirate with an underlying honesty and love of freedom...(I wonder who that could be..think really hard)...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

For me, he didn't, in fact he was spot on for all his scenes, which happened to be very pacey, moving onto the next chapter after chapter, very quickly.Dead Man's Chest is very Empire Strikes Back in its motive, effect on the viewer and trilogy.The photography is fantastic, sometimes I felt they laid it on a little too much with the CGI but they got some interesting views and left scenes with great settings.Liked how the story tied all the old crew -- bad guys and good guys --working together, to beat the Davey Jones gang. I also though it was a nice tip, to involve Elisabeth Swann into more of the action, this film basically made her a kick ass tom-boy-come-heroine, so to speak.Nearly everyone from the first film, is in this one. It is quite cool in that respect, the minor parts were given bigger chances to shine, even the dog with the keys.However, no one else really stands up to Jack Sparrow's effortlessly great persona and individuality.I'm diggin'.~Paul Browne.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is even harder to make a sequel to the ones that actually do, and still make it a great movie. Sequel are much harder because you working with something that isn't original, and still trying to capture what made the first one so great. Well POTC 2 delivers what we have been hoping for. It is the first time in a long time where a sequel has felt original to me, like it was its own movie without the first. Granted, it is a direct continuation, but still feels new. Johnny Depp reprises his Jack Sparrow role with as much fun as he did the first time around and once again steals the show. The action scenes are excellent, although I do feel they used the beast a little too much toward the end. The other players all have their moments and it all comes together quite nicely. The effects this time around, mainly of Davy Jones and his crew, are quite good. I really don't want to give too much away toward plot and what not so Ill close it like this. The sequel is not quite as good as the original, but still excellent. The running time is very long, but it goes by fairly well, and the returning members from the original really make this worth seeing. Its true what you've heard, this does end on a cliffhanger, but a great one that is worth cheering for, and definitely makes you want more.

Verbinski indulges in ultra long fight scenes (perhaps to make up for the wayward plot line). There are several cute and witty moments within the fights and tiny Keira gets her wealth of fighting. One fun moment comes as she and 2 of Sparrow's men run from and fight a whole host of beastly evil things while tossing only 2 swords between the 3 of them. the last few fights are repetitive, though, and would have been well served with a more daring editor. as far as sequels go, this film successfully brings back most of the entertaining characters from the original with surprisingly ease. Naomie Harris, Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg among others add a spirited kick to the film as well. like the dead men of the original, the special effects are superb. the evil creature men are perhaps a bit too graphic for the youngest.let's hope the third doesn't finally run poor ol' jack into the ground.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was completely disappointed, and upset that I spent $10 to stay up till 2:30 in the morning terribly bored, when I could've stayed home for free and be equally as enthralled while watching the Home Shopping channel.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is prime example of the terrible Hollywood sequels that are oh too common. It's more than obvious how the movie creators are trying too hard to appeal to the crowd, what with cheap one-liners from the first movie (the whole ""where's the rum?"" bit, etc), and more sorry attempts at comedy than sustenance. I mean, where's the plot? Instead of working on a story, they decided to give us warped farces of our old favourite characters. Elizabeth Swann is having stupid temper tantrums and is suddenly an expert fencer, Orlando Bloom's character is a melodramatic wuss trying to act all ""I'm a romantic hero,"" and Jack Sparrow is babbling on, making no sense, and doesn't stop talking about the stupid rum.From what I could tell, the creators clearly do not understand that special effects do NOT make the movie. It seems like they used the past 3 years exerting themselves to make grand special effects sequences, instead of focusing on a meaningful dialog, as well as general storyline. The movie bored me. And instead of sitting there thinking about the movie and the plot and what's coming next, I was sitting there thinking about how weird and bizarre and unrealistic the characters seemed. At least the first movie with the idea of that curse and all had previously mentioned sustenance in it. It gave the characters reason for going after something. Will Turner/Elizabeth Swann's love for one another is not enough to hold my interest.All in all, this movie was a terrible disappointment, and was probably the worst movie I've seen in theatres since ""The Village.""","35 out of 87 found this helpful.

What can one really $ay about that? Well, blame $tar War$ and Lord of the Ring$, after all, Disney didn't invent the franchise. That being said, I was expecting the worst (and certainly heard it from all the critics) before seeing this film. Maybe that is why I enjoyed the film so very much, and found that the time flew by (unlike my recent experience watching another ""super"" film of similar length, during which I kept feeling that my seat was uncomfortable, and kept looking at my watch). Pirates was, after all, never intended to be anything more than a tongue-in-cheek joy-ride based on, well, a tongue-in-cheek joy-ride. And it does move right along. Without giving away too much, I will say that I found the opening scene unexpectedly artsy and engaging, likewise the immediate introduction of major plot elements; and the introduction of new characters refreshing and intriguing. Androgynous Depp delivers again as the mincing and nasty Captain Jack Sparrow, and (IMHO) the wimpy and boyish Bloom nonetheless comes across as likable once again in the role of young Will Turner. Keira Knightley is eminently watchable, perhaps even reading the telephone directory aloud, but here her character, Elizabeth Swann, is spiced up a bit (e.g., taught how to sword-fight, an absurd idea, but let's not even go there). It's always a pleasure to see Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, say no more), and likewise Bill Nighy, who by now has ample on-screen experience playing the undead (Shaun of the Living Dead) and bad guys (The Constant Gardener), but whose real gift lies in ironic timing and subtle (or not-so-subtle) humor (Love Actually). Pirates newcomer Naomie Harris is a treat as the scary but sexy voo-doo queen Tia Dalma.As in the first installment of Pirates, the costumes and sets are lavish and appealing; the ships are believable enough (hey, this isn't Master and Commander), and the action is a-plenty. Also as in the first film, some of the fights go on much too long, and there is more BIG action than necessary, but both are forgivable within the genre (which is, in case you forgot, theme park ride). Nighy's Davy Jones is fantastic, due in no small part to the Disney CG guys. A side note for the literate among us: as in the first Pirates film, much is borrowed from Tim Powers' On Stranger Tides, a fact that no one will dispute after seeing this film. I won't tell you what to look for, you'll know. I was dismayed not to see any screen credit given Powers. Nonetheless, don't be surprised if the Fountain of Youth somehow plays into the third film.Bottom Line: well worth seeing on the big screen. I might even go see it again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Yo, ho, yo, ho, the pirate life is definitely for me!! Bigger and badder than the original! An absolute must see!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1413367/?ref_=tt_urv","dogbrain311","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2196822/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2006","The time has finally arrived again to lick your lips and put the key in the ignition to go see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie! Like many of you, I could not wait until we got to experience another adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann  better known as Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly.As you probably know, Disney gave producer Jerry Bruckheimer the green light to shoot the second and third movies together. That meant getting the same writers, cast, and crew back to shoot two movies back to back. Jerry immediately got Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio to write both scripts  or at least a draft of both story lines; Ted and Terry wrote the first Pirates as well. In my opinion, they decided to make these two films have an epic feel  especially with this second one leading straight into the third film. There are many references regarding the first film, but many story lines are geared towards a third film. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up a little bit after the original; Will and Elizabeth are still wanted by the police for helping Jack escape. Jack, on the other hand  well, let's just say his entrance will speak for itself. But I will say, Will and Elizabeth seek out to help Jack once again.There are a few new characters to the game this go-round. Jack's main nemesis is the sea creature Davy Jones, played brilliantly by Bill Nighy. The CG work they did on him is incredible  he's got a sort of sea creature look to him - a half man, half octopus. Whatever it is, it's amazing  he's got several tentacles coming out of his face - no nose, but he's got a side blow hole. And to top off his pirate-esquire motif, he's equipped with a wooden peg-leg. Seeing what the artists did with Bill Nighy and Davy Jones is almost worth the price of admission alone!Davy Jones also has somewhat supernatural powers  he can transform himself underwater into a giant octopus-killing machine, over taking whole ships and sinking them into the bottom of the ocean.Jack has a debt to repay to Davy  after helping Jack become the captain of the Black Pearl, Davy wants his pay back now. Davy's after Jack and the Black Pearl in this adventure, and he'll stop at nothing to destroy both. Jack gets a visitor late at night on the Pearl from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. Played by Stellan Skarsgard, Bootstrap warns Jack of his impending demise, but Jack discovers a way to get out of repaying Davy  send Will to do the job.After Jack discovers a treasure chest that is the key to getting out of his debt with Davy, his number one priority is finding out where the key is to open the chest  and then to find out where the chest is.Throughout the film, you realize how much fun Johnny Depp has with the Jack Sparrow character  his movements, his voice; his body language is just awesome, and hilarious at times. The character who changes the most from the first to the second has to be Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. You really get to see the action side of Will in this second film; in one sequence, Will, Johnny, and British military head Commodore Norrington are sword fighting on top of a moving water wheel. You also get to see Will's emotional side when he realizes he might be losing his love, Elizabeth, to Captain Jack. Unfortunately, we don't get to see much of Keira Knightly's performance come out in this film; she's kind of the back story, which hopefully will really shine in the third. But, it all leads up to that third film. And that's not to say she's not featured heavily in the film; she most certainly is  and she has to make a very important decision towards the end, one that could cost her Will. What I mean by my earlier statement is her story really won't get told until the third film.In the pirate land, they meet up with a fortune teller, Tia Dalma, played by Naomi Harris; her on-screen presence is great! She's tells Johnny and Will what they're in store for when battling Davy and his crew. Her role is a bit small in this movie, but Naomie mentioned how she gets into the mix in the third film. That's definitely something to look forward to - a fortune teller on a pirate adventure!Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's chest is an amazing trip on land and sea that will leave you breathless at the end and waiting until next year for the third movie, World's End! I certainly can't wait to see how Ted and Terry write up the finale of the trilogy! I'm telling you  you will love this movie! Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an absolute must-see!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The last two have one plot and the second definitely did not have an ending. It should either be all three with a continuous plot or 3 individual plots.

Because there's the issue of Jack fighting to keep his life, there's will and Elizabeth trying to ensure their freedom, and there's also Will trying to save his father's soul as well.The characters are much more in depth in this one as well. Jack becomes a lot more noble at one point. Will is much less of a pansy in this one. Not that he was in the first, but he's a lot more bad ass this time around. Even Elizabeth brings a lot more edge to her character. The minor characters have much more comic relief to them in this movie, and there are also a lot more twists as well with plot and characters who you never even thought to come back.The action sequences are twice as intense as well as the swordfights, and Davy Jones is a far more fearsome villain than Barbossa ever will be. Stellan Skaarsgard gives a great performance as Will's father as well.As far as the comedic gags go. I felt that they were somewhat needed at times, especially with Jack's character as always, but even the other characters had quite a bit as well, which made it much more fun to watch.Now, comparing this to the original trilogy of Star Wars. Look at Jack Sparrow. He reeks of Han Solo throughout the movie, albeit he's a lot more lax than Han, but he has the roguish, mercenary swagger that Han does. Will is basically Luke Skywalker, because he's the goody goody fighting for justice all the time, even though he's quite the pirate as well. Elizabeth is obviously Princess Leia, and the fact that her and Will are to be married is basically Luke and Leia without the brother sister plot involved. As for other characters. Barbossa can be compared best to Moff Tarkin in the first movie, cuz he is not the most fearsome villain in the seas, like Tarkin wasn't the most evil figure in the galaxy. Davy Jones is the evil emperor, and Will's father is like Anakin if he didn't get burned, but he still has done something he eventually is not proud of and does want to save his son, only it happens in #2 instead of #3. Gibbs can be compared to Yoda, cuz he's like a mentor to will at times. The two pirates (the fat guy and the one with the odd Eye) can be compared to R2 D2 and C3P0 in that order as well. The government and the undead could all be compared to the empire, just cuz they're the bad guys in the story. As far as plot goes, none of it has to really do with blowing up Death stars and stuff.However, the first one did go a bit like the first one in a sense that Will is a farmboy (blacksmith) who meets up with Jack(Han Solo) and wants to save Elizabeth (Leia.) Only, no death star. Curse must be lifted instead.In number 2 of Pirates, the plot had a lot more twists and turns, and a surprise at the end. The government and the undead are after the Pearl and Jack (Millenium Falcon and Solo) Will has to save his father, which is his goal by the 3rd movie, and finally, there is a HUGE twist as it ends, only no (Will, I am your father.) That's just how it seems to me, but not only that. If you think about it, times have changed again like they did back in the 70s when all those realistic movies came out and Star wars came along and changed everything. The new trilogy didn't do as well, and pray God Pirates doesn't do the same thing. Nowadays, in the world where there's all these remakes of classic movies that were sometimes better the first time around, Pirates comes along. It may be based on something already in existence, but the plot and the characters really came out of nowhere. And no one expected the first one to do so well, just like Star Wars. The second even surpassed my expectations at least and surprised the heck out of me. Pirates is the only series these days doing anything original and new. It's an old concept, but it is finally being shown the way it was meant to be shown. Everyone loves it so much, and it is a great legacy that is being sewn into history. Here's to Pirates 3.10/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you like seeing Keira Knightly naked, this . . . er . . . try Google.There's enough in this film to insult almost anyone's intelligence. How about the notion that primitives can actually believe that a dog could be their king? Or that a highly intelligent individual would turn over an incredibly valuable artifact - one that provides almost unlimited power to the bearer - to a person of questionable ethics in order to gain a reward that has a tiny fraction of the value of what was available had the artifact been retained? Or that a stolen document when filled in by the thief could have any influence whatsoever on the party from whom the document was stolen? These inanities and numerous others are pretty much the only things even remotely resembling buried treasure to be found in the frames of Pirates 2.

How often does one find a movie that has so much going against it, and it still remains a success. Originally, when executives discussed the plan of making a movie based on the beloved theme-park attraction, they conceived a made-for-video movie that would attempt to make a low-budget story out of a ride without a clear story.The first film worked because they didn't try to make sense of the ride (which as much as I love it, the story of the ride would make a very dull pirate movie) Rather they tried to create a swashbuckling pirate movie that would rejuvenate the franchise for generations to come, and with the amazing talent of Johnny Depp in their corner, create one of the most memorable characters to ever hit the silver screen.The first movie could stand alone as a complete story, without need for further delving into the legends of Captain Jack, but where would be the fun (and profit) of that? Dead Man's Chest suffers from the trilogy syndrome, much in the same way that Back to the Future and Lord of the Rings suffered: The second movie will inevitably remain the weakest of the three, and during it's initial release, will become the whipping-boy for the franchise. Because the public is mostly aware that the third movie is in the works, the story is created as a bridge between the first and second movie, and will always result in a cliff-hanger of sorts. Those who are unaware of the impending third movie will scorn the directors for leaving it so open at the end, and the more informed viewers will overlook the film to keep their eye focused on the conclusion of the story.Sadly, the studio themselves seemingly do the same thing. Production values on Dead Man's Chest were not as high as they were for the Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's likely that the studio is more focused on part 3, making part 2 more of a necessary evil rather than an important piece of the puzzle.That notwithstanding, the movie itself is fun. The action sequences are exciting, the jokes (although not as witty and original as they were in the first) are great, and Captain Jack is just as lovable a rogue as ever. The blending of CGI in this film compared to the first is not as smooth, and there are some design issues for several of the creatures that ILM created this time around.Walt Disney hated sequels, and when asked why he wouldn't do a sequel to the Three Little Pigs, he simply stated that ""you can't top pigs with pigs."" In this case, you can't do it with Pirates either.Overall, it's still a fun and exciting movie, and it leads into what promises to be an equally fun and exciting third installment. As long as you don't expect it to surpass the first film, you should enjoy this adventure with Captain Jack","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm gonna try not to drone on here, but I just wanted to say that I was not disappointed...(and I do not foresee any spoilers here, but I will warn you if something comes to mind)...The sequel isn't nearly as tight as the original, but that was to be expected considering that this film was written in tandem with the third film (to be released Summer 2007). So, we must forgive any untied ends until after the final film. Although I do have to say, you may leave the theatre with an unsettled feeling as you think about the time which separates you and the conclusion to this story.The first 20 minutes or so had me wondering whether or not these two films were going to unmercifully crush even its most loyal fans a la Matrix. But the film begins to warm up halfway into the first act and steadily builds to a wonderfully adventurous/treacherous crescendo. I'm happy to report that my doubts have faded considerably. I think this is going to be a truly great trilogy.The returning cast is as fun to watch as ever. Somehow, I still can't help waiting for Bloom to grab a bow and take down some !#$in Orcs, I'm not sure if it's his performance or my lack of imagination. Keira Knightley steps up her comedic timing a few notches; this really seemed to be a standout performance from her. Cap'n Jack Sparrow is allowed another fantastic screen entrance, enjoy it; Depp milks this character and still has a few more gallons to go it seems. We really get some good CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow moments and the film really seems to focus on him, which is right on target. Mackenzie Crook shows up and delivers some true comic relief. And there are a few other returning cast members who make memorable re-appearances. As for the new cast, Bill Nighy is wonderful as a 7/8 digital Davy Jones. Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) rocks the creepy little house her character lives in. Good stuff here.So anyhoot, go see it, it's good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have to say, I was a bit biased. I'd been counting down to July 7 since December, and I appeared in the theatre in full Jack Sparrow costume. So I probably would have liked it even if Johnny Depp had got up there and read the phone book.But honestly, this movie WAY surpassed my expectations. I LOVED the first one, and was a bit hesitant to see this one, because sequels are never as good as the original. But Dead Man's Chest is. It's pretty hard to top undead pirate skeletons, but undead pirate squid people are right up there.The beginning was a bit, ""Wait, what just happened?"" as they plunged directly into the action, without the mood-setting preamble of Curse of the Black Pearl. But once you got into it, the plot was actually easier to follow than the first movie... I thought so, anyway.Without giving anything away, I'll just say I don't think anybody expected THAT ending. Cynics might say it's Disney's way of ensuring you'll be back for the third movie, but I say it makes the third movie more of a real plot continuation, and less of some lacklustre plot tacked on to the end to rake in a few more dollars.I could not stop laughing through pretty much the whole movie, except for about the last 5 minutes, where I almost cried. It was absolutely hilarious, and completely worth the outrageous admission prices they charge these days.I think I'll go back tomorrow.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong, Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favourite movies, but even I had to admit that the second one was simply amazing. Many people that have voted or posted their comments have said that Dead Man's Chest was comparable to Empire Strikes back (a sentiment I thought of as soon as I left the cinema), when others have said Matrix Reloaded would be a more apt comparison. I believe that the people who agree with the latter must remember that the first made the impression on all of us because everybody was surprised that COTBP, a movie based on a theme park ride, would obtain the phenomenal success that it did, and therefore had a lasting effect on us. Despite DMC's arguably more pointless (less relevant to the story) beginning, I think everyone that watched the movie can agree that the middle and ending of the movie were clearly more exciting, suspenseful and enjoyable than the first. While the first movie had one relatively weak story of cursed aztec gold which was almost completely driven by Johnny Depp's (and to a lesser extent, Geoffery Rush's) unique acting style, and superb special effects which brought the skeletons to life. DMC on the other hand had the same erratic behaviour by Depp, a new villain whose mannerisms and backstory rival, and arguably exceed those of Barbossa, and special effects which personally kept my jaw dropped as soon as the formidable tentacles of Davy Jones first graced the screen. Jack Sparrow's character evolved magnificently in DMC, as did Elizibeth Swann's, who turned from spunky Damsel in Distress to a heroine in her own right, even managing to subdue Jack himself. Will Turner's story of a brave sidekick transformed into a much deeper tale of lost love, a scorned son, and demonstrated Will's ability to think for himself. His relationship with his father 'Bootstrap' Bill was one of the most disturbing and at the same time heart-warming sections of the film, and contributed greatly to Will Turner's purpose in the world of Pirates of the Caribbean, something which before was shrouded in uncertainty.The movie started with 3 different stories, each character revelling in their personal traumas and their twisted love stories, eventually converging into one astounding amalgam of action, romance, and a phenomenal twist that in my opinion was mirrored only in Empire Strikes Back. If you are skeptical about this comment, and find it hard to believe that a Disney movie based on a theme park ride can be mentioned in the same sentence as the best Star Wars film, but if you look at the meaningful topics that this film covers, and the genius of how they were executed, I am sure that you will agree that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a fantastic piece of cinema which far surpasses it's predecessor. When you agree with me about the quality of this film, please go and give this film the high rating it deserves.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It was a deliciously fun swashbuckling adventure that had its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. Director Gore Verbinski sailed his cast into a sunny experience that just made you smile out of pure enjoyment.But, in the world of the Caribbean, it's amazing how quickly the weather can turn against you. To put it bluntly, Dead Man's Chest is downright boring. It's poorly paced. It lacks a cohesive structure. And, for an action movie, it lacks great action sequences. The story, which is a convoluted mess that reeks of multiple screenwriters with too many ideas and not enough common sense, takes a good two hours to get interesting. Yup, I said it. TWO HOURS. In the meantime, we're tossed back and forth from character to character with vague dialogue and leaky pirate ships until the whole shindig smells as bad as the Kraken's breath.When we do finally reach the bombastic action-packed finale, it's hard to care anymore. Like an unruly dinner party guest, Pirates 2 long outstays its welcome. Character motivations weren't explained. Plot is thick and unintelligible. And, as a result, ""Dead Man's Chest"" becomes a victim of trying to do a little bit of everything, but at the same time, not doing anything particularly well. Sure, the special effects looked top notch, but in a world where computer generated wizardry is the norm, it takes a lot more than a fish people to get one to turn his head in wonder.It's fascinating how all the best cinematic ingredients (a good director, solid cast, brilliant special effects) all come together to taste downright bitter without the unifying power of a solid story. And, as the famous theme park attraction prophetically declares, ""They're be rough waters ahead."" In the meantime, I raise a glass of grog to the heavens in hope that the third installment brings life back to such a promising franchise.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

The special effects, CGI and costumes are brilliant, the sea battle scenes are fast-paced and not over-long and the pure action scenes are obviously the product of some extremely inventive and imaginative minds. Definitely one not to miss.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The only problem I had was the ending, it just didn't feel like a real ending, so it was a bit of a let down. Which is why I rated it a 8 versus a 10. Other than that, I think its another one of Johnny Depp's better movies. Orlando Bloom is alright in to. In this movie, Keira Knightly isn't the most likable. Jack was funny as always, and great at getting himself into trouble as usual. A lot of unexpected surprises in this movie... I found my jaw hitting the floor a few times.

I just didn't know if they could make a sequel good enough to be up there with the first. OH yeah! They did, I'm very impressed.I think they surpassed all my expectations and blew me away not only with the storyline, and the fine acting, but the hilarious bits and special effects were really wonderful. I love how they tied it in with the first. Now of course I'm absolutely dying to see part 3...How could they make us wait an entire year!!!!!!!!!??????????? It's just now fair!!! Please, Disney don't make us wait a whole year......just this once......please!!!!!If everyone wasn't on the pirate bandwagon (ship) before, well, they'll all be 'on the account' after this one!

Sure, there were some cheesy moments and stunts but they did make the audience laugh and me a couple of times. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has returned in this sequel to the first Pirates of the Carrribean film. Also returning are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the romantic couple. This movie contains action, great special effects and a little bit of humor coming from the characters. The stunts are good, but some of them are a little stupid. The effects are amazing, it had me awed and made me wonder how long it took to make a particular sequence.The downside is that it is just too long. Chock full of action and effects, it was just too long, and I wasn't really impressed with the ending too. However, this movie does have the occasional surprise and funny moment and I recommend this to families that want to watch something exciting and funny.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I don't know what people were expecting, but I think this movie is fantastic! I am one of those who actually think I like it better than the first one. I think that Johnny Depp's performance was just amazing (as always), but I think part of the magic was gone that was there in the first movie because in the first one, I didn't know what to expect until I saw it. Of course, this time around, I knew what to expect from Captain Jack's character. As far as the length of the film, I honestly didn't notice it at all. So, I hope those that go to see it will just chill out, sit back, and enjoy the wonderful ride this movie provides.By the way, even though the credits are extremely long, I hope people stay to see the extra scene that they put at the end (same as they did in the first movie). This one is quite funny (IMO).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The ghosts of The Matrix: Reloaded return in this god awful sequel to one of my favorite movies that does nothing in 2 hours and 45 minutes but set up a 3rd movie and make your bag of popcorn turn cold.For the first 30 or 40 minutes of the movie, I was entertained in being largely reminded of how much I liked the first movie of this series. By the time the lights came up in the theater, I wanted to throw something at the screen. That being said, the studio who produced this is genius because no matter how much this second movie has been destroyed by the critics, it would take tremendous self-control not to see the third POTC just to get ANY sense of closure. There was absolutely nothing resolved in this movie except 150 minutes of consumer manipulation.The most frustrating part was that all the pieces were in place: great special effects (that went a little past unsettling at times), the same great cast, and a pretty good plot setup. It appears, however, that Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are much better at adapting screenplays than actually writing one themselves. I get the feeling that so much time was spent on creating an entire ship's crew of half human, half fish characters that someone forgot to write an actually entertaining screenplay. The few times when the script was decent was when lines were basically copied and pasted from the first movie. As a result, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, and Orlando Bloom left much to be desired, but not by their own faults. I have to echo the Boston Globe's comment that Johnny Depp ""mailed it in,"" but he could not have done any better with the script he was given.Bottom line- you will see this movie, you will be mildly entertained at times, you will be left with a feeling of emptiness at the finish, and then you will attempt to fill that emptiness by going to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End when it comes out next Summer, only to find you could never quite recapture that great feeling of the first movie of the series- and the POTC franchise will win. Sound like a familiar plot line? This is the Matrix trilogy all over again- they even found an excuse to toss in some bullet time technology.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, if you prefer movies that wrap up every detail into a nice finished ending you won't enjoy it. What we get is plenty of Jack doing what he does best, supporting characters doing what they do best and fun humor that sometimes takes a second or two to set in. The movie never takes itself seriously and that was what I enjoyed about the first one. Movies don't have to be perfect critically acclaimed academy award nominees to be enjoyable and this is where ""Dead Man's Chest"" figures in. The opening scene is brilliant and the closing scene makes me impatient for the next installment.

The only thing that is difficult is the beginning of the movie. The beginning seemed like it took a long time to get things rolling, but once they did get movin' it was all unstoppable. The plot was pretty strong, and the acting was stellar. Depp's performance, as always, was great and Knightly did a wonderful job as well. Surprisingly it seemed like Orlando Bloom had one of the weaker performances in the movie, but it was still good nonetheless. The computer effects for Davy Jones and his crew were absolutely outstanding! Most interestingly was the frequent appearances of movie sets from the first Pirates of the Caribbean that was really present to show some good laughs. The comedy was not nearly as strong as the first Pirates of the Caribbean (i.e. Johnny Depp sailing a sinking ship into the docks in the first Pirates) This movie really showed off the pirate world and its inner workings. I really enjoyed the extensive shots in Singapore, but what i enjoyed most was the entrance of characters. There was always a clever way to bring in new characters and either crack a joke, or just make you amazed at the level of coolness, heh. Now the ending to this movie was wonderful in my opinion. I won't ruin anything, but I will say that I think they ended it the best way they could. Many will disagree with me here but I suppose that's to be expected in every movie discussion. I'm really trying to avoid giving anything away so I do apologize for being vague. Just go to this movie and don't be afraid of anything, just be relaxed and ready for one of the best movies this year. If you can't remember a lot of things from the first movie, watch the first movie again so that you're ready for a lot of the inside jokes and such. Also, a very short scene after the credits. I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Half the time I couldn't even look at the screen cause of the barnacled sea creatures up there were just ugly. Wow I wish I hadn't gone to see this movie. How many times can you watch a movie where the skinny girl who couldn't tear open an envelope beats up on and actually kills bad guys? This has been done to the point where I'm not rooting for them anyone, but rather for her to be killed off or something. There are so many holes in the story that are overlooked by its fans simply because they get more special effects to distract them. I think I'll just stop here as I'm more than sure that all of these fans of this poor excuse to ruin the Pirate ride at Disneyland will be saying how great of a movie it is. Yeah sure, just look back at the Lord of the Rings movies to realize that no one will care in a few years.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Think to Matrix, Back to the Future or Indiana Jones. All of these films first parts are in the top 250, but their sequels failed to obtain this performance (however Indiana Jones managed to recover with the third part). I think the main reason why most of the viewers, who liked the first part and did not the second, is because the sequel didn't carry the magic of novelty.When the first Pirates of the Caribbean came out, it was new, it was fresh, nothing really have looked similar to it before. It mixed adventure, fantasy, humor, great visuals and very good sound.The director didn't took any chances, he followed the successful recipe. The sequel is good looking, funny, well acted and most of all, and in this characteristic it exceeds the first one in my opinion, it is very dynamic. However after the first one, this genre is not new, so for many it just won't be as good as the first one.If you liked the first one, don't hesitate seeing this one. It holds the same qualities as it's predecessor. At first I thought the 150 minutes will be too much, but the film is action packed and if you like this kind of entertainment, you will not get bored for a single minute. And maybe the final part will have the similar fate as the third part of Indiana Jones. I hope so. 9/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jack, sashaying his way across the Caribbean, is trying to continue his infamous ability to cheat death. Problem is, though, is that he owes a life-debt to the dreaded Davy Jones (come full-on as a character and not just a small piece of sea karma by Bill Nighy). Davy Jones and his barnacled crew take the souls of those not willing to venture into the Great Unknown and apparently Jack had met Mr. Jones previously and wrangled a deal: he'd captain the Black Pearl for 13 years, and now that 13 years is up. So, in true Captain Sparrow fashion, Jack decides to cheat, steal, manipulate, and do whatever is necessary to save his skin. Even if it means finding the heart of Davy Jones (which is stowed away ...somewhere, waiting to be found). The more trouble is that Beckett wants the heart of Jones so that he can control the seas (he who controls Davy Jones' heart controls something called the Kracken, a mythological beast ...more on that in a minute) and thus be the only trading ships on the ocean. But Will Turner also needs the heart in order to save Elizabeth from the deadly clutches of Beckett who has promised to hang both Will and Elizabeth if he doesn't get it. The race is afoot! And what a race it is! As far as summertime blockbusters go, you'd have a pretty tough time finding something as entertaining as Dead Man's Chest. The action is incredible, the dialogue fun, and the special effects first-rate. Johnny Depp, as always, inhabits the role of Jack Sparrow. His mannerisms, line delivery and antics are just a sheer joy to watch. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are also fun to watch but not nearly as much as Depp (who steals every scene he's in).There are problems though (Argh!). Length is an obvious issue. At 2 and 1/2 hours, younger kids might find it a bit irritating to sit through something so long. Indeed, little youngsters should avoid the film altogether as it has some rather gruesome if not downright frightening scenes in it (gaining its full PG-13 rating by having images of eyeballs being plucked out of living and caged pirates, etc.) The other problems involve the meshing histories. A tenuous connection between Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman can be made, of course (the true captain of the Flying Dutchman was NOT anyone named ""Davy Jones"" but the myth is adequate enough to have him helm the ship). The other issue is Davy Jones' mythological undersea monster, the Kracken. The Kracken is a beast related to Greek and Norwegian mythology, not something as current as Davy Jones (who's myth started, I believe, in the early 1700s). My only other movie experience with the Kracken was in the sad, sad, sad B-movie CLASH OF THE TITANS (maybe not a true B-movie, but it sure felt that way!) I will admit, however, that Dead Man's Chest got the creature's features down more appropriately according to legend.At any rate, this is a wonderful summer film. Blockbuster? Definitely. Disney has done something amazing in their marketing, too: pulling stories from rides at their theme parks is a sure way to ensure that people come back to Disneyland and Disney World time and time again. Sheer genius.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Although some of the acting and most of the special effects were incredible there were times I couldn't help but wonder what went wrong. The first Pirates of the Caribbean was a fun and remarkably joyous film, where this one is slow and plodding with multiple mistakes throughout. I keep trying to figure out why they would take a fun film and put in even more cheesy comedy that makes no impact on the poor story line. This movie will do great in theaters due only to the fact that the first one was so great. I see people bringing young children to see this movie, and per the first one that shouldn't be a problem. However, be warned, this is a darker and much more death filled film. Worth the price to see it once, and maybe rent later.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

Great plot, exciting action, fun dialogue. Not a ""masterpiece"" of course, but no waste of time either! Just a Great fun film. Not for the squeamish, but those scenes aren't all bad...You have to pay attention to the development, and a review of the first film will probably help. There's an interesting and intricate story run through the film, with a few fun sub-plots. The movie expressed the concept of redemption by many of the characters, on many levels in many ways. Well done there!Lot's of funny and memorable lines. Elizabeth Swann's character (Keira) seems to me to be a much more highly involved character in this one. Though I'm sure there's room for argument there.Go see it and you will likely enjoy yourself!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Much better than the original, although the end is a bit of a cliffhanger and may disturb some people, Depp, Bloom & Knightley make a fantastic cast to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. In this second movie, we see a much broader side to Elizabeth Swann, who has finally come out of her shell & recognized that to survive with a pirate one must be a pirate himself. Same goes to Will Turner, who unlike the last movie has actually accepted his role as a pirate, just like his father. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is one movie you will not want to miss!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not ""this is not as good as the original"" but just poor movie making in general.Why? First of all, it's too long by at least 30 minutes. And I'd guess most of those 30 minutes could have been excised by scaling back on the mind-numbing gore scenes. I guess the producers wanted as much of the budget on the screen so we're treated to scene after scene of pointless sea zombies pulsing and oozing. Very stupid.Then there is the story, if you can call it that. In an effort to reprise as many of the featured roles from the first film, all kinds of vignettes are created to justify their presence in this mess.Finally, the biggest problem is the very thing that made the first movie so unique, Johnny Depp's performance. All the quirks that made his Jack Sparrow such an unforgettable character in movie #1 are so amplified in this film that it also seems like a parody instead of a performance. This is the first time I've seen Depp mug for the camera and it's very difficult to watch.Well, there is one more thing, it's no secret that POTC #3 was shot in tandem with this movie but the ending was so clichéd and sudden that it seems as if the whole plot of this movie was simply to set up the next.Save your money, rent the DVD and be very wary of installment number three.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

I must admit, as excited as I was walking into the theatre I was a little apprehensive. I wasn't sure that the second installment of Pirates could compete with the original. Boy was I wrong. The story may have not been the most original but the characters kept it going. Even ""the bad guys"" were incredible, and their costumes were brilliant, from Davey Jones' octopus face to his Conch shell-headed slave. The special effects were just unbelievable, the CGI totally blew me away. And all of the actors clearly put tremendous work into their characters, the cast was perfect. I will definitely see it again and I can not wait for the third one (rumored to be starring Keith Richards). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (CSI, Without A Trace) seems to be taking over the big screen as well as television, the new and improved Aaron Spelling. Keep it up.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The action is even more intense than the first and the 145 minutes fly by. I can't wait until Pirates 3 is released and I only hope that it can continue in the foot steps already established by 1 & 2.The make up is fantastic I can't imagine what those actors had to sit through each day in preparation for filming, hats off to the make-up artists... and artists they truly are.Obviously one hated to see the movie end... yes I will say it's a major cliff hanger and leave it at that.

Yesturday that I went to the movies with my friends, we decided to watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest"" and I will NEVER regret it, the first hour of the movie is really slow, but really funny, it has to do with the story, but the characters don't really talk much about Davy Jones, which now is looking for Jack Sparrow, there's not much explained about what happened to Davy Jones, his story is established by one of the characters but I really didn't believe the heart thing at the beginning, until afterwords, almost the ending. The story is great, really interesting, I heard that the 3rd movie was made with the 2nd, and that it will be released sometime next year, I await the DVD to come out, I WILL BUY THIS MOVIE! Another Thing I loved about it is that it sticked to the same actors from the first, not every movie shows you something like that. Disney did a great job, it shows that everyone involved did there best effort with this movie.The ending of the movie keeps you thinking, or well at least myself, I had no idea that something like that was going to happen.. Someone like him was going to appear. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE!!! I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!! WATCH IT! with ur family, friends, girlfriend, or even alone, you'll have a great time","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Great action sequences but the dialogue could have been a bit better as this film was a bit confusing but I got it just.The film was also very very funny with Captain Jack Sparrow's great humour once again appearing.I would suggest that you watch Curse of the Black Pearl before watching this or watch Curse of the Back Pearl again before watching this to understand some of the jokes.So I gave this a 10/10 as that is what it deserved.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I could only take in bits and pieces of it and because of that I thought it was slow and I was disappointed. However, I went again today and was able to sit near the top and take in the whole movie at the same time. I was truly amazed. Granted, there are many plot elements that are never explained and do not make sense. There are many that come from seemingly nowhere and you wish that you knew what they were about. However, all of these moments fit together wonderfully to create a truly worthy sequel to the first Pirates. The tone to this movie is decidedly darker than the first. Bill Nighy plays Davy Jones, the heartbroken (literally) lord of the sea underworld who commands a ship full of ghost pirates that look like the stuff nightmares are made of. For anyone who was creeped out by Captain Barbossa in the first Pirates, Davy Jones makes him look like Pooh Bear. There are sequences in the movie that carry the more lighthearted tone of the first, such as the crew trying to swing to the sides of the cliff in their cages and the epic swordfight atop the water wheel. Johnny Depp is truly in his element as Jack Sparrow, making him even more wacky and hilarious than usual. Orlando Bloom steps back into Will Turner and is given much more to do. Will has done some growing up and it shows. Keira Knightley once again plays the feisty Elizabeth Swann. She is also given much more to do and does a lot with it. She is no longer the helpless damsel in distress, she manages to keep herself out of trouble and out of captivity on pirate ships. I was especially amazed at Tom Hollander, who plays the land villain Lord Cutler Beckett. I loved him as Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice and was delighted to see him and Keira working together again. As a die-hard Pirates fan (I saw the first one six times in the theater), I went into this movie with very high expectations. It didn't meet them, however. It more than exceeded them.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Action-packed, dramatic and hilarious, with truly flawless CGI, this movie, although it is a sequel, is one that you will want to watch again and again.

I just felt obliged to write one, because so many people have criticised this film for reasons I don't fully understand.What I mean by this film having a similar feeling is that of the feeling I, and many people, got after watching Lord Of The Rings, or Star Wars. At the end you respected the directors decision to leave things in the air, (because you just knew this film had way to much content to throw it all into one film) and you were left wanting more, straight away. In contrast to this, take the original Italian Job film. That has got to be the worst ending to a film i have ever seen. It just ends, literally, with a cliffhanger. That is NOT a respected film ending. Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is.I think the plot was fantastic. The first film only had one major plot, maybe two. It was all about Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl, and the other plot, major or minor, was whether Will and Elizabeth would get together. The sequel contains so much more. It has at least 4 plots, which I will not mention due to the Spoiler rule. But the plots are full and well-balanced, and they link the characters together.I would understand peoples criticism if this film had subtle excellence. I know this may not be the best example, but the film Jarhead was slated by many for being boring and not having enough action. They expected a war-glorifying action movie because it was to do with the military. But the film was about the American Military training system, and basically, in the film, how much a waste of time it was for those soldiers. But this film's excellence is so obvious, it's so brilliantly constructed and linked together.So in summary, the film leaves you wanting more, it has a very well worked narrative. Like I said, this is not an amazing film review. But some people may see where I'm coming from.9/10 - It would have been 10 had it not been for Bloom's slightly wooden acting, but I think he did well on parts which I cant mention, spoiler rule.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Moreover, I had the lack of sense to bring my 9 year old daughter, having just allowed her two weeks ago to watch the first installment of this fabulous franchise. Guess what...it was no goof! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" has the luxury of jumping right into the story. This is no film where you suffer through the first twenty minutes of background; we reacquaint ourselves with our favorite characters in moments and the action begins...and very rarely stops! This movie is so fast-paced to be almost frenetic (but in a good way). For those who, like Elizabeth, lost track of whose side Jack was on in the first film, it is another struggle to keep up (of course, we all know Jack is always on Jack's side). The mood is dark and scary most times, but also contains an underlying humor to lighten the mood.The character of Elizabeth Swann is broadened nicely, while Jack Sparrow (er...Captain Jack Sparrow) and Will Turner continue in the same vein as the first movie. Several familiar faces make appearances, but the highlight was the seamless interweave of the CGI characters with the live action ones, particularly Davy Jones. Though the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise pioneered the completely CGI character, it has been just as masterfully accomplished in this film. Bill Nighy performed all of Davy Jones' acting through motion capture on set with the other actors which allowed complete believability in their interactions. Had I not known of the CGI nature of the character, I might have suspected some fabulous makeup and effects works, so lifelike was the character.Don't expect all your loose ends tied up; most of us know the third installment was filmed concurrently with this and this movie is left wide open. Enjoy the ride, however, for Captain Jack and crew have hoisted sails and are ready to brave the rough waters of sequeldom admirably.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Or Bloom's character and his father. Or Keira's character and her father. Or everyone and Jack Sparrow. Sparrow staggers around the film like he's drunk or just deranged. It's supposed to be cute but it makes him an anti-hero and it just didn't work for me.The special effects are totally misused. They could have looked creepy and made me frightened. But the undersea Davey Jones monsters look comical instead, and not in a good way, rather in a way that pulled me out of the movie so I could not really engage with it.To add to that, the plot lines don't make any sense. People are always pledging loyalty and servitude to each other, running around after various artifacts, and so forth. At one point, without spoiling the plot, there's a dice game involving pledges and oaths that made no sense to me whatsoever. It was so complicated and there's such a large cast of characters I really couldn't figure anything out. Everyone's fighting everyone else too, and it's like they can't decide whether to fight or be friends or fight again. The implausible character decisions combined with all the superstitious muckety-muck reminds me very much of the film The Mummy. ""Let's get the golden chalice into the water of doom before the clock ticks midnight because the silver bat of Davey Jones needs to feed on the insects of horror"". OK, whatever, people.Finally, instead of ending the film with some kind of closure, it turns out the entire movie is just a setup for the next film. I wanted to leave half-way through but my date kept me there, hoping the film would get better. Unfortunately, it doesn't get any better. If you go and you don't like the first 10 minutes, just leave. Or better yet, stay away.Who should see this film:-- Nobody, except maybe kids because they're too naive to know junk when they see it-- Anyone who enjoyed Independence Day and The Mummy, you're good people just entirely lacking in taste I'll give this film a 4 out of 10, and it would have been lower except I did enjoy a small fraction of the humor and action.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

The fights combine with humor as seen before, but have new twists. While this movie leads to the sequel, it is great to see it on a large screen. Coupling mythology and history has the advantage of providing great entertainment. If you have not seen the previous movie, do see it as it will add to the enjoyment of this movie.

It delivered in every way, with witty comments alongside brilliant dialogue and may I say fantastic acting! When I first heard that Bill Nighy was taking the role of Davy Jones, I wondered if he could fill these boots, but he proceeded to do so very well and created yet another popular character from an excellent film. The storyline was gripping and the many surprises had me shocked throughout the entire film. I cannot rap up this comment without giving praise to the outstanding performance given by Johnny Depp, he recreated Jack Sparrow with more humour and cunning than the first film, much to my delight. And may I say he continues to make me drool with his stunning good looks. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly also give amazing performances, though I slightly hate Keira/Elizabeth now for her actions, but if you haven't watched the movie yet then I won't spoil the surprise.

Pirates 2 is a different ball of wax. Have you ever noticed the red flags of movie execs meddling with a perfectly good movie? Pirates 2 has all the tell tale signs. (We can thank Johnnie Depp for salvaging the film). The biggest red flag in Pirates 2 are character and storyline digressions that are simply inserted to pander to a segment of viewers. Not to be too blunt ... but what purpose did the swamp lady really contribute? How about bootstrap Turner? Why is he the only crew member on the Flying Dutchman that still resembles a human? His make-up was god awful. What was he wearing? Was that a seaweed fez / and a moo-moo combination? Usually children, an old guy, a strong female, a mom, and an animal/pet are tacked-on to the storyline to ensure that everyone in the audience can find a character to relate to ... no matter how superfluous or pathetic that character might be.I think the special effects on Davey Jones were amazing. His facial effects were so good (eyes, mouth etc) that i think exploring his backstory would have made world of difference. I am certain that any script writer worth his/her salary developed a brilliant back-story related to the Dutchman's heart, the abandoned colony, and the location of the chest. That could have been explored vs. that brutally long panning shot of the long-boat re-entering the swamp with those pathetic extras in the swamp holding candles. C'mon -- why are people standing in swamp water? That cr_p had Jar-jar binks written all over it. At least try to get details like accents correct so we don't continue raising another generation of idiot children. Is the Dutchman Dutch? If so - then why the Scottish accent.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

It was made for the fans of the first Pirates movie (and of course for the Captain Jack Sparrow aficionado in most of us!). But still why do some people despise this movie? It's simple they point out, that it's not enough story to justify the running time. Although this is right to a great extent, it's not what you should be looking for in this movie. This movie was made to entertain, nothing more and nothing less. And although other movies do try that too (some fail others succeed), this one has Johnny Depp. It's as simple as that. Of course other actors are good here too, but the main attraction is Cpt. Jack.If you have seen the first one, you will eventually see this one too, so don't resist the urge to see it and don't listen to some of those critics, telling you it's a waste of time! It's up to you to decide, if you like it or not! (a last little note: The fabulous line from the trailer said by Will Turner: ""Never mind, let's go!"", has gone awol ...

So with an open mind, I saw this movie and I am quite happy to say that I was not disappointed at all. Plausibility needs to be thrown out of the window and this movie becomes sheer arrogant fun. The first one third of this movie is no doubt the best and its most unfortunate that the following parts were'nt as good, but were still good nevertheless. The Kracken CGI could have also been a bit improved upon.

I slept through a great deal of it and was sorry I didn't sleep longer. To me, the elements of a good movie are that it should keep your interest throughout, make you care about the characters, and leave you with a little different perspective on life. This movie lacked all three elements. Really good movies evoke a strong emotion (preferably a pleasant one), but do something other than bore you to tears. Pirates has many dark scenes with gross, gory, slimy, sickening effects, most done to redundancy, such as the character Davy Jones' beard made of octopus tentacles. In one scene, Johnny Depp has blue eyes painted on his eyelids so that when he closes his eyes, it looks like he is looking at you with these very blue eyes. During that scene, he closes his eyes A LOT, in case you happened to miss the cleverness of it all. All the movie had to say was ""Oh, look at my clever special effects"". That's it. A gigantic waste of a whole lot of people's time and way too much money.

Everyone else I knew simply loved it. But I couldn't get past the fact that the filmmakers paid more attention to the special effects than to the script. I was also not a fan of the acting. Johnny Depp played Jack Sparrow with over-the-top camp, while the rest of the cast took their roles entirely too seriously. But most of all, I didn't have any fun watching the movie.After much prodding by friends, I finally saw the sequel--""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""--and was pleasantly surprised. The problems I had with the original had vanished. Gone were the tedious expository dialog and clunky storytelling of the original. The humor was actually funny instead of forced. And kudos to the genius who came up with the idea of a 3-way sword-fight on an out-of-control mill-wheel--a great action segment that required no CGI, just incredible stunt-work.But the biggest improvement was the acting. Instead of Geoffrey Rush trying to do a dramatic, believable ghost-pirate, we have Bill Nighy (""Still Crazy"") playing the supernatural octopus-man Davy Jones with no attempt to be anything other than silly. I was also gratified to see up-and-comer Naomie Harris (""28 Days Later"") in a supporting role as a fortune teller (I predict she will be a big star by decade's end). But the biggest difference is in Johnny Depp's performance. In the first film, he had no actual funny lines, so the humor had to come from his drunken, swishy mannerisms. In this one, his dialog really is funny, and the performance is decidedly less campy.It is not perfect, however. The more I see Orlando Bloom in non-elvish roles, the less I like him. And Stellan Skarsgard simply has no knack for anything other than serious drama. And the ending meant to set up the sequel seemed forced.But overall, this movie was a vast improvement over the original ""Pirates"". I'm hoping ""At World's End"" will be even better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That said; it was not nearly as good as the first movie. Here is why.The first ""Pirates"" movie was a stand-alone story with solid intro, plot development, and closure. When the movie did as well as it did, the 'Big Wigs' told the writers to expand the story into a trilogy. The writers never planned to develop an extended story so they ended up pulling one out of their arrses. If you need another good example of this, look a the Matrix trilogy. As opposed to having a well planned out trilogy storyline such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" it simply stretched the concept out, recycled old jokes, and left us with so many plot treads to contemplate at the end that we basically need to watch the final installment for closure on this movie.The acting is as good as always, and as far as the character development goes; Knightley is the only one who's character kinda takes a dive as she is now ""love torn"" between Bloom and Depp's character. When did this happen? I don't know either.Despite it's problems it still kept me on the edge of my seat and I would suggest going to see it just for the beautiful cinematography and action.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It had more of everything I loved in the first one, with stunning scene after stunning scene for my eyes to feast on. I seriously felt like I was in Heaven. The acting is at the same level as the first one (with another great performance by Depp, naturally) which suits me just fine since I can accept that Bloom isn't the greatest actor in the world, but it wasn't the worst performance in history so it's easily overlooked. This soared to such great heights that I'm seriously wondering how they can top it for the third movie, At World's End. I mean, how can you get more swashbuckling action, stellar visuals, and great performances into 2 and 1/2 hours? If you're a fan of the first film, you won't be disappointed, it's all the greatness of CotBP and more.

What a letdown! The plot is ridiculously confusing, the violence is long and gratuitous, and most of the crew of Davy Jones' ship looks like rejects from a ""Star Wars"" movie. The cannibals on the island looked like a combination of Australian aborigines and African natives---not the Caribs which would have been inhabiting the islands. Yes, we know it's just-pretend, but would it really have been that difficult to introduce a modicum of historical accuracy? Where is the witty script that so enchanted us in the first movie? There were about 3 funny lines in the entire yawn-fest. Believe me, we weren't the only ones who thought so---the entire audience was dead silent. Where is the contrast between the lovely, feminine, elegant Kiera Knightly and the scummy pirates? Part of the fun in the first movie was that she was so prim and proper except when she got drunk on rum. THAT was part of what made the movie work so well. What became of the dashing bravado and humor that Johnny Depp displayed so adeptly in the first movie? He was so deliciously foppish in spite of his piratical ways. This may be the most overblown, over-hyped, pretentious movie of all times---shame on you, Hollywood! By the way---I hear my 8 year old nephew LOVED it!

I much preferred the sequel to the original. There was so much more to this film; humour, action and mild horror. Davy Jones was a better enemy than Captain Barbossa - he was an excellent, largely computer-generated character, whose name is already famously known through pirate folklore. The sea creature men were effectively replacements for the skeletons in the original film. The sea creature men were noticeably different from each other, which is a good thing as it gives the baddies much more visual impact. The awesome kraken was hugely impressive as well. The stunts throughout the film were well-staged and humorously over-the-top. This is Johnny Depp's best performance and I believe he deserves an Oscar this time, an award he was nominated for in the original film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was virtually impossible to distinguish crew members from one another and from the background when they were aboard the ship. Yes, the ocean is full of kelp and barnacles, but not everything is dark green and gray - not even in the depths. Give it some color and make things distinguishable! I rue the day this gets released on DVD...things will be even less distinct.2) I hope all movie studios read this comment: If you're going to make an action movie - let the audience be able to see the action! I get so irritated by movies that cram fifty different action shots into 5 seconds, but you can't tell what happened in ANY of the shots. Slow it down, people! Give the movie some depth. I can't even tell you what happened in half of this movie because all I saw were flickers of things flying across the screen. What was flying or what happened to it, I couldn't tell you.One last wish I have is that modern movies would stop showing people vomit. It's just disgusting, uncalled for, and I don't understand the modern fascination with showing it. You never saw it in old movies, and nowadays you can't escape it. It's ridiculous.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

If anything, every last tidbit was left as a cliff-hanger. I call foul on that part.But, look at my score for this film, an 8. I gave the original a 9.

Jack Sparrow is quite a letdown, if not sort of a villain when it comes to Will Turner and at times, Elizabeth Swan. Be prepared for a few scary moments, and lots of laughter, perhaps even a few tears for you sensitive souls. If you liked the first movie, you will love this one. Even if you didn't really like the first movie, this is a perfect flick for anyone. Some of it is a tad scary, but no so much that you couldn't take your kid to see it.

The first film in the trilogy was full of subtle nuances that were ruined by the second film. Every aspect of the first film that entertained the viewers, either by wowing or with humor, was attempted again, and each was more extreme. Ultimately, this movie played more like a live action cartoon than anything else. Where in the first film, the villain was, if not frightening, at the very least impressive and captivating, this film's nemesis was gross, unappealing to the eyes, and unbelievable. In terms of the characters, where Depp seemed to have found his perfect match in Jack Sparrow in the first film, in this one, the writers made his character simpler, less effective, and silly. He had a sheer brilliance to his disregard for everything that is lost in this film. Their attempt to make him the perfect hero that he is not is a sad turn for what was the most captivating character to hit theatres in years. Bloom, on the other hand, seems to have come into his character, and has found an understanding for the part that actually makes him slightly believable. Knightley is a disgrace. Her character was not believable in the first film, and her dialouge was exactly off, and this film is no change. I left the theatre feeling like I wasted my time and money, and I don't think I will even be able to watch the first film again without regretting where I know the series has gone. IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST FILM, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Be happy that Pirates of the Carribbean, Curse of the Black Pearl, is a perfectly independent movie with no need of a sequel.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The acting was superb, the direction was outstanding, the CGI broke records, and the music was excellent. So, imagine my excitement when I learned about DMC. Then, after years of anticipation, extremely negative reviews started to come in. I admit, I was nervous.The critics, as it turned out, were wrong.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" was absolutely AMAZING, and an instant classic in every way. The film both matched and exceeded the first film in every way. Depp surpassed his previous performance. Every character was well acted, particularly (and, surprisingly) Elizabeth and Davy Jones. Verbrinski's direction kept the overall tone light, fun, and made this the best popcorn flick of the summer. Zimmer's score was very different from Badelt's, but it suited the film well.And, finally, The CGI in DMC was fantastic. Davy Jones is without a doubt the greatest CG character ever put to screen. The Flying Dutchman was great, and, most importantly, the Kraken was perfect. If ""Pirates"" does not win an Oscar for make-up or visual effects, I am boycotting the Academy.Simply put, DMC is AMAZING. Ignore the critics, head to the theater, and see the summer's best film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It manages to beat the 'curse' (pun intended) of sequels .The plot is brilliant, the acting is superb. Johnny Depp is sexy and perfect as usual as Jack Sparrow, and is the heart and soul of the movie. Orlando Bloom finds his 'sea legs' in this installment and proves that he is a wonderfully talented actor. I've always liked Bloom, he has so much talent and in PotC:DMC he finally taps into that talent. Kiera Knightly takes charge and is funny and witty despite being sun burned for the majority of the movie. Surprisingly though, Jack Davenport - who I was ecstatic to see returning as Commador Norrington- did a fabulous job serving as both comedic ally and foe. Plus, he is really quite handsome without that silly wig on. The expansive supporting cast does an excellent job too and I was pleased to see so many characters from the original return.The film looks like it used every penny of its multi-million dollar budget. The costumes, makeup, sets, and CGI are flawless.Davy Jones and his crew are extremely creepy and may scare children. Along those same lines, there are numerous scenes of violence that I am surprised passed the ratings board, so be wary if taking young children.A wonderful movie full of laughs, tears, amazing action sequences, and endearing characters. I strongly recommend it and I plan on seeing it again.Also, stay after the credits for an added bonus.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I mean, I understood the need for some parody of the previous movie, but it really was walking the line of nauseating.All in all, I would recommend seeing this movie.

There was no plot, in anyway, and at every glimmer of a plot a new fight scene would be introduced and the plot would become elusive again. Even the talented cast couldn't save this movie. Maybe it's due to the writers that didn't want to write new material and just recycled the jokes from the last movie.

"8","/10","Better than Superman Returns? You bet!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1413391/?ref_=tt_urv","vcyho","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4861384/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2006","Now before everybody starts bombarding me with replies of disgust and disdain, please allow me to justify my heading.First off, when I heard that Pirates was going to be 2 1/2 hours long, I simply groaned. After seeing Superman Returns, which was also of the same duration, I soon developed an aversion towards any Hollywood blockbuster that would dare to go that same length. This is not to say that SR was a bad movie (on the contrary), it simply FELT like 2 1/2 hours. The whole movie could've moved at smoother/faster pace. To my great surprise, Pirates was nothing like SR. For unlike SR, Pirates didn't FEEL like 2 1/2 hours. There was never a boring moment and every scene had a fresh spontaneity to it. Here is why I thought it was more enjoyable: The story to SR was quite formulaic (the hero who does good, the love interest, the villain wanting some form of domination, yadda-yadda). Being such, we already know what the blueprint of the story is going to be. Every scene then begins to feel obligatory. The movie goes through the motion of conveying every clichéd scene that needs to be shown in order to tell the same story...and as a consequence, we have to sit through it and take in the motions. From the scene on the rooftop with Superman and Lois Lane (purpose: to re-assure the audience there is still an interest between the two), to the scene where Lex Luther almost kills Superman (purpose: to build up to the final climax of the movie). As a result, the movie starts to feel bogged down by these conventions, leaving a rather stale feeling. As well, the 2 1/2 hour duration really begins to sink in as we sit through every obligatory boring moment.Pirates, on the other-hand, is not built on a conventional story. Everything is spontaneous, there are surprises left-right-and-center, and the actors are given enough freedom to do whatever they wish with their characters (not simply treat them as prescribed archetypes). As a result, there is never a boring moment! There were so many turns in the story that I actually found myself looking forward to what awaits in the next scene. And what comes next develops into more havoc and hilarity. There was something fresh about this experience that I found exhilarating, making the 2 1/2 hour fly by. As well, the roles were all so delicious and juicy that I found it an absolute treat to watch these actors have fun with them (from Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, and from the comedic duo Lee Arenberg & Mackenzie Crook (Pintel & Ragetti) to the surprise cameo in the end).SR's flaw was that it over-reached: it tried to be an epic film. With that kind of goal and expectation it ended up relying too heavily on prescribed formulas, was too tightly latched onto its linear narrative, and gave us characters who seemed to take their roles and purpose too seriously (though my hats off to Kevin Spacey for giving Lex Luther a humorous edge). Pirates was the opposite. It was all fun from the get go, the narrative was loose enough to take some fun detours along the way, and it felt like the actors were all having one big party. This is what a summer movie is all about! Of course, this is simply my opinion. For a summer movie, I think Pirates 2 fulfilled my entertainment needs and left me eagerly anticipating for Pirates 3 (SR did not).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie starts with Will and Elizabeth getting arrested for helping Jack in piracy, and Will is offered one way to save themselves, get Jacks broken compass. In the meantime Jack gets a visit from ""bootstrap"" Bill Turner that Davy Jones is coming from him. So As Jack always does, he runs from his problems and goes to taratuga. This sets up a great action ride, the best I have seen in years. Like all blockbusters there's a few flaws here and there but nothing to ruin the fun. The KRAKEN stills the movie, and gives some great scenes. Bill Knightly is sooooo great as Davy Jones. You might remember him from ""underworld"" as ""victor."" I'll leave the rest of the movie in your hands, you just really need to see this movie, you wont be disappointed.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The wonderful thing about the Dead Man's Chest is that, although a much darker film with more horrific creatures and fantastic locales, it doesn't abandon the first film's lighthearted adventure and fondness for her characters. I felt as if in the first installment of the franchise, I only hiked up my jeans and took a relaxing walk along the surf. While Dead Man's Chest plunges into the opening shots mysterious sea and gives the audience a much grander, more epic adventure.The downside to Dead Man's Chest is that the action is much more tongue in cheek. The film embraces the absurdity of the subject matter: Pirates who sail mythical seas, telling fantastic tales of treasure and monsters, while boldly challenging their fears for their Lives, Glory, Love and of coarse Riches. The action sequences are so much more elaborate that I fear for the third film, as this embrace of the absurd could easily walk the plank into the depths of cartoon silliness.That being said, of all the summer blockbuster's that have been release in 2006, Dead Man's Chest by far eclipses the rest of the competition. Jack Sparrow is back in fine form, Will Turner remains the idealistic hero, and Elizabeth Swan's character develops in a surprising and refreshing fashion. Hero's step across the line and become Villainous at times, former Villain's become unsavory Allies, and Hollywood adventure on the high seas has never looked better.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This was the second in three films so it set up the third while continuing the story.The basic plot is that Will Turner and his bride to be Elizabeth Swann are arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow's escape. Turner is promised a way to save his beloved if he retrieves a compass from Sparrow. This sets of a series of adventures and back-stabbings that no one could predict, with a stunning climax that will leave movie goers stunned.My only problems with this film were the sexing up of Elizabeth. She shoved her boobs in the face of anyone who would look and practically threw herself @ Jack on the Pearl, while continuing to profess love for Will. My other complaint was the change in the characters interactions. Jack was very protective of Will in the first film and in this one, it appears he is selling him out, but not all is ever as it seems. Will is whiny and bratty, and spends the majority of the film complaining. However, he remembers his bravery later.This is a lot like Empire Strikes Back, where it sets up a chain of events that makes things look bleak for our heroes. I am eagerly anticipating the third installment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The ""stunning visuals"" were (excuse the pun) overboard. The CGI characters were so far-fetched that they made me cringe every time they appeared on screen. The plot seemed to revolve around setting the stage for the third film in this trilogy. And the ending... the ending was infuriating.There were some nice moments from the actors. Johnny Depp is just as funny as before, but with my expectations as high as they were, it didn't seem as wonderful. Bloom and Knightley both had a chance to show off a bit more than in the first film and they did cash in on it.The score is more or less regurgitated from the first film (it was great then, but now it's repetitive). Similarly, much of the comedy involves quotes of the first movie.All in all, I am very disappointed by this movie.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

The comedy by in the Native island Jack's and some other crew were swinging from the giant ball to grad the roots towards freedom,great and funny.And the action by the Duchman's crew fighting some of Jack's crew,and when Will,Jack and Mr.Norrington were fighting over the Duchman's heart.This movie will be the best movie that everyone have ever seen,can't wait for part three,plus two more things.

There is no real need for all of the violence that the audience is forced to watch. Perhaps the filmmakers forgot how many youngsters are devoted to the original? In the first movie, we actually cared about the villains. Even Barbossa had a human side--everyone wanted to see him take a bite out of that apple. The villains in this movie are flat and seem to exist for the sole purpose of showing off flashy special effects.There is no tangible ""plot arc""; in fact, the movie doesn't end at all.

The movie of the summer, I'd imagine. Regardless of whether this thing is going to get good or bad reviews, people are going to go in droves to this thing, and they should.The best parts of the movie were self explanatory, really. For me, and for most people it was Depp again, but I saw that coming. This seemed to be another one of those ""The movie is alright but his performance makes it grand"" thing, only not so much as say Secret Window or the Ninth Gate where he was 'making' those movies completely good. This one had a strong cast, but at the same time had a whole huge load of a supporting cast, and could make anyone paying half attention to the story easily confused (like the person sitting beside me).It had some great CGI things with the evil pirates from Davy Jones' ship, and the little story involved with Will Turner and Bootstrap Bill was introduced quite well, because it gave both the viewer, and the people involved that ""out of nowhere"" feeling, so it was easily identifiable. They do tend to pack a whole crapload into the first hour or so, just to have that 'wrapping up' feeling to make sure that you're following along from the previous film, which seemed to be the same as the first hour of Superman Returns (which was only 4 minutes longer. Howabout that!). But like Superman Returns, the rest of the movie following that hour is smooth sailing until it's hang-ending that you can see coming from a mile away if you're paying full attention to the film and not just staring at Captain Jack and waiting for him to do something funny. Oh, and Keira Knightley's in this movie too. I forgot that. She's cute, and mostly lost in the shuffle behind all of the other massive amounts of characters that are there as a seemingly effortless (but actually not quite) plan of wrapping everything up in the third film.The one thing I do like above everything else about number two is how much darker it was. It wasn't the happy, almost always sunny movie the first movie was, this was something a bit darker, a bit scarier, and a bit uglier. That's how it should be, and they pulled that off beautifully, savvy?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This time, he has a debt to pay. To the devil of the seas, the convincingly slimy Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Once again, the three main characters, Jack, Will (Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth(Keira Knightly), are sent into a wild, crazy adventure involving cannibals, crusty sea men, a giant tentacled behemoth and a beating heart. The excitement is unrelenting, and after two and a half hours, I wanted more. There is a lot of laughs, lots of amazing special effects, and lots of prime popcorn movie material. Jerry Bruickheimer usually delivers great movies, so I was expecting even more than the first Pirates. I did. It was bigger, darker, and everything a sequel should be, easily by favourite sequel since the Two Towers. The surprise ending leaves me waiting impatiently for the third. Great, great movie. I hope Johnny gets credit for his portrayal. He rocks.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The first film in the series was held together by Johnny Depp. This film has fine performances from the entire cast and great scenery, special effects, & fabulous action sequences. Keira Knightly is very good as the female lead trying to marry Orlando Bloom's character who seems to be tied to Captain Jack Sparrow. In this film, these folks are given some good script to work with outside of their interaction with Sparrow. That is what makes the film better than the Curce of The Black Pearl.Yes, this film is long, but even though I was tired when I saw it, I dare you to sleep through it. The plot is too good & the action scenes too good to sleep through. The legends of the sea are used in this one, from Davy Jones Locker to the Flying Dutchman, the images are all richly there. The search for the key to this movie is very entertaining indeed. The action is great, the comedy is great, & I promise you can't sleep through it. This is like riding your favorite roller coaster.Because of the fact there is more action, more balanced acting, more locations, more of everything than the first film, Johnny Depp's performance does not stand out as much in this one as it did in the first one (which is an Oscar Depp deserved more than the person who won it, um what's their name?). Never fear though, Captain Jack Sparrow is still plenty here & does dominate enough scenes to make everyone happy. You will find this film a real pleasure to watch & it is the best family film of 2006, without a doubt.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Having already broken box offices records, this is a worthy sequel to the original film, with all the favourite characters showing up again, and even some brilliant new ones.Bill Nighy as the evil Davy Jones is pinpoint perfect casting and plays the part very well, considering a lot of it was cgi with his costume.If you haven't already seen the film, what are you waiting for.

"8","/10","A great summer movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414238/?ref_=tt_urv","cereneau","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3038864/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2006","Back in 2003, when we really needed a great summer movie to get things going, we got ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a surprising gem of a movie whose magic and fun was only overshadowed by the performance of Johnny Depp and a deep fascination with the beauty of Keira Knightley. The movie pretty much came out of nowhere and took millions of unsuspecting moviegoers by surprise. I, myself, was so amazed by the movie that I went back two more times over the 2 1/2 months that it remained in my theater! So, needless to say, I'm a fan! When I heard that the sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest"" was on its way, I was undoubtedly excited.Then I saw the trailer.To me, the trailer made the movie seem like a hodgepodge of boring CG characters and bad acting from Orlando Bloom (""We have to go back for Jack...OK nevermind""). To say that I was disappointed would be a huge understatement. Furious and skeptical are, perhaps, better descriptors for the rage that consumed my soul. Despite this, I simply had to see the movie for myself, being a huge fan of everything the original movie had to offer.The movie begins, by almost all accounts, poorly. We find good ol' Elizabeth and Will are to be married but are arrested for their involvement in the escape of Jack Sparrow (seen in the original). Will eventually strikes a deal with Cutler Beckett, the operator of the East India Trading Company in Port Royal to go after Captain Jack and bargain with him to return to ensure the safe release of Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Elizabeth escapes, herself, and leaves in pursuit of Will. Jack Sparrow, all the while, is being hunted by the notorious Davy Jones, with whom he has a debt to settle. This is essentially the plot of the story. Stated plainly in a few sentences, it actually takes the movie about 45 minutes to get to this point and this is why the first part of the movie is so dull. There is hardly any action for this period of time, and it's quite painful to sit through. Needless to say, I was regretting my decision to see the movie. However, when it finally picks up, it REALLY picks up.The movie is filled with humor, just like the first, and Johnny Depp's performance is, once again, Oscar-quality (though the magic from the first film has worn off a little). There are numerous humorous references to the first movie, mostly about rum, which are funny at first but eventually wear a little thin. Additionally, most of the funny, quirky characters from the original have returned to serve as comic relief. It really is a fun, if not funny, movie.additionally, the action sequences in ""Dead Man's Chest"" are top notch. Where as the first film essentially involved a lot of sword-fighting and cannon-firing, the writers of DMC rightly made sure to mix things up a little this time around. There are, of course sword fights and cannons (it is, after all, a pirate movie), but there are other circumstances that are happening simultaneously that keep things fun and interesting. Possibly the greatest addition to the action is the kraaken, a giant squid (or octopus. I'm not entirely familiar with the mythological beast.) When it's around, its one of the coolest CG monsters to ever grace the big screen, perhaps even topping those in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Additionally, the kraaken is truly creepy, almost frightening, as it engulfs ships like candy.Another memorable newcomer is Davy Jones, played by Bill Nighy. When I saw the aforementioned trailer, Davy Jones looked ridiculous with his octopus beard. However, I must say that I was really impressed with his character. Nighy does a phenomenal job of making this otherwise plastic character seem utterly real and complex, and his performance is on the level of Depp's. Also, Bootstrap Bill, played by the always great Stellen Skarsgard, is another great character. As it turns out, Bootstrap, who we know died, is enslaved to work on Davy Jones' ship for an undisclosed amount of time. When he encounters his long-lost son, it really is a touching moment, and their relationship is really, at times, captivating. Additionally, the relationship between Will and Elizabeth is more interesting this time, as is the relationship between Elizabeth and Jack.Overall, the movie is nothing more than a popcorn movie; a fun, big, exciting, phenomenal popcorn movie. Anyone going in to see an Oscar-caliber movie is probably going to be disappointed. Pirates of the Caribbean has never sought to be an epic movie like the Lord of the Rings, or other trilogies. It is simply a fun summer movie, one that you will undoubtedly enjoy for years and years to come.Oh, and the aforementioned line in the trailer said by Will, it never actually happens. How about that?Writing: 3 out of 5 Stars Directing: 4 out of 5 Stars Acting: 5 out of 5 Stars Overall: 4 out of 5 Stars","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I believe this movie to be very well done and exciting, definitely better than the first one, and more realistic. Definitely does not ruin the first one, like most sequels do. This just adds on to the creativity of the first one, and makes the series more popular than it ever was. Deifnatly worth the 3 year wait between 1 and 2, and I still remember to this day how I felt when I found out the truth of that amazing ending, that left me hanging off the edge of a cliff, gasping for air no longer in my lungs because I froze on the spot. But I am not going to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it who eventually will. I have explained everything else about these series in my 1st Pirates comment so I am not going to get into too much detail. But the movie was defiantly funnier than the first one, and the acting was a bit better since the actors have a more general idea on who their character is, and what he/she does, and their personality. Take Jack Sparrow for example, everyone loves him dearly because he a good actor, and apparently looks ""hot"" as the role. He seems like the hero to everyone doesn't he? But really he wants everything for himself and wants everything to go his way, even if he does seem like the hero. Don't underestimate him! 10/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, fortunately the film was very entertaining and somewhat different (is it me, or are the characters just a little more wet in this one).The common problem with sequels is that they try to outdo the first one. This is why I still like the first one better, since it felt like a smaller movie. Regardless, I definitely enjoyed the slapstick humour of the first third mainly because they didn't make such a big deal out of it. Just give the people what they want to see in an action film. Funny/crazy stunts.Constant references to the previous film were okay and I was truly surprised at the amount of characters that came back for this film. The ending was a particularly nice surprise. In all the films only weakness is the fact that there is so much going on it makes the film feel rather long and the plot rather messy.

The comic relief is well placed and all funny, the cgi is fantastic, and the story, in my opinion, is solid.If you liked the first movie then this movie will make you very happy, and when it's over you will find yourself counting the days till #3.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The cinema got dark, the movie rolled, and roughly 2 hours later I realized what a letdown the movie really was.My biggest letdown would have to be the story and character writing. Both were just poorly done. Character relationships built in the 1st movie were horribly continued and lacked any real emotional value. And the story moves too slow for too long and its hard to keep any real interest, and the fact that its confusing doesn't really help either. Basically it lacks action.It also overplayed certain elements from the first film, especially the comedy which, good at times, was way too overdone. Certain characters roles were overplayed and just weren't as good.The movie did have a good action sequence at the end and the CGI was pretty incredible on ILM's part, but the poor story really killed this film for me.Just didn't live up to my personal expectations and not near as magical as the 1st film","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow IMDb.com Movie Review: Now I must say that it seems quite unlikely that a swishy-buckled character like the Capt. Jack Sparrow could ever earn the allegiance of a crew of crusty old salts who fancy themselves Pirates. But this is a Hollywood MOVIE, not a recruiting film for the U.S. Navy or His Majesty's Fleet. Given that caveat, among myself and a flock of friends who went to see ""Chest"" last night, it could be said that, ""A good time was had by all."" If you want to see the movie, I'd dare say, that's all you need to know. Go & enjoy it. To me, it was slightly romantic; somewhat imaginative; and a bit choppy in plot & editing. But it has great sense of humour. ... Enjoy it as it is. That's right, I did NOT see the first ""Pirates"", but that didn't seem to matter. And, yes, there is ample evidence that a sequel is in the offing. Another take it or leave it proposition. I recently saw ""Click"" and found that to be more cause for thought or reflection.  If you want cerebral, read a book. If you want a swishy-buckled Captain, Jack Sparrow will swoop you off your feet. Depp's Devil doesn't wear Prada, but he looks like he'd like to ! ... 8/10. Cliff Hall+++.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But there were a few greay areas in the movie. and also the what was the deal with Elizabeth and Jack (does she have a crush on him) and what makes the tribal think that jack is their god. Also to mention that the movie has lost its charm from the first one.Captain Jack and his crew set sail, this time around, toward a course that'll lead them to an all-important chest, that only Jack knows the meaning of. The content within that chest happens to tell the sad story of one Davey Jones and his lost lady of the sea. But in order for Jack to get to the heart of things, so to speak, he must enlist the unwilling help of both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, yet again. With their assistance not only does Jack learn a valuable lesson in doing the right thing, but Jack ends up, unintentionally, leading both Elizabeth and Will down a path to their deepest desires.The special effects were great and 80% of the movie is special effects. The production values were brilliant and coming from Mr. Bruckheimer you always know it won't disappoint you.But I still don't regret watching the film and would also recommend to everyone else.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I really loved how Davy Jones and his doomed crew began to take the form of various sea creatures like hammerhead sharks, crabs, etc. I love all the characters and this movie picks up right where the last one left off. It seemed to be a bit darker than the first one and may be a bit too scary for the really young ones. Still, I highly recommend this if you're looking for a fun popcorn flick.

I knew they were shooting it like LOTR but i didn't know the sequels were gonna be like that. If you haven't seen the movie you will be shocked at the cliffhanger ending.

This time he owes an unpaid blood debt to Davy Jones played brilliantly by Bill Nighy. While Will and Elizabeth are arrested by the East India Trading Company lead by the villainous Lord Beckett. Lord Beckett then sends Will off to get Jacks compass in exchange for freedom. All the stars return for Pirates 2, with Mr Gibbs adopting a much bigger role. Jack Sparrow is more the centre of interest, with Will and Elizabeth holding far more Supporting roles with Jack and Davy Jones taking big roles. Commador Norrington has a much changed part in the film, yet bigger than Pirates 1. The size of the film is much bigger than Pirates 1. With the lifelike approach to Davey Jones Kraken, a large octopus like animal which drags ships down to their watery grave. A sword fight in a giant moving wheel between Jack, Will and Norrington is also extremely spectacular and comical in several ways. Even the special effects on Davey Jones tentacle face make him look menacing. Pirates 2 also brings many things from the first movie which Pirates fans will like to see. For example Barbosa's monkey is now on Jacks Black Pearl. The movie ends very much on a point making you wait a little under a year for Pirates 3: At World's End due May 25h 2007. A brilliant film which definitely supports the original.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Most of the old gang is back here,particularly the principals. The high-bred-but-wild-child-at-heart Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley,as willowy and yet athletic as ever)finds her wedding date with the valiant Will Turner(Orlando Bloom,willow-er...attractive and athletic as ever)interrupted by an arrest warrant being served her and him,in regards to their complicity in letting one Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp,skanked up,dandied and devilish as ever)escape the Royal Navy's authority. It seems that the only way the two can escape the gallows for this high crime against Queen and country is to make a deal with the magistrate(Tom Hollander),which has them destined to twine ways with the nefarious Captain,who's got his own agenda to attend to. It seems he's managed to draw the ire of none other than fearsome Pirate legend and demonic troll Davy Jones(Bill Nighy in heavy,heavy makeup and rubber),who has a very dear price he wants the Captain to pay. This while Jack himself seeks something of the Captain's:namely,the legendary Dead MAn's Chest,which beats the heart of old Jones.The movie has exactly what you'd expect of it,particularly if you saw the first film: sword fights,rocking,jarring physical effects,quick banter,a few plot twists and a few touches of the supernatural. Only this time,the physical comedy,which was a side compliment to last films good-natured sense of adventure,now takes front seat as the adventure becomes the under-pinning of this at-sea endeavor. This movie is every bit the summer entertainment that it is meant to be. Indeed,I'm not sure what more I--or anyone,for that matter--could really expect of it. It moves at a great pace and only starts to feel like it's running a little long toward the very end. The costuming,make-up and scenery is great escapist fun,and the performances by Depp(to the point that it feels like tedium to even mention),Nighy,Mackenzie Cook and Lee Arenberg(as the comic relief)and Knightley make this movie seem authentic enough that you can taste the rum. It may not be the best movie you'll see this year or this summer,I dare you to find one that sets up just a great look,feel and sound that comes anywhere close to living up to its potential the way this film,the second directed by the eclectic Gore Verbinski,does.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm tempted to make the excuse that to follow a film as good as the first, is well, an almost impossible task. having said that, Star Wars were able to pull it off.I left the cinema feeling somewhat disappointed, but a week later, whilst reflecting on the movie, I think they did a good job. Its clear that this film was laying out the playing field for the third film, and i'm OK with that.Great action, and as per usual, Johnny Depp is fantastic. I thought Orlando Bloom put in a good comedic performance, something I had not seen from him before.Overall, i think it was a very good film, and holds a worthy place in the trilogy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The stunts were awesome and unique. The makeup of the actors on the Flying Dutchman ship was unbelievable. The movie was adventuresome and funny. They could not have picked a better lineup of actors to play the characters. I do have one comment. The dog that carries the key in his mouth ended up running on the beach with the crusty old pirates chasing him. I hope they bring his character back. Afterall, he is part of the Pirates exhibit at Disney. Cannot wait till movie 3. Liked it better than movie 1. I did have to buy my tickets online all movies were sold out. Will be making a trip to DisneyWorld to see the new changes to Pirates of the Caribbean in 2 months. Can't wait.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are quite of few sword fights that make you think ""Count of Monte Cristo"". But it's not all action in this movie there is plenty of story to munch down on. The use of foreshadowing in this film is just extraordinary. You think something is going to happen, but ironically another thing does. If you have ever seen Disney's ""Tron"" you may be familiar with this film element. The ending leaves you hanging for the third film it keeps you coming back for more. Honestly, I couldn't finish my popcorn and soda because this film kept me on the edge of my seat. (Yes, it was that exciting)Anything with Buena Vista is awesome. Wait until after the credits people. There is an extra scene. Pay close attention to the movie and it'll mean a lot to you.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie was trying to get too many little things going all at once in too little time. The story line was too convoluted and did not live up to the original. A lot more 'action' and quite a bit of 'gross-out' so if your into that, this will be a great movie... If you want to see a smooth storyline in a movie that has a point, this movie probably isn't for you.Although, harshness aside, we'll have to wait until the third movie is released before I can pass final judgement on the series overall.Oh and make sure you sit through the credits to see the Mr. Depps Assistant, and the Payroll accountant.

I just about sat on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. I loved hearing the theatre fill up with laughter, and I almost fell out of my seat a couple of times. Some parts with Johnny are just the funniest things that i have ever heard. Also there are parts that the directors did change lines within. Ohhh tricky tricky they are.

Davy Jones well what more do you have to say than that half squid half crab and a Scottish accent. Tia Delmar was great very very seductive character with comedy thrown in as well plus brains.

I have never seen more attempts at grandeur fall so flat. They threw the baby out with the bath water on this one.This movie was mostly a 2 and 1/2 hour blur for me. There were times I could not even make out the dialog, much less follow the action scenes wet with stuff that cost too much to cut. It was WAY too long.Was this movie intended to be silly or serious? I found it overall, incoherent. Perhaps I am one of the few who just did not 'get it' (or one of the few that did not see the emperor's new clothes). It had some humorous but overtly silly moments that made me laugh. It was rarely engaging.The special effects were over-the-top, and in many instances, first rate. On the other hand, there were many scenes where the green screen was so obvious, I could figuratively puke. Aside from the expensive eye candy, this film did nothing for me. All told, maybe 20 minutes of entertainment at too high a cost.This movie just goes out of its way to WOW you, but I keep thinking... 'what is going on?'. Perhaps the fact that the preceding movie took flight from my brain years ago might have contributed to this lack of understanding (that movie wasn't all it was cracked-up to be either). Still... should this movie not stand on its own? I also think that this movie could be scary for children. Even as an adult, I found the characters aboard Davy Jone's ship somewhat disturbing. Not exactly stuff you market under the Disney brand (except for the silly stuff). I won't even address the racial biases this movie inadvertently promotes.I will not fault Johnny Depp for participating in this atrocity, as he has already been grandfathered into the franchise. It is always fun to watch him, and he contributes some to the limited entertainment value of this film.I expect that many movie goers who saw this on the big screen walked out with stars spinning around their heads... thinking they had seen a tremendous blockbuster. Really, they were just inundated with incoherent WOW and knocked over, not realizing that they had bumped their heads.If you can, give it a miss. It will be time well not spent.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This is not one of those times. Disney doesn't always mess up. (That's a big surprise!) Dead Man's Chest deals with the search for Davy Jones and a missing key to a chest, but no one knows what key or what chest. I enjoyed the characterizations and the casting was impeccable. Cinematography and special effects are very much on par with the first Pirates of the Caribbean. You must see the first one before you see this one. Otherwise, all the references to the first movie will be over your head. Don't worry about that, though. The first one was great. Enjoy this one with your kids (might want to view it first for violence and some adult situations.) It was great to see the actors from the first movie repeat their performances in this one. I'm looking forward to the 3rd (and final?) Caribbean when it comes out in May 2007. Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance again! I hope they can carry this on to the final one.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Truly, they had an easy audience with me, as I was set to enjoy the film, no matter what. I simply couldn't imagine myself disliking it - and, on the whole, I didn't. It is a good movie and definitely worth seeing. However, I've got to sadly admit that I was a bit disappointed with the film. Really, the only problem with it was the storyline. The acting, the visuals, everything else was great, but the story was problematic. I understand that being the middle part of a trilogy automatically makes it a ""bridge"" film, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't have stood on its own. However, as they have written it, it is simply all a lead-in to the third film. Additionally, the story keeps moving from point A to B to C to D, and on and on, without any build-up or time to contemplate what's just happened - in other words, it's a bit confusing. I could, and would, readily forgive all that, but the major problem was, as another reviewer put it, the characters (and by that I, basically, mean Jack and Elizabeth) we knew from the first film aren't always present in the sequel. It's a much darker film, with Jack constantly betraying everyone, and I won't even make an attempt at explaining Elizabeth's behavior in this film that is so at odds with everything her character thought, felt, and displayed in the first Pirates. With that said, it was, nevertheless, a good film. It just doesn't live up to the original. However, I am hoping for redemption of characters and a return to the feeling of the first film in Pirates 3.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Oh my gosh! Pirates of the Caribbean! Everyone is squirming in there seats now.. they only have to wait three months. But the question was, will it really be THAT great? Finally. The day comes and we're off to the theaters the minute we wake up.When the movie starts, hope will slowly start to shave off you. You're not too sure it's going to satisfy you like you hoped, but you continue to watch and give it a shot.And you leave the theater satisfied.Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest is an amazing and epic sequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl. The movie is just as good as the first, if not better. After watching Dead Man's Chest, I've already made plans to see the final edition of trilogy.The movie is quite long, but nonetheless entertaining. I've seen three to five hour long movies that just seem to drag on at incredibly slow rates. You sit there through some parts that seem to have no point and are unable to contribute to the main point. This film, however, will keep you locked in your chair, whether or not your body needs a restroom break.The new edition is better than the first, in my opinion. More imagination is thrown in and stronger characters are delivered by the cast. More humorous and suspenseful than the first, and the animation is wonderful.Dead Man's Chest IS what you've been waiting for. It IS the super sequel to the super hit, The Curse of the Black Pearl. It WILL satisfy your lust for another insane and epic adventure with humorous Captain Jack Sparrow, trustworthy William Turner, and bold Elizabeth Swann. Of course, we can't forget about all the other incredible characters.Dead Man's Chest won't let you down. Get ready to view the sequel you've desired for so long.Excellent. A ten out of ten.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is awesome, Sparrow plays his great, having that just right mix of evil and good to complement his character.Some parts are a little scary if you are with young children or skittish people. Some things jump out and some characters are kind of scary for little kids. Overall it wasn't to bad, but a little graphic in the violence.The acting was great and you had to love Knightley in this movie. I would pay to see this movie again as I loved it so much. Depp just makes you loves his character toward the end even more than usual.Only thing i didn't like was that if you didn't see the first movie you would be a little confused.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It had everything you would expect in a sequel. The fight scenes were really intense and the creativity put into them showed. The movie was full of laughs as Jack (Depp) has you laughing the entire time. Depp really makes the movie and he single handedly stole the show. As the ad's says jacks back and thats exactly the truth. If you enjoyed the first movie you will be sure to love this one. Though i do suggest that you watch the first one before you go because if you are like me and haven't seen the first one in a while you wont pick up on certain things. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and it leads you right into the third movie which looks to follow the lead of the first two into the great movie spotlight. It has some big shoes to fill. I gave it a 10 because it gave me everything i was looking for and more. I can honestly say this movie is funnier than some of the comedies i have seen in the past few years. So head to your local theater I'm sure you will not be disappointed it is a grade a film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really thought it was going to be horrible, or at least not as good as the first. But I was pleasantly surprised. Pirates from start to end had the more mature theme that was lacking in the first one. Now for the three of you who haven't seen it yet it still is appealing to children, maybe a bit scary at times, but it has its funny moments. This is another winner for Depp and the whole crew. While the ending may make most of the world mad I liked it and I do highly recommend this movie as one of the best this summer.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved it I was shocked at the suspense. Johnny Depp is like, almost the best pirate there is. ELizabeth Swann/Keira Knightley looks more appropriate in this movie. Will turner/Orlando Bloom has yet again succeeded in a great role. The ending is great and I liked it a lot. This could be the best Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet to come. I knew that it would be as good as the previews. In my opinion, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley,and Orlando Bloom have done many great movies.

This felt odd to begin with but that was soon forgotten as the story took hold. From daring fight scenes to sidesplitting fruit skewers the actions rarely stops, perfectly galloping along with a pulsating Hans zimmer score. It did drag out a little by the end but I feel this movie will be best judged as part of the trilogy hence the talk of this being the cousin to 'empire strikes back' and The Two Towers'.Oh and i almost forgot.......Johnny Depp is a Joy......like you were expecting anything else!Now where did i put the rum!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest falls into the usual pitfalls of sequels. It forgets about character development and having a plot that sticks together (there isn't one except for the fact that everyone wants to get their hands on the chest). Instead (in a typical Hollywood fashion) the director thinks that enough special effects will bedazzle the audience. Johnny Depp wasn't funny, both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom's acting was weak to say the least, and the virtually non-existent story line was very predictable. If you want to watch two hours of sword fighting with dead seamen from the deep, then this is the film for you. Otherwise if you are over 22 years old and have a brain, then I am sure there are plenty of more interesting things you can do with the time.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

(While I loved the movie, please don't get me started on the whole adding Jack Sparrow to the attractions in Florida and California, thus ruining tradition and memories of childhoodit just hurts too much.) In the world of Hollywood today, we all knew that that success would lead to a franchise. It's a good thing that the filmmakers seemed to of had the same amount of fun as the audience because they are all back for more. People shouldn't be misinformed about this movie either, as it is the first part of a simultaneously shot two sequel setwhich one should know if they have turned on a television set these past two years, however, with the grumblings of ""I can't believe I paid 7 bucks for a trailer"" by theatergoers after my screening, maybe reality TV really is ruining our youth. Anyways, the film does not have a clear-cut ending, but instead a fantastic cliffhanger for the next installment. Believe me now; if it's as fun and entertaining as this one, we are in for a fantastic trilogy.Johnny Depp is back embodying the pirate we love most. All his eccentricities are there along with the sharp wit and sarcasm. He plays off Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth deftly and surely with amusing banter and bickering between the three. There are times when Bloom and Knightley falter, he not really impressing me in much other than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven and her lapsing in parts where her reaction shots seem like she has broken character and is just slyly smiling at those speaking to her like it was a dead take. Depp however never breaks stride and proves once again to be the best character actor in Hollywood despite everyone's desire to make him a leading man. His search for the key to the ""Dead Man's Chest"" again leads Jack along to save himself from revenge by those he's betrayed, while also leading him on a path to have an opportunity of redeeming himself and proving his friends' thin faith that his heart is true as warranted.The supporting players do a wonderful job throughout the film as well. Stellan Skarsgård is great as ""Bootstrap"" Bill, Bloom's Will's father. Actors like him bring credibility to an adventure movie, as this performance proves. While brief, he plays an integral part to the plot and surely will have more screen time in the third film. Jack Davenport shows some range as a beaten man looking for redemption, a welcome contrast to his confident and regal Commodore Norrington from the Curse of the Black Pearl. It's a shame he isn't used more in US cinema as he always gives a good performance; we always have his British work like the seldom seen stateside, but quite good miniseries, ""Ultraviolet."" The fight scene between Depp, Davenport, and Bloom is a highlight of the film and never grows old, even when it appears like it should. Naomie Harris also does a nice job as the creepy, otherworldly mystic our band of pirates seek wisdom from. Our real-scenestealer, however, is Bill Nighy as the villain Davy Jones. Even under the massive amounts of CGI animation, we are still given a brilliant performance. All his facial ticks and expressions are apparent and even if one didn't recognize his voice, you could still tell who is playing him. Anyone who has seen him in Shaun of the Dead and especially Underworld, where he plays his vampire Viktor much the same way as Jones here, will know what I mean.As far as the effects go, the CGI is almost impeccable. The work done on the crew of the Flying Dutchman is amazing, with each actor having computer work mapped over their bodies. The sea-life textures are realistic and rival the effects work done on the cursed crew from the first film. Even the monstrous Kraken is rendered well. There are instances where it appears a tad cartoonish wrapping it's tentacles around ships, but the detail and sliminess of them close up is nice. One scene in particular is bad though, where a character towards the end faces the mouth of the monster. Our view is from behind the person looking at the gaping orifice, to see a flat wall. The feel is totally of a green screen as all sense of depth is dissolved. This instance is salvaged almost instantly, though, by the next cut, to a three- quarters view, where we are allowed to see the tentacles and teeth in defined planes of perspective in relation to the character, resulting in one of the best computer generated shots of the movie.Even though Dead Man's Chest does get darker and more gruesome than its' predecessor, director Gore Verbinski and his writing team retain everything from the original that worked and begin to build upon it. While one can't really judge this film quite yet without seeing the finale that awaits, it is still obvious that it delivers on all its promises. We are treated with an entertaining adventure film with all the trimmings: great acting, great writing, humor, romance, and superbly choreographed swashbucklin' action. It all culminates with an appropriately surprising cameo appearance, readying us and whetting our appetite for At World's End in May of next year.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Ever. It surpassed the original with better special effects, more sinister characters, more violence, more plot twists, and a somewhat darker story. Jerry Bruckheimer has never let his audiences down. Even before his work with Pirates of the Caribbean, remember his stellar direction of the movie The Rock? He has always given his movies his signature trademark of the movie generally kicking ass. I definitely suggest going to see this movie, even if you're not a Disney or pirate fan. This is the only PG-13 rated Disney movie ever to be released, as for good reason. The usual colorful Disney cliché is replaced with some realistic violence, more so in Dead Man's Chest than in the Curse of the Black Pearl. And yes, the plot twists are monumental. I'm not a spoiler, so I won't say anything, but let's just say I was rather surprised at the conclusion. The only thing I will spoil is, stay after the credits for a short yet somewhat comical scene. All in all, I'm going to make this short and to the point. SEE THIS MOVIE.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Although watching this movie was a definite throwback to some of the old time Disney fare, and reminded me a bit of my childhood in movie theatres on a Saturday afternoon. Pirates was not quite as good as the dated but charming Swiss Family Robinson (1959, was it?), but it was about as bad as the dreadful Fitzwilly (1967).Visiting Disneyland, you see rubber rocks in the faked-up 'wilderness' area. How hard would real rocks be to get? Disney movies are equally prone to the fake, when audiences would probably accept the real, even if the real stuff was flawed. This shows a tremendous disrespect for the audience on Disney Studio's part. As an example of the weird moral 'logic' Disney CAN at times stoop to, consider Pretty Woman--- about a hooker who meets Mr. Right and strikes it rich. The moral lesson of that Disney flick, evidently, was that only money matters, and having some cash to flash, and a trendy wardrobe, automatically makes you a person worthy of social position and respect.Pirates has some moments that are interesting. But as you've probably heard, it's all flash, and no substance. There is no love, no romance, no likable characters we are rooting for. Nothing in the movie really matters. And some of the bits are so gruesome, gross, and ugly that I feel tainted merely by having seen them on the screen.This movie is like being shown some old lady's button collection. Some of the bits are pretty, some interesting. Some ugly, many are dull and plain. But they don't add up to anything at all. When you're done looking at the buttons, you have nothing. Not even a rag doll or a simple garment. Just the experience of having handled somebody else's second-hand buttons.Pirates of Caribbean, Deadman's Chest, is vapid at best, and immoral and a shameful waste of talent and resources at worst.

The opening sequence is visually stunning and beautiful and it didn't let up for the whole movie. The special effects, as in the last movie, were wonderful leaving the audience completely at ease to validate and believe what they are seeing. The story has so many twists and turns it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Lots of surprise visits from past characters!! The end is hardly an end at all, leaving most things WIDE open for the third installment. Stay past the end credits if you have time, but the ""extra"" scene isn't as good as the first movie's was. As before, the acting is phenomenal. The depth in Knighly's performance as well as Blooms is strengthened by the end which is really needed considering the circumstances. Depp's acting was wonderful but I was unable to see growth in character from the last movie; not a bad thing, but noticeable against the growth in the other lead actors. If you loved the first movie, you'll love the second. Definitely was worth going to the midnight showing for!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'm somewhat at a loss to understand why this sequel has evoked a nearly opposite reaction.Except to say- the jokes both visual and verbal seemed somehow patronizing and ill -timed. The ingredients and timbre of the 1st film with it's blend of one liners, humor and expected pirate myths- sailing in a ship built out of salvaged parts of a host of films from several genres and vintages has lost it's compass here. If it is the same formula- then I have no explanation for why I liked the 1st film to begin with, or why it worked magic at the box office. It may well be that those who did not like the original, may like this one very well. It is also likely that fans of the Pirates of the Caribbean; Curse of the Black Pearl may well embrace this one as well- for all the reasons I find it forced, and way off course They may find it entertaining. I also think it gave in to some common ""rules"" and lazy ones at that. ( It was how they broke all the rules in Curse of the Black Pearl that made it so fresh and charming) Dead Mans Chest is doing the fashionable- kiss the sexy pirate- divide the lovers with the lowest common denominator, and roll so much video -game action that no has time to think if any of it is actually truly enjoyable storytelling.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Your in for a treat, I can see why the makers of Superman Returns wanted to get a head start at the box office over this.The action is top notch, great sword fighting with creative use of the setting much like in the first one, the special effects had that big movie feel, yet they were subtle and natural. Seeing the portrayal of Davy Jones was especially good, and once again Johnny Depp delivered with an amazing performance. In addition to the action the humor was sprinkled throughout and gave the audience good laughs to keep us involved.

I guess it was hard for the effects team to top the undead moonlit creative genius from the first film.I also didn't like the fact that this film doesn't end. You will have to actually see the 3rd film to get to the denouement of the plot. Similar to the ending moments of Back to the Future 2, but not nearly as satisfying. As a matter of fact the ending of this film raises more questions than it answered. Though I may skip the the third film out of spite.

So I dived into it straight away. Glad to say that Dead Man's Chest lived up to its expectations and I found it to be better than Curse Of the Black Pearl. Jhonny Depp's performance as the enigmatic Capt Jack Sparrow is the reason why he is fast becoming one of my favourite anti-heroes as this time him and his crew get into more trouble this time with a super-natural , hideous looking foe known as Davey Jones with whom Sparrow had some business dealings and well its time to pay the paper! There are non-stop action and laughs through out this one so thusly it is difficult to pick a favourite moment however the action and violence had been taking up a notch which to be honest was great! and even a little bit or gore to keep everyone satisfied. I was glad to say that all the cast came together and worked together really well, you also so some more character development on various other members of the crew and no silly little sub-plots firing all over the place. The SFX were great and the not to mention the make-up of Bill Nighy who was totally unrecognisable! My only complaint was that it was a little too long and it does require committed watching but with the surprise ending I assure you it will be worth . To conclude Dead Man's Chest is defiantly a great summer time film to check out as it thrills, makes you laugh and entertains you , I just hope At Worlds End will be just as good if not better !DEAD MAN'S CHEST 8.3 OUT 10JACK'S BACK !!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects are over the top, the characters are caricatures (or cardboard cutouts) and the length is way over the top.

I was such a die-hard fan of the first one.Now after having seen it, I am a little mixed on how good it was. In it's own self, It was very good. But compared to the first, it was so different, and not comparable to the first.Although, if you did not see the first one, you will be totally lost in the second one. The only problem with the second one is that Verbinski (director) not only thinks you have seen the first one, but have scrutinized every little detail of the movie. Now, I am not afraid to admit that I have done that, so I saw every little ""inside"" joke that was out there. Another thing I did not like, was in the trailer and some other reviews they made the movie almost cheery and fun, but no. The film is much darker than the first. More gruesome and far darker. Although in it's darkness, come the funniest Jokes that you will laugh out loud to, and pretty hard in some scenes.The greatest thing was that the characters of Elizabeth and William are far more developed, or so it seems to me. What really surprised me was that William Turner had a bigger part in this movie, and you got to see a darker side of him. It gave much more depth to his character than before. Elizabeth also shows some of her dark side. Now I can't give to much away or I will ruin the biggest surprise at the ending. All I am going to say is, There is going to be hell to pay in the third movie.I thought Captian Jack Sparrow was a total ass in the second, even more so than in the first one. Compare the first and second, Jack was a noble hero almost compared to him in the second!!! There were many times I just wanted to slap him and yet, I just could't help but laugh, and enjoy all of his antics. You defiantly see a side of these characters you never thought existed. I was surprised, but not totally.When you go to see the second movie, try not to compare how good or bad it is to the first. But keep it in mind, instead. You may really enjoy it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not only that, but we were also introduced to some fantastic new characters, including Vanilla Will's dad, Bootstraps Bill Turner, the voodoo lady Tia Dalma, and of course, the unforgettable Mr. Fishface, Davy Jones, played expertly by Bill Nighy.Speaking of Davy Jones, let's talk about the effects of this film. Even though it was released 14 years ago, the effects are still breathtakingly real and hold up incredibly well. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones looked so real that people thought he was wearing prosthetics, but that's just how expert the CGI is. The Kraken is also a sight to behold. Normally, I'm a practical effects kind of person, but the CGI in this film is expertly done.However, I do have an issue with the story being needlessly convoluted. While it's not as complicated as a Transformers sequel, it's still overly complicated. Despite that, I respect what Gore Verbinski and the writing team were going for. They were trying to create a full world of pirates and other fun creatures/people while using real pirate mythology.Overall, this is another fantastic entry into the Pirates franchise. It's a very enjoyable film that expands on this incredibly cool fictional universe.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having said that I thought the first film was good too.This film contained a lot of ""monsters"", far more than the first film and to be honest, I was surprised that the film didn't have a higher classification than it does. When I was a kid I would have had nightmares for weeks due to some of these horrific creations but it seems that kids are much more tougher nowadays. The special effects were great, especially the tentacles on Bill Nighy's ""octopus"" character.If there is one criticism to be made then it would be, for me, that the movie went on a bit too long. I'm not a very big fan of long movies and it has to be something extremely special to hold my interest for more than 100 minutes or so and this film only just managed to keep me watching to the end. I'm glad I did though. It's not that the film was boring, it's just that I find it really tough to sit still for so long and hold my attention.On this evidence, I strongly hope that there will be a third film.Great!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

POTC Dead Man's Chest was a tremendous thriller, with action every where you look. What makes it so different from the first, is the lack of comedian laughs. Which for this movie is a good thing. This was a much darker movie than the first, with characters (especially Depp) showing much different sides of their characters. The actors again take to their parts perfectly, even maybe a bit more perfectly than the first. The CGI effects were fantastic, and the sequences were unbelievable. Lots of new lovable characters appear in this movie. This movie still has some laughs, but you won't laugh the whole time like last time. It's a better movie, with less laughs. And after seeing it, you'll be glad the 3rd movie is coming in less than a year.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed this one as well... until the ending.Someone who hasn't seen the original will be able to enjoy it, but won't get some of the jokes. However, if you loved Johnny Depp in the first one, you can expect to laugh at his genius once again.I relate this trilogy to the Matrix Trilogy. The first one rocked... the second one was OK, but wasn't meant to stand alone. I am not a fan of movies that obviously are set ups for another movie. Plus this movie is 2 1/2 hours long. Hopefully the third will complete this series and no one will remember being upset at a cliff hanger ending.But like the other guy, I didn't pay to see it. So my opinion might not match someone who had to pay. I'll be interested to hear others' reviews.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The end was horrible for anyone like me to see, as now i have to see the third one next year.A definite date for my diary.Johnny Depp has always been a favourite of mine and hasn't dampened my spirits in this film, his acting, his looks his humour all showed through in the movie and was really as exciting to watch as he is to look at! So anyone that even slightly liked the first 'Pirates Of The Carbbean', must watch the second( and the third next year of course)unless you really want to miss out on a fantastic experience!10/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the back stories of Will and his father, and the denizens of the of the Flying Dutchman. Very cool! Highly recommended! But, also, tell me.....there's a scene in the early part of the movie when the characters are standing outside on the balcony in Port Royale (I think).

Therefore I cannot give a fair comment on the film. However, I found nothing to keep me awake. I could care less about the characters or the plot premise, they had no substance. This action movie had no action at all. Which is great if you need something to zone out to while you are in bed trying to catch up on some sleep. Actually I was hoping for something entertaining and with a good fight scene here and there. For the next Pirates movie they should choose a new director and hire writers.The only good thing was the special effects but that magic only lasts 10 minutes tops. Because without a nice story and characters you can connect with, the special effects do not mean much","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie has many action scenes and many interesting scenes. Jack is so nice character because he makes me laugh and his fighting scene is so cool. It begins the end game and I thought that the scene that found a treasure chest was the most interesting because many people fight to make a treasure chest one's one. I sat out the scene. To see a fight scene, I thought that Elizabeth is a great girl. I thought Ragetti and a combination of Pintel were very interesting. I think you will like them.

Dialog or scenes that were funny the first time around were not funny a second time. I wanted to enjoy and tried hard, but could not. It was confusing, complicated, hard to follow, and took a long time to set the stage before the story really got started. It had a corny element, an almost Harry Potter magic (I like Harry Potter, but not in this movie), and had some lame attempts at humor. Captain Sparrow's humor was over used. He was much more funny in the first movie - with just the right dose. It has a few redeeming moments and a few surprises, which are good. It was way too long. I found myself sitting there wondering when a long and repetitive scene would end. The ending is a set up for part 3, which is OK.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I have also read that this movie was a little cliché, but I disagree.. the action towards the end is a cliffhanger! A MUST SEE.. It makes you want to watch the third installment.The story also is decent, but the only reason I did not give this movie 10 on 10 is because of 2 flaws in the story.. Here they are: 1) Will turner goes hunting for capt Jack Sparrow to save Elizabeth Swann from prison, but 10 mins after he leaves, she is released very easily. So when she could be released so easily, why did will turner have to go hunting for jack sparrow??? 2) How did the Black Pearl suddenly get trapped on the island?? that one totally comes out of the blue!! And co-incidentally, will turner finds capt jack sparrow and the rest of the crew on that deserted island.. A little far fetched if you asked me.But anyhow, if you are not that choosy about movies, I am sure that you will overlook these and the movie is well worth an eight on ten if not more. You can see that a lot of effort went into making this movie and make no mistake, I will be watching the third installment coming next year! Bottomline... this movie is quite good and one for the entire family. Easily the best movie of 2006 thus far.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can see why people love ""Pirates"" in which Johnny Depp plays the bumbling pirate Jack Sparrow who has escaped death in the beginning of the movie while being searched by Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom. Will wants to find Jack in telling him that the soldiers from the first movie have kidnapped Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and want to trade in a deal that if Jack gives himself up, Elizabeth could go free. More surprises come along the way with Jack wanting to find the heart of Davy Jones where William finds out that he has a father who is a slave to the monstrous beast. Meanwhile Elizabeth escapes her prison thanks with the help of her father where she searches for Will in the seas disguised as a pirate herself.While the special effects is the standout of the film giving most dead pirates and creatures life, the reason why Pirates of the Caribbean 2 works is because of Johnny Depp's charisma in this movie. I'll get a chance to see the first film but this film will stand out as a reason for me to love Jack Sparrow and the adventures.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, despite that, it was stunning. The visuals looked spot on, the spirit of the first film was kept alive, and the introduction of Davy Jones is a gem to the film.As with the first, I was blown away, and ready to see this film again. I did have my gripes though, as will others. I still think that in the overall story, the First POTC is better. It's a given. Dead Man's Chest does indeed have more action, but it lacks the tightness of the first movie's plot. Though another spectacular, yet more eccentric performance by Depp, whose Jack Sparrow is one of the main reasons for these movies being as good as they are, Elizabeth's character seems flawed, or the creators of the film might be taking a different direction than anticipated with her. Not going to spoil it, but when you see it, you'll know what I mean, and question: What the hell?Though the plot was slightly weak, some of the dialogue a little sloppy overall, the movie is definitely a popcorn flick. It's funny that every time I see either of these POTC movies, I am in awe, and despite the shortcomings of greatness that there could be in them, I don't really care because of how fun they are to watch. And, to add to that enjoyment is Davy Jones, who honestly made the film for me. After seeing Dead Man's Chest, I again had the time of my life.So...rope up a couple sea-turtles lads, strap your boots on, and go see Dead Man's Chest. You won't regret it.

The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. But... um! That's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You learn of Davey Jones's past, a little more about Jack, Bootstrap, and Norrington's past(after the first movie that is). They also hate the plot because it's so called ""Just another plot randomly made up so they can do a sequel!"" So was Spiderman2, Shrek 2 and upcoming 3 and 4, Superman Returns, all of the Tim Burton Batman's, LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc. etc.But this is good, the plot is excellent, Jack's struggle to save his soul from Davey Jones comes in a series of funny, and serious events.Also Will's struggle to save Elizabeth from the gallows and free his father's soul from the Flying Dutchman.And Norrington trying to return to the Navy... it ends up in a fight!And they open up the chest when they find it and who gets it? Find out...The heart of Davey Jones give anyone who wields it the power to control the sea, so Jack wants it to rule the sea so he can roam freely as a pirate, and rid of the East India Trading Co. etc. with Elizabeth at his side as his Queen.Will wants to stab it to free his father's soul from Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman.Norrington in Tortuga, met Mercer Beckett's assistant and received a message that if he brings him the Compass of jack to Beckett, he'll get his job back... only in a higher rank, Admiral to the East India Trading Co.So they end up fighting for the key, on Isla Cruces, NOT ISLA DE MUERTA! Sorry a guy wrote a fan fiction where the chest was on Isla De Muerta...And Jack open's the chest and takes the heart... but what happen's next?FIND OUT!! So the score was great, and the acting was really good, one of the best parts was the cinematography! It was good! And the choreography, and the make-up really good. So pretty much this movie looks to me like it's going to be 2006's most popular!Just remember critics this is a Summer, popcorn flick, not a major epic, just something for fun...10/10!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This gave me very high expectations for the second. For much of it, I was awestruck and, for a while, thought it was better than the first. However, as it dragged on the on, I started getting weary, wishing it would just wind it self up. An example is the water wheel sequence, which was initially clever and well-done but just went on way longer than necessary. I got the joke! Much like the 2nd Lord Of The Rings (which REALLY bored me) and Superman Returns (which I generally enjoyed), it could have easily been cut more judiciously. Despite that, I recommend you see it.

This one has both. The first one I liked because of it's humor. Especially because of Johnny Depp who is extremely funny in this movie. Dead mans chest is more of the same, but with a better story. It slows down when it needs to and speeds up when it is requested for the sake of the movie. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like humor like Charly Chaplin (look at Jack Sparrow throughout the movie and you know what I mean) if you like Kiera Knightley (I know I do) and you like action as if you are in a roller-coaster. I didn't mention the special effects:maybe the effects on the Kraken (I will not tell what or who that is) are a little over the top, but nevertheless I have been amused for the full length of about 2 and a half hours.

So if you adored the first movie, you'll probably get a kick out of this one; but if you, like me, are in the minority that considers the first movie entertaining but overrated, you'll probably have even less patience with ""Dead Man's Chest.""Where ""Black Pearl"" had a silly and convoluted plot involving a crew of undead sailors, ""Dead Man's Chest"" has an even sillier and more convoluted plot centered on a different crew of undead sailors, this time led by tentacle-faced Davy Jones (reliable character actor Bill Nighy). Because each character in this movie has his or her own quest, which involves going on subsidiary quests to find other people or objects that they require for help, the structure quickly becomes overstuffed. However, the number of competing characters does provide for an exciting chase sequence near the endas long as you can remember what everyone's motivations are for taking part.For ""Dead Man's Chest"" to make sense, you must also remember what happened in the first movie, because most of the characters (even those who made little impression in ""Black Pearl,"" such as Norrington) recur. But, ironically, you would also do well to forget the first movie, because this one recycles many of the same jokes and scenarios. The actors have amplified their old performances without exploring any new ground: Johnny Depp is woozier, Keira Knightley feistier, and Orlando Bloom blander than in the original film. Action sequences are bigger and busier; despite ""Dead Man's Chest""'s 2.5-hour running time, there's no room for a simple one-on-one swordfight like Depp and Bloom's in ""Black Pearl.""So ""Dead Man's Chest"" is bloated, convoluted, and not particularly original. But I found myself enjoying parts of it nonetheless. One sequence set on a cannibal island has no bearing on the plotits only purpose is to let Johnny Depp make a fool of himself, but he does this so willingly that it's a pleasure to watch. The director and writers didn't take any risks with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, but they didn't embarrass themselves or betray the spirit of the first movie, either. And hey, at least you know what you're in for.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The reason that I liked all these films was because they were entertaining in a non-patronising way, fun, funny in parts and grand.Yet POTC 2 is none of those things, the comedy all comes from Johnny Depp being a shifty Pirate (more exaggerated from his fantastic role in the first film) and normally involves him walking funny! All of the set pieces were too long, non sensical and had little if anything to do with the storyline. And what a storyline it is. I struggled to tell what was really going on for most of the film but perhaps that was because I was fighting for consciousness most of the time.The first film felt like some people wanted to make a great Pirate movie whereas this one is purely a money-spinner with little point other than to get to the 3rd film (Matrix anyone?!). I'm at odds whether to see the 3rd one when it comes out(I never saw Matrix 3).","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is the KING of weird characters, and Jack Sparrow was at the top of the list. But Johnny Depp is not an actor made for sequels. Sparrow is nothing new to him and it is not a challenge anymore to him. The first one was great because he was experimenting, this one was good too... but he was safe. I hope that in the 3rd movie he takes more risks. Still, a must see and a very good movie overall.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Almost every reviewer has been getting on this film and giving it bad reviews; Entertainment Weekly gave it a D. And their reasons are that it is too long and confusing. But I say, when pirates, swordfights, and Captain Jack Sparrow are involved, the film could never be to long. I also thought that no film could beat ""Superman Returns"" as the best film of the summer, but a certain jolly roger has just passed the man-of-steel and is leaving him in the wake of their churning water. ""Pirates 2"" has made the first ""Pirates"" film seem mediocre; it is darker, funnier, and more fun. It reminds one of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, when people said ""Empire Strikes Back"" couldn't improve on the first ""Star Wars"", but they ended up being dead wrong. It ended up being the best. Maybe that will happen with the second ""Pirates"", but who knows, the third film may blow the other two right out of the water. No pun intended. The plot line is somewhat complex, so I'll save myself and you the trouble and I'll just tell you to go and find out for yourself. I will say this, the plot involves Davy Jones, a few daring rescues, and the best sword fight I've ever seen. This alone should draw droves of people, and don't forget our slightly strange, but lovable friend, Jack Sparrow. Who once again is brilliantly played by the amazing Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones is incredibly freaky, and, second to none, the most believable CG character ever to grace the silver screen. I applaud thee FX masters. I must caution parents though. As I said before, this film is much darker, and much more violent and disturbing; the evil crew of the Flying Dutchman as gruesome to behold. So ye be warned, this is not your typical Disney film. Something else I liked is that all the characters from the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" are back, and I mean all of them. I can't even begin to explain how funny this movie is as well. The first was funny, but not laugh out loud, hilarious funny. Of course, most of these funny scenes involve the scene-stealing Jack Sparrow. So, even though it's dark, the funniness and fun make up for it. Now before I wrap it up, I have one thing to say to all the critics who disliked ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; those who couldn't enjoy a pirate, swashbuckling film for 150 minutes, must really have ants in their pants. So all ye scurvy knaves, get ye to thee nearest theatre, and prepare for the time of ye life. Arr.

The action is my favourite part because it's energetic, thrilling and well choreographed.The soundtrack was upbeat as ever and made you want to hum along.My favourite main characters where Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom and of course Johnny Depp all of whom had that perfect chemistry throughout the movie.If you enjoyed the first movie then you will definitely like this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Why must we have throats being slit, murder after murder, and so many dead? Our children really do not need this type of exposure; possibly I am mistaken, but it appears that II was more murderous than I.The movie is very long...too long!

""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not just a movie. It's a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, which means that maximal enjoyment of it comes with certain obligations. It is the second episode in what will be at least a trilogy - the third installment is scheduled for release next summer - and full appreciation of its whirligig plot will depend on thorough acquaintance with the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" picture, conveniently available for purchase on DVD. And since ""Dead Man's Chest"" brazenly dispenses with the convention of an ending - it's pretty much all middle - you will, by virtue of buying that ticket, have committed yourself to buying another one a year from now if you're the least bit curious about how the whole thing turns out. By then, chances are good that you will have forgotten most of what happened in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so you'll have another disc to add to the shopping cart. And there are other memorable bits and pieces, visual highlights of a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. Ms. Knightley is, once again, a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end. Mr. Bloom, as is his custom, leaps about, trying to overcome his incurable blandness, and is upstaged by special effects, musical cues, octopus tentacles and pieces of wood. Naomie Harris turns up for a few scenes of hammy voodoo, and Mackenzie Crook and David Bailie contribute some proletarian slapstick. Most of the other members of the first movie's cast show up again, sometimes in surprising circumstances. But the easy delight that such flights of visual fancy inspires is crowded and blocked by all the other stuff going on in this long, ungainly movie, which for all its busy, buzzing parts, is incapable of standing on its own. It batters you with novelty and works so hard to top itself that exhaustion sets in long before the second hour is over. By next summer, I suppose, we'll all be rested and ready for more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A little worse than the first one, but still an extremely enjoyable ride, with one of the best CGI ever. Like, how they did it like this in 2006?! Davy Jones looks absolutely amazing! Like, literally the best-looking CGI character maybe ever in any movie and I mean that. So with that, it was very easy to get along with the plot and characters all throughout. I love the fact that it is possible to feel the decency of the director in the movie. Everything here is treated with care and every decision is making sense. I think that that's how the true adventure blockbuster should have to be treated - truly excellent CGI, an interesting plot with a fun screenplay, likable characters, playful romance, and just a simple sense of a great adventure. I'm looking forward to the next one, although I've heard that it won't be that good. We'll see. I trust Verbinski.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thing is, either you're going to love or get creeped out by this underseas devil, and especially his crew.If you can digest the supernatural elements that Jack is thrown into- once he owes his debt due to the Black Pearl ship having been raised from the depths by Jones 13 years earlier- then this movie will be nearly as enjoyable as the first. However, it potentially will drive you crazy, as everything is left open-ended, particularly with a completely unexplained cliffhanger, that really gives this movie the feel that it is just Part 1 of a two-part series that will be concluded with 'At Worlds End.'","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But he was never really that much of a box office draw. He was always known for quirky, interesting and odd ball movies but never brought in the masses. It was this movie where he created one of the most hilarious characters with his Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp was able to take what was just a Disney park ride into a major movie franchise because of his charisma in the lead role. I don't think another actor could've pulled off this role and been taken seriously. Most other actors taking the character choices that Depp did here probably would've been laughed out of the theater but Depp just has that It Factor with this role that it was perfectly created for him that it just clicked.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I liked many of the references to the Legend of the Black Pearl (LBP), but I got tired of that by the end of the flick. Sure it was funny to have the Governor try to find the keys to the jail cell and mutter something like 'Where is that dog?' but that kind of thing just got a little too overdone by the end.I get that the director/producer probably wanted to make a movie that could stand alone more than the Harry Potter series, which relies heavily on the viewers understanding the characters and plot of previous installments. But at the same time, it seems that make too much effort to reference those kinds of details from the LBP, so that if the viewer has not seen the LBP they will not understand the refs.That's really my only gripe.I loved the action scenes and new twists on sword fight scenes. In general, a sword fight is a sword fight and hasn't changed since before the black and white era. It was a great movie and I recommend seeing it to anyone. The acting was very well done. There was no gap or inconsistencies from character to character from the first. Those supporting characters returning from the LBP carried their characters over perfectly.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And a crossword. And a knitting project. Or something, because at 150 minutes, this sequel is a time commitment. The characters run through fight/adventure sequence after fight/adventure sequence in a plot that only makes sense if you don't think too hard.This isn't Hotel Rwanda or Citizen Kane and never wanted to be. But with a predecessor so fresh and funny, having a sequel with definite lulls is a disappointment.Keira Knightly is underused, chasing after everyone else. Orlando Bloom's Will doesn't bring many surprises, and Johny Depp's Jack is...well...business as usual. Tom Hollander makes for a funny villain, especially after his turn as Mr. Collins in Pride & Prejudice...I kept waiting for him to complement someone on the excellent boiled potatoes. The rest of the supportive cast is fine but there are so many that I wonder if the third installment should be titled ""Prirates of the Caribbean: Ocean's 13"".After 115 minutes I wondered if this film would ever end, or if I would find myself watching Jack Sparrow twirl across the high seas for the rest of my life. And then I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if Elizabeth had just married Norington in the first place. He had a good job, was decent looking (he's more attractive sans wig in this installment), and her dad liked him. Maybe then she wouldn't have found herself chased by the undead, their barnacled counterparts, and pirates in eyeliner.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

But about this one, new villain, new pirates, a great movie with a lot of pirate action and I am very satisfied about the sequel. The main villain, Davy Jones, is such a well made and rememberable villain. He has an octopus face with a great pirate suit, and for the captain of the bad guys I think this villain was even better than from the first movie. The concept of that Davy Jones has his heart protected another place in a chest, was interesting and a funny concept. Jack Sparrow tries of course to find the chest to avoid Davy Jones destiny. Good acting as well as like from the previous movie. Of course, Johnny Depp didn't disappoint as Jack Sparrow, he delivered us a great new pirate experience, he was silly and funny, and really made the movie ten times better than it could be. Without Jack Sparrow this wouldn't even be called a movie😅 I really liked the action scenes in this movie, especially one scene were three guys (included Jack Sparrow) were fighting on a spinning mill while they cross a big island. Well done scene, my favorite in my opinion. And the music theme, too, the iconic theme, made the scene great! This whole movie was great.

At World's End takes the plots of this film and enhances them beyond believe.Disney will never repeat this kind of movies, and I'm just happy that we can enjoy them in 2023 and years to come as they were created.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, the film was still up to par as the first, as most Jerry Bruckheimer productions are! The only negative thing I can say is that the scenes involving the cannibalistic islanders was lengthy and sometimes often bigoted and transposed as cannibals when they really weren't. Disney executives and writers need to research better next time before allowing something like that in their films! For that, the film was banned in several countries, costing the film revenue and publicity that they could have otherwise avoided! Overall though, the film did reach viewers and was well received in the United States, and on my scale received 8/10!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A lot of ""greats"" I know, but I truly feel this movie captures all of those elements at their best.The performances were astounding. Funny, dramatic, realistic. Naomie Harris is an astounding surprise, perfectly capturing her accent and releasing it to the audience in a magical way not foreign to the wonderful character she portrays. Mr. Depp is again, enchanting. It seems all the returning actors have perfectly grown into their characters and the new editions are great compliments. This movie is one of the best examples of great character acting in modern times.There were moments where I was completely wonderstruck by certain camera angels and movements. In a time where most everything has been done in the film industry, that's saying something, not just for the cinematography but for the directing and editing as well.This movie will undoubtedly be one which movie critics will scorn. It seems that modern day critics should spend more time saving the money they earn from their undeserving jobs, to spend on an education towards the industry they work in, an less time sitting in the theatre guzzling down gallons of soda. If you saw, and like millions of movie goers LIKED the first Pirates movie then you will like this one. There are plenty of nods at the first film (and at the ride for that matter) that will delight anyone with a memory. My main point of advice would be to go see it and form your own opinion.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action scenes go on far too long, the movie is way too long, and neither the script nor the action sequences are anywhere near the swashbuckling fun of the first film. It appears the writer and the director get lost between story lines, and they're unable to create a cohesive plot, as well as any symbiosis between the characters. ""Dead Man's Chest"" was sadly predictable, plodding and quite un pirate like. There are very few parts that amuse and surprise, unfortunately. Please, return to the ""formula"" of the first picture, and don't torture us with another Dead Man's Chest for the third.

Davy Jones.The flow and progression of the story is perfect.

I can see how the film may have driven off some viewers, with it's seemingly complicated plot and less humor than it's predecessor. I am an avid supporter of this film and find it to be my favorite movie of the Bruckheimer/Verbinski series. The two final films were shot consecutively and the second movie acts as a means of setting up for the final act in part three. The film revolves around the chest containing the heart of Davy Jones and the race to acquire it. Jack Sparrow's hoping to escape a horrible fate at the hands of Jones' pet, Will Turner seeks to free his recently-discovered father from Jones' crew, and disgraced ex-Commodore Norrington wants to regain his life by turning the heart over to the East India Trading Company.The original cast returns from the first film, with some great new additions. Depp, of course, as Sparrow remains one of the most memorable film characters he's ever portrayed though I will admit some of his lines didn't sit right with me. There were points where I couldn't help but feel some the lines felt forced and didn't fit. I'm still not overly impressed with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner but Keira Knightley brought more to her role this time around as Elizabeth is evolving into a stronger character than we've seen. Also returning, is Jack Davenport as Norrington who receives a more prominent role and becomes invaluable to the sequels. Seeing as how Barbossa was killed in the first film, the sequel was in need of a new villain so, outshining all others, we have Bill Nighy's addition to the cast as what has become one of my favorite film villains...Davy Jones. Nighy brought so much to the character and did a fantastic job bringing a completely CGI character to life.While mentioning the CGI, you will also note that it's improved since the original film. The character of Jones is so realistic at times you'd be hard-pressed not to think the make-up was done practically. Jones' crew, a mix of half-human/half-sea creatures, look fantastic but suffer at moments from the same issues as the undead pirates from the first film where the CG tends to stand out at times. There have been a lot of complaints that the story was too confusing, but I disagree. I admit I was somewhat confused at first but everything became clear as I was watching the film and had a firm grasp on the story upon my first viewing. Granted, there is a lot going on in this film and it easily fills the 2.5 hour run time but it's not time wasted. My best advice is to relax and enjoy the movie, and if you can, try to pick up on the subtle foreshadowing scattered throughout. DEAD MAN'S CHEST was easily the most enjoyable of this trilogy for me and the surprise at the end, right before the end credits roll, was enough to ensure I'd be back for the third.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And let me tell you, it does not disappoint. It is not as good as the original, but it was still very high up there. The visual effects are the best that I have ever seen and the original's pale to the sequels. Davy Jones is one of the greatest special effects I have ever seen. Just how real the flying Dutchmen were left me in AWE.THe biggest difference between this movie and the 1st is that it is so much darker. There's a lot more blood and people getting their throats slashed, and the Kraken killing many people. Depp is still Depp and thats why the movie is so great. Although the 1st 20 minutes of the film are a little slow, the pace picks up and film ends up being a 2 1/2 hr thrill ride. The scale of this movie crushes the original, but with a budget of 225 million compared to the original's 145, how could it not. In the end this film is still a great movie that I will see many times, but I cannot compare it to the original. The two have the same exact cast, but the films still feel different. Don't get me wrong, the film was excellent but the core of the film is very different and there are way to many different characters and their story lines.

The film does leave you with mixed feelings, The main feeling would be whens the next one! Definitely check this out. There are parts of the film that are jumpy, and i do believe that some bits are quite graphic for a Disney flic, different but something different for them making it seem to myself personally much better because it looses its edge as a child's film, although a 12 i wouldn't take younger easily scared children, mite make the imagination run wild. The film has the twists and turns you want the action usually expected and you can really get into it, and purchasing the film on DVD with all those juicy bonus features definitely makes it top notch. i don't know anybody YET that hasn't enjoyed it, but i completely understand that not everybody is the same we don't all like the same films/music/people, if we did wouldn't the world be great?? :) peace <3","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You will love part 2. In most trilogies the second and third movie always seem to ruin the movie or seem not to be better than the ORIGINAL. Although this movie has broken that tradition. It's an excellent movie with excellent character development, many plots and subplots and it ties in nicely with the first movie.If you want to watch this movie I would strongly recommend that you watch the first Movie.. Other wise you may get a little bit lost. This movie flowed well with lots of actions although you had to do a lot of guess work because unlike the first movie where stories were told and you knew what was going on this movie failed to encapsulate the story telling which was a great feature in the first Pirates movie.The great thing about this movie was it wasn't ruled by visual effect. The story line was magical and the flow of the story was great. This movie is a long one but there are no boring bits. There was only one bit of the movie which I didn't like and that was When Kira Knightly tried to be dramatic.. but apart from that it was great...Also make sure you watch carefully because the writers have left little clues in the movie for the third installment which is HIGH on my must watch movies list...... The second movie has set the scene for the third movie which will be brilliant....","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So much to my avail, we went to see this long-awaited movie ... at a drive-through. I'm *never* one to complain, but ... I'll never go to a drive-through again for various reasons.Now onto the good stuff, because you don't care about *that*. ^^^^ This movie started out dramatically, just as I knew it would. With actors like Bloom and Depp, how could it not? The first fifteen minutes were actually well done, and set up the story well for those who had mistakenly not seen the first Pirates, as well as Pirates fans. The film begins with Elizabeth and William marrying; happy happy. Of course this movie couldn't start with a happy event (very predictable, if you will) if the film was about Pirates and and some dude named Davy Jones. A problem occurs -- one in which I will not say -- and the two are unable to marry. This all takes place in approximately ten minutes. The scene switches, and eventually it gets to Jack Sparrow, whom I think was over-dramatic in his role. He is introduced in the only really comical part in the film (where the theater is an uproar of laughter), so don't expect anything very funny about Dead Man's Chest.As the story went on, my rating dropped. I suppose I'm the dumb person and I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, but this storyline was *bad*. I mean, the first Pirates had a surprisingly good story, but the sequel ... ugh, Gore, I think you just messed up. Maybe it was because I saw the film in a noisy drive-in, I don't know.The creature effects were good, but not realistic. I'm not into the whole computer generated effects in movies, because most of the time it looks incredibly fake. This movie proves my point. If you're a big Pirates fan, this probably won't bother or occur to you, so you needn't agree with me.I was impressed with the sword action in the first movie, and it was ooook in the sequel. The spinning wheel dueling as shown in some of the trailers was kind of ridiculous. But the part I hated most in the movie was Depp's plunge from a cliff; he smashed through bridges on his free-fall, and landed on hard earth. God, couldn't there be a lake or something below?? What the hell is this? There wasn't even a crater in the earth. Of course, he just groans and gets up -- it reminded me of something from those ridiculous television wrestling matches.Apart from all this bad stuff that I wrote, and a poor ending, Pirates *did* have some potential. You probably think I wrote too much crap, but the story had its ups and downs. The action was pleasing, and there were some funny parts. I think that if you liked Black Pearl, you should see this movie. If you haven't seen the first, then watch it, and see if you think a sequel is worth your while.Lukus","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"9","/10","A Wild Ride of Pirates, Rum, and Humor","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9212132/?ref_=tt_urv","sanadalsalt","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur87081876/?ref_=tt_urv","24 July 2023","Oh boy, where do I even begin with this movie? Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an absolute rollercoaster of a film. From the moment it starts, you're thrown into a world filled with adventure, pirates, and a whole lot of rum. And let me tell you, it's one wild ride.First things first, let's talk about Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's portrayal of this eccentric pirate is nothing short of genius. He brings such charm and wit to the character that you can't help but root for him, even when he's up to no good. I mean, who wouldn't want to be as cool and witty as Captain Jack Sparrow? Plus, that iconic walk of his, it's just pure gold.Now, the plot of the movie is quite intriguing. Jack Sparrow is on a mission to recover the heart of Davy Jones, a mythical pirate, in order to avoid becoming his eternal slave. But here's the kicker, he's not the only one after the heart. His friends, Will and Elizabeth, have their own agenda as well. It's a race against time to see who will get their hands on the heart first.And let me tell you, the action sequences in this film are mind-blowing. From epic sword fights to breathtaking ship battles, you'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. The special effects are top-notch, and the cinematography is simply stunning. It's like you're right there in the middle of the action, sailing the high seas alongside Captain Jack Sparrow.But what really sets this movie apart is its humor. The witty one-liners, the hilarious mishaps, and of course, Captain Jack Sparrow's antics, all contribute to making this film an absolute joy to watch. You'll find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. It's the perfect blend of action and comedy, and it works so well.Now, I have to admit, the movie does have its flaws. At times, the plot can get a bit convoluted, and some of the characters' motivations may seem a bit unclear. But honestly, who cares? This is a movie about pirates, after all. It's not meant to be taken too seriously. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.Overall, I would give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest a solid 8.5 out of 10. It's a fun-filled adventure that will keep you entertained from start to finish. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow alone is worth the price of admission. So grab your popcorn, hoist the anchor, and set sail with this swashbuckling masterpiece. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The best sequel of all time and a most respectful and complimentary addition to the first Pirates movie.

Oh :( how sad. Okay, well this is a very good movie. I didn't even realize it was done when it ended, I was waiting for more, expecting more--great, great, great--just make sure you choose a good movie theater to watch it.

And over the years Hollywood has learned that entertainment can originate from a lot of different elements, visual spectacles, big name celebrities, romance, unique and unforgettable characters, comedies, action, or sometimes just a plain good story that doesn't need any other polishing to make it fantastic. It's like mixing a cocktail with different ingredients. Yet no one likes to drink the same cocktail over and over again so the difficulty is to put in the same ingredients only to create something that is better than the first glass. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is probably the only movie that achieved such goal so far in this summer race.Not only does it have all of the elements above, it also succeeds in lifting the whole scale and expectation of adventure genre to a brand new level. And at the same time, not straying from the tone of the first one that everyone had enjoyed. It is something more than an extension, it made the audience felt like the first movie was merely a tip of the iceberg, that there's way more that's underneath and so many territories worthy of exploring creatively.Johnny Depp's crowd-pleasing, original take of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is at it's best here, successfully bringing the character to the very core of the movie. Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is unforgettable. The supporting casts of pirates each have their own purposes and bounce off very well against one another. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a villain with soul and CGI only made the character more convincing. Something I haven't approved of CGI ever since Gollum from LOTR.I won't go into the story because you can't really explain it without spoilers but let's just say it doesn't wait for you to think because there's so much going on at once. It's usually confusing for the audience when there's a lot of strings to tie in three hours yet they manage to pull it together alright. Each character is there for a purpose and they don't waste time. It's hard nowadays to see that in summer blockbuster. The ending amplifies the anticipation it had build up for the third movie while the audience were enjoying this one. However it is still a continuation of POTC1, so it's best if you're familiar with the first one to enjoy every minute of this sequel. Overall it's not only best summer blockbuster I've seen so far, it's also the best movie that lived up to my expectation this year.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rest of the time I hated it. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are horrible actors. The film was too dark, too spooky, even for me and I'm 18! Don't laugh. I saw it with a friend, it was his second time seeing it, my first, I almost walked out. What a waste of nine dollars! On the bright side, the day after that I took my Mom to go see Superman Returns, SO MUCH BETTER! I would rather want to watch Superman Returns instead of Dead Man's Chest. The music in Pirates was good. I walked out humming the main theme. I hated the movie though. I never should have said that I hated Superman Returns, it was WAY better than Dead Man's Chest! If my family buy's it on DVD, I will be watching either Superman (includes Superman Returns, not just Christopher Reeve's) and Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. DON'T SEE DEAD MAN'S CHEST! Scared man tell no tale. I was really freaked out. I saw Curse of The Black Pearl and liked it. the third film is coming out next year 2007 along with the sequel's for Fantastic Four and Spider-Man 3. I will probably see Spider-Man 3 quite a few times, especially considering that since I didn't like Dead Man's Chest, I might as well skip this one.

There were not just ""laugh out loud"" moments, but ""I want to stop laughing, it's starting to hurt"" moments too. The action sequences were so silly, you just want to see the film again to confirm you really did see what you thought. The special effects were special because you stopped thinking about them being effects.

Why this movie was not as good as the first, however, will not be.The movie was just a little too ""goofy"" for my tastes, in that typical Disney fashion. It failed to balance comedic silliness with seriousness as well as its predecessor.Secondly, for the first time, I started to truly dislike Will's overly virtuous character and his often ill-timed showings of bravado. Whether the fault lies primarily with Orlando Bloom or his character is unknown, but I felt that Bloom's performances were a little too wooden this time around. In addition, Will's oft-brash behavior seems to lack consequences. When you see his run-ins with the villain of this movie, a squid-like version of Davey Jones, you will understand my sentiments.In general, Davey Jones was a ""suitable"" villain for the second film, being neither perfect nor absolutely terrible. I feel that Barbossa from the original movie was more balanced and fun. He was a ""bad"" guy who wasn't exactly bad, thus providing ample excuse for his lack of cruelty. Davey Jones, on the other hand, is heartless- in the full literal sense if you get what I mean- and because of this, the writers are forced to give him some out of character moments to prevent him from killing Will. He's also paired with the typical idiotic crew, perfect for holding back the otherwise unstoppable villain enough to allow the heroes juuussst the wiggle room they need to escape all the disastrous situations they seem to get into. The writers also saved Davey Jones from total character-suicide by making him have a curse (which was never explained) that prevents him from getting on land, or even within 10 feet of the shallows. This means he is forced to depend on the aforementioned stupid crew, rather than be stupid himself.The plot of this movie was at least as good as the original, with even more twists, and the much-welcomed reappearance of a two very specific characters from the first film. The major problem with judging the plot, however, is that we don't even get to see how it all ends! This movie follows a trend set by the first two Lord of the Rings, ending exactly where the first film is going to start off with no warning whatsoever. I found this a little disappointing- especially since I embarrassingly didn't know about the third one for some reason when I was watching the second. Still, it wasn't enough of a pain in the butt for me to detract any points from the film's rating.If you feel like I haven't said very many good things about the movie, well, keep reading- that's coming. Then right after that, a few more bad things, then my conclusion.The good news is this; that wonderfully piratey theme song that gave the first Pirates a lot of its appeal is back in full force. The stunts and choreography in the film are still as amazing and tasteful as in the first- if you detract the few goofy ones close to the beginning of the film. Jack Sparrow is as witty, endearing, and as drunk as ever. Elizabeth, still gorgeous and kick-ass without being annoyingly pro-girl-power, is taking an even bigger role in this movie than in the first one. I for one do not mind.In fact, one of my favorite scenes in the movie was Elizabeth and Jack's discussion about ""curiosity"". I think Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly stole the entire show and left Orlando Bloom standing in the dust.Good news aside, I am now free to address the one scene in this movie that left me grinning in a combination of embarrassment, annoyance, and amusement.I was proud of Pirates of the Caribbean for introducing its own unique flavor, spirit, or whatever it is you choose to call it into theaters and DVD shelves everywhere. This is why I wondered exactly why they chose- like Superman Returns, V for Vendetta, the One, and other films that I cannot at this moment recall- to incorporate Matrix-like effects into their movie. In just the film where I thought that I was safe from incredibly slow-moving flying bullets, they sneak one in.Sure, it was well timed, and it was just one bullet. There were no slow kicks or time-defying dodging of sword thrusts and/or punches in the film. Still, it was just a little over the top, and worthy of detracting a tiny fraction of a point.Well, despite all, I still loved the film, I still recommend the film, and I still desperately want to see the last? installment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Just as good as the original, suffers from minor continuity issues","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3029989/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","7 June 2014","It was hard not to enjoy Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Pirates are always a fun subject to tell stories about. Johnny Depp exceeded at portraying a new character on screen while working with a script that not only created an interesting world that he lives in, but a lively one at that. After such a critical and financial success, even with some of its dark moments, it would seem important that the mouse house would stick with keeping this particular franchise afloat (pardon the pun) with the same elements while adding something new to the story. Thankfully, that's what they did. Besides a number of small issues, this sequel holds up extremely well.After defeating Captain Barbossa and reclaiming the Black Pearl as his own, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns to the seas. Unknown to him, he is quickly needed again by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to help him find the key to a secret chest only known by Davy Jones, the Captain of the Flying Dutchman. If Turner doesn't find this soon, he and his fiancé Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are to be hung for treason and letting a criminal escape (that being Jack Sparrow). Just by starting the cast off with these three, is great see. Their chemistry worked in the first and they continue to work well here too and that's not all. Several cast members from the first film come back too which is a pleasure. I was surprised to even see Jack Davenport (Commodore James Norrington) return. Even stranger is that although it feels like with all the returning cast, the experience would feel too much of the same, but it's not.There are three new main characters to the roster. Naomie Harris plays Tia Dalma, a spiritual witch who has a way with words and expands the backstory of Davy Jones. Stellan Skarsgård adds an interesting mix to the story when it turns out he's Bootstrap Bill, the father of Will Turner. Lastly, there's Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who's not terrifying if you're older than 13 but he's still a force to be reckoned with. Besides it is cool how well the body of an octopus was integrated in with his face. There's another internal struggle that goes on with Jack Sparrow involving whether he really is more than just a pirate. It's good character development. Again, just like the first film, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio's writing is great at adding new material to what fans and audiences have already accepted from the start.However, there is one issue with this movie and its the only problem too. There are numerous events involving continuity that go without explanation. An example of this is when Jack Sparrow captures Barbossa's undead monkey. I later discovered that the monkey was undead because in the post credits of the first movie, the monkey had stolen a piece of the cursed treasure. Now how would someone know that if they didn't watch the post credits? Another event like this belonged to when audiences finally see Pintel and Ragetti in a boat with a the dog who holds the jail keys. Since when did the dog become their ownership? I do not recall them taking the dog or the dog following them. Some explanation would be appreciated on scenes like these because its confusing to how various characters got into such situations. Like it was stated before though, this is the only issue.Once more, Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is beautiful, capturing all wide panoramic shots of the sea and various islands. The action is still very entertaining. It does not involve as many canon explosions as did the first, but in replace of this, viewers get to see the Kraken. By golly is this cephalopod enormous. It's suction cups are gigundo, with agile tentacles that batter any ship to pieces. Oh, and don't forget that dental job, woo! The special effects, which also make up the Kraken and several other of Davy Jones' sailors look great too. There's such a diverse imagination with what they look like with several mixes of marine wildlife. I can't imagine having barnacles or scallops growing off my face though. Finally, although he co-wrote the score to the first with Klaus Badelt, Hans Zimmer takes the reigns as full composer. Fans of his music should be able to tell he took over because their are parts to the score that have more emphasis on heavy tones involving strings. Zimmer also keeps the same main theme for Sparrow and even includes a softer theme for the tragic character of Davy Jones. It is still a great follow up altogether.It suffers from silly continuity errors but that's its only flaw. The action, music, special effects and characters all still entertain at the level they did from the first. Watch out for that Kraken though, man what a giant.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought it was so damn funny, even funnier than the first one, though it was also darker than the first one. It was never boring, the fight-scenes was amazing, especially one, you will know which one when you see it. Dead Man's Chest has everything a good sequel is supposed to have, lots of humor, funny villains, a very slimy new Villain, Jack Davenport was very cool as Norrington this time. The movie has so many levels, from action to slapstick a' la Buster Keaton. I guess I don't have to mention that Depp is amazing as always, that's more than you can say about Bloom or Knightley, but they're cute and doesn't bother me very much. Not much more to say than; whatever you do in life, don't miss the Pirate of the Caribbean-movies!!! Easily one of the best movies of the year.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean isn't that special when it comes to the story, it's simple, straight-forward and easy to follow.I believe the script, on paper, has nothing special to it, what makes this film so OUTSTANDINGLY special and be one of the greatest sequels to an blockbuster is the whole filmmaking. The pacing, the set-design, the editing, the soundtrack.. It takes the experience on another level.It wouldn't work without Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Hans Zimmer, Gore Verbinski and all the other talented artists that worked on the production. Most importantly to note is the editing and the soundtrack. It goes hand in hand. This film for me perfectly embodies what Kubrick once said, A film is not a work of fiction but rather an progression of thoughts and feelings. For me, this film progressively creates an atmosphere that is unbelievably unforgettable and feels so tangible and that's what counts. That's more important than a great script. To deliver an script, no matter if it's good, mediocre or bad, in the most immersive way possible.That's enough said, Immersive experience. Every High-Budget film should look at these ones and take inspiration.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The follow-up, sadly, is a bloated and confused mess. Giving Depp little to work with, the strong lead character who drives the initial film has not evolved. This time around Sparrow's been reduced to a role of lesser import and, painfully, one comprised primarily of repetitive buffoonery. Too many under-developed characters and a convoluted plot, the sequel relies on CG histrionics to sustain energy and fails miserably, collapsing under its own weight. Bill Nighy is terrific, easily giving the film's best performance. But Dead Man's Chest simply crumbles down around him and commits a film's worst sin: it becomes tedious and ultimately boring. Of course, none of this matters one whit. Marketed to a fair-thee-well, this film has become a must-see event that has transcended the need to be an artistic success. Matrix 2 and 3 anyone?","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is because I could barely understand what people were saying through the movie because of their overly thick accents. The second reason is because I probably had a bad seat in the movie theater at 12:01am. Anyways, this being the case, I went back and saw the movie a second time, hoping it would clear up some things for me. Let me tell you, it sure did! For people who haven't seen this movie before, the beginning can get a little yawn-worthy. However, I assure you, pay close attention to the details and you will be pleasantly amazed! The acting is excellent (excluding 2 people, whose names I dare not mention because of their wretched acting) and the escalation of suspenses keeps you at the edge of your seat for most of the movie. The CGI was beautiful and so were the special effects. The movie includes several plot-twists that are simply delicious and add to the character development and the plot. Oh, and we can't forget that TWISTED cliffhanger ending that stunned the world! The only negative things I have to say about the movie is that it doesn't flow as well as the first one. Some bits are a little choppy and can make a first-time viewer leave the theater dazed and confused. Plus, the plot isn't as well thought through as Curse of the Black Pearl, but we must keep in mind that it IS the middle movie.Middle movies are almost ALWAYS rough, mainly because the producers have to lay out the new storyline for the audience. Take the Empire Strikes Back, for example. The story was a little rough, but the added: ""Luke, I am your father!"" at the end totally made the movie worthwhile. Same goes with this movie: If you hadn't have watched this movie and skipped the the third one, you'd be utterly lost. This is why this movie is not only entertaining, but important to the series.In summary, this movie was VERY good, but basically a set-up for Pirates 3. I can already tell from watching this movie that the last installment of the pirate tale will be one of the best movies ever made. And I mean that, too...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I loved the portrayal Johnny Depp made of his now legendary character Captain Jack Sparrow, and I love the fact that the movie didn't take itself to seriously. It was a very good popcorn flick with not to many over complicated twists and gave room for very much entertainment.But even POTC can't flee from the most terrible curse of them all, I'm talking about the curse of the bad sequel. A curse that has struck many movies and destroyed many franchises. Unfortunately in these days we live in people want money and press out every penny on anything that can make them a quick buck, I think ""Dead Mans Chest"" is a perfect example of that. They made a sequel (technically two) over the course of 3 years.Well the troubles of DMC begin right at the start as I and my friends thought that we had entered the wrong movie when it began, it was so dark and so melodramatic from the start. The first 5 or so minutes you just might believe that this movie is a horror movie set in the 18th - 19th century. Nothing of the light hearted first movie is to be seen the climate of the movie is set right from the start but not as a adventure comedy type of movie, but a dead serious pirate movie.Well then is the entrance of Captain Jack Sparrow that is actually a worthy tie to the one in ""POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl"" only a bit more morbid. I'm not saying this movie doesn't have comedic moments, but there are a lot fewer then in the first and a lot more serious at that. So much so that I never really laughed out loud but smirked at the funny moments in the movie, cause they felt misplaced, this movie had no real comedic feel to it.I won't tell you the story cause you've probably already read it but what I will say is that you can just as well skip this movie and wait for the 3rd part of the installment cause what this really was, was a 2 and a half hour long trailer cause it ends worse then ""Matrix Reloaded"" and I am not joking, I felt cheated and aggravated. You do not get a whole story for your money, there is no end to ""Dead Man's Chest"".You can actually feel how Jerry Bruckheimer wanted a ending (or forced it upon the writers) like this to guarantee that people would want to go see the third part of the installment. I'm sorry to say that Hollywood endings have changed a lot through out the years their not happy endings now, their just not concluded.This movie is dark, it's not something I would let small children see (unlike the first one), it's beautifully shot, has top notch cgi and amazing sets but that's just not enough, without a good story none of that matters.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

What happened to the Pirates of the Caribbean the first  I was looking forward to the sequel of a sophisticated full of wit. I especially enjoyed the fact that everybody - but most of all Jonny Depp - was able not to take themselves too serious. Let's admit it, the genre Pirate Movie can only be endured nowadays when it is not taken seriously. It may be unfair to compare the second movie with the first - the commercial pressure on the second is certainly much higher than on a first one of a sequel..... But the first one had a story - as opposed to clichés, it had characters as opposed to wooden sticks in costumes, it had wit - as opposed to ...I don't even have a word for it. Why shorten the role of Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow? He is supposed to be the antidote to the boring characters of hero and heroine!!!!!!!!! Neither Keira nor Orlando are good enough to rescue a movie disaster. Who believes that special effects are a substitute for a story? And those special effects were just silly I just realise that the longer I write about this movie the more time of my live I am wasting on this stuff","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

At least half the audience were dressed as Pirates! The movie was good - very good - but not as good as the first. The effects, as expected, were awesome, especially Davey Jones and his crew. And Johnny Depp re prised the role of Jack Sparrow with perfection. Unlike the first POC - Dead Mans Chest starts out fairly slow - but it does build and by about 45 minutes into the 2 1/2 hour movie it is gets fun and exciting! I kind of equate this movie to the 2nd film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy... Was a good movie - not as good as the first - BUT - is a GREAT transition for the third and you leave hungery for the 3rd to be released! With the ending scene of this movie I know I heard at least 75% of the audience shout ""COOL!"" Bottom line - if you liked the first - you will like this one and if you plan on seeing the third you really have to see this one. I would say this is yet another huge hit for Disney and the POC craze shall continue!Go see it - enjoy - well worth the time and money and a lot of fun to see with a packed audience!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

He brings a lot of character and energy to Davy Jones. And the design for Davy Jones is awesome! As are all of the designs for his crew members.All of the acting is good.There are some really fun action scenes.The music is great, just like in all of them.Some of the jokes are funny.And for a movie made in 2006 the special effects hold up very well, especially with the Kraken. And man does the music during that scene kick so much ass!The biggest problem with this movie is that it's too long and there is so much unnecessary stuff in it. Like the sequence with the cannibal tribe, that could have been cut out completely. And there are subplots that I think make the movie convoluted. Which means you would have to remove Will and Elizabeth but it's not like that would be a terrible thing. They're not bad characters it's just they don't need to be in it. I feel like the movie would be better if it was more simple like the first one.And some of the CGI for Jones' crew shows its age but it's not distracting at any point.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's definitely one of the most engaging and likable entries in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, in my opinion. I admit I could do without the love triangle that begins to blossom between Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth. Nevertheless, I found the film enjoyable, without being overly long as the third film was. While Jack Sparrow's character is not played quite to the perfection of the first movie, he still throws in plenty of memorable lines here, including his ""Why is the rum always gone?"" and ""You're not makin' any sense at all."" I have heard complaints about the scene on the island with the sword fight on top of the spinning wheel and how unrealistic the scene is. Who cares if it's unrealistic? These movies weren't meant to model real life. They are just for fun. To anyone who is critiquing these films too hard, just sit back and enjoy them. I have had fun watching this entry in the series, so don't go by what many critics and even fans have said about this movie.*** out of ****","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am happy to say that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest, was an amazing movie. This movie is a great 'middle' to the trilogy. The movie constantly keeps you saying 'what the hell is going to happen next?' The ending gives you a great cliffhanger that makes you want to see the 3rd one RIGHT NOW.The special effects are one of a kind in PoC 2. Seeing the cracking for the first time is terrifying, even in the back row of the theater. I found the sword fights a little sparse, but amazing when they occur.There was more suspense, and less humour this time around. Johnny Depp still proves that he is the only actor that can play Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando bloom and Keira Knightly do their role very well also.Overall, this movie is a suspenseful action ride filled will humour and amazing visuals. This movie feels a little incomplete, but the 3rd one shall answer all of our questions.I saw this movie with my Grandmother of all people. She was asking questions all the movie because she never saw the first one. She did not like it, and came out saying things like 'Why did that guy have snakes coming out of his face'? 'Why did those 2 idiot pirates try to take the ship at the beginning'? She thought that the writer had one hell of an imagination. She said no thanks to seeing the 3rd one with me. All a matter of opinion I suppose.~Cyano","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A good, fun summer movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1419069/?ref_=tt_urv","TJ1380","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1299658/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2006","I admit that when I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Pirates of the Caribbean, I was skeptical. I just couldn't figure out why everyone was getting so excited over a pirate movie based on a theme park ride. My attitude changed when I finally saw the movie. Not only did it deliver one of the most memorable film characters I've seen in a long time in Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, it turned out to be the kind of fun adventure movie I used to watch when I was a kid. Despite all the state-of-the-art special effects it was the kind of swash-buckling pirate movie that they just don't make anymore. Needless to say I was much more excited about the sequel, and while I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the original, it's still the kind of fun adventure movie that should be released in the summer season.The movie picks up shortly after the end of the first one. Jack Sparrow is the captain of the Black Pearl, and Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (the other, less memorable heroes from the first film) are arrested for aiding in his escape from the hangman's noose. They face a death sentence, but the charges against them and Jack will be dropped if Will manages to find Jack and bring his apparently magical compass back to a cruel and manipulative government official. Meanwhile, Jack has his own plans: it turns out that he owes his soul to Davy Jones, the devil of the sea himself. He may need his compass to locate Jones's treasure chest (the ""Dead Man's Chest"" of the title), the contents of which may be the key to freeing himself from his debt. I really can't say much more than that without giving too much away, but let's just say that soon everyone has their own plans for the chest, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.The plot does get rather convoluted at times, which is the main reason why I liked the first ""Pirates"" better, it still works for two main reasons. First of all, it never really takes itself seriously enough to interfere with the spirit of the film. It definitely takes things into darker territory than the first film, and it allows for some good character development, but the film never forgets that it's supposed to be fun above everything else (the film even makes a joke about momentarily stopping the action to explain the story so far). Secondly, it allows the character to act exactly how pirates are supposed to act. Jack Sparrow may be capable of acting the hero, but as a pirate he can also be an untrustworthy, thieving, backstabber who would betray his own friends to save his own skin. Remarkably, this doesn't make him any less likable; his behavior as well as the behavior of others is treated as simply the way pirates are supposed to act. They're only loyal as long as it serves their purpose, and some backstabbing is all but expected in their world. This kind of moral ambiguity fits the theme of the film perfectly, and I for one am glad the filmmakers recognized this.As with most sequels, there's not much I can say about the acting that hasn't been said in the first movie. Once again, Johnny Depp steals the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. As I said before, he's more morally ambiguous this time around, but it works incredibly well for his character. He also seems to engage in a bit more slapstick, which I'm not a fan of unless it's pulled off really well. Fortunately, Depp pulls it all off incredibly well. Just as before, his Jack Sparrow is something of a bumbling fool, but the fact that he always manages to escape any situation due to luck or a sudden feat of swashbuckling heroism (or both) makes him into a legend in his own mind. The other leads are good enough, but this is definitely Jack Sparrow's movie.The film also provides a great villain in Davy Jones. In addition to being a great CGI creation (his squid-face often looks more like a very lifelike mask), he has considerably more depth than one would expect from a summer movie villain. He's a ruthless, fearsome, and as frightening as a good villain should be, but one expects that he was not always this way. There's a sadness to his character that suggests that he many not be as evil as he first appears to be. I definitely want to see what happens with his character in part three.The action scenes have about the same feeling as the first film with one exception: the first film didn't have a Kraken. It seems that just about every other movie has some kind of CGI monster in it somewhere, and they're rarely that impressive to me anymore, but the Kraken (basically a giant squid capable of dragging an entire ship under water within minutes) somehow succeeds where other monsters fail. Maybe it's because we don't really see much of the beast aside from a number of tentacles smashing apart ships, or perhaps it's the feeling of impending doom as it's attacking the heroes in the climactic battle scene, but the Kraken manages to be as scary and impressive as a good sea monster should be. As for the Kraken-free action sequences, the best would have to be an inventive (and funny) three-way sword fight in which the combatants end up on top of a runaway water mill wheel.As I said before, while I didn't think ""Dead Man's Chest"" was as enjoyable as the first movie, there's still a lot to love here. It does require some knowledge of the first film to truly enjoy it, but that's the case with most sequels. This one is definitely worth checking out.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It starts off a little slow but it's setting up the plot basically but when they get to the cannibal island thats where the fun picks up. The CG is amazing especially on Davy Jones and his crew, the first emergence of them and the Flying Dutchman is great. My favorite character of the film wasn't Jack Sparrow but Tia Dalma, she was great and lot of fun to watch. I came away a little disappointed with the film overall but I do love the surprise ending. At times I got into it and at times it felt really long. The scene after the credits is cute so stay all the way through the credits. The film basically sets up the third one (May 25, 2007) which after how this one ends and from the plot outline I read for ""At Worlds End"" it sounds bigger and better than ""Dead Man's Chest"" so I'm really looking forward to it. I heard Tia Dalma is in it more, I really hope she is. Early reports are that this made from $50-58 million on Friday, I hope these reports are true, even though I didn't like it as much as the first it deserves to set all the weekend records and be biggest movie of the year. My Grade - B+. But check it out and decide for yourselves.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What makes the first film great is carried on and placed into this film without taking on exactly the same form as in the first film. Again we have one hell of a performance put in by Johnny Depp as the surely liver-troubled Captain Jack Sparrow, this performance is undoubtedly keeps the film going although i am definitely not degrading the performances by the other two main characters and the supporting cast but we know who steals the lime light. The comedy used in the film is also included in the action sequences and had me and my two friends laughing at it and as a 16 year old watching what is supposedly a child's film it just proves that they have done a great job. The storyline and the ultimate twist in the tale all added up to give one climatic ending and set up the installment for the third film with brilliance. If you have read this all the way through you will see that i have nothing but praise for this film except one tiny little thing that got to me: Orlando Bloom is not cut out to be a comedian and i felt that some of his more comic lines were wooden and although got a few laughs where definitely not as well delivered as even Kiera Knightly's but apart from that i have nothing but respect for the makers of this film as they have in no way brought down the original and they may even have just raised the bar.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The character's motives at times also seem rather confused, in particular in respect to Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley parts (and their relationship... and his sexuality...).

It really feels like Disney turned a blind eye for this film and At World's End.What these sequels do so well is embellish our history with the mythology of the times. This is a fantasy land; Davy Jones is a real octopus man with the kraken under his command, people can be resurrected and humans in servitude can be encrusted on the wall like barnacles if they're on a ship too long. And what makes it compelling is that 'our world' still exists. The British Navy is clashing with these fantastical elements-the end result is surprisingly grounded as a result. Or rather, it would be if Jack Sparrow didn't exist. Yes, he's back and sillier than the original film-but it's at least tolerable here. I love that Will Turner, the more standard protagonist of adventure films of the past is just fighting in the background half the time, as if the normal adventure film is happening, but hey look at this more interesting thing (Jacks' antics) instead.A third of this film doesn't really need to exist. The whole island sequence especially is silly, unnecessary, physics-breaking, nonsensical and dumb. I love it. This universe has its own laws of thermodynamics and physics. Once you accept that, this franchise (or at least the first three films) are so much fun.I will say though, that the special effects are such a jump from the first film. Some of the CGI of the Flying Dutchmans' crew is just fine, and doesn't look too great in daylight. But Davy Jones looked phenomenal at the time, and is still pretty impressive today. Bill Nighy is fantastically threatening once he eventually shows up an hour into the runtime.Despite the ""bloat"" of that first hour, Jones and the Kraken are built up incredibly well. I remember as a kid being super excited for either of them whenever I rewatched the film.So Dead Man's Chest is a lot of fun, and more interesting than Curse of the Black Pearl. It's definitely messier but the worldbuilding resonates with me more. I was actually pretty surprised how well the film holds up. The pirates franchise isn't remembered as much by me and my friends-probably because of the fourth and fifth films being what they were-so it was especially nice being able to enjoy at least the first two thirds of the original trilogy again. I'm really curious to see if I'll enjoy At World's End, having not seen it since I was a kid.

And little did he knew is that he's schedule to be a victim of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones. And there's no turning back on this one cause the Flying Dutchman can track him down anywhere at sea.Jack must find a way to get himself out of this with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth. As well as unexpected characters involved in the same mess.I liked this movie a lot. It has element you won't see from the original. And it's action pack so there's never a dull moment. That and the ending is what you would call a cliffhanger. Which makes this one like ""Empire Strikes Back"" where you'll have to see the next one to see how it ends.The next one ""At the World's End"" is in production. I can tell that the next one will surpass the other 2.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

So here it is finally after how many years---3?!?they took there time but it is well worth the wait! johnny Depp put on another fabulous performance and his legendary one-off lines will make you laugh just as much as you did in the original. Obviously for ll the women who are concerned he looks just as fabulous as well so do not panic that they may have decreased in the 3 year long wait.It is very hard to compare the two films seeing as they are so different which sounds strange seeing as it is the sequel but perhaps this is why it is so successful the plot is completely different. It could be a separate film in its own right and have done just as well. The fight scenes are tremendous, the graphics extremely accurate and the relationship between the characters highly amusing.I think most women will be pretty glad when i state the only slight criticism there is with the film---the on screen chemistry between Orlando and Keira is lacking slightly, nevertheless if it were any greater it could change the overall effect of the film. so i think the decision was accurate and it also allows women of today's population to dream of marrying a pirate!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The characters gain more and more depth as the story continues and we are surprised to see what has become of them since we last saw them and what decisions are made as the adventure continues. As with any good second film in a trilogy, we're left with just enough dissatisfaction to make us anxious for the third film. Every question we got answered was replaced by 2 or 3 more.

I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, so I needed to see this movie the day it came out! And I did!! All the sequels I have seen (with the exception of Star Wars and Harry Potter) were so terrible!! This is a major exception! The camera work in this movie, was excellent!! Whoever did the cameras, I applaud you! This movie seemed much funnier than the first one and much more scary at the same time. Pirates 2 played with all of your emotions: happy, scared, suspense, romance, terror, sympathy... The list goes on and on!! Johnny Depp... This man is GOD!!! Whatever you see him in, he is always amazing!! GEEZ!! He even walks in character! How many actors do you know, that do that?! Jack Sparrow can be so cruel and so sarcastically funny, that Johnny Depp nails it in every single scene, with every single line, with every single movement. And this is coming from someone who isn't freakishly obsessed with the guy! Orlando Bloom. Have you ever seen him in anything where he is in the tiniest bit funny? I don't know if it was the lines, or him, but he had a few funny parts. When he gets upset, wow. I feel for him. I really do. Earlier that week, my brother is telling me that he isn't a great actor. This man could do silent films; he wears his heart on his sleeve. Kiera Knightly, well... I haven't seen her in anything else except for the 1 and 2 of these movies, so I don't have much to compare her to. I think she did a great job where she was trying to make Jack believe something (I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you). I was right there with him! She's a fabulous liar, a fabulous actress. I don't think that this movie should be as long as it is. Two and a half hours... That's what Harry Potter is for. They could have left out the whole 3-way sword fight. Granted, it was quite funny, but it took up too much time for such a senseless act. This was, in fact, scarier than the first one. The squid, the violence, the CGI, etc. I would recommend this movie to anyone I met!! Granted, kinds under a certain age... probably not. But this movie deserves whatever they get for all of the hard work put into it.ACADEMY AWARDS, HERE PIRATES 2 COMES!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They could back engineer a trilogy or write two mostly stand alone adventures. The choose the former but I really wish the choose the latter. One of joys of Pirates 1 is how self-contained and well finished it feels. It doesn't feel like introduction to a world. It feels like a complete story.I think both films 2 and 3 suffer from being overextended. It is much worse in 3 but the native Islander section is basically filler here-entertaining filler but not necessary to overall story. Likewise, Jones AND the East India Trading company being the villains is redundant. There's a much stronger story of Jack just trying outsmart Jones and dragging Will and Elizabeth along for the crazy ride.That said this is still a rousing adventure. Jones and his crew are some of the best CGI characters on film. They compete with Gollum and the Na'vi. The humor of the first film is still present and the swashbuckling is still fresh enough to be fun.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were references to the first movie in a variety of ways, bringing about much laughter and some groans of ""oh, they didn't"" but in general, well worth the tie-in. There were more subplots twisting and turning in this film than the original which can cause some confusion because of the speed and shortness of the those plots' background. The CGI work was quite good. The monsters were very much associated with the sea. The character development could have been a bit more fleshed out, however, it can be considered adequate for a second installment.Of course, Captain Jack Sparrow had quite a few humorous lines. Elizabeth seemed to be more three-dimensional than in the first movie. Will held his own in this one and could have been even better if given the chance. Ragetti (one-eyed pirate) was a complete surprise with his spot-on insights and spouting of facts at times. The other characters weren't too bad either.Summary: As the first movie was more of a surprise when it comes to Sparrow and the other characters, this one may seem less so because we already know what the characters are like. There are more subplots than necessary which can be confusing but they may be what is needed to use as a reference for the final movie when it comes out next year.I recommend this movie. It is fun, light-hearted, action-packed and full of double entendre. 8/10 stars!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Its not that kind of picture. Its designed primarily to entertain and to extend the ""Pirates"" franchise, and it succeeds brilliantly at this.You can see elements of theme park rides and video games in the plot, a plot that's structured more like the levels of a game than the chapters of a book. This results in the only negative comment I can make about the movie -- it runs a bit long as the plot is continually stretched to fit around the action sequences. (The movie also has a definite ""to be continued"" feel about its ending -- but then what would you expect?) So don't expect an uplifting intellectual experience, plan to overlook the historical and technical inaccuracies, ignore the overused clichés (not English villains *again*!) and sit back and enjoy the ride.

Incredibly, the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise is one of the most lucrative to date. However, only the first film is considered a critical triumph. The rest are accused of lacking the quality plot, humor, and originality of the first. I agree completely in the case of the third and fourth films, but I feel that the second installment is highly underrated. Few of the flaws that plague the franchise are present here, and Dead Man's Chest is actually a worthy follow-up to the original.The only thing that makes these movies watchable is, of course, Johnny Depp's fantastic performance as Jack Sparrow. Without him, there could be no Pirates of the Caribbean. His weird mannerisms, hilariously endearing personality, and total unpredictability have made him one of the most beloved characters in movie history. Dead Man's Chest gives viewers plenty more of Captain Jack, and he's just as wonderful as ever. If anything, I almost felt that he was better than in Curse of the Black Pearl. He's given a great introduction in this movie, and he never fails to bring humor to any situation he's put in. He contrasts wonderfully with the serious and somewhat clichéd love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, and is always there to lighten the mood when things start feeling too sappy.One thing I can say for the first movie is that the evil skeleton crew was incredible. I particularly enjoyed fight scenes where they would flash in and out of the moonlight, transforming. They were beautifully and artfully done. It is clear that in this film, they tried to rival it with the creepy, marine life-infested crew of Davy Jones. While special effects have improved drastically, there is sort of a ""been-there-done-that"" feel to these new characters. Davy Jones himself, though, played by Bill Nighy, was a breakthrough in motion capture effects. Even with a beard of tentacles and complete lack of a nose, his excellent performance shines through and never seems silly. Nighy made quite a wonderful villain, as good or better than Geoffrey Rush from the first film. Plus, something has to be said about the Kraken. That was an awesome creature! It looked amazing, and was built up really well throughout the movie. By the climax, it feels like you're watching an old-fashioned monster movie; and it is great.Many people complain about the plot of Dead Man's Chest. Personally, I don't assign much importance to the story of movies like this. Admittedly the storyline is rather convoluted, and some may not appreciate the large cliffhanger at the end. But that is kind of the point of the story. The second and third movies were filmed back-to- back, and are really two halves of a whole. They share the same characters, same villains, and some of the same plot threads. Admittedly, there may be too many said plot threads to be completely coherent, but let's be honest: no one came to see Pirates of the Caribbean for the plot. It's either for the incredible action scenes (and boy, are they incredible), Jack Sparrow's character, or Orlando Bloom's face, all of which this film delivers in grand excess. Only in the third and fourth films did the plot to detract from my enjoyment of the movie.People will compare Dead Man's Chest to the first movie endlessly, and there's nothing anyone can do about that. But as a sequel or a standalone film, it's not at all a bad movie. While not perfect, it's well-executed, well-acted, and a damn good time. I give it 7 out of 10 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Storyline was convoluted as characters and script wasn't very well strung together and just left me brainlessly soaking up action scene after action scene but feeling empty about the overall depth of experience.

And whats with that compass?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The 1st (curse of the black pearl) was a good film. No 2 is not so good. Don't get me wrong the special effects are excellent but the overall feel of the movie was messy with ""let's plonk this here"" and ""that would be a good idea to put that bit in the film here"" attitude and it didn't cement together. It was a long movie and some pointless sections could easily have reduced the running time. This is obviously flogging the movie licence to print merchandise money for the big studios which it will. I am not feeling the ""Hollywood"" touch in this movie and for a big blockbuster you would expect it. Johnny Depp is quality and any part he plays he shines, that is the only thing that kept the film alive. If you have the choice watch Superman returns instead as that definitely has the ""Hollywood"" touch.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was expecting better since the first movie blew me away. I felt however that part of the reason I did not like it at that time was that I didn't fully understand it, I was expecting something completely different, and when the movie ended it was 1:30 AM. So I decided to see it again and had a completely different reaction. This film wasn't as good as the first but not many sequels are. POTC 2 had amazing effects, funny dialog, and an overall entertaining story. The only flaws were that there was less interaction between the main characters than there was in the first film. Also, while Davey Jones was an interesting 'villian' Barbossa was a lot more entertaining. All in all the movie was great. I think it would have a more positive reaction from other viewers if it didn't have the other one before it to compete with. If you aren't to impressed the first time you see it, i recommend giving it another shot. I would have given the first POTC a 6 out of 5 stars but i'd give this one a 4.5 out of 5 which if you think about it, is still really good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It also felt like they were really pulling for laughs in the beginning which was very unlike the first movie. Anything Jack did you found funny. However, as soon as the action started, not only did the movie pick up, but the comedy as well. I got lost in it.It was much darker and dealt with deeper issues, some characters do some unexpected things and have pretty deep conversations. There are many old faces from the first movie and a lot of new ones with Davey Jones and his crew as well as a new addition to the protagonist side, Tia Dalma.The ending I thought was fantastic even though I know it confused a lot of people. It was very abrupt, I heard a lot of people commenting on that as they left the theatre but overall I quite enjoyed it. I really think their goal is to get you back in theatre next year for the 3rd movie and it worked on me!While not as good as the first movie, it holds up as a sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So, when I was expecting everything with the second and got nothing, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. Still, it's disappointing when such a long anticipated release falls so flat. I'll admit that I laughed at times - mostly because I felt I needed to on some level or a few around me were giggling - but upon further reflection, it was shallow laughter. The gags just didn't cut it, the characters seem to have lost their spark, and the plot didn't inspire much anticipation or excitement. Although it was nice to see the original players return, they just didn't seem themselves in this installment - trying too hard to relive the first I suppose. I was still much impressed with the authenticity of the setting, props and costumes, but I felt the special effects, although amazing at times, played too big a role and were rather overdone and distracting in a way that overshadowed what should have been solid acting performances with the wit and timing of familiar characters from the first. It reminded me of a comedian that has an off night. Still, I'll no doubt buy it on DVD to complete my collection, so hopefully the third will make up for it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The best use of tone in the franchise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7667711/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","21 December 2021","I've always considered Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest to be the best of the franchise pretty purely because of its tone. It feels most like the kind of fun adventure tale that each movie seems to shoot for. It has a better balance between its tragic villains and adventurous antics so that it never gets weighed down with heavy moments, allowing them to come and go quickly to establish what they need to establish before moving on to something lighter. The movie never gets super light, though, preventing any kind of really weird tonal shifts that could cause some discord within the film.The first film was written in such a way that sequels could happen, dropping in things that could be expanded later, but there didn't seem to be a huge plan for which way to go. The first two sequels go quickly into much weirder territory implying, I think, a greater influence Gore Verbinski had on the writing of the scripts. It feels like he was largely a director for hire in the first, and he was able to much more creatively guide the next two. I've never done a study of his work, but I am familiar with it, and the odd faces, weird body horror, and dirty designs fit well with his other movies like Rango and A Cure for Wellness, culminating in what may be the single weirdest big budget adventure film ever made.Anyway, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) are set to be married when their wedding day is crashed by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), determined to find Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his mysterious compass that does not point north. Jack, at the same time, is searching for a mythical key owned by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the mysterious captain of the terrifying Flying Dutchman. The key goes to a chest that contains something Jack wants. It turns out that Jack and Beckett want the same thing, and so begins our new twisty-turny adventure in plot misdirects and Caribbean pirate action. Recounting the plot would be ridiculous, but needless to say it involves a cannibal island where Jack is made their chief (in order to cook him), daring escapes, Will's father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, as a damned mate on board the Dutchman under Jones (one of the best bits of retconning I've seen, to be honest), Liar's Dice, deals with the devil, yearning for lost love, patently ridiculous and entertaining sword battles, and a giant beast of the sea, the Kraken.The film really is overlong, but it never loses a desire to entertain. Take the single most excisable sequence in the film: the escape from the cannibal island. It serves little narrative purpose, revealing nothing new of our characters even. It could be pretty hard cut out of the film, having Will arrive on the beach to find the crew trying to get the Black Pearl ready to make sail when Jack comes running around the corner, being chased by a horde of natives intent on freeing him from his mortal coil, and little would have been lost narratively. And yet, I'd never want it cut because it's fun. The weird toe neckless, the swinging cages made of human bones, the escapes of Jack (running around with a log tied to his back) and the crew (running and rolling through the jungle in the circular cage) are so much fun to watch that getting rid of them simply to adhere to strict narrative discipline would be detrimental to the film experience overall.The movie is a film of extravagance, taking the huge budget for both sequels and throwing them at the screen in ungainly ways. The designs of Davy Jones and his crew, as men slowly become fish-like creatures the longer they serve before the mast of his damned vessel are amazing in execution and also point to some ideas that percolate just below the surface of the film. If there's a theme of this film it's going to be about delay. Elizabeth is driven by the fact that she was denied her wedding night (wink, wink). Will is dealing with the same thing, but also the relationship of his father, broken by his trip to the depths and subsequent impressment on Davey Jones' ship (a twice cursed pirate father, as one character puts it). Jack is obsessed with delaying his death and, in particular, his promise to serve on Davy Jones' vessel in exchange for 13 years as the captain of the Black Pearl's captain. Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) had his career completely derailed when trying to ruthlessly chase Jack into a hurricane where he lost his fleet, and he's dealing with that delay, so to speak. None of this is really prominent (it's an adventurous swashbuckler first and foremost), but I think it speaks to why I like this second film more than the first.That mostly centers on Davey Jones. Jones is a man who fell in love with a woman who broke his heart. So, he cut out his heart, put it in a box, and sails the seven seas looking for more crew on his undead quest and can't step on land for ten years. This is the kind of tragic backstory that Barbossa had in the first film, and yet the first film spent so much time on Barbossa's tragic motivation that it ended up feeling like it was in competition with the rest of the film for central focus. Davey Jones' motivation is well-defined but takes up less screentime overall, allowing him definition as he moves within the film, providing the right amount of context for his actions without overburdening the film with it at the same time.That limitation of screentime for Jones' tragic backstory allows the film to get back to the twisty plot and absurd action, creating a more consistent tone across the body of the film that elevates the whole film into something much more fun. The finale of the film, an extended chase and fight, is the exact kind of exaggerated action that I want from big-budget action filmmaking. I don't want regular things done fancy, I want absurd things done big. The three-way sword fight between Jack, Will, and Norrington as they fight over control of the key on a beach, up a hill, into the ruins of a church, and then on top of and inside a rolling water wheel is action that's always changing, never getting boring, and consistently visually engaging.As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect at all. It really is overlong in ways that don't always entertain, such as the efforts to get everyone into the same place at the end. It's determined to make sure it all makes sense, but there are so many moving pieces that it ends up feeling kind of laborious. And, despite my enjoyment of a lot of the action, there really is a lot of it and it can feel extraneous even while entertaining. I think that's a way of saying that I get kind of antsy in the middle section of the film. However, I kind of love the opening and the closing, finding the overall film a riotous adventure full of swashbuckling worthy of the name.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought it was great. I was surprised at some of the returning characters, but it was great seeing them again. The plot was very good. Although I thought this one was really well done, it doesn't even begin to compare to Curse of the Black Pearl. There were some events in this one that I wasn't overly impressed with but overall it was good. Johhny Depp is absolutely hilarious and brilliant again as Captain Jack. I highly recommend it to any one who has seen the first one. I went to see this one with my mom who hasn't seen the Curse of the Black Pearl. She was completely lost when it came to a certain someone at the end and a few other events. So I wouldn't watch it without seeing the first. After seeing this one, I definitely can't wait to see what they have in store for the final movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now that I saw it again, I wonder why I did that. It is not another crappy sequel after all.Granted, it is not exactly a masterpiece or anything, but it is fun and entertaining (and has the same vibe of Curse of the Black Pearl, which is a good thing in my book). It has an interesting plot... and it still has Jack Sparrow, along with Johnny Depp's superb acting! Also, I have to give kudos to the special effects department! The look of Davy Jones, his crew and the Flying Dutchmen is simply haunting, and very creative. These ""sea monsters"" (so to speak) contrast very well with the ""pirate ghosts"" of Curse of the Black Pearl.My only two criticism are the random situation with Jack/ Will Turner and the cannibals, and the slight overuse of Pintel and Ragetti.I've yet to see the third, but considering I just regained my interest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I might as well enjoy it.If you haven't seen this film but enjoyed the first, I highly recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has brought in a whopping 132 million over this weekend alone, while leaving Superman in the dust, which earned a measley 21 million, pretty low if you ask me for it being in its second week of release only. Why they put Superman to go head to head with the POTC is beyond me. They should've known the man of steel would stand no chance against all them damn bloody pirates!! Now onto the movie, all I have to say is WOW!!! This was an awesome fantastic sequel that really lived up to the first. And I might as well go on to say it might have even surpassed the first. Everything was outstanding. The acting, directing, special effects, visuals, EVERYTHING!!!! All true Pirates of the Caribbean fans will not be disappointed! Johnny Depp is defintley of course the stand out in the film as Jack Sparrow. The entire theatre was cracking up mostly the whole time. Dang, now I really know he was born to play this role. I couldn't see anyone else playing it but him. The other returning players also gave outstanding performances. Orlando Bloom was given way more screen time this time around then in the first and deftinley shows his talent that hes a fine actor. And Keira Knightley again shined playing the lovely stubborn Elizabeth Swann.And I have one thing to say to all the people who are bashing this sequel and saying it wasn't good at all because it just has a lot of action scenes and special effects and that there is no plot. So what??? The last time I checked, most people go to the movies to get away from the real world, so to speak. They don't want to be bored by a bunch of scenes where it's just talking and thats it. We want to see fighting, lots of action and special effects. Hey, if you don't, this is your wrong movie. Go see Gone with the Wind or some other sappy drama. I'll take this over any of those anyday!! And hey, if you didn't notice there was a plot, I'm wondering if your watching the same movie I am.All in all, this is defintley the Big Summer flick of 2006. No doubt about that!! HIGHLY Recommended to everyone who loves a good awesome action oriented special effects extravaganza!!!! This will be a real treat for you. And yes, TAKE THE KIDS!!!!! There are some scenes that are frightening and scary, but not enough to make them cry. The showing I went to had numerous children in it, and all of them enjoyed the movie. I didn't hear one cry or peep out of them except of course laughter. So do take them. The entire family will enjoy this!!! A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars in my book!!!!!!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

His only chance of avoiding this terrible fate is to try and locate a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones. But even with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), and his loyal crew, the quest will be a perilous one.With an amazing cast and amazing production values, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is simply bursting at the seams with amazing stunts, amazing special effects and amazing action set-pieces. But what is most amazing about this film is that director Gore Verbinski still somehow fails to deliver a finished product that is equal to the sum of its parts.This sequel to his own 2003 blockbuster, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest is an overlong, incomprehensible mess of a movie, which has all of the right elements but no decent story on which to hang them. The dreadfully structured and convoluted plot jumps from one event to another with seemingly no attempt at a coherent narrative and totally wastes its wealth of great characters.At nearly two-and-a-half hours long, the film pads out its extremely ill-conceived script with endless, and ultimately very dull, fight scenes and a glut of admittedly impressive, but often unnecessary, CGI effects. In fact, if as much effort had been put into crafting a decent tale as was obviously put into realising the movie's monstrous villains, Dead Man's Chest might have been a whole lot better.As it stands, though, I'd rather be keelhauled than be made to watch this bilge again.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"" finally the second part will be out , and I wanted to watch this movie by any means.And here I am finally watched this great movie which takes your mind to an adventurous world full of mysteries , secrets & suspense not neglecting humor(of course). In general, the movie is a big blockbuster & better than the first, who was also like a surprise for the watchers.Some scenes may seem a little bit slow and boring , but this doesn't decrease from the movie's value as it has many and many and many interesting sword-fight scenes and hilarious chases.There is something which can be noticed and may be important in this movie which is the FEMALE characters in the movie. It's obvious that they play a very important role in the events of the movie (this began to appear for me since i watched the movie again).For example: (Elizabeth) she is the one for whom (Will Turner) decides to face a lot of dangers and threats his life for her sake , and she is also the one who , to some extent , was the reason of (Jack's) death. Another character is (Tia Dalma) which has a multi-benefit role and her importance will be more the next movie (after bringing captain Barbossa back).Her importance appears as she is the one who HELPS the ship crew to know the secret of the key , and it seems that she is chess player and they are the pieces !!. The last female character is an unseen one which is the woman who made (Davy Jones) take his heart out for her and so making all characters searching for this heart and so on. So she is one moving the main event in the movie. Those three female characters are an example that women can easily control men's lives and sometimes destroy them , they have great influence on them and they are masterminds .Of course I'm not against women or something but I think that's something the movie is trying to say.At the end I'm telling that anyone who haven't watched the movie yet then he MUST MUST , and if anyone saw the movie and has another comment please inform me.Another thing which is if anyone saw the movie & agrees with this analysis tell me because I'm not sure whether this analysis is right or not !!.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

She gets better every time I see her.I also have to give props to Jonathon Pryce (The Rachel Papers), Naaomi Harris (28 Days Later), and all those fantastic people who did the makeup for this film.I certainly will be there for the next chapter.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I knew I was going to enjoy it. I knew I was going to laugh and grin. I knew this and had confidence in the film because of Johnny Depp. He made the first movie, he was the reason I watched (and continue to watch) it over and over again. I fell in love with Jack Sparrow and doubt I'll ever fall out of his spell. But with this movie came a couple of major surprises: I wasn't only laughing and grinning, I was at the edge of my seat and anxious for the next scene. And it is more than Johnny Depp that I will return to the theaters again as often as I (financially) can allow.Orlando Bloom can act! His character is better rounded, there's more to his story, and his scenes without Depp stood out beautifully. I think he learned a lot in the past couple years. Miss Knightly also did a nice job and came out as more of the rogue Englishwoman I wanted and imagined her to be. The majority of familiar faces (and favorites!) from the first movie show up throughout the course of the film as well, wonderfully enough! And it works, which is really the amazing part. This movie drew on the good points of the first but didn't nag anything to death. Don't worry about the previews where things seem to cheesy--sure, they may be walking that edge of hilarity, but they are well balanced by other serious plot lines and the more anxiety-packed moments.I can honestly say this is the best sequel I've ever seen (excluding the original Star Wars films) especially considering that the first movie was probably written independently. This compliments the first movie so well, in fact, that I think I liked it more than the first. Nothing can ever be on the same level as an original, it's true, but this movie went above and beyond by drawing me in on all fronts this time around. I'll watch the first movie again and again for Jack, but its sequels will be the more satisfying for me.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

After being completely taken by surprise and blown away by the originality and complexity of the first, original film, i felt completely let down, confused, and saddened by how that first film is tarnished by this sequel.Now, of course, in hindsight, i can appreciate the second Matrix film as a worthy installment of the series, and perhaps filled with the most rewatchable fight scenes of the entire trilogy. Hopefully, the same will be said about this film once all is said and done. Yet, for the time being, it seemed as though ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is more said, than done. My initial feeling is that it sucked the life out of the original, spat back the enjoyable lines and character references, and created a ridiculously complex back story that makes it incomprehensible with its laboured pace and unsatisfying faux ending.Which is the problem of the second installment of pre-planned trilogies. It's almost as though the filmmakers hold back, knowing they have to save something for the final film, or else why bother? (Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers notwithstanding). Which, in response i say, why bother with a middle chapter if it's going to be so unfulfilling? Johnny Depp's role as Captain Jack Sparrow is still as much fun to watch as it probably is for him to act out. But his place in the movie as the bonafide hero takes a bit of the edge away which made him so dastardly to cheer for in the first film. What this film lacks is the presence of a real great villain, as Geoffrey Rush is sorely missed during the film. Both Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann seem like mere window dressing, as they try to cram as much cast from the first film that it makes more seem like less.Much like the second Matrix film, this film will most likely be remembered for its excellent action sequence, mid-way through the film. Yet, by then most of the audience will be just as turned off or tuned out as Depp's inspiration, Keith Richards. This isn't a plot line that's too complex because it's so brilliant. It's a plot line that takes so long to develop that it becomes too laboursome for the audience to care less. Just give us the popcorn movie experience we loved so much the first time around.Unfortunately, like a bad movie spoof, this film is too full of repeated remarks and familiar circumstances, and not enough fresh, fun thrills. i wish i had Adam Sandler's remote from ""Click"" so i could fast forward half this film, and then on to the third one, where they must be storing all the fun and excitement this one left behind. Not enough booty to salvage this one from the depths.Grade: C-","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Sam is an ordinary teenager who bought himself a car, but not an ordinary one, it turned out to be alive. And there are actually a lot of such machines, and they all need Sam's help to find a cube that contains the power of incredible energy and evil machines are hunting for it. That's the idea Michael Bay had enough to create a very interesting and spectacular film.The older I got, the more interest in this creation disappears, and my good attitude to the film is warmed only by the presence of LaBeouf in the frame.

And the sequel does not disappoint. It keeps almost all of the magic of the original. The music, action, and acting is just as good as it was before. The comedy is a little on the short end in this one. A few too many jokes about rum in my opinion. But that doesn't effect at all.If you liked the first one, you surely will go see this one, and you'll enjoy, or at least, I hope you will because I did. It starts off a little slow, and sometimes can get a little crazy during the film but it's great nonetheless. It is s little long but in the end comes together perfectly with one of the greatest cliffhanger this movie-goer has ever seen. POTC:DMC is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Don't listen to what critics say about it being too cartoonish, too scary for little kids, and boring. This movie is none of those.The Summer isn't even over, but Pirates 2, in my opinion, is the best movie the season has to offer. Savvy?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No other company but Disney is capable of producing such a perfect combination of excitement, fun, romance, and style. Just like the first Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest presents a number of big Hollywood stars who seem to be having the time of their lives. Keira Knightley is beautiful and not only that. She is funny, brave, and decisive for the plot. The crew of the Black Pearl is once again as chaotic as faithful. Orlando Bloom is a hero once again, this time, however, he does not really seem to be that shining light that he was in the first movie. His part is a minor one, and once again, Johnny Depp makes the film both the best non-animation film by Disney and the best pirate-movie ever. Not only a jewel in this summer, but a jewel in cinema history.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Why does Ms. Swan have to fall for Capt. Sparrow... does it really have to be a heart breaking movie? It breaks my heart when Ms. Swan Kissed , Capt. Sparrow. I like the way they portray the role, the settings, it's fun, but I wonder what will happen to Will Turner. Even if they are Pirates it should still show Loyalty with it comes to the matters of the heart. Now I wonder about the Part 3, it seems that only Will Turner who doesn't have the heart of a Pirate but I like his character he is wild and can be savaged but he has a heart that shows he is a human.. that no matter what bloods runs in you, people can still choose their own lives and what they can stand what they believe in and I like his character because he has a heart....","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

That part in the beginning where the guy gets his eye pulled out by a crow was very graphic (I'm deadly afraid of crows now). and 2. Why was no one surprised to see Pintel and Ragetti again? They were part of Barbossa's crew. Did anyone even recognize them? Here's an alternate scene I came up with which I think they could have done:Elizabeth Swann: (seeing Pintel and Ragetti again for the first time) You! Pintel: Oh, you remember us poppet?

Johnny Depp returns as Sparrow and continues his brilliant performance of the character. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones also did a great job in his role. There are some memorable episodes in the film, although some of them are too drawn out. Hans Zimmer did a great job taking the music from the original film and creating new material and themes that became an integral part of the franchise. The plot of this film is more complex than the first and may lose a few viewers along the way, and the length of the film doesn't help that.

It was true to the slash-stab-laugh formula of the first Pirates of the Caribbean and it's much better than some of the other Hollywood junk that's come out recently. However, at times it feels that they are trying really really hard to make you laugh about the ridiculousness of Jack, and his bumbling crew. And whereas the first movie could be more or less placed in a historical context this one is definitely moving towards the fantasy side of things. In the first, as long as you could swallow the idea of the Aztec gold then the most absurd thing was the ghost crew. This one... well you've seen the posters of Davy Jones aka Octopus-face... yeah the rest of his crew is like that too. Oh and if you're going because you like gnarly pirates then you're probably going to be disappointed. However, those minor objections aside I really enjoyed it and you probably will too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A terrific adventure. It's been an unbreakable rule amongst Hollywood blockbusters that a sequel, although trying to be better than their predecessors, are never really better, something always falls short of its predecessor. Although some sequels have eventually broken that law, it's pretty rare for another sequel that actually is better than the original. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST breaks that law once more, as it is bigger and surprisingly better than its predecessor, the immensely popular PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. The budget is eventually bigger, much for inserting bigger and better effects than the original. Not only does it feature a lot of pirates, this one has slimy creatures and a giant Kraken. But even with it's over-commercialization, PIRATES 2 lives up to it's hype.Personally, the original PIRATES wasn't exactly the best summer movie in years, but it was an unprecedented summer entertainment and it's quite an offer I couldn't refuse. I enjoyed the special effects and action scenes, and then there's Johnny Depp's portrayal as the half-sane pirate Captain Jack Sparrow which provides the film's best charms. This sequel offers practically the same formula, only with new refinements as it is a sequel to a certified blockbuster hit. The special effects are bigger, the action is more abundant and of course, the running time is extended. While the original film was long enough, this sequel is twice as actually long, running at 150 minutes. Nobody wants to stay too long in a packed movie theater for that long, which is probably the films heavy flaws. The film is far too long, with some parts that often lag. The film could cut at least 1 hour without losing much than a large dosage of special effects that could be included as an extra feature on DVD.Still, while it is even longer than the original, this sequel is actually better and it has more action and thrills than its predecessor. It's definitely longer than the previous film, but this one manages to escape the sequel curse of being but a xerox copy o the first film. This one has a new plot, concerning Capt. Sparrow's life debt with the gruesome undead pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, with a CGI octopus-altered face). The lovable characters of Capt. Sparrow, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) are back and with their much development and chemistry from the first film, there's no complaining about ""no character development"". The special effects and photography are superb as they should be. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun with his accomplishments on effects, but still manages to accomplish a product that delivers far more appeal that that those of CGI.A highly recommendable summer attraction. Much more like a theme park ride than a movie, but at that way, it's still terrific entertainment.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie was way too long! Plus the fact that it didn't really even go anywhere. To me, the whole 'Keith Richards' shtick got real old! It's kind of like drinking sour milk from the fridge, putting it back, and hoping that it will taste better in the morning! The whole saga of pirate movies, without a grabbing story, a real waste of time. I know the third one was filmed at the same time as the second one, seems Hollywood is confident that this one will sell like the other two, and it probably will.One thing that really turned the sight of the movie off to me was the sight of rotting flesh. To others, this may be the best thing they've ever seen, but to me, it was as horrible as the movie! I live with too many stupid things, why do I need one-eyed pirates rotting to death, while being chased by human squid things that have no hearts.On another note, if only the editor took about thirty to forty minutes out of the movie it might be watchable. I'm not saying it isn't now, it was just done poorly.

However, when I first walked out of the movie, I was entirely disappointed, but I felt as if I should be liking it because the first one was so great. In fact, that's the reason this review is so late.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" seems like a film Disney put out to get automatic money due to the success of the first film. However, lucky for them, they forgot they had some ""fans"" who will defend the film vehemently, no matter what people say. I've seen people with perfectly legitimate opinions on the film get bashed by the so-called ""fans"", just for pointing out a negative aspect of the film.And that is how this movie differs from the first installment. Whereas ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a fun film that most people could find numerous things to enjoy, the second movie in the series seems rather long and dragged-out, characterized by (some) shoddy effects work and flat acting from some of the main characters.However, I am willing to look past that if the film has a good plot. Unfortunately, this film did not. My biggest gripe with this film is that it basically ends in a ""to be continued""-type scenario that basically says to me ""we want your money for part three!"" And, unfortunately, they will not be getting mine. As an avid ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" fan who saw the first film seven times in theaters, the second film has greatly impacted my appreciation of the first movie. There were so many possibilities, yet it seems as if Disney decided to go for more action, sacrificing a good plot instead.And, suffice to say, Disney will not be getting any money from me for part three.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Maybe the first movie contained many of these facts but number two only gets to rotten and to much rum. The first one is a masterpiece if you compare it with this crap.First out, on of many, big disappointments - Orlando Bloom. Orlando Bloom is more awkward then ever when he through out his lines exact from the ms, where are the feelings.. where are the acting Orlando? Maybe he should talk to Woody Harrelson about a name change. He starts to feel like Ben Affleck, and that isn't a good sign. Keira Knigthley is OK, until she starts yelling and just turns herself to pathetic. I read that the movie was like a living h*ell to record, and that feeling is also in the movie. It feels just like an movie. ""Do this, say that!"" And nothing more. And, unfortunately, Keira belong to that crowd of actors.Jack Sparrow where just one of a kind in the first part, but now he just feels goofy and nag. He tries to be funny bit through the whole movie, and that's 2,5 hour.. I didn't laugh once! Many of his moves was predictable and I'm not enjoying a movie when I can tell the story to myself before I see it one the screen for the first time. It feels like they use the Jack Sparrow character in the second movie, just because he succeed in the first one. Like, why changing a winning concept? Well, if you turn a a good concept and character to bad, it drag also the first part down with it in the fall. I'm not sure that I can watch the first one again, without get annoyed on Jack Sparrow.I would prevail you not to watch this movie, even if you have seen the first one.. if it wasn't for number 3. But if that sucks too... this is just waste of time and money. But, if you aren't going to see number 3. Then you can stop with have seen number one. It contains a good story, good ending and some interesting characters. This one however, is just ""a movie"" with nothing to offer.The only thing that makes my vote go up to 3 instead of 1... is the crew under Davy Jones command and himself. But without the daily technology, even that would have sucked.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Our seating was perfect, the theater top notch. No cell phone distractions. The problem was the movie itself. No pirate adventure at all, just a silly self-parody with special effects excess. Johnny Depp was downright boring with his rehash of the mannerisms from the first film. There was neither character development nor suspense. There was no fright. In 2006, films can excess at fright, but there is just nothing scary about either a man in a Halloween Squid Man costume, nor in a giant rubber sea monster. The filmmakers give us not one reason to care about what happens to anybody. I like Keira Knightly, a lot, but it takes more than a pretty girl to make a good movie. Sadly, today's young audience may have never seen a good pirate movie. The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Blackbeard, Crimson Pirate or Anne of the Indies are seldom revived. Hollywood would not be capable of making another quality pirate movie. They have no stars of the stature of Errol Flynn or Burt Lancaster. Dead Man's Chest wasn't as bad as Peter Jackson's awful King Kong movie, but each in its own way demonstrates why 2005 and 2006 are the worst years in motion picture history in terms of quality.

It's okay to wonder why they decided to trade in a semblance of a plot and instead fill two and a half hours plus (!!!) with rum jokes.My girlfriend asked me what my favorite part was as we were leaving. To quote the ageless movie-review joke, I told her it was when the movie finally ended.I'm not a hater either, so I don't want to catch any grief from any of you. The first POTC is a great movie. I was laughing and in suspense and enjoying great action sequences.Just don't expect much from this motion picture.Remember, it's okay to admit that it just wasn't a good movie.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The first Pirates kept me on my toes with laughter and suspense and I enjoyed seeing it a few times more. This second movie will probably be added to the DVD collection.

Sure the trailers that focused on a goofy cannibal tribal scene and an octopus pirate (Davy Jones) didn't excite me much, but with Pirates 1 being nearly the best mainstream film of the 2000's (better than ALL of the Star Wars prequels, on par with LOTR), I figured Pirates 2 would surprise me...Unfortunately I was only surprised because most of this movie is a series of unimportant scenes created solely to showcase some very ridiculous but fun action scenes. Most of these scenes are overly long and contribute nothing to the story. Remember Peter Jackson's bloated (but beautiful) King Kong? This one has multiple bloated action sequences similar to the never-ending Kong battle with one then two then three tyrannosaurs in a field, with tyrannosaurs swinging on vines in a chasm, with gory bugs in that chasm, with velociraptors etc.A lot of the dialog in Deadman's Chest seems a bit hard to understand though it may have just been the theater I watched it in. Pirate speech can be a bit muddled (like this film's plot). Speaking of plot, the many on-off-on the ship transitions make very little sense. We go to locales like the town in Part 1, Tortuga, an island of cannibals, some bayou, sand reef island, other islands, and then return to these places again occasionally. The plot is much less clear than in part one with the cursed treasure. One interesting plot device is even more use of pirate deceit than in Part 1 which leaves us wondering who will redeem themselves by the end of the film or in part 3.Luckily Jack is still one of the most bad ass characters ever created, but his schtick has worn thin by this movie. He doesn't reveal much more depth and is far less surprising and ridiculous than before. Maybe part 3 will amaze us again...The antagonists in Pirates 2 are nowhere near as cool as the ghastly skeletal pirates in part 1. It seems the new enemies are basically just a chance for ILM & company to show off some creepy animalistic special effects. Think ridiculous stuff like the Island of Dr. Moreau ! I'm fairly certain there's no good reason why these soulless pirates are part hermit crab, hammerhead shark, or octopus other than some computer geek thought it would be cool. I'm sure Disney mandated the huge variety of enemies so they can release more toys and have more spooky scares in an upcoming revamp to the Disneyland ride!!BY FAR the best thing in this movie, is the last 5 seconds of the film before credits. I won't give it away, but it was perhaps the only EXTREMELY redeeming part of the movie. Let's just say it brings back an old acquaintance who happens to be portrayed by one of the greatest modern film actors. The idea of this guy, Jack, and Chow Yun-Fat together as friends or foes in part 3 is enough to keep me excited for 2007 as I forget about the bloated mess that is Deadman's Chest.Fans of action crap like Nicolas Cage's late 90s action flicks (sans The Rock) will enjoy Dead Man's Chest. Hard core special effects junkies should also love it. Anyone who's seen a lot of creative or classic adventure films will realize much of the action scenes were pulled from past films and merely extended thanks to the sometimes-curse of CGI.In a nutshell, I'd say Deadman's Chest is like the Matrix Reloaded or the Phantom Menace: Pointlessly bloated unimportant action stories that could have been a 30 minute prelude to the next film (Matrix Revolutions & Attack of the Clones respectively).Don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself. The hacks at Disney needs to sell lots of tickets to pay for its acquisition of Pixar's talent.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I think Disney went over the top with this production trying to capture too many details. I have to say that even my teenagers thought the story line was reaching a bit. Davy Jones is suppose to be a pirate not some sort of weird sea creature/pirate. Elizabeth was best played as the nearly helpless, but clever lady in the first Pirates movie than in the sequel where her behavior wasn't at all believable. The humor and the action scenes were lacking over all.

(and don't tell me that plot, characters etc don't matter in a good action/adventure flick; the first movie had plenty of action, but was an excellent story with good writing). I think the biggest problem was the editing. It seems that to please the audience base, the director chose to keep in all of the action, creating for a very long 2 and 1/2 hours; to keep it from being even longer, key scenes that helped develop the plot/characters were clearly cut.Incidentally, I went and saw ""The Illusionist"" after. 2 different genres of course, but the difference between a quality, entertaining, and well-crafted film and a hyped blockbuster couldn't have been any more glaring.p.s. a pretty dark and violent movie in places, if you're planning on bringing your kids...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong the whole cast are terrific in their roles including Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, and Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. This film isn't all that bad but it couldn't been a lot better. The acting is great, the special effects are amazing, and the action is impressive but somewhat of a let down. Gore Verbinski does do an admirable job as a director but the movie is overlong and it feels like there's just too much going on a similar problem that Spider-man 3 suffered as well. Despite it flaws Johnny Depp makes the movie worth seeing because of his fantastic performance as the charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is good as Will Turner and Kiera Knightley is equally impressive as Elizabeth Swann. The rest of the cast also turn in solid performances including Stellan Skarsgard as Boot Strap Bill (Will's father), and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones the legendary Captain of the Flying Ducthman. Nighy's unrecognizable under all the CGI effects that helped create his character. Nighy makes for an imposing villain but lacks screen time. The ending definitely leaves off with a cliffhanger and there is a surprise cameo by a returning character from the first film but by then you just want the movie to be over. At least in my opinion Dead Man's Chest is a decent movie but nothing spectacular that left me feeling disappointed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Over-all I was disappointed, but I wouldn't go as far as to say 'don't bother'.There are some great set pieces - that are amusing and well done. But the problem for me and my wife was that the film seemed to solely exist as a vehicle for these set pieces - with little or no attention to a narrative that reasonably took you from one to the next. This is something that the first film had going for it. The three-way sword fight was a great example of this - the motivations for why all three would now all want to kill one another - especially after the feeling of camaraderie at the end of the first film - was insufficient and unconvincing....Second point was that although it was over 2.5 hrs long it seemed 'rushed'... For us the film never really 'breathed'..and lines were 'spilt' out, rather than enjoyed...Third point I'd like to make is about Jack sparrow. In the first movie - despite appearing intoxicated most of the time - he was still clearly rather smart and had a sense of honour. In Dead man's chest he basically sells out William Turner - with no plan to return and rescue, and little sign of remorse... This is not the same man at all, and even a return to fight the Kraken at the end fails to make up for this for me... Plus - second time around the drunken word play, logic bits were verging on embarrassing I felt. I'm afraid the actor just didn't nail it for me this time around......or else maybe this character was only good for the one movie....Hell - there are some laughs, and as I say the set pieces are brilliantly done. The kids loved it of course, and although I wasn't as disappointed (make that angry) as I was after Matrix 2, I don't think this a worthy successor to what was a marvellously entertaining original.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The visual effects of this film were very good, but I personally found them gross. They obviously tried to change it up from the first film, but while I loved the spectral shapes of I, I got yucked out of the slimy grossness of II. Anyways, I pretty much disliked everything about this film. I may wait for the third on video.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Napoleon's greatness lies in his appreciation and acceptance of his lifetime blunder which effectively exploded the myth of his invincibility.Pirates of the Caribbean is yet another visually loaded, graphically exploited, fictional absurdity and cinematic blunder effectively transforming sublimity into utter ridicule. The special effects department and the long list of art and makeup/costume designers have virtually crafted a sore not only for the eyes but for the souls of the audience as well.Astonishingly, crass of this kind and magnitude is winning accolades from the majority of audience, because they are left with only this type of stuff to watch. Mediocrity and shallow fiction has overwhelmed the cinema and good movies have become a distant dream. The rapidly advancing motion camera and computer aided visual technology has incapacitated the aesthetic imagination and lively, vivacious portrayal of the incumbent directors, producers and screen writers. It seems, as if their sensibility and sensitivities have reached the rock bottom of human intellect.Screening and portraying weird, clumsy, bizarre and creepy creatures to provide cosmetic effect to the movie testifies to stumpy intellect of these film makers. If majority of the opinion poll recommends it as a great entertaining movie; even then, it cannot be established as such, because it has been time and again proved, substantiated and logically recognized that whatever comes out from the horse mouth (majority) is not always right and true.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The second one they just abandoned all that except for when they were recycling the same exact jokes and schtick.

When the protagonists start fencing while balancing on a gigantic mill wheel rolling down the hillside I knew this was going down the drain.The movie perfectly delivers the intended Disney theme park attitude and I guess you have to be in the mood and mindset of a 13 year old to fully enjoy it. That also explains why again this movie lacked real thrills or terror moments again, if undead seamen monsters are like this, I wonder what I was afraid of as a child. They looked ugly but not terrifying. They acted and talked as stupid as Laurel Hardy.Costumes, sets, sfx were excellent, though. The music was too much on many scenes, rubbing it in. So, if being repetitive and without any innovation is considered a solid good delivery of entertainment, this movie is a 10er. Because of all that I rate it as a 5.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the first movie, Johnny Depp struck a perfect balance with his portrayal of Sparrow, comic but not over the top. In Dead Man's Chest, he loses that sense of balance and becomes too much of a caricature. Then there's Elizabeth's sudden lack of love for Will and attraction to Jack instead. Not that you blame her, as Will is pretty painful, but it is a huge character departure from her obvious long suffering love in Black Pearl. So, for me, the plot just becomes an excuse to set up Pirates 3, which I haven't seen and won't waste my time on. The only good thing is the reappearance of Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa who was sorely missed.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film was simply awful and, since I enjoyed the ""Black Pearl"" so much, immensely disappointing.For starters, this thing is at least an hour too long. The length of the film is completely ridiculous, unnecessary and is almost as if Verbinski were infected with the same disease that ensures Peter Jackson will never shoot a film under 3 hours for the rest of his life. ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a mess. The story lacks any kind of cohesiveness and in a number of scenes I was left thinking yeah, the CG is cool, but why? What's even more irritating is that not one of the actors did anything less than a really good job. Depp is, of course, simultaneously dark and funny. Knightley is, of course, beautiful and seductive and somehow always looks classier than anyone around her. Bloom is, well, let's just agree that he fits the role and played to the limit of his abilities. What I noticed near the end of the film is what the cast lacked: Geoffry Rush. Rush provided something in the Pearl that Nighy, even with his considerable talent, couldn't possibly replace with his Davy Jones-in-a-green-suit bit.I found myself bored and uninterested after the first twenty minutes. I think the bottom line for this one is CG effects and a previously successful film has very little to do with making a movie that's enjoyable. I sincerely hope Verbinski and crew will come to their collective senses before completely destroying what should be a great trilogy.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Funny, exciting, and just plain enjoyable.Imagine me quite sad to find then, that Pirates 2, in just about every way possible, is the total opposite of the original. After all is said and done, it can most damningly be summed up as flat out boring.Oh yes, all out favorite characters are back, but the pacing and script are all over the place, and frankly it feels like we've already been there through most of it. We spend almost an hour with barely anything of note going on, and then for the remainder find the movie entangled in trilogy-itus. Plot line after plot line introduced, with no intention of wrapping thing up before we've gone on to see Pirates 3, coming out next year.Which would be fine of course, if this movie remained action packed and entertaining on it's own, but aside from a few random sparks, and an ""almost there"" but not quite ending section, this movie failed to recapture the fun of the first for me.Perhaps Pirates 3 can recapture the magic lost in what was essentially a 2 1/2 hour setup film, but I'm not particularly sure about that...","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It seems that creators Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer were more concerned with special effects than plot structure. I will be perfectly honest- the CGI was really cool. However, no amount of amazing CGI could make up for the sheer mediocrity of the plot. There was very little character development on any previously existing characters, but there were lots of new characters that just seemed to take up space.Also, the movie is altogether too long.

It was light-hearted enough to keep you from peeing your pants, but deep enough to keep you interested. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 lacks both of these. Sure there are some witty lines and funny moments ( for example, the cannibal inhabited island ), but these hardly make up for the dark, demonic scenes on the Flying Dutchman. Not to mention some pretty gruesome prosthetics. I found myself with my hands covering my eyes more than once during this movie. I was hoping for another swash buckling, light-hearted adventure. Instead I found myself waiting for daylight to come on the screen and praying that I wouldn't have night mares. The producers of this movie had a tough job in trying to make it as good as or better than the first. Unfortunately, they chose to go about doing this by making it scarier and more gruesome. More witty dialogue and involvement of relationships between characters is probably what was needed here. I think I may just be reading about what happens in the third movie.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp gave a very good performance as well as several members of the cast who I am not familiar with previously.

Also unfortunate is that, this now turning into a trend with most of the newer big budget films being strictly OK (superman recently).As almost everyone did I went into this movie expecting a good time and nothing more, but this movie was STRICTLY OK !! Despite the fact that I lowered my expectations to factor in the fact that this is nothing but a fun movie.The story is boring, humdrum AND HAS At least A DOZEN PLOT HOLES, fans of the earlier movie and the ride will point out at least a dozen more.The Story is completely unidimensional and is unable to justify the length of the movie.Heres how a sequence in the movie is ....""The giant creature is attacking................hmmm cool graphics, OK now what......the giant creature is attacking again............OK so now what................hell the creature just attacked again..........at least a dozen scenes have been unnecessarily added. I think one day the editor went for a nap and never came back.The acting was one department where this movie excelled, Johnny Depp as expected was great, HE HAS CERTAIN FLAIR ON SCREEN WHICH IS VERY ENTICING AND UNIGNORABLE (you can love him or you can hate him but you cant ignore him), the supporting cast including Bloom, Jack Davenport (the guy from coupling), and the 2 stooges was brilliant. The only complaint was from Keira who doesn't have the flair to play a pirate/fugitive.The 2 stooges were absolutely hilarious and provided some of the best comic moments of the movie.Again this movie has been made to please the entire range of demographics, (this means we have bumbling Indian Pirate which is historically true also but good), but that also means that Orlando Bloom will unnecessarily be stripped ALA Salman Khan, there is adult oriented humour, A F@#$ING LOVE TRIANGLE (MAYBE QUADRANGLE), hell as usual this movie has been voted higher by women then men.The special effects were absolutely mind boggling, (not any scene but the scale , nearly 1 in 2 scenes have computer generated elements in them), you cannot tell whether they are sets, or robotic costumed, or CG.The ending of the movie was probably the biggest disappointment with the last 15- 20 mins being very boring. Lets face it THIS IS NO EPIC and I cant why the movie-makers are trying to make one.In all movie that can best be described as STRICTLY TIMEPASS, you are assured a good time BUT YOU LEAVE THE THEATER FEELING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN BULLIED IN TO SEEING IT.+s great cast and acting, superb animation, 2 stooges, good humour +/-s Keira Knightley -s overdone and overused animation, loooooooooong, humdrum story, no real action, feeling that you have been forced to see it because of the hype.total 5/10 (only because I laughed a lot but I'm torn between honesty and promoting such ordinary film-making)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It was a tad long, but it had enough fresh material to sustain itself for that long. I thought the characters were lovable, the premise was involving, the dialog was interesting, and the visual effects were amazing. All the first movie basically wanted to do was give you a fun ride, and it most certainly delivered.Then came the sequel. I've always been suspicious when it comes to sequels, but enough of my friends told me it was excellent that all my fears were repressed and I made a point to see it as soon as I could. What I saw was a self-absorbed slog through an over-the-top interpretation of the more delightful aspects of the first movie. I say interpretation because nothing seemed to same to me as it was in the first movie. For example, Captain Jack was well played in the first movie as a chap whose brain may have been slightly toasted, but nonetheless was witty and charismatic and always seemed more or less like he knew what he was doing most of the time. In the sequel they chose to magnify and distort two of his main features: his general manner, which is depicted here as either incompetence or desperate flails at childish slapstick, and his wit, which is cheapened to ""big words"" and ""shock-value-cause-they're-so-out-of-character"" remarks like, ""You smell funny!"". That was just a rundown of Sparrow, but pretty much every character has undergone a similar deadening transformation in this film.But why get so analytical about a movie that's meant to appeal to the popcorn crowd, you say? Because I think this movie is insulting to the mind. It expects us to simply accept everything that's happening on the screen without questioning the inconsistency-ridden progression at all. I found it especially difficult to stay interested in the least while every single fight scene dragged on.. and on.. and on... and ON. Consider a brilliant sequence involving THREE MAIN CHARACTERS (which is a title equivalent to a cinematic ""get out of death free"" card) in a badly choreographed three-way sword fight that lasts for about 10 minutes. Or maybe longer, I wasn't timing it.The basic plot is decent, but this movie really is not about its plot. It's about Disney capitalizing on the charm of the first movie by saying, ""You want more? HERE YOU GO!"" and shoving this load of extravagantly adorned crap in our faces. This was truly a movie put together on the basis of demographics and financial predictions.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I walked in the theater expecting a great/exciting movie but walked out utterly confused. I take part of the blame for this because I was not paying attention in the beginning. The ""problem"" starts in the first 5 minutes of the film. You have to pay a lot of attention to what the characters are saying, especially Jack. That's when they explain everything that's important. And if you miss it, like i did, then you will probably not understand the rest of the 2 1/2 hr. movie.I didn't like how they made the movie too complicated. It was like a big whole web of mumbo jumbo. If you don't understand one part of the web, it's hard to understand another part. There were too many magical creatures and too much action. You didn't even have time to stop, take a deep breath, and relax.I think the producers were being too ambitious with this movie. They were trying to make it funny, exciting, adrenaline pumping, complicated all at the same time. They could have stuck with a nice and neat plot like the first one. The first one had a great plot, it was organized, there weren't too many twists and turns, it was exciting, romantic, and funny. The 2nd one was too much of everything that it made it difficult to ""digest."" I also noticed that there were sooo many parts that they could have just not included at all. And these scenes were each about 15 minutes long.Overall, I think this movie was a big mess with too many twists and turns, unlike the 1st one.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I liked the first one OK, but it didn't strike me as something terribly unique. Still, for a silly summer blockbuster it pretty much pushed all the right buttons and provided for a fun, if long, ride. Now there's Pirates 2 and unfortunately it not only doesn't even come close to the first one but stands right here as probably the worst ""setting a new box office record""-movie of all times. It's in fact not even a real movie but has the feel of a Bugs Bunny cartoon done in live action...only those cartoons usually last for about 5 to 10 minutes, this one drags on for almost three hours and thereby overstays its welcome for at least two hours. I'm not even bothered much by the fact that there is no real ending to this picture due to the third part, which is coming out next year. It's been less then a day since I've seen Pirates 2 and already I couldn't tell you anymore what it is about. Not that I would've been able to do so right after the end credits... That's because the only thing this movie ever does is to go ""Kaboom"" real loud. It's a shame that this flick draws in huge crowds while there are so many wonderful movies which go by completely unnoticed, yet would have been endlessly more deserving.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The term cash-cow comes to mind. This movie is just too long and uninteresting. Davey Jones and his crew are just a mess of special effects more distracting than entertaining. Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a big disappointment. I loved the first film and the special effects with the crew being dead made the SF believable but the Davey Jones character made the whole thing a joke. I have the 1st film on DVD, it is a very good film, but for me that is where it all ends. I did watch the third one to see if they had recaptured the magic of the first one but it was even more dire than the 2nd. Johnny Depp created one of cinemas great characters in Jack Sparrow and it is a shame that they didn't make sequels more along the lines of his humour with some good old swashbuckling thrown in.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I really don't like movies that finish without an end. The ""krakon"" gave me less emotion that a movie with a killer octopus in the 70ties. The gags was not really funny, and the drama wasn't really developed or resolved. To be sincere, even the TV program I was watching before going to the cinema was more entertaining... I like Johny Deep, but I think the direction wasn't very convincing with the actors. They have the same strange movements and forced expressions, which is not very nice, you know, each character should have their own aspect. Another important thing is what the movie communicate. Is a children movie, concepts like compassion, justice, and fidelity are too much faded in my opinion.

To this day I don't know, but I do know that more often than not people were harshly disappointed in it. A part of it for me was the numerous references to the first one, whether it be the dog with the keys, the ""CAPTAIN jack sparrow"", the midget (I'm not being critical of the midget but they used him for comedy to the point where it was like, 'are we laughing AT him or with him?') They tried too hard to make the movie funny. The best parts of the movie was the introduction of Mr. Turner, Davy Jones' role and the cliffhanger at the end.

If only they had picked a better movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't as bad as a film could possibly be considering that it's the same great characters and setting as the original but it's close. The film brings back the old gang of characters but pairs them with and far more memorable and gruesome villain in Davy Jones. The octopus-like villain is played by Bill Nighy with a lot of help from CGI. The plot centers around everyone trying to find a chest with the heart of Davy Jones but I had very little idea why. To say that the film is confusing is an understatement. Put it this way: if Pirates of the Caribbean was a course, I would not pass the final exam, and even though the plot isn't necessary to enjoy the good-spirited swashbuckling fun, it certainly would have helped. When the movie isn't being dragged down by the plot, however, there are a couple of amazingly innovative action scenes that almost makes you want to forgive the confusion. One involves Johnny Depp, displaying a comic physicality that could rival Charlie Chaplain, running away from a tribe of cannibals. It is hard to understate how brilliant Depp is in these films and how much he brings to the series. The other involves a three-way swordfight and a waterwheel gone awry.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The only people who have liked it so far that I've talked to have been girls, all of which admittedly were staring dreamily at Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. At the very most, I will be renting the 3rd movie, but probably downloading as to not encourage anymore movies of this nature.The sound design was quite good as was the use of color.

I can understand that kids and certain adults like this movie, but I expected the public of IMDb in general to be more critical! I mean, A SCORE OF 7.4 FOR THIS MOVIE? Comme on!! This leads to my disappointment. First of all, the movie contributes in no sort of way to cinema. It contains nothing new. It's the typical sort of Hollywood blockbuster made to entertain millions. The characters are as cliché as can be, and no charm of Johnny Depp can convince me of the opposite. And by the way, Orlando Bloom is totally miscasted. He's too serious. And the actionscenes do not make any sense at all!! Sometimes at a really ridiculous point, like when they start dueling with three men over the precious box on the beach. There's a stupid little music on the background, like the whole scene should be funny or something. Get real please. Another fascinating thing is the magic swimming ability of Will Turner!! Not only he has got pirate blood in hem, which makes him a hero off course, he can also swim faster than 200 feet long boats! No kiddin'. By Maria and Joseph, how can a movie like this have a 7.4 rating?? I can only conclude that the general criticism of IMDb is dropping. A movie that entertains is great, no doubt, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I trusted IMDb in general, often the score is ""objective"". But now I don't now.I guess I am a little p+ssed off because they keep on bringing the same rubbish, and they can, because lots of people do not ask for more...

That film was Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There is one interesting side note about it's success: it isn't very good. If you would like to see a bloated, overlong, and generally unentertaining expenditure of $200 million plus dollars on screen, then pony up for Dead Man's Chest. If you want to see a entertaining movie, then keep looking.Dead Man's Chest opens some time after the conclusion of the first entry, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) on the day of their wedding. The nuptials are interrupted by Cutter Beckett (Tom Hollander), representing the East India Trading Company, who is interested in Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and is using Will and Elizabeth to reach his goals. He strikes a deal with Will: Bring him Jack and he and Elizabeth will be let go. Jack also has problems of his own: he is being chased by the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, along with some very impressive CGI), who has survived death by becoming a combo of sea beings, to pay up a dept he owes Jones: his soul. Jack is, needless to say, interested in avoiding this, so he goes in search of a relic that will give him the drop on Jones, and Will comes along for the ride, with the plan to return to save Elizabeth.So, let's start with the good stuff: Dead Man's Chest is gorgeous to look at, beautifully photographed by Dariusz Wolski, with equally impressive production design by Rick Heinrichs. Also, the visual effects that realize Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman, his ship, is beyond superb. The crew are realized as amalgams of creatures of the deep, and their integration with the live action photography is excellent, worthy of an Academy Award nomination at the very least. And Johnny Depp is once again fairly entertaining as Jack Sparrow, although not quite as much as the first installment.All that leaves plenty of room for the bad stuff. If Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was overlong, then Dead Man's Chest is nearly unending. The film clocks in a two and half hours, and that is a minimum of an hour too long. The film moves at an absolute crawl, with enough extraneous material to fill two other movies. It takes forever to actually get going and the first hour is almost completely unnecessary setup, with lots of side trips off the main plot: Jack and crew ending up on an island where he is worshipped as a god and the crew are all food for the cannibalistic natives; Elizabeth trying to catch up to Will and Jack by hitching a ride on another ship and befuddling the crew; the Black Pearl recruiting a crew to help them out and meeting up with an old adversary, etc., etc. Most of this stuff just slows down the narrative and pads the film's running length without adding anything. It's more than an hour into the film before the real villains show up and the story finally gets going.What doesn't help is that the screenplay is almost completely unable to really explain anything that is going on. Beckett wants Jack for an object he possesses, and Davy Jones wants to keep . . . something safe. The film actually explains what these characters are after, but the explanations do nothing, because I still don't know what anyone is really after in this film. Everything in Dead Man's Chest is half-explained, and I guess the fact that this is part of a two film cycle (with another sequel to follow) is supposed to give some reason as to why full information is not given out, but it just leaves audiences head's scratching. When you sit through a two and a half hour movie and still don't really understand any of the character's motivations for doing anything, it can prove to be a letdown.Dead Man's Chest also suffers from relatively non-existent character development. Will and Elizabeth seem to have used up any depth to their characters in the first film, because they are both relative ciphers here. Their love affair has little or no passion, you don't really feel any draw to either of them, and their plight is rather uninvolving. Jack Sparrow is fun to watch at times, but his rather unbending ""me for myself"" attitude makes it difficult to latch onto him as a hero. Bill Nighy turns in a decent performance as Davy Jones, and while the effects used to realize him are impressive to say the least, he proves to not be a tremendously imposing villain.In the never ending sweepstakes to separate the viewer from their cash, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has cooked up a impressive looking spectacle that is hollow to the core and takes forever to get where it is trying to go, and once you arrive, you find that there is nothing special waiting for you.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Overall not a great film, but an okay one made really good by the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. It was an amazing performance, deserving of an Oscar nomination, but there is really nowhere to go with the character. I knew this going into Pirates 2, so I had no expectation that it would be nearly as good as the first movie. I had hoped that this movie would be a simple fun goofy romp that would essentially be the continuing adventures of Captain Jack. Unfortunately, this movie could not achieve that simple feat.The first two thirds of the movie drags on like a church sermon on stewardship. The movie spends way too much time following the adventures of Will and Elizabeth, and it seems to take forever to get Captain Jack into the story. The problem seems to be that the producers only had enough story to make one solid sequel, but of course they were greedy and decided to stretch it into a trilogy. The result is that this middle film is essentially a two and a half hour setup for the third installment. Overall there is about an hour of this movie that advances the story, the rest is just unnecessary and hokey action sequences that play to the lowest common denominator. The entire storyline involving the island with the tribe of cannibals did not advance the story at all and just served up some lowbrow humor.There was another scene where Captain Jack, Will, and Commodore Norrington engaged in a three sided sword fight that I think lasted for about 100 of the 163 minutes. When you are watching this scene, you know that no one is going to get hurt, you are just waiting for it to be over so that we can go back to the story. This fight scene include the participants riding a big wooden water wheel down a hill. I can't help but picture Jerry Bruckheimer saying to Gore Verbinski ""You know what would be cool, lets have somebody ride a big wheel down a hill, that would be cool. Wait, how about if we put a bunch of people in a spherical cage and roll that down a hill. It sure is cool when people roll down hill."" There were also a couple of action packed sequences with a sea monster, when it seemed that generic pirates came out of nowhere just to die two seconds later (Bruckheimer should have this tactic trademarked, because nobody does it better). Unfortunately the sea monster could not snag the annoying parrot or any of the other supporting pirates who always seemed to poke there heads out from the debris after all the excitement has settled down.When it comes down to it, I probably would have been willing to pay my 6.50 to see a one hour setup to the third movie, rather than have it stretched to two and a half hours and expect to actually see a movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the Curse of the Black Pearl a great deal but felt it walked a fine line between realism and supernaturalism without delving too far overboard. It had abundant, well-choreographed action sequences (except the first duel between Jack & Will which was too over the top), good character interaction, a good plot, and believably ruthless pirates.Dead Mans Chest has none of these. Characters have seemingly become more simple minded, the action sequences are too far apart and were all overly extravagant, the dialog was uninteresting, but the worst part of all had to be Davey Jones and the pirates of The Flying Dutchman.When I first saw Bootsrap Bill with mollusks growing out of his neck, I accepted that being among the undead, perhaps this could have been reasonable. But to have Davey Jones head be an octopus, and his first mate having a hammerhead shark head was just too far removed from reality to allow me to engage in these characters and took me out of the film.Taking the POTC franchise deeper into the realm of supernaturalism was unnecessary, and will ultimately doom the franchise. Had it been grounded more in realism, then the franchise would be able to survive even without characters like Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. POTC could have been a franchise that contained overlapping characters, but could have focused on telling new and interesting stories and introducing new characters instead of being character dependent. But now it is stuck in having to out do the previous film in weirdness rather than focus on telling interesting stories. And that means it will have to continue with the same cast of characters.I don't expect there to be any more POTC movies after POTC3. And I don't expect POTC3 to be any better than Dead Man's Chest. Disney has made POTC into the next Matrix trilogy. Great first film, followed by two films that were more about suckering in the audience than they were about good storytelling.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

There is no resolution. No, it's not a cliffhanger, it's zero resolution. Nothing explained. I didn't find myself wanting to see the third, I found myself regretting that i paid money to see this in the theater when I could have waited, rented the movie with my friends or family, and only paid full ticket price for the third.Beyond that, the only real gripe is a lack of any protagonist or, honestly, antagonist. All of the former lovable characters (even Jack was lovable, eh?) just backstab and betray each other every two seconds, and overall just come off as huge assholes. As for Davy Jones...he is quite possibly the lamest 'villain' in cinema history. I mean really, he can only go on land once a decade...but his crew? Of course they can. Pointless plot element anyone? All in all this movie felt like a poor attempt to stretch the franchise into three films when this could have easily had a resolved ending. Hell, look at the original...perfectly resolved ending with everyone living happily ever after, and people are still lining up the sequel. Could another completely original sequel do the same, or is this just some cheap Hollywood ploy to drag us back to the theaters.Remember, Miss Cleo (or whatever that witch lady's name was) says that there's only one way to bring Jack Sparrow back...shell out another eight bucks, you stupid jackasses!

This time Jack is on a search for the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop ""comedy"" and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality its a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. ""I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on"", said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Orlando Bloom certainly does. One has the feeling that they forgot to tell him who his love interest was supposed to be, and in his confusion he shared what little erotic interest he could muster for someone other than himself, between Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. The story is of the type where every scene is lifted from some work old enough for its copyright to have expired: ""The Flying Dutchman,"" ""Captain Cook,"" the Road movies of Crosby and Hope, etc..

I guess it's a trick used by the less talented writers. Anyway, I have no problem admitting I'm one of those less talented, so I'll simply write it down for you this way: I liked the original Pirates of the Caribbean and I like easy going brains off films as well. I still didn't like this one - not one bit.It's a film where the whole thing is played down by a few minor things, that just ruined it for me. Maybe you see it differently, but for me any lack of suspense or surprise is usually a sign of a bad film, especially when talking about a film such as Pirates of the caribbean.With lack of suspense I mean this: all the impossible and supposedly exiting scenes meant nothing to me because the heroes were such superhuman creatures that nothing really threatened them. Elisabeth Swan, the lead lady, singlehandedly cuts down.. well I don't know, would you believe fifty?... terrible monsters of the depths - the most feared creatures on earth. And she's just a high born lady, wait till you see the rest. The horrible sea monster is really no threat when Will (Orlando Bloom) takes command of the pirate ship! Harrr! Brace the main sail! Prepare the starboard guns! Argh. How the heck does he even know which way is starboard and whats a main sail, let alone a yard. I just had to laugh - why do you have to build these heroes so much, can't they just grow. Wouldn't it have been fun if Captain Jack would have stepped in front of the order yelling Will and said something like 'pardon me, but that would lead us to the reef which would lead us to sink which would lead us to die.. savvyyyyy?? now step back..' To me that just makes it so boring - anyone can do anything if they're on a just cause and you really don't need any clever plot twists or ideas to get the heroes out of trouble. All you need is Elisabeth or Will with a sword in hand and no trouble is too much. That's it. So with this there is no suspense and no surprises.This goes in the same bin with Godzilla, King Arthur, Indepence Day, Day of Tomorrow and the rest with ridiculous heroes that wouldn't even need any villains because there's no doubt they'd kick theirs butts even with an unsharpened pencil and with no working limbs.4/10 - Bad, but still barely viewable.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Expected something along the lines of the first, but no, it was disgusting, made me want to throw up the entire time and just wish and pray for the end to come. The ""bad"" characters were grotesque and slimy. Had to close my eyes during some of it. Thought about walking out if it did not end soon. It did end, with no resolution on a sour note, setting it up for a sequel which I was not expecting to happen. There was a very confusing kissing scene between Elizabeth and Jack, and to make matters worse, it was difficult to follow, as the accents were too thick to understand the language when the plot was explained. Will tell everyone I know not to watch it and I will never watch another Pirates movie again. Felt cheated, and like I wasted 3 hours of my life on this stupid movie. A complete insult to my intelligence. My husband felt the exact same way as I did. He and I don't usually see eye to eye on movies either.

This is a poorly written, disjointed, unimaginative piece of movie making that should have gone straight to video. I'm quite shocked that this movie is doing well at the box office...and with all the good reviews at IMDb...must be a bunch of studio hacks voting over and over. Did Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, and Orlando Bloom actually read the script and say ""Now that's a great film""? The dialogue is not very funny. The acting is nothing new that we haven't seen in the first movie (which I really enjoyed by the way). Depp does a good job as Capt. Jack Sparrow...but there is no charm or depth to anything in this movie.I can't write any movie spoilers because there are about 4 different plots circulating in this movie all of which make little logical sense and are jumbled together. You could take a dozen scenes, mix them all up and you'd still get the same terrible movie. The only notable good point was the CGI special effects that were done quite well. Overall this movie gets a D+ in my book.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The studio seemed to presume the core target audience was composed of retarded hillbillies, so they decided to make the movie ""accesible"" (read: brain-dead). There was some nonsense plot about pirate ghosts ( a refreshing change to the earlier pirate fags) that was more transparent than the Invisible Man. The original movies swashbuckling and Depp's performance have been dumbed down and raped to slobbering fetus covered in excrement and baby innards.

We jump from one scene to another with such little transition, it's as if large blocks of the movie were inexplicably removed.Unlike the 1st movie which started off very slow but picked up speed, this movie starts of slow and just gets slower. Johnny Depp at times seems so bored, he just slurs and mumbles through his lines, clearly forcing himself to get through scenes he also hated.Just pass on this one.

Maybe it's just because it's the sequel to one of the best movies ever. Maybe it's because it uses the same type of effects as the original. More likely, it's because the plot line doesn't really ""go"" anywhere.The ending reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back. You know, the 2nd movie of the original Star Wars trilogy. It picked up from the first movie and, predictably, leaves open a few cliffhangers to lead into the 3rd movie. If you don't mind this type of thing, then read no further. If, however, you are like me and enjoy an 'ending' to a movie, this one will bother you.The sets are beautiful, Knightley is gorgeous, and Depp and Bloom play the hero roles to near perfection. Dialogue is strong, but some of the side characters development is lacking. I won't put spoilers in here, but there are a few notable people in this movie, and we're never quite sure what their purpose is.I do recommend you go see this movie if you enjoyed the original. I plan on seeing the final piece of the trilogy next year, so I felt obligated to see this one. I suppose it will prove to be a essential piece of the puzzle, so to speak, but right now I just feel deflated and unimpressed.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

With no choice but to agree he sets off to find Jack and locate the gold- but Jack's got problems of his own, namely an unpaid debt to feared pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) that will see him cursed to eternal damnation in hell if it is not settled.Following the massive success of the original POTC in 2003, the sequel was just screaming out to be seen. But, riding arrogantly high on the commercial and critical success of the last film, this time round it appears the original film's director, Gore Verbinski, has got carried away with himself and made a very self indulgent sequel. Overlong, messy and convoluted, Dead Man's Chest simply doesn't sail the shaky tides as well as it's predecessor, creating an uneven and unfocused film that fails to sustain an interest during it's lengthy running time. I don't think I fell asleep at any point, but there was a period where it was as if I simply switched off and a large segment of the film just got blanked out in my mind.The cast are back on (mostly) good form. Johnny Depp once again crafts a very engaging and enthralling character in Jack Sparrow, a wise-cracking, charismatic rogue in everyone's bad books and Keira Knightley also returns as the heroine Elizabeth Swann, strikingly beautiful and very agreeable in the role. In the main cast, only Bloom fails to strike a chord, rather wooden and bland as the main hero. The film boasts quite an impressive supporting cast in general, from Nighy to Mackenzie Crook and Johnathon Pryce (wasted) as Elizabeth's father. But there's a weird sub-plot of them all double-crossing each other and doing anything to come out on top, as opposed to the last film where they all shared a jolly, merry camaraderie together. The film ends leaving the room open perfectly for the next film in the series but in doing so fails to provide a satisfactory ending to an already piecemeal and lacklustre story.In between everything, the special effects and action sequences have quite a neat flare to them and the script madly races along trying to keep everything above water. But where the first film set sail with a mighty roar, the first sequel seems to get lost at the Bermuda Triangle. **","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Even the seemingly endless and meaningless sword fights and battles added little to the sheer dull and boring segments of ""Pirates"" II. I seriously considered walking out after about an hour, but I did not want to disturb my wife, who was sound asleep next to me. Sure, Keira Knightly is easy on the eyes, and only became more beautiful as the film dragged on and she was subjected to more and more abuse, but who really has two and half hours to spare watching strange and slimy fish-man creatures run around.

Take the first movie, subtract all the funny lines, add a couple fight scenes that defy all the rules of gravity, add many pointless tangents off the plot, and you get the second movie. On its own, Pirates 2 would be an average movie, but compared to the original, it is an utter let-down. The overall plot is interesting, but it is presented in a way that is random and scattered. The characters all behave in a way outside their characters in a corny, not good, way.

This film is exactly what it says on the tin, A DEAD MANS CHEST! The makers of this prune juice spent more time spending money on making it look dramatic instead of sitting down and giving it a plot that manages to excite me. Once again we have Johnny ""pretty boy"" Depp demonstrating how acting in this film clearly is out of his Depp, all the guy does the whole time is shake like a junkie and come out with rubbish lines like ""yeh sorry mate"" which seriously arn't funny. He claims he based his character on Keith Richards, though in my opinion Keith Richards isn't a flaming pirate! Girls constantly rave on about how fantastic he looks in this film, though I think he just looks like he was bought in from under a railway bridge attempting to recite Gypsy King Songs on his guitar. Anybody could have played ""captain jack pinhead"" and pulled it off well. The only ""Hollywood heartthrob"" who actually bothered to act in this film was Orlando Bloom, if you can get past his constant dramatic shouting. All the other cast played their roles out fine; they weren't the people responsible for putting the music up so loud that it actually gave me a headache.I was privileged enough to see the special features on the DVD. It clearly demonstrated how much money they wasted and to top all the off, they started putting props and sets together without even knowing what the story is! They then go on to mention how they want to trim off $2million from their already ridiculously too high budget. Don't get me started on how over the top the special effects were.Now I can see why people like this film, but I just think it's one of these films that have way too much money spent on them ""High-profile"" in this day in age is ""high-budget"" and high budget seems to always make a film very tedious.

The first third of the movie is completely unnecessary; the adventures of the crew with a group of natives has nothing at all to do with the overall plot. A visit to a lady that supposedly can help them does not result in any actual information being given to the characters that they don't already know (although the audience don't know all of it, they could have cut those scenes and had an existing character exposition to Will and the audience). The scenes of Elizabeth catching up with the rest of the principles appear to be tacked on just so we wouldn't forget that she's in the movie too.So while the action sequences and humor are actually pretty good, there is so much dead time between them due to pointless (and at times, contradictory) scenes of melodrama and exposition that they could have probably cut the film down to 90 minutes or so and had a pretty good summer movie.

Even Depp's mincing, oddly flamboyant Captain Sparrow, which was the one element of quality in the original outing, has faded into the background, doomed to insignificance amidst all the overwrought special effects (Bloom and Knightley are their usual bland selves).

So many plots are too long for no reason that they become meaningless. The only notable character, Jack, goes from funny in the beginning to boring at the end. The only credit I would give is the special effects. They are magnificent indeed, but they don't save this story from misery. Not at all. All the chasing, explosion, fights, are for only one reason: another sequel. I really have no idea a successful filmmaker can be this irresponsible. Consider this: watching this film, having in mind that they are shooting two sequels at the same time; sounds familiar? Exactly, the matrix sequels. And what happened? The masterpiece first movie goes from a bad second to a worse third. I mean, if they can't make a better sequel, why don't they just leave it alone? Infuriating!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, I was greatly let down by the apparent absence of story or plot. This over-long film seems to be simply one incident after another, with no real sense of where the characters are going, no real coherence or continuity. A series of events does not a story make. The effects are - surprisingly - a little ropey too, the Kraaken looking less realistic than a live octopus. I was a huge fan of part 1 and really wanted to love this film. It's just a pity that the talented cast wasn't given more juicy lines and their characters more juicy predicaments.

Then, I had the misfortune to rent POTC: Dead Man's Chest. This is the worst kind of bad movie. Whereas Poseidon was so bad it was entertaining, POTC/DMC is just mind-numbingly bad, with no redeeming features. I fell asleep half-way through this Hollywood excuse for a film. Then I made a fatal mistake: I woke up the next morning and thought, ""Well, maybe I was just tired"" and I sat down and watched the rest. I'm sure many people would have stopped a few minutes in upon realizing ""Nope, I wasn't tired, it really IS bad"", but you see, I REALLY liked the first Pirates movie, so I thought there HAD to be something to come (a fun Sparrow moment, some really good swashbuckling, a good Knightly eye-candy moment). Nope, nada, ziltch, nothing. All this movie is - is the worst sequel to a great movie since Temple of Doom - a money-making CGI-fest regurgitation of what some writers thought would pass as film. As I can see from the large percentage of 10s it has received on this site, the film-makers obviously found something appealing to someone. The sexual appeal of the leads? The CGI? (which was mediocre at best) It certainly couldn't have been the morass of a confusing narrative, could it? Oh well, I can only speculate. And I can only hope that Pirates gets back on track with #3, which will hopefully be what The Last Crusade was to the Indiana Jones trilogy, a fun movie that makes you forget about how bad the second movie was.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Being two and a half hours in length, there is quite a lot of action and character/story development, yet the pace of the movie created anticipation and a feeling that this film is merely a go between to the third and final film in the trilogy. The reprisals of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner were true to the previous film with outstanding performances by Depp, Knightley and Bloom as well as the fabulous supporting cast including the brilliant Bill Nighy. However Nighy brought a darker and more intense mood to the film with his villain - Davy Jones. This was hard to counter act but Johnny did not disappoint with witty one liners and neither did the cast with ensemble slapstick. There were many references to the original film but i feel that some of the spirit or ""scally wag"" elements linked to the first film were lost to the epic sea battles and evil plots.Overall the film was very enjoyable and the visual effects and CGI were amazing. If you loved the original this will not disappoint and is a pleasurable experience and if you haven't seen the original i suggest you check it out before viewing the second. Enjoy the movie!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I said to myself ""This cannot be good."". Guess what? I was right.Dead Man's Chest picks up directly where the first Pirates left off. Will and Elizabeth's wedding is cut tragically short, by a pair of arrest warrants baring their names. Will, is then charged with finding our beloved Captain Jack Sparrow, retrieving his compass, and handing it over to a shifty Lord ( a clone of the first Pirate's Commodore Norrington character). Once found, Jack tells Will he will give him the compass, but only if he finds a key for him. Jack, on the other hand, owes Davy Jones a soul. So, being a pirate, he's effectively screwing everybody else, to wiggle his way out of being in Davy Jones' debt. Then Elizabeth breaks free of prison (of course) and proceeds to help Will and Jack. If you ask me, and I'm assuming you are since you're reading my review, the plot sounds like a treasure hunt concocted for a six year old. You know, the ones where this map points you to this key, which unlocks this chest, which has another chest inside it Even worse, however, are the stupid subplots we are asked to endure.While there's dozens of reasons Dead Man's Chest doesn't work, here's the main one: It should never have been made. Listen up, Disney; when you hit the jackpot, and make an amazing movie based on a theme park ride, play it safe and leave it there. Don't insist on whoring it out and creating a trilogy. Any scene without Johnny Depp (who remains Oscar worthy), is pure drivel. The entire film suffers from bad supporting actors, awful design choices, and a plot unworthy of Saturday morning cartoons. Curse of the Black Pearl was near perfect. It struck the right balance between humor, action, and plot. But in Dead Man's Chest, they are all out of whack. Badly.On to the acting shoot me now. Everyone, excluding Johnny, is terrible. Orlando Bloom continues to prove that he is nothing more than Legolas without the wig. And sadly, at least half the movie is placed upon his shoulders for him to carry; at which he fails. Keira, what happened? You had been doing so great. And even got an Oscar nomination for God's sake. But now, you're wooden and unfeeling. You make us come away cold. I'll ask again, what happened? I understand that playing an entirely CG character isn't an easy task, but Bill Nighy as Davy Jones gave me convulsions. Think of everything an actor shouldn't do in a role, and he probably did it. And the French-ish accent? God I'm literally stunned at how bad this performance was. But amidst all the terror, we have a shining star. Johnny Depp, who reprises his role as the Keith Richards-inspired Jack Sparrow, is brilliant beyond words. Complete with a drunken swagger, and more eyeliner than all of Green Day put together, he's simply a wonder to watch. Every expression is pure gold. There's just something I cannot put my finger on that makes Johnny Depp so incredible. Now, that's not to say every scene with him is perfect. The screenwriters make his character take a turn that is contrary to everything Depp had placed into the role. It effectively neuters his character, but it's hardly Depp's fault. He still remains Oscar worthy as ever.But the real problem arises when Davy Jones appears. His character is so bad, he cancels out everything Jack Sparrow adds to Pirates of the Caribbean. And to anyone who has watched the first, they know that is everything. So what are we left with once Sparrow and Jones are gone? A horrible movie.Overall, this movie had me wishing it was over during the opening scene. I won't fail it, simply because Johnny Depp is so incredible, but know that without him, it wouldn't have lasted five seconds. It's scary that Gore Verbinski can go from such extremes of good (Curse of the Black Pearl, The Ring) and bad (Dead Man's Chest). But frankly, I would have drowned myself in popcorn butter if Johnny Depp had not been in this movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, as I left the theater I felt pretty darn let down. The first one had an excellent plot which kept me interested towards the end, mainly because it had a few action sequences that were really good coupled with some excellent dialog that really drew you into the plot. However, it seems as if in Dead Man's Chest, the producers neglected the dialog/plot (which is disappointingly simplistic) and tried to make the movie all action. In all fairness, the special effects during these sequences were absolutely superb (amoung the best I have ever seen), yet they seemed like they were simply a Zorro movie with really good effects. When I say Zorro, I mean that most of the things in the action sequences are just overly contrived (etc. something falls, sets off a chain reaction, and sequence is changed in ways it never could have been in real life). The plot itself, as was mentioned earlier, was somewhat disappointing. The first movie had some of the coolest villains I have ever seen (the skeletons), however, the villains in this movie are not scary but just kinda repulsive, like a ""whats this dead animal doing out here in 100 degree heat"" repulsive. Finally, while the first movie had this air of sickening realization that curses and stuff actually exist, since this is already confirmed even at the start of the first one, the world it takes place in just seems like Neverland in Peter Pan where paranormal stuff is in fact the norm. My advice? See it, but don't let the reputation of the first one sweep you away in this air of ""I don't care about all these details, I want the sequel to be good so I will make sure and bubble on about it to all my friends."" Just take an open mind when you go see it and be accepting of the fact that some sequels do in fact, fall miserably short of the original.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I came out of this movie thoroughly annoyed and disappointed, while one of my friends came out excited and feeling quite fulfilled. So, why the difference? I cannot speak for her, but I will do my best to explain what I thought of the film.My initial response once the film ended was that it was unnecessarily drawn out. There were two extremely long action sequences that added nothing to the plot, and it seemed like they had only been placed there to fill some time. I do want to point out that I did think that the main plot was fine, but they could have covered the 2nd and 3rd film all in this film - another film is not necessary for the same story.One other thing that bothered me was the fact that so much money was being spent on the film and yet there were so many times when it just jumped out at you screaming - Hey, Look at us standing in front of this huge blue screen! Considering the scope of the film, you would think that they would take more time to make it seem more realistic. Though I shouldn't talk, it's better than I could ever do. And some of the scenes and imagery was amazing!!! The characters were as they usually were. They were fun. But there didn't seem to be the same passion as the first film. Very little development, and where things did happen, it wasn't really believable. Perhaps the characterization was left as it was because there is going to be a 3rd movie - which really is just acting as the second half of this second movie.Anyway, if you really love the Pirate movies, you will probably enjoy this one too. If you are just somewhere in the middle with it all, you will probably be like me and wish you had just decided to see anything else. It's not a strong sequel, but a sequel nonetheless - and that is enough to keep some people happy.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Watching a plot less 9 hour movie (okay, so it's really just under 3, but the movie feels like it goes on until the end of time) isn't exactly a fulfilling experience no matter how good the special effects are. Johnny Depp does a commendable job and Keira Knightley as as beautiful as ever, but Orlando Bloom is as stiff as ever and no ""plot"" point makes sense. Not to mention, did we really need to have a 30 min sword fight between Depp, Bloom, and whatever his name was? Ghastly that this movie is the highest grossing of the year. Then again, given what America craves these days (and it's not exactly quality) I can't say that I'm not surprised. It's beautiful to watch at times, but come on, I felt like my I.Q. was dropping by the point during this movie. Do yourselves a fabor, rent the first one, which actually HAS a plot to follow, and don't ask yourselves what happens next.

Maybe (Universal Soldier: The Return - 1999) for example, (Miami Vice - 2006) for another. But, this time, I was in such a great anger too!Forget all of the insane people who think that this nonsense is a movie. Forget the fact of (Johnny Depp) being a great comedian. Forget that the first movie was nice, and maybe the first in mixing pirates movies - which we really missed for a very long time - with the fantasy factor, (Jerry Bruckheimer)'s money, and perfect CGI. Forget all of that. Because HERE, you'll find nothing but reasons to turn you off!OH GOD. It's distastefully satiate, so boring, and despite the huge look; very poor. In fact, there is no nothing. No great action, or good thrilling moments. There isn't even a good dialogue or just one-liner. At one point, (Depp) managed to escape from some savages, then while getting finally on his ship, he was about to crack a punchline for his failing chasers, but he didn't. Simply no one wrote a thing for that!Explicitly there isn't anything funny, except the case of this plot which I dare anyone to understand it, or even stand it after any understanding. Scrutinize well: The good guys are searching for the dead evil man's heart to finish it, namely kill the man who already lives with no heart (!) but according to these very movies' logic, dead people used to be so alive anyway (just recall the last shot in here), so what could deter this evil man from coming back to life after this so-called killing?? He's living as a ghost already! I told you earlier, noting is funnier than this plot (funnier as odder!).Most probably there wasn't any plot in the first place. They just designed couple of action sequences, one in the middle and one at the end, then put around them too many storylines and unnecessary scenes to end up as a long painful time. Briefly, it's too much ado about nothing. And when the first was good, so with a sequel as bad as this; you must feel disappointed and deceived as well!.. And there were 200 million in the production of THIS???!!! By simple equation, this equals, in my country's money, over 100 movies where every one of them is cost 8 millions pounds. This is extra, and ENORMOUS, reason to be mad, especially when you watch this drivel of a movie!I believe the explanation is that the big success of the first one abetted (Bruckheimer) to milk more and more money from it. However, with hasty - talented in only blabbering - writing, no kind of excitement, no sense of humor from EVERYBODY, sophisticated CGI, costumes and sets--the outcome was that uninteresting heavy thing which we wanted to leave the theater while watching it since the intermission!About all the writers of all the previous comments which were entitled (First-Rate Entertainment, Great Action & Comedy, The Best Movie Ever, BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!); it's bogus, it's fake, don't you ever buy it. Most likely they were watching the first one!THE MAIN LESSON HERE IS: Don't believe the huge propaganda, and judge by yourself. But in this very case, bear the headache, the provocation, the desire to sleep.. and the anger too!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They are almost NEVER as good as the first, and if you don't expect much you usually aren't disappointed. However, I was pretty excited about this film. It was alright.Overall, the film wasn't as funny and the story was lacking. It was VERY over the top. (I mean come on...Davy Jones plays the organ with his squid-face tentacles!!) Also, I felt that the characters were not consistent with the original. At the end of The Curse of the Black Pearl, Elizabeth, Will, and Jack are a team. There is a strong loyalty between the three. In Dead Man's Chest, this seems to have disappeared. I thought that was a wrong choice. And the villain, Davy Jones, is much more evil and much less entertaining than the original villain, Captain Barbosa.This film fell prey to the thought that the sequel must be bigger than the first. There was more action and more special effects than the first (and YES, they were impressive) but they didn't necessarily add anything spectacular to the overall film. They could have kept to a simpler story with less frills and stronger writing and this would have been a better film.One bright spot, however, is the ending.

Standing in line for an hour, I was the first in my area to receive tickets to the midnight preview of the show. The theater was filled with devoted fans in costume. My, how we have been disappointed. The producers of the film, apparently only wanting to rake in the cash, have created a plot less, listless, carbon copy of the original film, which might have been a classic had it not been overshadowed by this certain failure. Pointless adventures, overblown special effects, and forced humor are rampant in the film. Worst of all, irritated fans who have waited two and a half hours for the film's conclusion must now wait another year before the many cliff hangers will be resolved. Jack Sparrow, originally a witty and lovable pirate, has become a villainous, sex-crazed scallywag with no perceivable humor. Depp cannot be blamed; it seems the script was cranked out of a Pirates of the Caribbean factory, where identical plots are slightly masked by new (and less intriguing) characters. All I can say is: perhaps Barbossa can save number three. He seems to be the only fun character left, as the others have been drained of any entertaining or honorable qualities (this doesn't includes Will's now-dull romantic dramas). And, finally, where have all these random histories come from? And what is the purpose of so many strange ancient civilizations? So many plot lines will shoot out of nowhere and go nowhere from thence, it is truly mind-boggling. Writers, I for one am sorely disappointed, and rather angry. In earnest, I feel that we devoted fans are owed an apology.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Much of the film is played for humor, but it does not work very well. I found myself shaking my head at much of the slapstick instead of laughing at it.The narrative is muddled and confusing, which is compounded by the fact that the film is too long. Too many scenes seem unnecessary and exist just to stretch things out.However, the film is not a total wash. Things really pick up in the last 45 minutes or so and set up perfectly for the 3rd installment.

And whats more disappointing is the fact that despite being overly lengthy, the movie offers very little screentime to Captain Jack Sparrow! I mean whats the point of making a sequel when you (O Director) tend to focus on everything but the mainstay of the movie.The storyline is slightly muddled so you have got to pay extra attention! C'on, director, this ain't no Godfather, you should have kept it simple.Full marks for visual effects but the weird mythological creatures shown look creepy and disgusting and you just dont want to see them. A person watches a movie like this to laugh and have a good time and not to feed their eyes with the sight of senselessly ugly creatures.The biggest tragedy about this sequel was its lack of humor!! O DIRECTOR! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!You should {/have to} watch this movie if you want to watch next movies of POC series as it is an important link.I give the deadman's chest 4/10 stars. It's predecessor set the bar really high and this one was just not good enough but SOLID PERFORMANCES by JD, Keira and OB made is passable. Thumbs up to them.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But after seeing the movie i was really disappointed. The fast paced, smooth moving story and action in the first movie is not present in this one. The movie is plagued with a weak plot, storyline or whatever you want to call it. There is the attempt at comedy with Captain Sparrow and his crew getting caught by the cannibals. This was totally unnecessary and we could have done well without it. And the crew of The Flying Dutchman could have been more scarier and intimidating than was portrayed. There is no continuation of the story line from The curse of the Black Pearl, but after watching this movie one has to watch the third part. Hope that will be better than this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, it never lived up to the first movie. I think this one had three problems. It dragged a lot of the time. The story wasn't as strong as that in the first film. Orlando Bloom, didn't hold his own with the other actors. HIgh points for this film, Kiera Knightley did very well and held her own with Depp. The set and scenery were great. It was a pirate movie. Then of course there was Johnny Depp. This movie is worth seeing, it just isn't the first one. However, I usually don't like the second movie in a trilogy setting and I think third installment has already been shot. I am definitely looking forward to that film.

First was a brilliant movie, but then came the 2nd movie...Even when not comparing it to the first-one it was disappointing to say the least. Most of the supposed to be funny moments weren't spontaneous at all, in my opinion mostly due to bad scripting/directing. There's not much you can say about Johnny Depp's acting, only that it couldn't save the movie for me.The movie felt inconsistent, forced, some things compressed into very little time, and some very lengthy things that have absolutely no contribution to the whole movie, except for making it longer. It felt like an episode of a very expensive but bad sitcom where nothing really happened except work towards a cliffhanger. I suppose I know what the highlight/peak of the movie was supposed to be, but it didn't impress me at all, and I wasn't the only-one that felt this way.One of the things that also irritated me most is that it felt like they had to fit all characters from the 1st movie back into it, which seemed unnatural, some of the characters served little or no purpose in the movie. Also, the characters in general are inconsistent, certainly towards the end it goes completely wrong. There's little interaction between Keira and Orlando, virtually none between Orlando and Johnny, and a little bit between Keira and Johnny, but not much at all. The movie doesn't concentrate on characters at all, which was one of the better things in the 1st movie, which also resulted in most of the funny moments. Now the focus seemed to be on special effects and some far too long script to tell what there is to be told. Making an 'extensive' resume of the story would take fewer lines than I wrote here in this comment.I wouldn't go see the movie when you haven't seen the first-one. A few of the moments that actually made me smile were references to the first-one, and also the script relies too much on the audience knowing what happened in the first movie and knowing the characters. Offcourse it is a ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"", so some things could and should refer to the first movie, but this much? No thank you...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first movie, though long, was fresh and fun. All the acting was good and Depp's character was especially charming. The sequel is even longer than the first movie and shows us nothing different. Depp's character, though still fairly endearing, borders on annoying and the fight scenes are too long. Dead Man's Chest has all the bits and pieces of an fun action/adventure movie, but overall it just feels tired and a little overdone. If the movie had been half as long it would have been twice as good. I have to give praise where praise is due, though - Davy Jones and his crewmates are pretty darn cool. They are the best part of the movie. Hooray for Davy!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Unlike the first film more time is spent on the other characters like Orlando Bloom, which is a shame as his acting isn't as sharp as Mr. Depp's.One other thing was the special effects in the first film were fantastic, the second were also as good right up to the Cracken, the CGI stood out very badly from the live action film.The above are minor complaints on an excellent film that's why I rate it 8 out of 10, but lets hope the third installment picks up the pace a little more.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I do give a nod, however, to the visual effects which were stunning, but a film with such a big budget tends to drift away from direction and screenplay and focus only on visual effects which in turn does not make a good movie.

"5","/10","How to make a successful sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1416979/?ref_=tt_urv","Polaris_DiB","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5232724/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2006","Trying to make a successful sequel is an interesting thing. There's a lot of expectation, but where the expectation comes from is contradictory--on one hand, everyone expects the same characters and the same general quality as the first movie; on the other hand, they don't want the same movie with repetitive, tired jokes. In a movie like Pirates of the Caribbean, which is very popular mostly by force of its interesting and dynamic characters, that line is a bit harder to hit because everyone is attached to the characters, but don't want them to ever really be damaged.I would say then that this is a very successful sequel. It doesn't necessarily rely upon the first movie, but a lot of what is going on is very aware of the first movie's influence on these characters. It brings back almost all of the characters, major and minor, from the previous movie, but it does accept the task of taking the time to develop them. In a sense, a lot of what happens in this film could be considered unnecessary pandering towards icon recognition. In the opposite sense, this movie seems willing to take risks with character development that might not be agreeable. I personally consider the two to even themselves out and create a sufficiently self-contained movie experience.A major issue with the film is its ultimate tie-in with the next sequel. This movie, like The Matrix Reloaded, is a bridge between two different movies that deal with different issues. It would probably behoove any potential viewers of this movie to understand that while it has a sort of climax, it doesn't really have a complete story-arch. Don't go expecting to have the complete story else you will be very disappointed. Go to see where the next movie will take you and figure out where the character development is going.Many have said that this film is ""dark"". I don't really consider a lot of the imagery darker than the original... this one does seem to like its Eldritch horror, but what really makes this movie less light and enjoyable than the first is that for the first time, we see the characters (and especially Jack Sparrow) at their very weakest. Throughout the first movie there's a sense even when things seem to be in conflict that the character's overall capability will eventually work itself out. In this movie, the characters themselves are completely unsure of themselves (the compass, anyone?). This development is actually why I really like this movie by itself: we know Jack the graceful but klutzy looking sort-of-drunk, but now we get to see Jack the nothing seems to be working out serious captain. We also know Elizabeth and Will the lovers, but now we get them not quite knowing what they're doing for each other as well. Because it's such a big change from what they were in the first movie, it does seem almost necessary to have them resolve it over two more movies.The idea of forcing it into two movies is kind of depressing to me; technically, there is no rule that says a movie must be between one and a half and two hours long. A movie could be a stunning narrative and still be five hours long. However, Hollywood does know audience impatience, and as many people have said about this movie: ""It starts to get a bit long..."" Nobody seems willing to sit down to watch a complete four-hour narrative, so instead they are more willing to pay the price of two tickets. If that's the way their time is valued, that's the way their time is valued, and I don't think I can really do much about that.So for what it is, this is a very good movie. The strong parts are the ideas behind the character development (though I still don't think Knightley nor Bloom really have that much ability to carry the weight of serious acting on their shoulders) and the very inventive action. The swashbuckling is presented to quite an extreme degree here, and a lot of it is actually quite surprising in where it goes.Go out and enjoy it. Most everyone else is.--PolarisDiB","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

They took personalities and dramatic elements from the first and made a caricature of the whole thing. It decided not to take itself seriously, which in some cases can be nice and self depreciating, but in the case of making a sequel it shouldn't do this, since it insults the fans that went to watch it the first time around. I swore this was directed by a different person and when I learned it was Gore Verbinski again I felt ashamed that he had turned his back on such a great story and turned it into a cartoony farcical piece of garbage. The performances seem rushed as many films do when they are trying to rush production doing back to back films. I have looked at the cast of the next pirates movies and it looks to be more of the same. It is unfortunate people become fans of the first and blindly follow the next few films unwilling to look at it critically.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything sadly about the character is wrong. The timing is off, the spontaneity has evaporated and everything about Captain Jack seems formulaic, as if conforming to the concept generated by the media, rather than the narrative. The franchise killed the character. The theme park ride increased, toys were made along with imitations present in films such as Epic Movie and somehow that got into the head of the much loved star. And it is the script above everything else that destroys this film, and our hero.Curse of the Black Pearl worked so well because it was relatively simple. Sure the complex ideology of the Aztec gold had heads working overtime but the character story lines were basic but entertaining. Here there are too many additional protagonists, the effects are all over the place (Oscar winning or not they are too muddled and too in your face) and the political agenda enforced takes the shine of the pirate tale.The additional Governors, villains and crew feel encoded for the vastness of the scenery rather than the significance of the plot. They are there to make the story feel huge, but oversteps into overwhelming and incomprehensible Yes the effects are fantastic. The Dutchman is visually stunning and the darkness of the first is given a vivid shake up by this depiction of evil pirates. However the story of Jones' love life and his protagonist in general bring the imagination down. His image too is way overdone. The skeletons in the previous film were just right for fantasy, but this feels like a sick nightmare rather than a legend of the sea.The political madness ruins the fun and imagination of pirates and you have to wonder why this is even encoded in the first place.Dead man's chest offers a computer generated sequel that is consistently poor with infrequent surprises and a tendency to attempt the far fetched when the simple mildness of the first would have sufficed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So it's only a matter of time before sequels followed. And because the ship ain't broke, no major fixing was done. Everything from the first film was there: from the amusing one-liners to the excellent special effects here and there. And yes, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are all in a second go for a ride, including director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. In short, everything that made ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" a work of entertaining summer fun was there. Except for some.Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) are about to be married, but no sooner than the movie had begun when they are arrested and condemned to death by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). But Beckett offers a reprieve for Turner if he can give him Jack's compass (a compass that points to one's true desire).Meanwhile, Captain Jack is warned by ""Bootstrap Bill"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård) - Will's father - that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is set to settle a debt Jack owes the ruler of the sea and captain of the Flying Dutchman. Jack must find a way to pay his debt to avoid serving Davy Jones for a long time. So we have Will after Jack's compass, Jack after Davy Jones' heart hidden in a chest buried somewhere (hence the movie's title), Elizabeth after Will, Bootstrap Bill after the safety of his son, and former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) after Jack to reclaim his lost honor.Therein lies the movie's problem: it didn't quite work the second time around (for me at least, because as we all know, this film shattered a lot of box-office records in its first weekend run). The first one was thrilling, funny, and entertaining, albeit in a Jerry Bruckheimer-flick kind of way, which is turning your brains off. The sequel is still exciting, humorous, and entertaining. But unlike the first installment, ""Dead Man's Chest"" lacks focus. The overstuffed storyline might have seemed reasonable in pitching the story before it's green-lit but it comes across as similarly confusing and confused. Verbinski isn't exactly a household name in terms of big movies, but his work in the first film (and in ""The Ring"" to some extent) clearly shows he has a knack for escapist film-making by crafting the picture in a simplistic but enthralling enough manner that didn't hinder the characters, the action, or the adventure. It also seems that the scriptwriters tried to take everything in the first film and bloat it exponentially.Some of the action scenes seemed a little otiose and without neither reason nor rhyme, which stripped it off of a sense of urgency that made the first film thrilling in the first place. And granted that the special effects were of visual caliber my academic daydreams are made of, it feels like virtually every aspect of the original is rehashed and then geometrically pumping up every detail into something bigger. I'm actually a fan of the first film (not a big fan, but a fan nonetheless) but ""Dead Man's Chest"" is just turgid in every sense of it. Only the still likable cast (Depp made a lot of college girls in the audience swoon) and the prevailing fact that Verbinski proves to be more effective at delivering pure popcorn flicks recently than the likes of Michael Bay and Rob Cohen keep this film barely afloat.""Dead Man's Chest"" film has all the things that made ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" work, and yet the paradox of it all is that while it's crammed, it feels lacking in the end. Partly, of course, due to the blatant come-on for the third ""Pirates"". Still, this second ride's more exhausting than thrilling.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Despite it being a Disney film, I wouldn't recommend it for kids. People die. A lot. In a variety of nasty scenarios. And as seems to be the trend with trilogies, it hardly had any plot at all.

I'll even admit to liking ""Cutthroat Island"". This film however, I do not like. OK, I did not walk out of the theatre on it but when I finally did (after the film was over) I was very disappointed.So, what is there not to like? Plenty. This is the first Johnny Depp film I have seen where he is not interesting to watch. I would not say he is outright bad in this, but he is sort of on autopilot, reducing his Jack Sparrow to a very 2D character, who I lose all interest in weather he lives or dies. The same is unfortunately true for the other two main characters. The CGI is sometimes horrible, but at the same time in other places it is oddly enough some of the best I have ever seen! Further: the plot. Where in the Curse of the Black Pearl, it was the Aztec gold that was cursed, I could buy that. Now everything and everyone seem to be at least a little bit supernatural, which is not just as fun. Also where the CotBP was a well-balanced film for the whole family, this should not be seen by anyone over 12; it is all slapstick and effects.It would have been nice to see another CotBP-type sequel and not the typical Bruckheimer- sequel: more of everything (especially grand effects), leaving no room for the actual film.But the worst, by far, of it all is that I will still go and see the third... Even though that is also part of what annoys me; instead of getting a good and enjoyable film, we get a product that just makes sure that we buy it. I wish that someone could have loved this project like Peter Jackson loved LOTR. Do not get me wrong though, I am all for a free market and I do think that we deserve what we buy and since I'll continue buying this, I guess I deserve it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was exciting, and the characters were charming and entertaining, and strangely believable. Sadly, now that Pirates has become a sensation, the plot of the second film shriveled to nothing more than fluff. The action isn't even particularly compelling, and the characters actions are not believable. In a good story, we are always willing to suspend our disbelief in the impossible and become engrossed in the lives of the characters. This never happens in Dead Man. In fact, at many points during the film, I was focused on thoughts such as ""oh, look, now the actors had to do this"". It was very much a parade of effects and glorified fight scenes and chases. Stereotypical. Predictable. Boring. Disappointing. I still give it a 5/10 because I loved Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. But I'm angry that they didn't measure up to a standard that I think should have been possible. I'm sure the merchandising will be very successful... and of course, that's what it's really all about, isn't it?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen (see white chicks for that) but at the same time I did leave the theater very upset. I can appreaciate that this movie is part of a larger story. I loved the matrix trilogy and it employed the same release path. But the major difference between the matrix trifecta and pirates is that of marketing. Everyone (read: who cared) knew that when they went and saw Reloaded in May of 2003 that they should not have expected the story to come to any kind of conclusion. It was well known that there was a third movie coming out 6 months later and that it would pick up right where it left off. However with this movie (possible spoiler i suppose) that was not the case. When ______ (that guy) came walking down the steps at the end, I fully expected the movie to march on. In fact I was pleased that the movie stopped putting it off, then that very thing happened. Right when the story (or at least one of them, there were too many to count) was about to come to resolution the credits rolled.Now to be fair I have no problem with a clifhanger. Its going to a movie expection to see some story, with an ending, and instead I get a gigantic clifhanger. FOR A MOVIE THAT Isn't OUT FOR ANOTHER 10 MONTHS! With that rant about the ending (lack of one) over; the movie was still visually appealing, and rather entertaining. Granted it was dull at points, and the dialogue was hard to understand, it was still overall good; if you can deal with watching a 2.5 hour trailer for the next movie.Summery: No ending, heavy accents, slow at times, great cgi, Capt Jack Rocks.Recommendation: Read a few spoilers, save 8$, see the third one its only 250+ days away.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Johnny Depp is not the central character this time and shares equal screen time with Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. The film is slow, dreary, and drags at times. The comedic lines looked hammed up at times, desperately trying to pull a laugh from the audience when there really is none. At other times, the editor clips away from the moment much too soon for your brain to register that a line or action might have been funny.The character, Captain Jack Sparrow, was the center of entertainment in the first film with others interacting in HIS story.

I did. The three previous movies of Gore Verbinski's (The Ring, Pirates 1 and The Weatherman) I cherished. They showed a rising director who had talent. This film is nothing like those movies or for that matter, even ""Curse of the Black Pearl.""While watching the film, I got the sense that I was in a test screening to see what works and what isn't. Then the realisation that I wasn't in a test screening, I was in an opening weekend viewing sunk in. It was a realisation i wish I would not have had, because I was desperately wanting to fill out the card and voice my opinion.My main problem with this film is that they didn't try hard at all. The only thing it felt like they tried at was to re-establish how good the first movie actually was. I'm guessing that like me, most people loved the comic lines from the first film. Unlike the first film though, they don't subtly throw them out anymore. The comic lines in this film aren't thrown out to the audience; they gave us the equivalent of putting us in a batting range and hit all the ball to us at speed's so fast that the laughs aren't even over with before they expect us to laugh again. The laughing may cause to miss key points.The acting was another disappointment from this film. Don't expect another nomination for Johnny this time. Yes, I am saying that Johnny Depp even was unbearable in this movie. It's not that he was bad in this movie per se, it's just he attempted to completely copy everything that made his performance in the first one so great. Exclude the character development from the first movie and he's still the same antagonist; even this time he's not likable, in fact, one could possibly say he is the most unlikable thing about the whole movie. Even Stellan Skaarsgard was understated in this film and I think he's an amazing actor. Looking back on this film, the only character I did like was Kiera Knightley's who this time around wasn't just reserved for eye candy but actually had things to do.One of the things I did like was Gore Verbinski's amazing cinematograghy. Except the problem with his cinematography was that he uses amazing shots in the middle of an action that takes you out of the movie and has nothing to do with what's going on. Peter Jackson esquire, except PJ makes his cameras useful for the scene and not a way to say ""Wow"".On a closing note, this was one of Hans Zimmer's best scores he's done*****/**********","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The rest of the cast was great (Rush, Knightley and Bloom) and overall that was the best pirate film since the classics of the 1940's and 50's.Unfortunately the sequel Dead Man's Chest really sucks. This is a comic book without the heroes. If you like comic book movies, Spiderman and X-Men were way better and much more intellectual.Sure the effects were ambitious and at times impressive, and the island scenes pretty, but the natives were goofy rather than intimidating and the whole aftertaste was all like a nightmare rather than a dreamy fun adventure.The plot is convoluted. The script dumb. The storyline unbelievable and the special effects over the top and aimed at the Saturday morning cartoon demographic. Even with the same previously excellent cast, the acting is sub-par. Depp's performance is lackluster. He stretches his old character awkwardly without introducing anything new and his humor is less funny the second time around. I don't think it's his fault, it's just that the producers wanted sequel cash and spent their energy on effects and not on a script or a story. While the first film had some authenticity to it even with its fantasy visuals, this film seems to be aimed only at 12 year olds who want to see lots of slime and monsters. Who cares about an intellectual dialog? I was extremely disappointed and am no longer looking forward to the next sequel which is so unabashedly teased at the anticlimactic end.I'm sorry but this film drops the baton. When is someone going to make a real pirate film with historically authentic villains and Das-Boot realism? Today's technology should be used to help a film not hurt it. I want to see authentic villains like Rackham the Red or the fierce Blackbeard who would drink grog and gunpowder, and light matchsticks in his beard to scare the enemy. That's way cooler than an octopus head or hermit crab face. Imagine what could have been done with a realistic evil captain who steals the gold and the lovely love interest...anyway I digress.This film is like a video game without the joystick.I wish Davy Jones' locker had never been disturbed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film did have it's action, and there wasn't really a break from the constant movement. The thing was that it was too filled with special effects and action sequences, it's my firm belief that effects are great unless they're overdone. Unfortunately, it was overdone. It seemed that they just wanted to push out a movie to capitalize off the previous movie's success and didn't care as long as they got it out there. It wouldn't of been as bad if the movie hadn't of been as long as it was or if it had been building towards something meaningful, but it was dragging on for no real reason. The ending was terrible as well.So, in all, I'd say I was disappointed. The main theme of my criticism is that action is fabulous but when it's overdone it doesn't sit well in one's stomach. I'm going to see the third one hoping it recaptures some of the first film's magic, but I won't be holding the same expectations I was holding for this film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

As for Kiara Knightly and Orlando Bloom, they know the character but the don't seem to be in love with it. As for Jack Davenport and Bill Nighy they didn't seem to have a clue what this movie was about. Next was the storyline. What where they thinking. They pick the cheesiest sea tale (Davy Jones) and make the story so so completely far-fetched and ridiculous that the audience can never figure out know what is going on.

After viewing Dead Man's Chest yesterday I can understand what critics were saying. The first ""Pirates"" was an exciting fast paced ride and featured strong performances from all of the lead actors. However, this installment of ""Pirates"" is pretty much all special effects and nonstop action with little attention paid to the actual plot. It seems as if the director had no real storyline planned and just strung together a series of exciting scenes loosely connected by weak dialogue. The cast's talents are wasted: Jack's performance feels half-hearted, Will Turner barely comes across as our hero, and Elizabeth's scenes feel like an afterthought. Their screen magic that made the first movie a success is replaced here for multimillion dollar computer generated technology. Overstaged by special effects, Davy Jones isn't close to the same villain as Rush's Barbossa. Not to mention there were only half the amount of laughs. All in all, this film (which at 150 minutes plus 40 minutes of previews is just way too long) feels like it will only act as a wobbly bridge to connect the first and third film -- and I hope they take more care with storyline in the final installment. While Depp was nominated for an Oscar for his work in the The Curse of the Black Pearl, I see no academy nods in store for this summer popcorn flick.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Perhaps, it is because of the elongated approach of the fundamental narrative or the unnecessary prolongation of the storyline that had me perceptibly aggravated.Don't get me wrong, I do like it when movies get into the nitty-gritty of a concept but here the case is slightly different. It seems like the story has been lengthened for no apparent justification whatsoever other than blatantly breeding a two & half hour long feature. As a result, except for a few eventful occurrences, everything else came off as somewhat out of place, 'congested', and 'convoluted' in a sense.That being said, I still believe the audience who fancy such fantastical elements would have a great time nonetheless.

The theater was full 20 minutes before show time, the anticipation was electric. I was expecting the audience to be as much fun as the movie.And in a way, I was right. Once the film started rolling, the air went out of the crowd pretty fast. A slow, boring opening, followed by a rather ridiculous sequence that just provided a vehicle for Will to meet up with Jack Sparrow. You might ask how I could condemn something in a POTC movie as ""implausible"", but I will. The whole sequence wouldn't have been less forced if Will and Jack had bumped into each other at a Starbucks in Tampa.It picks up somewhat after that, I suppose, but it still has more stuffed in that it needs or can competently carry. It seems they had a lot of ideas from people they couldn't say no to, so they threw it in somewhere.Jack Sparrow was considerably less animated than in ""Pearl"". It looked more like someone playing Johnny Depp playing Jack Sparrow than the brilliantly eccentric performance of the first movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, well, they're still gorgeous. Davey Jones is particularly interesting visually, as are some of the other human/sea creatures. Many of the humans are a waste, sometimes overdoing old jokes from the first movie. It's only ironic once when a pirate shows a surprising flash of educational sophistication.This whole second movie is just a setup for the third movie, and that's not the only way it reminds me of ""Star Wars"". One of the creatures in particular I think ILM just pulled out some of their old work from ""Return of the Jedi"". Others in my clan noted similarities to Indiana Jones movies, and that some of the bad guys seem to have patterned their characters on Orcs. Sigh. I wanted so much to love ""Dead Man's Chest."" And I don't hate it, just like I didn't hate ""The Empire Strikes Back."" But both left me unsatisfied, for a lot of similar reasons. I don't like paying full price for what's essentially an extended trailer for the next sequel. I'm disappointed when a terrific actor playing a terrific character comes out flat the second time around. (Let's hope Johnny Depp doesn't fall as far as Harrison Ford did the third time around.) And it's only a minor compensation when the character special effects are drastically improved over the first round.Advice: See ""Dead Man's Chest"" but don't knock yourself out. It will be in the dollar theater soon enough.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is a bit confusing but as the plot unfolds you realize the genius of it all and begin to really appreciate it. The biggest fault of the movie though is the humor. They took the stuff people found funny in the first film and glorified it, just over-doing the same-old jokes. Especially about the rum. Another fault are the graphics. Just about everyone in Davey Jones' crew, including a giant octopus they have, have much animation, if not all animation, put into it and though the effects are good, it still kind of seems too sci-fi and fake. But the plot makes up for the both these faults, despite the abrupt ending that will leave you waiting for the 3rd one. This one is definitely a two-parter with the next movie. The action is all right, most of it is at the end. I feel that they've taken some of the action from the first movie and replaced it with comedy. But the adventure in this movie is just fantastic as well as the story-line which they've set up greatly for the next one.

It was a great shame when the film ended.First chance I got, went to see POTC2, full of optimism and was left painfully disappointed.Everyone, from the director down to the person who carries the props, seems to have believed that if they put Johnny, Kiera and Orlando in the same film, give them the same character names and tell them its about pirates, then a wonderful film would surface.It didn't.The humour, such as it was, was scant. Depp seemed to be trying too hard to be funny and he had lost some of the 'campness' which made Captain Jack Sparrow a classic character.Knightly seemed unsure as to her role. Is she there as a role model, a foil to the humour, a heroine or a combo of all. Whichever stool she thought she would sit on, she fell slap back in the middle.I'm afraid, and I know many people will disagree, but I have yet to see Orlando act! To me, he is eye candy for the girls.In much the same way that Empire strikes back / Two Towers were sequels that set the scene for the final episode, the second installment gives the impression that the baddies have the upper hand. As we know from Return of the Jedi / The King, the good guys will, eventually, come through.Hopefully, by the the time POTC3 is finished, Captain Sparrow will be clear as to what he is, good or bad.A real waste of time and money.

The whole film jumped from one special effect after another, with no attempt to have the characters relate to one another. Granted, these special effects were spectacular, but what purpose did they serve beyond themselves? If I were ten years old, I would appreciate them more and expect little else. I only hope the third film will be an improvement and have lots more of Depp and Davey Jones.

I went to the theaters to watch it expecting a lot, after I saw all the media coverage and the teasers on the tele. Well after all the upcoming movie trailers the movie started off and right from the beginning it wasn't clear as to what was happening on screen. The usual fake pirate acting done by all of Jack's men excepting for him of course, more unfunny funny sequences, more mindless acting and some of the actors looked as if they didn't know what the heck was going on.Well let's talk about the movie now, it's totally useless, boring and senseless. Just people running around involved in boring fight scenes. This movie had a lot of senseless jabbering as well, there were certain points during the movie that I couldn't be bothered listening to all the chatter going on screen and thought why I wasted money on this. The 2 out of 10 was for the CG or CGI as some would like to say it was pretty good but this alone cannot save this sinking ship. I think some reviews were just being considerate and polite by giving it good reviews but the fact is that this movie is boring and a big disappointment. Whatever happened to all the good swash-buckling high seas adventures that we have come to know of in pirate movies.Let me put the script in a nut shell - Jabber,Jabber,Jabber,Fight,Jabber, Jabber, Jabber, Fight...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Then Norington who would push honor and sacrifice above all turns into an egotistical, vengeful villain. The writers are clearly not the same-it lacks all the wit and charm of the first. Finally, yes the original was fantasy, but this crossed (for me) into the ridiculous.

Like the original, the film combines comedy and some good performances along with a creative set and special effects. It's an average action film and the perfect way to spend an evening. However, the film seemed to be a little too long, and the other problem with it was that it did not have a proper ending. I was getting built up to a good ending, but it just did not come.

I honestly wish so much that Disney hadn't made this movie because if it had been made by say Warner Bros. it may have been better and far less typical. This is the one thing I have always noticed about Disney movies, all my life. They are all very cliché and typical (by typical I mean the typical plot line or the typical ending or the typical romance...etc) they have no substance to them all they are is love scenes and victory, I have not once seen Disney even attempt to create a movie that actually has something to do with the way REAL life works. The first was far better. Too much affection in the movie to be called ""Disney."" Disney should be ashamed. And many people probably wanted to push that bimbo off deck.& 2) It seemed to drag on forever, it was incredibly long to me. And when it finally ended it didn't even really end.This is definitely not the best movie I've ever seen but definitely not the worst either.

The movie was 2.5 hours long, therefore, had plenty of opportunities to offer viewers what should have been left behind at the editing room. Trivial stories felt uncomfortably short to add anything significant to the whole picture but frustratingly long to be entertaining. That's what was appealing for the first one: clever, clean cut, and stylish.Unfortunately, all those elements are all but present in the sequel. The jokes are cheap and only drawing mindless and cheesy laughs. Even Johnny Depp looks like he's not very good at imitating himself. Granted, his performance in the first one was phenomenal and above all, original (only as a pirate and only in the movie industry) but his acting in this one at times pushed it too far that it seemed old and tired.Computer generated images play too much of a role here. Too much of a role that human acting almost appear insignificant. Somehow, it reminded me of The Lord of the Ring, just less impressive and less coherent.Finally, the ending was so obvious as a cliff hanger that it was nonsense and, well, shameless!! Overall, having watched the first one, I found Dead man's chest amazingly disappointing. The kid sitting next to me, for the most part of the movie, kept looking around like he did not want to be there.

I first walked into the cinema thinking that it would give me some entertainment though i was dead wrong. Walking into the picture i felt fine though after about the first half of the movie and being so unattached from it i started to get a headache from the pointless action.The visual effects are quite good though the main problem with the movie is that there is no storyline or developing of the characters relationships what so ever.Johnny Depp portrays a fantastic performance as jack sparrow, though all of his sayings were just conveyed over from the original movie and slightly changed making them very dull.Spoiler warning , ...It seems that some one just wanted to add a mystical undersea Kraken beast into the gist of the story. They also could not think of a better way of keeping the audience slightly intrigued so they put it in half way through the movie, not allowing for a climax trying to drag it on for 2 and a half hours which is just stupid. In the end though u find that the characters have no relationships with each other and have not developed what so ever and they also continue the stupid joke about burning rum which was finished in the first movie, yet they repeated it numerous amounts of times.The finale of Jack Sparrow getting eaten by the Kraken is just pointless and didn't need to occur. The movie also has aspects that come out of no where and do not happen again through out the story. At the beginning the movie can be seen as being more gruesome with crows picking out the eyes of prisoners though this is not continued and yet again pointless because it would increase the parental rating. An aspect to why the first one is so much better is that it allowed the audience to see the characters develop. Though this one lacked it immensely and the ending of wanting to continue the story made you think why?, its just so pointless.The movie lacks so much that the fist one did, mainly due to it giving me a headache due to the pointless action and unattached i give it a 5, i would have given it less but Johnny Depp's performance saved it and is probably why people would still like it so much.Though due to no character development what so ever and pointless action it made it a bad sequel not dealing with matters that would have allowed it to soar.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Fun, exciting, enchanting. The sequel is long, boring, and pointless. Johnny Depp has become a pale characterisation of his former self. Didn't grab me at all. He over-acted in away akin to Willie Wonka. For a man of such accomplished talents his choices of recent film and his acting in them has been at best cringe-worthy and at worst plain bad. The scenes where he runs along the beach away from his cannibal captors just makes me wonder why would anyone want to run in that manner in the first place. The charm that Depp can so easily create in a character is lacking.It's the first film repackaged without any of the charm. I guess you expect lots of Pirates running around doing Pratt things and if that floats your boat, then fine and dandy. I fell asleep. Honestly, in a packed cinema, I couldn't keep my eyes open.There are lots of returning characters from the first film, in which they were adequate if not essential. Here they are brought back without any great purpose- and I couldn't remember who half of them were.I know they are making the 3rd film in the franchise- one was enough for me, I have no desire to see a third.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The entire movie is almost exactly the same as The Black Pearl, only the treasure is something different. But where the first film could keep your attention by a good and original story line and nice action scenes from time to time, Dead Mans Chest seems to have lost that. There are way too many action scenes and most last too long. The story is as predictable as what and the romance is so annoying. If you look at the storyline I think this should not have been a trilogy because part 2 and 3 (if 3 is going to be like this) could well have been 1 movie. What's left is a brainless action movie.

Special effects, see, are *special* because you save them to make create a *special effect.* When you are looking at a special-effects, octopus face throughout much of a movie, it becomes ... less special.Bill Nighy, who played Davy Jones, the character with the octopus on his face, can be a thrilling actor. He was riveting as an aging rock star in ""Love, Actually."" You couldn't take your eyes off him. And he didn't have an octopus on his face. He was just ... ACTING. *Acting* really well, from a *witty, surprising script,* that engaged him in *an interesting plot.* Gee ... could POTC take a clue from that? What difference do POTC:DMC's visually fabulous hamster-wheel stunt, or its fruit-kabob stunt make, if you don't have a coherent plot, built up through well written dialolgue, acted by characters you care about? Captain Jack Sparrow was such an endearing character in the first pirates; why was his character wasted in ""Dead Man's Chest""? Why did he have few to no scenes to develop this well beloved character? The movie pretty much ignores any effort to build up Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightly) or Will Turner's (Orlando Bloom)'s characters.Oh, I know you're going to go see it. You know you're going to go see it. And no matter how many reviews this movie gets that criticize its complete failure to pay any attention at all to character, plot, and dialogue, it will make bazillions of dollars.Which, in a sense, is a shame.

It wasn't as good as the original, but it was an awesome film and does not disappoint.Acting: Amazing. Everyone is at least good. I would say Bloom did a great job, and Depp was amazing. But Nighy as Davey Jones was the best. What an amazing villain. He made the villain seem SO EVIL and so badass and so cool, YET...you knew that there was another side of him. A+Action: Wow. Just...I didn't expect it to be THIS good. The sword-fight at the end is one of the best ever. A+ Pacing: This is the biggest problem with this. Like many blockbusters that are around 140+ minutes, this suffers from pacing. Some scenes were unncessary and somes scenes weren't shown that should have been. B F/X: Amazing. It was so amazing that I didn't even rememebr that Davey Jones was mostly F/X. A+Story/plot: A entertaining story that gets better and better as it progresses. The ending was PERFECT. A Overall: A. I have seen 8 films this year at the theater, and this is by far the best one.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

My roommate bought it and a bunch of us were watching it. I walked out after the first 20-30 minutes. I can't remember exactly. I feel like this movie was completely mislabeled. It was disgusting. I am extremely upset and disappointed at Disney for letting such filth be tagged to their company name. I am only 23 but if I had 13 year old I wouldn't let them watch it. It is quite disturbing. I automatically assume if Disney is going to put their name on it that they would take some pride in their work, but apparently not. I was so offended. The images and actions of certain people at the island in the beginning was enough for me to ban all three movies for the rest of my life. I will be wary of Disney from now on.This movie is offensive and I believe inapprobiate for children.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Yes, Dead Man's Chest isn't lacking in visual wizardry...it's the story and ""fun-factor"" that fail to live up to the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Where the original was fun and humorous, the second movie in the series just seems uninspired and too long. You can tell that Pirates 2 was made purely because of the success of the first, and not because the writers had another great story to tell. Without that lynch-pin to hold everything together, Dead Man's Chest feels like an unnecessary cash-in. You should still see it if you liked the first movie, but be prepared to be slightly disappointed.

There are a few good moments of swordplay and windmill tipping. But in general the film was entirely avoidable. In the first of the series, the Jack Sparrow character was actually vulnerable and likable beneath his cavalier swagger. In this second of the series, the swagger remains but Jack Sparrow has been reduced to the level of petulant child. This version makes Will Turner's and Elizabeth Swann's prior and current admiration of Jack Sparrow completely implausible. We are supposed to believe that these people risked their lives, their love and everything they owned to save this guy??? I don't think so. I hope that the third film in the series returns to the grandeur and style of the first.

I had never seen a pirate movie I liked before, so I went in interested but with low hopes. After all, this was a film with a troubled production, whose shoot went significantly over schedule and budget. Reshoots were employed. These are usually bad signs for a movie and bode ill for its ultimate disposition. And really - a movie based on an amusement park ride?However, from the surprisingly convoluted but still neatly self-connected plot to the top drawer visual effects and of course the performances (including Depp's, an actor I had never previously had much opinion of), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" turned out to be so much more than I had thought it would be. As one reviewer somewhere said (L.A. Weekly, I think), these are movies for people who do not like pirate movies.Count me in! I like to have my buckle swashed from time to time, but I do not count myself a pirate movie fan. Yet I LOVED ""Curse of the Black Pearl"".So, I was really looking forward to the release of Dead Man's Chest. Bill Nighy was an added bonus; I saw he was to play Davey Jones (he of the locker). I loved his work in the ""Underworld"" films, ""Love Actually"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".The plot sounded promising; Jack Sparrow owes a debt to Davey Jones: his soul! He does everything in his power to get out of repaying it, including enlisting the help of every character from the first movie. So where did it all go wrong?The movie is too damned long. There are too many characters. Not enough happens of significance; too much happens for the sake of on screen action. Time is elastic in the plot; people travel to and from ports and islands with amazing rapidity, to the point where the audience is wondering if these people have simply developed the power of teleportation. And really, this feels more like a remake than a sequel. Phantom ship? Check. Supernaturally enhanced crew? Check. Curse? Check. Outrageously staged sword fights? Check. Etc...The special effects are as amazing as ever, though the kraken both appears too often and yet not enough of it is seen each time.Sadly, the movie is more an endurance contest than a giddy ride. In fact, it is very much like the ""dark tunnel"" amusement park ride: sit down and watch everything scroll by without actually caring about or being a part of it. Characters are already established from the first film (a dozen or so) and nobody grows or changes except for maybe, maybe a glimmer out of Jack and Elizabeth.Special note here about Johnny Depp: Jack Sparrow was very much a one-note performance in the first film, but enjoyable due to the character's unpredictability. As written here, Jack is as predictable as gravity, and about as interesting. He is a dead center in a film that desperately needs a live one, and no amount of fey sashaying or uncoordinated sprinting at the head of a cannibal tribe does anything to change that.Plotwise, things just happen and happen and happen in this movie to the point of boredom; what should be a rousing three-way swordfight on a rolling mill water wheel is just dull and the kraken attacks (all four of them) are simply variations on a theme.The creative team here has really used the last ounce of goodwill they generated with ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" to create this loud, frequently boring, sporadically amusing and overlong mess.

It's closer in conception to a video game than a piece of bone fide storytelling  numerous maguffins the vapid centre of its aimless forward thrust. It fills its face with busy visuals, contrived gags and pirate clichés, as bland and one dimensional as the ride it's based on. No real story, no depth, no reason to be  its perfect for an audience with no interest in style, character or imagination. A commercial behemoth that will please silly women who think Depp and Bloom are reason enough to see it  their superficial appeal an easy score for wholly minds, and silly boys who like their movies like their x-box titles. At the time of writing the biggest opening box office hit in history  the Godfather to this in just 30 years, no irony, no hope - unquestioned. Hollywood's rape of film culture continues unabated and with the consent of its drooling patrons. Part 3 awaits in May, a big-budget nonse offering your kids the promise of sweets from the jar marked 'entertainment'.

This movie definitely could've done with losing quite some stuff towards the middle that dragged on a bit and sometimes the plot got a bit muddled up. Also there were a lot of times when the film makers recycled jokes from the first film just to try and get a few more laughs out of them. I wouldn't have minded so much if they had restrained themselves a bit but there's only so many times you can joke about rum before it gets old. And they definitely could've improved the ending: I'm fully aware that things will be explained in the third film but all the same the plot twist felt a bit forced.However all that said the good aspects of this film more then outweigh the bad ones. For me the highlight of the film was definitely the Kracken: it was amazing! I'd go so far as to say it was the best movie monster I've ever seen! And the action scenes were especially well done (like the three way sword fight on the run-a-way water wheel). It was a film you could just lose yourself in and just purely enjoy (even if it did get a bit dark on times).And even if you don't enjoy the story or the acting then you can just lose yourself in the wonderful sets and fantastic effects. All in all it was a pretty great film, not quite on the level of the first one admitadly but certainly a worthy (if flawed) sequel","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film has indeed impressive visuals, and continues the first installment with some of the best (and best paid) actors in the industry. And yet, it cannot help becoming boring and being almost unbearably long, despite its pretensions of being an action film. To be frank, I had a hard time following the action, and worse, I also had the feeling that it did not matter too much. POTC-2 has a story that can be condensed in a few pages of a comics book, but it looks like long and complicated, and repetitive. So yes, I enjoyed the effects, and I like seeing actors like Depp and Bloom and the rest of the crowd in any movie, but this is not enough for a good film, and I think that kids also got a little bored by this movie.Ohm yes, I know, series three is out.

It is difficult for me to divulge details without this being a spoiler to potential audience, so I'll pass on the other dozen or so laughable ""filler"" scenes you might encounter.The romantic story between David Jones and his lover serves as a mere backdrop in the film, which ought to be elaborated in more detail, but it isn't, disappointingly. The great anticipated final battle between the pirates and the Dutch India Co is ""downsized"" to 2 ships blasting each other endlessly. There is not much in terms of twists comparing to the prequels; most are clearly foreseeable and come as no surprise.The ending packs the greatest disappointment, yet, to Pirates fans. With some 10 mins left to straighten out what future holds for Will, Elizabeth, Sparrow, and Barbosa; as you can imagine, they end up being very cliché and not entirely exciting at all. Especially, the love affair between Will and Elizabeth should create outcries among fans.The character built-up so meticulously done in the previous 2 movies is completely shoved over the cliff with the character of Barbosa (in addition to the monkey, Jack) trumping all the rest of the cast. Pirates 3 seriously should focus on what matters in the film and gradually build up to the end with great character development and twists and turns that leave the audience asking for more, as was the case in Pirates 1&2. Unfortunately, not so in 3. Many would find Pirates 3 to be a major let down.Hence, my 5 stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We follow our favorite anti-hero Pirate, Jack Sparrow thru his goofy exploits on the sea as he tries to recover a key to open the chest that houses the actual beating heart of the un-dead computer-animated octopus-faced ""Davy Jones"". His reason for recovering it is to pay him back on what he owes him. Jones is the leader of a ghostly gang aboard the floating Dutchmen that terrorizes the ocean seeking souls to join his undead crew. There are, I think, another 3 or 4 people looking for the same object for different reasons(all for their own safety I must say). The action is definitely almost non-stop with a couple of humorous sets and a couple of good lines from the Rolling stones impersonating Pirate, played by Johnny Depp. The problem with this movie is that we know who's going to make it out of every hair-raising situation so there's no suspense. And as far as drama, forget about itinstead we have a few people searching for an elusive trinket to help them out of their own particular predicament and people getting into situations way over their heads for the sake of their own interests. But of course, everything will work out for all of our most popular swashbuckling characters, as long as you keep watching even through the 3rd movie of course. There was definitely a lot of money put into the computer-animated special effects and the choreography of the fight sequences had to take some work, but who really cares?? In my opinion, this is just another Hollywood money-making machine so let's all join the cause and wait until the 3rd one is available for free somewhere before we watch it Who's with me??","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Though the first installment took the audience by surprise with the character of Jack Sparrow so inimitably portrayed by the gifted Johnny Depp and therefore served as a tastier treat, this second installment substitutes sea-dead cum barnacles for the dancing skeletons of the first and is a bit more grisly...and a lot less fun.But Gore Verbinski knows how to choreograph these outings and he is able to marry some very fine special effects to the genuinely good cast of characters and the result is a fantasy that is a visual delight. The cast includes Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy who is completely covered in tentacles as Davy Jones, Jonathan Pryce, Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård,and Naomie Harris and they all seem to be having a glorious time. It is a bit long for a slight story (well in excess of two hours) and the special effects of the kraken (octopus like tentacles) overwhelming boats becomes tedious, but it is a fun outing and it all too blatantly sets us up for part three due our next spring.

Dreadful acting, and a painfully slow, awkward plot highlight what may be one of the worst 'high budget' films in recent memory. The script is abominablethe dialogue is geared for cartoon viewers and contains every stereotype of a pirate known to man. The humor (or any attempt at it) is forced and clumsy at it's best. The film is clearly designed to cash in for the inevitable sequel and milk the crowd for doughas if that needs to be said. It is, sadly to say, a vehicle designed for two purposes: show off special effects (*yawn*); and rake in the money. On that basis, it succeeds only too well. Johnny Depp, casually walks his way through the role of Captain Jack Sparrow--if you look carefully you can see the pain in his eyes (admittedly it is hard to see to the casual observer as the pain is softened by the ridiculous amount of money for the part-- I'll bet you that was real rum in his bottle during the filming). Joe Lunchbucket and family will be happily entertained--because they won't have to think hard, if at all. If you're curious and want to see Johnny Depp in some of his better roles, I would suggest 'Blow' and 'Donnie Brascoe' -- two truly riveting roles. This is the last time I'll go for the 'Pirate' bait--you can have mine next time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Pretty good stuff.However, this idea plainly chafes against the rest of the movie which is dreary, dark, nihilistic and NOT appropriate for the age of the target audience.

I enjoyed the ri... movie. From the start the twists, turns and loops of this movie get faster and faster, and higher. Everything about this ride has been souped-up, mega-sized, etc... all in an effort to outdo the first movie. Unfortunately it's not just the action which has been souped-up - the villains and corresponding horror and violence has been as well.This movie/ride is definitely not for the faint-of-heart. Davy Jones' crew makes Barbossa's Zombies (from the first movie) look like Hobbits next to the Orcs in Two Towers. At times things (especially the scenes with the Kraken) get every bit as intense as scenes from Aliens - while there are humorous moments much of it falls flat due to the serious nature of the movie which leaves you hanging on for dear life at times. A NOTE TO PARENTS: be responsible and get a sitter. This movie is not meant for kids despite the marketing (shame on you Disney and McDonald's). Despite the ratings in most areas (influenced I'm sure by politics) I could not recommend this to anyone under 14.Because of the wildness of the ride you don't realize you that haven't actually gone anywhere (i.e. no plot development). The only change you note is that you're a little higher up from your starting point preparing for the next big downward spiral. The sharp twist at the end though is one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie - it also is an indication that the second part of the ride may be as wild as the first. We'll have to wait and see. Let's hope they don't jump the tracks entirely in an effort to outdo this one as well.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. Grade: ""Curse of the Black Pearl"": B ""Dead Man's Chest"": C- ""At World's End"": A-","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Depp is truly the most interesting thing about the movie, a bombastic, CGI soaked affair with some impressive special effects and solid action scenes.The biggest problem with Pirates 2 lies with Depp's supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both very pretty, but neither comes close to matching Depp's charisma. Bloom in particular may look good in knickers, but for all his swashbuckling and hero-making, his performance is as bland as dishwater. The film's physically unappealing secondary characters are much more interesting. Pintel and Ragetti are strangely likable, Davy Jones is satisfyingly grotesque, and I found myself weirdly attracted to Tia Dalma.Pirates 2 is very dark for a Disney flickalong with the requisite pirate-y betrayal and (figurative) backstabbing, there's some relatively nasty PG-13 deaths (including throat cuttings and hatchet hackings) and I know if I was six I'd be terrified of Jones and his scaly crew.

Ever since I saw the first one on a hot July day in 03, I was completely blown away. Well, three years later, ""POTC: Dead Man's Chest"" has finally arrived into the hungry hands of pirate fans worldwide.To start off, ""Dead Man's Chest"" stars all of the familiar faces we all know and love from the first installment. Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, Jack Davenport, and all the rest are back in their usual roles. Johnny Depp, as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow, is once again comic dynamite and captures the audiences imagination brilliantly (by the way, he once again has a great entrance). Some of Johnny's best scenes involve him escaping in some way and because of that, the audience I was with was constantly laughing. For those who enjoyed the quirkiness of ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", you'll definitely appreciate the ""non-serious"" feel of this film. In fact, ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes itself even less seriously than it predecessor. This is due to the over the top stunts, slap-stick comedy, and a plot which is even more supernatural than before. One of the problems that ""Dead Man's Chest"" has is that it recycles a lot of the jokes from the first film. Thus, this installment feels like a bit of a retread, despite the fact that this film features an entirely different plot. The ending is a major cliffhanger and definitely builds immense excitement for the third film. ""Dead Man's Chest"" purposely answered little questions about the plot (much to the frustration of the audience). Because it didn't answer a lot of questions, I'm not entirely raving this film. I'm well aware there is a third film after this but during a two and a half hour movie, audience's want answers to some of the burning questions in the plot. ""Dead Man's Chest"" is silent on this issue. Overall, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is an enjoyable, and decent romp but is a bit too over-the-top for it's own good. In my opinion, I preferred it's predecessor where the plot was much simpler and the laughs wonderfully original. If your a fan of Johnny Depp or Pirates, this is naturally a must see. I'm just not sure if it's entirely worth a second viewing at the theatre. 7/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Again,director Gore Verbinski returns along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and supporting cast Keira Knightley and, Orlando Bloom for another round of high adventure and breathtaking excitement. Unfortunably,in the wake of the first film's huge success,this is almost sinks deep into the abyss of film failure,but in all this one is most cartoonish than the original film from 2003 which was very difficult to achieve. The second installment of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest"",often feels like a live-action version of Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote extravaganza and on the other hand feels like a live-action version of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd with a hint of Daffy Duck thrown in for grand measure. These moments are the funniest-liveiest parts here while the rest of the material is just bloated and as for the rest of the material it is brilliant in the special effects area along with some excellent scenes involving the bad guys-a creepy,crawly crew of half-humans,half-crustaceans,not to mention a showdown with a enormous multi-tentacled leviathan-a monstrous squid that really is sort of a tribute to the earlier Disney films,especially Richard Fleischer's 1954 version of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"".The first one was absolutely brilliant,but the sequel to this one is kind of a disappointment especially with some of the performances here. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is watered down in parts but the rest of it is okay if not concern with some of the scarier scenes and cliffhanging action sequences which may confuse younger audiences. Be aware that the film has a rating of ""PG-13"". In the second movie,because of Jack's blood debt to the feared pirate Davey Jones,Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley),and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom)must join the quirky captain once more and defeat a series of supernatural villains who want Jack's soul. However,if Captain Jack finds the treasure chest to Davey Jones' locker,and if he can control Jones,then Sparrow can avoid being his eternal slave. If not,he'll will be doom to life in eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife. Anyway,the characters travel to exotic islands,dirty pirate hangouts,and come face to face with other characters that are more frightening than those in the first movie. However,the performances are okay,but still letting Depp take control of the lead,the movie pays more attention to Knightley than in the first film,especially in the action sequences where she hold her own. As for Bloom and Depp the characters are more in focus are more entertaining here. The rest of it was spectacular,especially with the computer-generated action and astounding special effects. However,there is a chase scene that drags on endlessly and that was tiring at times. The movie is way too long. At over 150 minutes at length it gets boring with some of the material with some of it as no-stop action in between. But in perspective,""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest"",which by the way ends in a cliffhanger to set up for the next and final installment of the series,which hits theatres around Memorial Day of 2007. But still nothing can stop this film for becoming one of the biggest hits of the summer. And again,we can thank Johnny Depp for that.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Totally lame and unbelievable. When will this movie be on ""Full Screen"" Edition so the Hundreds of millions of people of people who own regular televisions can watch it? I hate having half of the picture cut off with black lines on the top and bottom of the screen! And ""Hell No"" I am not throwing away three fairly new sets to buy a wide screen to please some ""Gay"" director in Hollywood!!!! Free speech is a wonderful thing. We don't watch any shows promoting the ""Gay"" actors or lifestyle. I hated seeing the tops of actors heads cut off and no body. So If this is the wave of the future, It looks really bleak. I am glad that I got to enjoy movies that were made for the full screen. So much is lost with wide screen!!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In the second, the primary characters become more known and developed, and the good and bad (or thereabouts) come to final conflict.In this third edition, the writers succumb to a more lackluster plot, scattered with various complicated and less exciting sub-plots. New characters, more worthy of Disney action-figure profits, are introduced.The acting is still top-notch. But the plot is weaker, and we found ourselves frequently more bored in the lulls than enthralled as with the previous two Pirates movies. The plot plays up all of the previous primary characters as though trying to rally forces, but each becomes embroiled in the sub-plots, and the overall continuity and excitement suffers greatly as a result.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is, fortunately, not the case here.In fact, this film this film is even more bombastic and vivid than the first. For me personally, a good movie is the one that manages to trigger a multitude of emotions in the viewer. This film succeeds in doing so, as it makes you laugh as well as marvel. The humor remains presentThe various intrigues and motivations of the characters are understandable. They are also manageable overall and hardly too complex.Furthermore, the so-called production design is obviously elaborate and only does justice to the adventurous scale of the film.Then, the action sequences are even more exciting and better conceived and executed. The violence and darkness are further enhanced as well.Moreover, Hans Zimmer impressive score is even better and even more epic. I particularly like Davy Jones' introductory music.In addition, the visual effects are also commendable.Possible negative criticisms against the length of the film are, in my opinion, circumstantial. The fact that such a film only got a 53% rating on Rotten Tomates is deeply ridiculous.Finally, the ending constitutes a perfect cliffhanger.In short, one can claim that this sequel is qualitatively as well as quantitatively better. It is a lively and memorable blockbuster that is immensely fun to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A Worthy Sequel That Gets Most Things Right, If Not All","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3278107/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2015","The follow-up chapter to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl might appear inferior in content & a step-down in quality of narration but it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that presents significant upgrades in many aspects, takes the spectacle of the first film to a higher level and despite a few hiccups remains a highly entertaining & amusing ride for the most part.The second instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Dead Man's Chest continues the journey of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as he's reminded of the debt he owes to Davy Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, and then races against time to steal Jones' heart in order to strike a bargain with him. But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, plus it works in tandem with make-up team to make its effects work.Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, and what an intriguing character he is!On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing vital to the story. Definitely more epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is a worthy sequel that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
