There were dumbfounded scenes that did not make any sense led by decision making. The kills were not that good especially since it is a PG-13 movie. The only parts that I liked are Jason Statham and his great acting and the antagonists getting killed off. Other than that, I was ready to leave the theater. It really questioned me on how does the protagonists keep on surviving after questionable events. I honestly liked the first one better because it was not that bad of a shark movie. The sequel, however, just made it worse. I am surprised that this film was allowed to make it in Dolby Cinema since it only allows good or great movies in the auditorium. Overall, The Meg 2: The Trench is pretty bad with its scenes and kills. I would recommend to stay away from this movie.","39 out of 46 found this helpful.

This movie was one big bore with no thought at all put into it. It's just a quick cash grab rebounding off the first one. You'll have more entertainment watching paint dry. I myself have more enjoyment spoon feeding my disabled, hunchbacked cousin pudding. The shark in Sharknado looks more realistic than this creation made by some CGI intern at the local community college.

Annoying kid, paint by the number villain, a predictable plot. Unlikable characters who all behave like cartoon characters.I liked the first movie and was looking forward to the sequel, but the irritating characters and lazy [;it just didn't do it for me.I don't mind popcorn movies where you park your brain at the door, but they are usually fun. I think that is the problem here, it just was not fun. Statham is the best thing about this movie, he always turns in a reliable performance. The rest of the cast are so forgettable, in the end I was cheering for the shark.If I want a good shark movie, I will watch Jaws.","66 out of 77 found this helpful.

Is Captain America and is the ultimate force of good in the world felt like a betrayal to story telling.As a mum of part-Asian children, I'm really enthused to see more inclusion of Asian actors in roles that go beyond those stereotypical kungfu roles. Unfortunately, this had no texture or believability and I felt like I was watching a caricature of a believable person, with believable relationships.One word of wisdom to CCP - You can make good stories that reframe you in a positive light, but when you make such hogwash, ridiculous stories.... it makes you look like a controlling communist....","14 out of 16 found this helpful.

There is no excitement or suspense, no characters one can relate too (at least I couldn't), and compared to fine ""shark movies"" like Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, Open Water or The Shallows, this one is not B-league but C-league, despite some production value. Also, some well done CGI is no news anymore for quite some time and not very entertaining if the rest of the movies is just crap. I really would prefer to put some of those good old Godzilla themed movies of the 50s and 60s back on my screen (and have some fun) instead of watching this, well, void of boredom ever again. I really like some of the movies starring Jason Statham, but as I don't watch (and like) Fast & Furios movies (the last one I watched was the third entry) the last really good one I can remember was that little movie Homefront, a movie made 10 years ago - simply put, I would prefer to get more class and less mass.","30 out of 39 found this helpful.

If this was touted as a edge of your seat thriller with cutting edge CGI and unexpected twists and turns, it'd be a 2. But this was always going to end up the campy, overacted, completely implausible, CGI riddled cheese-fest that it is. And it absolutely delivered on that expectation.It has Plot holes so big you could swim a megladon through, hilarious foreshadowing via dialogue (if they say something won't happen, its going to happen,) and a decent smattering of quips, giggle/smirk inducing lines, and the requisite action scenes.It ticked all the boxes for expectations - and exceeded it in areas like ""completely unrealistic technology,"" ""inaccurate animal behaviour"" and ""Implausible physics/hydrodynamics."" But that just added to the fun.For the naysayers - expecting more quality/realism/etc from this movie is like expecting a Fast and the Furious movie to be extolling the virtues of bicycles.Its a fun, lighthearted, and ""laugh at the ridiculousness"" sort of flick and that's worth a passing grade.","24 out of 35 found this helpful.

The palpable absence of the previous star cast further drowns this terrible sequel leaving a void that Statham simply couldn't fill.The plot is so awful it's as if a kindergarten child was handed a pen and paper during the writers strike and was told to write whatever popped up in their head.Shall we talk about the acting? The protagonists were mediocre at best. Their acting looked forced and unnatural.As for the supportive characters, they all looked as if they came straight out of a high school drama workshop. Take that female security guard for instance, a character so unnecessary and annoying. The actress herself was so unable to deliver a single convincing line. Every time she spoke I found myself wincing. Kudos for achieving such a cringe-worthy presence on screen! As for DJ, the comedic genius offering humour so intellectually stimulating, it's as if the writers consulted a focus group of thee-year- old kids. Perhaps the only one who could deliver a somewhat decent performance was Cliff Curtis but he still couldn't salvage this shipwreck of a movie.Furthermore, the cgi looked so cartoonish I half expected the sharks to break into a dance routine straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.Overall a cinematic disaster that should come with a warning label: ""View at your own peril!""","57 out of 79 found this helpful.

No need to put any thought into how stupid this movie its cause it's met to be the opposite of smart.

Jiuming continues the work started by his father and sister with the backing of billionaire Hillary Driscoli (Sienna Guillory) including having successfully captured a meg, named Halqi, and kept it in captivity despite the concerns of Jonas. As Jonas, Jiuming, and several others embark on a journey from Mana One research station to explore the Mariana Trench, they stumble across a conspiracy with far reaching implications that unleashes the threat of the Megs once again on humanity.After weathering a troubled 22 year long development cycle, The Meg proved to be a sleeper hit overindexing in the United States and making over $500 million worldwide. Shortly after the first film's release it was announced the producers were in development of a sequel that would mine material from other material in Steve Alten's Meg novel series. With Ben Wheatley stepping in for directors duties and the writing team of Dean Georgaris and Jon and Erich Hoeber, Meg 2: The Trench delivers on the same silly fun as the previous film and is unapologetically ridiculous Summer escapism.Jason Statham and Sophia Cai reprise their roles as Jonas and Meiying respectively from the previous film, and despite the clunkiness of having to explain away Li Bingbing's character Suyin from the previous film, the movie does a solid job of building upon the chemistry between Statham and Cai with the two in a unique place with Jonas now Meiying's legal guardian and there's a solid dynamic between the two. We also get the welcome returns of Cliff Curtis' Mac and Page Kennedy's DJ respectively with both still great supporting characters to bounce off against Statham with DJ in particular given some very funny developments spurred by his experiences in the last film. Much like the novel it takes (loose) inspiration from, Meg 2: The Trench is stuff to the gills with things that happen and it's probably the most movie you'll get in a Summer blockbuster in terms of sheer variety. There's a little bit of Aliens, some Abyss (or if you will: Leviathan), of course traces of Jaws, and even a little bit of Die Hard and Jurassic Park thrown in for good measure. The last act of this movie is just insane and much like the prior film it is unfortunately held back from getting too bloody thanks to its PG-13 rating, but in terms of delivering on crazy action and spectacle it's certainly firing on all cylinders.Meg 2: The Trench is my kind of cinematic junkfood. It's a movie that feels like a throwback to those 90s era blockbusters complete with a rap song over the end credits called ""Chomp"" that almost makes you expect the credit ""Voice of Magic Taco.... James Earl Jones"" (look up Simpsons and Zorro, you'll know what I'm talking about). As you can tell I had a blast with this movie and I hope they mine the rest of the book series for all it's worth.","158 out of 316 found this helpful.

Why would you try to float the film with a crew of completely unknown, talentless actors who seem to have come straight out of an amateur high school acting class?Now let's talk about the plot. Completely nonsensical! So indifferent and poorly written that leaves you wondering if the writers were playing a cruel joke on the audience.

Page Kennedy is a shining star though, and every time he was on screen I was ecstatic.The plot is bad, bordering hilarious. The villain's motivations are cartoonishly poorly thought out, and all the decisions that lead up to the movie's climax taking place are idiotic at best.The actual megs (and other sea creatures) are gorgeously rendered, but you'll also have to suspend your disbelief about how they're a) alive b) doing any of this. Honestly, I would have loved to see more of the sea monsters, instead of all the plot bs. Sea dinosaurs take off running on land, just roll with it.My conclusion: this movie is campy as hell.

Firstly, the plot feels confusing and inconsistent. The plot twists are not only predictable but also cliched, making the film dull and uninteresting.The performances of the actors do not redeem the situation. The main characters appear emotionless and unbelievable, lacking any chemistry between them. The dialogue is cliched and wooden, further detracting from the overall experience.Special effects and the portrayal of the sharks are disappointing. While the first Meg film set high expectations, the sequel fails to deliver anything new and seems as if the budget was cut in half. The sharks look artificial, and their movements are clumsy.The soundtrack is also problematic, as it fails to build tension or create a suitable atmosphere. The music at times feels disconnected and does not adequately support the unfolding events.All in all, Meg 2 falls far short of the original film's standard, leaving the viewer disappointed and questioning why this sequel was made at all. Hopefully, in the future, sharks will return to the big screen with a stronger and better-executed presence. I would have given 0 stars if I could.","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bearing that in mind, here's a few thoughts to get the boat rowing. Isn't the reason that we -{ PAY }- . . . Of our ""own-free-will"", { and often rather handsomely, at that! } . . . To see a larger-than-life { quite literally! }, ""UTTERLY BONKERS LEVEL"" sci-fi action extravaganza such as 'Meg 2: The Trench' ( to be referred to simply as 'Meg-2' here ) . . . That we wish to 'Escape', be 'Enthralled', and perhaps most significantly of all . . . "" Be able to let our hair down for a while, and just have a little 'Serious' Cinematic -{ FUN }- ? ? ? "" Just Sayin'. ( And if you consider yourself to be a -true- lover of action flicks, then you will most -definitely- be able to relate to Meg-2 ).Jason Statham has been one of my favourite action heroes for the longest time, & well & truly -Delivers- in Meg-2 as 'Jonas Taylor', inasmuchas the ""kicking ass"" department is concerned. However, the absence of Bing Bing Li ..{ 'Suyin', in the first instalment }.. was an unequivocal disappointment, as her presence in 'The Meg' was nothing less than sheerly delightful. In contrast, Page Kennedy { 'DJ' }, not only reprises his role ..with 'Panache!'.. but also brings some -genuinely enjoyable suprises with him . . . -{ And }- performs the massively exhilarating hip-hop song ""Chomp""! ( The track plays over the end credits ). If I have one -major- criticism of the film, it is that the -extremely- deadly Komodo Dragon like prehistoric creatures on ""Fun Island"" { -Also- featured in the aforementioned trailer } were, for want of a better expression . . . Just permitted to er, well, simply ""be there"" ( this is -very- obviously implied ) by the island's management ; -inspite- of the said venue, ( quite expectedly of course ), being chock full of, you-guessed-TOURISTS! But ..'other than that'.. I simply surrendered myself -completely- to the -{ ""MINDLESS MOVIE MADNESS"" }- at hand, and made a perfectly earnest effort to just relax, and enjoy the undeniably -immense- level of entertainment on display.Summary : The opening sequence is ""Par Excellence"". Also, I was -especially- heartened by Jonas's very endearing relationship with the ""sparky and seemingly ever enthusiastic"" 14 year old whiz-kid 'Meiying' { Suyin's daughter from the first picture, and played by the -now- 15 year old Sophia Cai } ; as it provided a VERY refreshing break from the 'Heartless Badass' personna that we almost -always- see Jason Statham's roles embody. In a nutshell, Meg-2 is ""rife"" with Twists, Turns & Curved-balls, galore. It -attempts- to fight every possible narrative clich√© Real-hard, and generally ends up winning ( -NOT- to be confused with all the -very- obvious ""homages"" present in the picture ). Ergo : "" 8.00 -{ UNABASHED }- , Chompalicious Marks Out Of 10.00 "" . . . .

Their replacements with unknown actors contributed to the film's downfall, as their lackluster performances failed to elicit any emotional investment.

It's one of my all time favourite action movies. The premise is reasonable enough that you can suspend disbelief. The writing and plot is solid, with good acting, great action sequences and some cool twists. The Meg 2 on the other hand is the antithesis of the original. This is why you don't let AI write screenplays! That's the only way I can think that this abomination was created. Just like those early AI picture creations that look like Dali had an accident with a meat clever, and you can't figure out what the hell you're looking at!!?? Yes, it's that bad. Moronic action sequences that defy the laws of physics and treat the audience like they are a bunch of brain dead popcorn munchers. It should be a crime to make a sequel that is so utterly, got wrentchingly awful that your only salvation is to stare at your watch and count the seconds that feel like hours until the godforsaken torturous visual and auditory cognitive assault finally ends. This is one of the worst if not the worst movies I've ever seen at the cinema.

So out of spite to myself, I decided to sit through this one, purely because Ben Wheatley was directing. 5 minutes in and I knew then I made a big mistake.Going into it, I kind of knew what I was getting myself into. I'm under no illusion that I'm watching a movie about a giant shark that only wants to eat people. Everything was bad, the CG on the sharks at some points was laughable, the dialogue was so cheesy it makes you uncomfortable. Things happen with no explanation as to why, Statham going for a swim 7 kilometres underwater with zero equipment was ridiculous.Again I know what I'm watching but don't make it so implausible that it comes off as a joke. It felt like I was watching something from Asylum Studios that was made on a quarter of the budget. There were scenes that are literally taken from other movies but filmed badly. The final showdown was like watching a bad John Woo movie from 1995.It's safe to say that I have tormented myself enough wanting these movies to be something they are definitely not, if there's a third, I'm not putting myself through the pain of watching it.

He works at Mana One with Meiying's uncle Jiuming Zhang (Jing Wu), who owns the facility, exploring and mapping the bottom of the sea at the Mariana Trench and fights environmental crimes every now and then. Jiuming is raising and training a female megalodon called Haiqi. While mapping and unknown part of the bottom surface, Jonas finds that Meiying is a stowaway in his submarine. Further, they find a hidden mining station on the bottom of the sea. However, the criminal Montes (Sergio Peris Mencheta) explodes the area and traps both submarines in the trench. On board, Mac (Cliff Curtis) and DJ (Page Kennedy) discover that the rescue submarine has been sabotaged meaning that there is a mole in the crew. How the submarines' crew will be rescued?""Meg 2: The Trench"" is a funny and entertaining sequel of ""The Meg"" (2018). The plot is intense, full of action and with the most absurd scenes, as this type of film should be. It is funny to read professional critics that expect a movie with Jason Stratham would be a Shakespearean drama or a documentary. And funnier the review of the maneuver mass that worship and repeat the same non-sensee in their reviews. If I see a Jaason Stratham's film called ""Meg 2: The Trench"", I know what I expect to see and I am very satisfied with what I have seen. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Megatubar√£o 2"" (""Megashark 2"")","25 out of 54 found this helpful.

The supporting cast was great too, especially Page Kennedy.The movie hits the perfect time limit as well, as I cannot do long movies anymore after seeing Oppenheimer.

The first Meg was a decent enough bit of entertainment. The sequel is a very pale immitation.There are is a pointless eco=polution sub-plot that I assume are included to pad out the story. They add nothing to the story, plus they are really badly done with obvious villains who are revealed too early and have very predictable deaths.As other reviews have pointed out, what little Meg action there is takes place in darkness with average cgi. The acting is phoned in by most of the cast.The movie kicks into overdrive in the last act, where all hell breaks loose and we get a series of multi-monster / bad-guy action scenes. Even here, all logic goes out the window.It also doesn't help that this was made before the events of the Titan submersible disaster and anyone watching this will have a passing knowledge of the effects of incredibly deep submersion on the human body, so the entire underwater action in the first half is ridiculously stupid.This just isn't silly enough to make it worth a few hours of your time.","35 out of 56 found this helpful.

The graphics the movie uses for the supposedly advanced tech gear and pods looks like an early 2000's Playstation save screen.For the first chunk the actors are sitting on a set that is not at all convincing of an advanced underwater vehicle while communicating with one another with the most wooden script imaginable. Some sections it almost seems like the actors are reading it for the first time as the emotion put behind the words just comes across so stiff and fake. This is also on the actors as no good actor/actress would be accepting of this poor of work. Perhaps I am just expecting too much for a movie that has a slogan of ""New Meg, Old chum."" However, there are times in the movie where it in some ways takes itself seriously and doesn't accept entirely that it's all truly one big joke. When it takes that position I expect a little more quality.Much of the movie is the characters trying to joke around with each other with almost inside type jokes and none of it particularly is interesting for the main reason that we really know nothing about the characters and therefore no investment in them. I think the hope is that the audience will warm up to the characters more through these jokes, but for many characters we hardly and in some cases don't even know their names. The characters poor development makes their back and forth banter just kind of annoying instead of being plot advancing. It almost seems like the script was built as if this was the 4th or 5th movie in an established franchise where your expected to know the characters relationships prior.The reality is that a good chunk of people won't even remember the main characters name (Jonas) from the first one never mind the secondary characters. At the very least some sort of 5 min recap to get up to speed was likely necessary with maybe a possible flashback.As far as the lead, Jason Statham delivers the exact performance he does in every other role. If that's your thing maybe it's worth your watch.With regards to the quality of the story not much can be expected going in. However, the villains which were probably inserted to get the movie past 90 minute runtime were more of a distraction than anything. People come to see a shark hunting down the research team, but it seems they ran out of ideas on how to make the chases unique enough so they added the secondary villains to try to have some other side story to consider. I get the move, but at the same time it wasn't particularly enthralling. The villains trying to destroy the environment for their own personal fortune is a very common theme and this movie adds nothing new to that framework.Lastly , it is pretty clear that the movie is insecure with itself by trying to add a bunch of clich√© and stereotypical sections to the ending to try to keep it afloat.Overall the entire production feels like it was written on the spot 5 minutes before shooting kind of like when you didn't do your homework in grade school and try to scribble something together so as to try and not get caught by the teacher for not doing it.Lucky enough for the filmmakers this kind of weak pathetic movie can still sell in the summer. I get it's not to be taken seriously, but there are a whole host of other movies currently in theaters that will provide you more entertainment.","93 out of 169 found this helpful.

The film's incessant use of 'guys' and 'you guys' reaches new depths of annoyance, eclipsing any potential enjoyment. When faced with the colossal Megalodon, a character yells, ""You guys, we need a plan, like now!"" This laughable line exemplifies the script's inability to craft meaningful dialogue during crucial moments. The constant stream of 'guys', 'what are you doing here?', etc, is lazy writing, revealing a lack of effort in character development. Despite boasting impressive underwater visuals, ""Meg2"" fails to dive into meaningful conversations. The excessive use of 'guys' and 'you guys' dilutes any emotional impact the characters might have conveyed. It's like watching a shipwreck of potential unfold, as the film's attempts at drama and tension are lost in the sea of repetitiveness. In a sequel that should have evolved, ""Meg2"" instead regresses into dialogue mediocrity. The constant refrain of 'guys' makes it difficult to take the film seriously. It's disappointing to see a potentially thrilling movie sink due to its own verbal shortcomings.

Where does one begin to list all the stupid plot holes, inconsistencies, and just plain dumb writing.What I found most annoying was that for most of the first hour it's like an action/espionage movie with the sharks as a subplot. Given the title, shouldn't they be the main attraction?What's with the cheesy campy comments when several of the characters are in life threatening situations? I mean really. In any of the situations given in this movie the last thing anyone would realistically think of saying when they're about to die is something funny.I've got to think that the writers, director, and actors, all knew what they were doing but then again, maybe they just made a MEG of a mistake.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

Even though I think the first movie The Meg (2018) is better than this second movie, I do think the sequel Meg 2: The Trench (2023) is as fun as the first movie. It does have issues like the first movie, but when it comes to a movie like this, what were you expecting?Jason Statham returning as Jonas Taylor is still great to watch in the action sequences involving him going up against three Megalodons, along with stopping a malevolent mining operation that messes with what Jonas and his team are trying to do involving exploring a deep trench. Jing Wu as Jiuming Zhang was good; he and Jason Statham worked well together in suspenseful scenes and action scenes, along with him having a connection to one of the Megalodons that are out swimming loose. The return of Cliff Curtis, Page Kennedy, and now older Shuya Sophia Cai back in the same roles they played in the first movie, and they still do a respectable job.The three Megalodons looked good and had beneficial effects on it, but sometimes the CGI can be noticeable at times, along with some creatures that appear in the third act climax. The antagonists that are sabotaging Jonas and his team and doing the mining operation are standard seen it before antagonists that just make things worse for the characters in a way that is entertaining to watch when stuff goes down. The look and feel of the trench when they are walking through it looked cool with a dark feeling, but it had some cool designs, with certain ocean life with good designs.There are fight scenes between Jonas Taylor and the antagonists from time to time in the movie that was cool to watch, and well shot. In the third act was where everything went down with the great action sequences with Jonas Taylor against the three Megalodons, while other creatures attack at the same time at a beach; all of it was entertaining, nicely shot, and can be suspenseful. The first act was interesting setup for the movie, the second act was suspenseful being stuck in the trench, and the third act was fun and over the top to watch with crazy things happening.Meg 2: The Trench (2023) was just as fun as the first, though it has some moments that felt slow, and I thought the first movie was better, the movie was still entertaining to watch. Good acting, good looking sharks, beneficial effects with occasional noticeable ones, with good cinematography, and action/chase sequences that are suspenseful to watch. I would think if you liked the first movie The Meg (2018) then you will like the second movie Meg 2: The Trench (2023), especially if you are looking for a fun summer movie to watch this year.","15 out of 33 found this helpful.

""Meg 2"" has very little down time - something is always happening, and someone is always doing something - compare that to the first film, which was primarily filled with boring characters having boring conversations, and you already have a recipe for success with this sequel.There are some similarities between this sequel and the first film - namely, all of the Statham on shark action occurs within the last 25 minutes of the movie. And while that bothered me during the first film due to how sleep-inducing the buildup was, ""Meg 2"" basically plays out like a separate Statham movie until the climactic creature feature shenanigans begin. So, you'll see Jason and crew fight bad guys, shoot monsters, and make their way out of precarious situations until, inevitably, facing off against the titular megalodon.And when they do finally fight the meg? Man, oh man, is it awesome. With enough sea monsters to make even the most seasoned creature feature veteran blush, the third act is bombastic and ridiculous and everything you'd expect from this type of movie - long story short, it's worth the wait. And ""Meg 2: The Trench"" is certainly worth a viewing.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

But in Meg 2, right from the opening scene, Statham does what Statham does best, and does so a few more times throughout the rest of the film, as well as a bunch of other insane action scenes. So right off the bat, you will get your Statham fix of action, and then some.Additionally, the humor is leaps and bounds better than the first film that was mostly misses, where in this one, we found ourselves laughing out loud many times. Sure there were a few misses, but the comedy was mostly hits, and well placed and executed.Even the story had non-stop suspense throughout, with little breaks to catch your breath, and the pacing was spot-on for the nearly two hour runtime. Sure there were some cliches and a few plot holes with some cheesy sub-plots, but overall this sequel was much more entertaining, tons more fun, and directed much better than the first film.All casting and performances were decent, and the S/VFX more impressive than the first film. Thus I can actually recommend this film, and give it a very deserving 8/10, because this film was more entertaining and real-er than the nearly triple budget Fast X nonsense.","73 out of 172 found this helpful.

Too many things going on, not enough Meg action. The majority of Meg action is in the last 20-25 minutes. This film should've been called ""Creatures of The Trench"", instead. This reminds me of my experience with Jurassic World Dominion where the giant locusts and the humans take center stage. I just want more Megs, goddamnit.Jason Statham is on autopilot Jason Statham and the supporting actors don't help much either. The performances range from downright poor to unconvincing to okay-ish. The saving grace of this film is its CGI creatures and Statham vs. Meg Part 2. The Statham and Megs showdown isn't even that exciting, to be honest.The story is painfully generic and super predictable. Of course, I knew what I got myself into. I enjoyed the first Meg! I'm okay with generic or predictable, but at least make it thrilling and fun! This isn't the Ben Wheatley I know. The worst thing any film could do to me is to leave me emotionally detached.

It's not often a movie makes me angry and prompts a walk out, but Ben Wheatley stab at the big time truly has me seeing red.Granted having left 40 minutes before the movie finished probably doesn't warrant a review of any kind but you know when you just have to vent?The original Meg was a let down, but being the Jason Statham fan that I am(Safe, Wild Card) being two of his finest efforts so I was hoping based on the trailer for the sequel things might be due for an upturn.Sadly such was not for happening!Now I never read the books but how on earth do you mess up when the golden goose is right there in the title.Cliff Curtis was seriously underused and looked I'll, The Stath looked his comfortable self but he was given mundane dialogue. As there was Chinese investment in the movie, we had to suffer through a small portion of subtitles.The trench sequences truly nailed the coffin for me, and as for the Meg itself, the way the story was developing, the prehistoric creature more or less took a back seat to the Die Hard elements that started to unfold.I realise this was a summer blockbuster, leave your brain at the door but this was just a misfire and definitely not one for the Statham collection.","20 out of 35 found this helpful.

I like Jason Statham so decided why not; I'm bored. I'll give a whirl. Other reason I didn't want to watch it was because though I'm a scuba diver, I have a phobia of octopi and knowing essentially I'd be looking at the kraken with huge tentacles gave me the jeebs. Thankfully, that part of the show was towards the end and minimal. But though things were messy and far from perfect (antagonists were subpar at best but thankfully most were eaten fairly quickly); the comedy and bantering between the characters was amusing even in dire strait situations. It's not a film for everyone but if you want to just relax with some popcorn and have a chill evening, go for it. It is actually amazingly better than the first.

A runtime of one hour and fifty-six minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Jason Statham as ""Jones Taylor"" is back in the sequel to ""The Meg"". The film about a massive Great White Shark. Now ""Jones"" is the adopted father to ""Meiying"" played by Shuya Sophia Cai. Since her mother passed away in the first film. ""Jones"" has assumed the father role but ""Meiying"" is raised by a village.Her uncle ""Jiuming"" played by Jing Wu, ""Mac"" played by Cliff Curtis, and ""Dj"" played by Page Kennedy. Picking up from the first film they have a ""Meg"" in captivity now. The trench where they got her from is being explored daily. With all types of exotic things and creatures that date back to before the dinosaurs down there.""Jiuming"" company is making new technology and advancing the company his sister and him built. ""Jones"" is still a wild cowboy now doing secret missions stopping people from hurting the environment while also trying to be a good dad.But when you have a ""Meg"" in captivity something is bound to go wrong. After a routine mission to explore the trench. Not only do they have to deal with an unruly teenager that's trying to be an explorer like her mom. Finding even more ""Megs"" in the trench along with other prehistoric creatures. They also have to deal with spies in the organization and people trying to go to the trench for all the wrong reasons.With this cocktail of disaster. ""Jones"" and the gang will have to stop whatever things follow them out of the trench a second time around. As well as stop these people trying to sabotage everything ""Jiuming"" and his sister built. In this wild big shark sequel.""Meg 2: The Trench"" was a wild ride. They outdid themselves with this film. Going above and beyond the first film. With more and bigger Megs on top of other massive deep blue creatures. Along with creatures we haven't seen before. You had an assortment of things to keep you busy. Then sprinkle in humans pulling double crosses and being money hungry.I felt like they had a meeting and said let's list every possible thing we can do that's over the top. No matter how ridiculous it is. Then they applied everything on the list to the screen. Some scenes were a bit ridiculous but it made for one entertaining film. You can never say this was boring.With a storyline that was simple enough. They focused on the action and the wow moments. With satire throughout the film. It made for a fun film. With newcomers to the franchise like Melissanthi Mahut playing ""Rigaas"", Skyler Samuels playing ""Jess"" and Sergio Peris-Mencheta playing ""Montes. Who you might know from playing ""Gustavo"" in the hit series ""Snowfall"". They all brought that extra seasoning to a film that probably didn't need any extra. But who cares.Overall this film came out during the perfect time, ""Shark Week"". With great promotion. You got a wild blend of ""Jaws"" mixed with ""Sharknado"". It was supposed to be over the top and it worked. I had a fun time watching it. I was entertained the entire film. It gave you a way for a third film. So don't be surprised when it's announced. I give this film four mor fires üî•üî•üî•üî•.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

The action scenes seem to all be on fast forward and aren't remotely exciting or impressive. A dreadful wall of sound masquerading as music combined with Sfx is headache inducing.The story seems to sideline the Megs in favour of some other creatures and desperately wants to become a Jurassic park sequel. As much as I love Statham he seems sidelined by pointless and annoying characters that are just in the way. Lame environmental side story and bizarre double crossing early on make little sense or mean much. And having a Meg in captivity trying to train him like a poor sea park exhibit was beyond dumb. Still, this film would have got 10 if the Stath had punched the shark.","37 out of 71 found this helpful.

I thought, ""That's what I've been wondering this whole movie, sister."" The only thing worse than bad dialogue is bad dialogue delivered poorly. The only thing worse than bad CGI is bad CGI that is the title of the movie. The only thing worse than wooden characters is wooden characters that you don't care about.Close-quarters, will-they-make-it-or-not scenes are only engaging if you become attached to the characters first. I didn't. I always knew who was next to ""bite it"" (I kept turning to my son every time someone gave a telltale line, and said, ""Bye..."") When I saw the commercials, I thought, ""Well now I know he dies... and she dies... and they die."" And those were the best kills in the movie, so they blew that (did they think I would forget and be surprised?) The inconsistencies in tone (Is that guy a serious scientist or a clown? Is that woman a tough hero or a scaredy cat?) coupled with really bad non-humor, and bad caricature (let's give the sassy black man more sassy lines) was often cringe-worthy. Even actors with some chops - I'm looking at you, Cliff Curtis - wandered around looking like they wished they were somewhere else.I love a good, brainless popcorn chomper once in a while if it is fun, or silly, or outrageously unbelievable, or cool to look at. This wasn't consistently any of these. It was like they put all the ideas in a bag, shook it, and pulled them out randomly. Now let's have an explosion. Now let's have an escape. A chase where the outnumbered pursued turn the tables on their pursuers. Now mercenaries on a boat. And how about throwing in some odd-buddy bumbling and fumbling, that will be hi-LAR-ious!When they threw in the old trope of a fight on a mining conveyor belt with the rock splitter at the top, I was done.So why two stars and not one? The relationship between Statham and the young girl was sweet, and made me smile. The rest of the movie had me grinding my teeth.","59 out of 120 found this helpful.

Being trapped on bottom of the ocean or being attacked by a Kraken should be easy to make exciting and terrifying. Plus, a golden opportunity lost with one shark and his handler could have made a real impact.

This movie felt like it couldn't decide if it was 2020's ""Underwater"" or land of the lost. The first half of the movie took itself painfully seriously and yet failed to deliver on any character depth or plot depth. The movie had a great idea and should have done more to draw out and intensify the starting plot line of the movie. Instead it felt very rushed and choppy with terrible dialogue, the entire first 20 minutes of the movie were basically useless. The movie introduced several baddies with the decision making skills of someone in a bad horror movie, and wasted all of them in the end. The second part of the movie came along and the tone completely switched to a ridiculous action movie which was far my enjoyable because it was simple, men fighting sharks. If the movie had started with the tone of a ridiculous action movie and added some more comedy it would have been far far more enjoyable. Overall this movie was nothing more than a high budget B list movie. Minus points for ""Haiqi"" the worst CGI shark ever.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

As usual Statham is basically being Statham - wisecracking, scowling, grinning and scrapping in a diving suit, while the no-name supporting cast are annoying, noisy, over excitable and as throwaway as the main plot about illegal undersea mining in 'secret' Meg infested waters.The worst part of it all though is while the plot and numerous sub-plots over-bombard you like a tsunami, the Megalodons are practically an afterthought until the last 20 minutes when it all kicks off into overdrive, and not in a good way!Even the cgi sharks (and also a giant octopus, and mutant lizards lol) are pretty lame this time out. Indeed there really is nothing other than some decent location filming and well choreographed fight scenes to keep you hooked-lined and sinkered.There is some good news though.

Jason Statham isn't ever going to be an Oscar winning actor, however he's far more deserving than to be in a film like Meg 2.Do studios even oversee the films they bankroll? Because this is a new level of bad. I mean it's soooo bad it isn't even ""so bad it's good"".It's all over the place, I won't spoil it in case if you're reading this you still want to watch it, but this makes the original Meg look like Jaws.

I liked the large number of marine and amphibious monsters. This film is improved by Jason Statham, who plays very well. Also, this film can be praised for the graphics. But including all the advantages of this film, it cannot be compared with the jaws of Spielberg. Now I will move on to the minuses of the film. The first disadvantage is a very stretched plot, this film could have been laid for an hour, but they made it almost an hour longer. The next minus is the bias of the ending of the film. In general, this is a worthy project in the genre of a mystical thriller. Against the background of the super premieres of Barbie and Oppenheimer, which all people are trying to go to, it will be difficult for this film to overtake even its first part at the box office. But I hope Statham and Ben Wheatley can do it.","23 out of 50 found this helpful.

It's more likely both especially after the little we've learned following the Titan disaster.Criticisms aside, one can always sit back, suspend reason and just enjoy a movie. Meg2 does require a dunce hat as well but it can be done, probably.At least until the movie plumbs new depths and hits the 'unadulterated corny' switch.Just ride along remembering to trust no one and it's all really happening in a suburban pool with inflatable fish.That works until they then turn on the humor.I thought at first Li BingBing was written out due to some disfavor.

Then there's Jiuming who has merged his company with his father's, taking over the ocean exploration mission while having a meg as his pet. On their mission into the Trench, they get trapped while their rescue pad is sabotaged, an inside job ofcourse. Their fight for survival extends to the surface as few megs and other creatures follow them through. Once again, the onus is on Jonas Taylor and team to take on the megalodons and save the day.The problem with this sequel is it simply doesn't try enough to entertain. The humor is flat for most part of it and with multiple creatures, it just misses the opportunity to go full on crazy. The Meg scenes aren't enough and less innovative. When you bring in an mega octopus, one expects more out of it yet what we get is lame underwater shots which simply doesn't do anything. The whole greedy villains thing is so one toned that in a creature flick, it sticks out as a sore thumb.Page Kennedy as DJ gets stale lines to deliver to evoke laughter, while none of the dialogues do work, he still manages to shine in two different scenes. Barring that, the film doesn't give much to Wu Jing to do. With the familiar characters, it somewhat is watchable until one realizes how underwhelming the creature scenes are. With it not getting violent or crazy enough, the third act gets badly monotonous and fails to entertain. Meg 2 misses the mark.","63 out of 147 found this helpful.

One of my favorite quotes from the film. I think you can tell as to where I am headed writing this review. I wasn't expecting anything really from this film, but I actually enjoyed the first Meg. I was curious if they could pull it off a second time, boy was I wrong.Lets start off with the obvious. Where the hell are the sharks? You go into to this film hoping to see some shark terror action going down, not a boring half assed pretentious thriller. It is not thrilling for anyone wondering. The megs show up briefly in the middle of the film and towards the final act, that's it.I felt this film had way too many plots and ideas and instead of choosing one that is solid enough and go with that, they chose to make a mis- mash of four different films. The narrative was cheesy and messy. Even for films like this, you would expect some foundation to justify the characters' actions. In this film, Jonas (Jason Statham) has an adopted daughter called Meiying (Sophia Cai), who is the daughter of Jonas's love interest that SPOILER ALRET gets killed off in this film for some reason with no explanation whatsoever.Now for my favorite part, the acting. Look, Jason Statham is alright. He is very typecasted for these kind of films and sometimes he makes it work. He was great in ''Hobbs and Shaw'' and I liked him enough in the first Meg. In this film, it was just a little too much for me. His dynamic with Meiying didn't work in my opinion at all and felt forced. Overall, the writing is just god awful.With all that being said, I did have some good times in parts. Them being mainly the scenes with the Megs. The final act where Jonas kills the megs is pretty entertaining. I think part of the problem with this film is that it has a PG-13 rating which limits the possibilities to get creative with this type of movie. Some jokes landed and made me laugh and more serious scenes made me laugh too. I would say this film is so bad its good. Don't watch this expecting anything new or interesting.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I would definitely recommend seeing it in 3D with expectations for a non-stop thrill ride of fun and predictable outcomes. I thought the acting was better than in the first and this one had some added antagonists and a few new creatures to say the least. I found the 3D jumpscares very entertaining as typically this would be not the type of movie that I would pay to see but I was in the mood for a fun thoughtless wildly entertaining thriller with a predictable outcome and the Meg 2 satisfied.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I expected silly entertainment, but this movie exceeded my worst expectations. Terrible acting, painful to watch and listen especially the terrible accent of Statham's Chinese sidekick, forced into the script to make the film pass through the Chinese censorship. The actor who plays him is known from such cinematic masterpieces as ""Liu Lang (Wolf Warriors) 1 & 2, and at least 3 parts of ""Zhan lang"" , few ""Zu Zong's"" and few Pan Deng's' and it can be heard that so far he hasn't had much opportunity to practice his English with one exception the class D Scot Atkins flick, the rest of his cinematic output consists of films that are Chinese propaganda films that painfully show how great a country China is even in the face of the end of the world. Meg2 is not one film, but two - first one it is an English-language film about murderous mutant sharks and the other the Chinese one, is something like a Huawei advertisement where a righteous and brave Chinese inventor gets caught in the middle of a movie with sharks. Meg2 has huge problem with the chronology of events - as if someone tripped in the editing room and fell on the hardware before saving the final version. The drama is predictable and downright boring.

The bad guys are seemingly ancillary. And new sea monsters come from nowhere. There is zero suspense. And the bad quality lacks a laugh. This poor film takes itself seriously. And that is beyond said. I'm a huge fan of Jason Statham as a B movie action hero. This is beneath him.

I won't go into too much detail as I don't think the movie deserves to be picked apart, the way some other reviewers have.I love a good shark movie and there are very few that are at the top of the list. However Jaws, Deep blue sea and Meg 1 & 2 are definitely my all time favourites.You have to take this movie with a pinch of salt, like with all shark related movies as all of them are pretty hard to believe.My only criticism is that, I know some parts of the movie are predictable, such as the sharks reaching the surface yet again and targeting a tourist island (same scenario in Meg 1), which in all honesty should at least have been a different concept. Maybe with the title being ""The trench"" it would have been more interesting to watch the characters fighting the sharks in their turf. However with that being said the movie doesn't dissapoint, with the inclusion of new and interesting creatures.The CGI I thought was brilliant. The sharks and other accompanying creatures are very realistic and badass. The sharks scenes are intense and thrilling.Jason Stathem taking on 3 gigantic prehistoric sharks?? I wouldn't expect anything less.If you want to watch a movie that is fun, entertaining and bonkers, this is the one. Ignore the haters because quite frankly for a shark movie, it's great. I have no problem paying to watch this again and I hope they bring out Meg 3.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

I don't think you need to have watched the first one per say. Jason Statham does Jason Statham things and that's a good enough reason as any to watch a movie for me. Actions great with or without the prehistoric fish. There's things that happen that aren't logical but you're watching Meg, it's brain dead action movie and it delivers on that.The graphics are pretty good, only complaint I'd have is if the sharks, or anything big moves a little quicker, I guess they're sluggish cause if they're size but it would've been a little more thrilling. The green screen for the background was great, better than I expected and looks like they actually threw money and time into it. It's littered with last minute saves and coincidences that happen just to keep the plot going. It's pretty fun but I think at some point it felt like it was being dragged, a few things in the plot could've been hurried through or cut out, second half could be shorter. But it did go all out on the action, of course the story's nonsensical and predictable but the movie does what it set it to do, acting was decent from everybody so it didn't feel like you're just watching only for Statham kicking sharks. I wish we got to see more of the kraken octopus though, more integrated into the story, but the megs had to have the spotlight I guess.I think if you're going to watch this you're going with your brain shut off and in that regard it's close to as good as it could get. It's exactly what you'd expect, so if you're looking for dumb action you'll get it, it you dislike it for being silly I'd blame that on you 'cause you should've known lol.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

The first half was uninspiring and boring, the second half got more interesting but was too little too late in the film's two-hour runtime. Oceans make up 71% of Earth's surface, but only 5% has been explored. Over 80% of the world ocean is not yet mapped or observed; that pressing mystery is the film's unique selling point. But these great mysteries of the watery deep were rushed into. A suspenseful, well paced build-up was nonexistent, and that selling point was quickly squandered. Because the film is called ""The Meg"" it takes no guesswork to anticipate what's coming. They could have thrown a few other prehistoric sea predators to keep the audience on their toes or even surprised. They also could have also briefly gone into some interesting facts/details about these animals in a plotline consolidation scene to help the audience to properly appreciate these dangers of the deep from a paleontology perspective. Several of the film's jump scares were decent.The film's deep ocean exploration wasn't scientifically accurate and apparently broke the laws of deep-sea physics, which is tolerable as it's for ""entertainment"" purposes, but grates nonetheless when you think how unimaginative the plot is. I'm a fan of Director Ben Wheatley, but felt he wasn't given much creative licence here, having seen and admired his previous works, it just seems like this was a well paid job he was contracted to do transactionally. On this project not a lot of his signature directorial ""fingerprint"" really registered. Wheatley's signature natural and vernacular dialogue and acting methodology was nowhere to be seen. Much of the attention was instead predictably heaped upon Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), the film's frontrunner. With DJ (Page Kennedy) having a few memorable moments and one-liners, as did Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai). Statham's action sequences were pretty good in the second half though, he can really work a jet ski.5.4/10.","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

With its attempt to improve upon its predecessor, the movie showcased significant potential. It managed to steer away from the A-rated label, yet despite its efforts, it still left viewers with mixed feelings. While the film provided an entertaining experience, it also suffered from several plot holes and inconsistencies. This review delves into the highlights and shortcomings of the movie, ultimately presenting an overall analysis of its merits and drawbacks.A Successful Attempt at Entertainment""Meg 2: The Trench"" successfully captivated its audience with its intense underwater scenes and breathtaking visuals. The film's special effects team did an exceptional job of creating a realistic deep-sea environment and the majestic yet terrifying Megalodon. The tension built through the exploration sequences and the intense hunt for the prehistoric predator kept viewers engaged throughout the film.The attempt to tone down the explicit content and language from the first movie was commendable. By making it more accessible to a broader audience, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" managed to gain a wider fanbase while retaining its core appeal of adrenaline-pumping adventure.Loopholes in the DeepDespite its entertaining elements, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" suffered from several glaring loopholes in its plot. The transition from the initial deep-sea exploration to the hunt for the Megalodon felt rushed and lacked coherence. Some events seemed too conveniently orchestrated, leaving questions about the characters' motives and decisions.Furthermore, the science behind the prehistoric creature's sudden appearance in modern times was glossed over, leaving a sense of disbelief among some viewers. Exploring the concept of a living Megalodon required a more comprehensive explanation to maintain credibility within the movie's universe.A Balance Between Fun and FearThe film did succeed in creating a balance between moments of thrill and lightheartedness. The witty banter between the characters provided much-needed comic relief amidst the perilous situations they encountered. This interplay of emotions helped maintain a sense of enjoyment and entertainment, keeping the audience engaged.The portrayal of the Megalodon as both an awe-inspiring predator and a formidable threat contributed to the movie's overall appeal. The suspenseful chase sequences and underwater battles were well-executed, further enhancing the film's entertainment value.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Therefore a team of I want to say conservationists (I may be wrong) that include the films star Jason Statham dive down to investigate after their company invents the technology to do so. What follows is about two thirds of the films worth of completely forgettable none-sense so much so that I'm actually struggling to remember what happens already. Followed by the inevitable last 30 mins balls to the wall action carnage and carnage is definitely how I would describe it. The film is disappointingly boring for most of its run time and the films final act isn't exactly groundbreaking as far as action films go, although with that being said it's considerably more entertaining that the first two thirds. None of the emotional moments land, you don't care about any of the characters and while bystanders seemed to get killed with ease the main cast seems near invincible.This film felt doomed to fail from the start and why a director with such skill as Ben Wheatley would sign on to this is beyond me. This is the man who gave us brilliant low budget British films like Kill List and Sightseers, why has he sunk to this to this level?Clearly the bright lights of Hollywood were too much to resist however hopefully and I mean this with the upmost respect he will now return to the British film industry as I can't see him having a load of offers on the table in Hollywood after this disaster.Not even Stathams charisma can save what is one of the worst films of the year.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

This sequel is directed by Ben Wheatley, director of Free Fire and Kill List
Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) and his investigative team detect multiple threats surrounding the Trench. From here, prehistoric Megalodons and other, older sea creatures manage to escape and thus create dangers in the modern world.Jonas and his team must stop these creatures before innocent people are endangered. During this mission they learn that there is a mole in their team, which they scam to get out financially better with another party.Director Ben Wheatley has more experience as a director with action films, but tries to direct a monster film for a change. Thanks to the story, this movie comes across more as an action movie than a real monster movie. The film is more concerned with the betrayal of the mole and how this leads to two different parties facing each other. The presence of the Megalodons and the other sea creatures sink to the bottom of the movie because of this. So it ends more like a long-winded action movie without really interesting or comical moments instead of an exciting monster movie.Because Ben Wheatley has no real experience with monster movies, the visual effects of this movie also seem a bit less credible compared to the first Meg movie. The Megalodons and the other sea creatures seem most believable when they are in dark sea scenes. These dark scenes do provide a more realistic effect of the dark, deep sea, but because of the further darkness you as a viewer cannot clearly see what exactly is happening or is present. Because of this ambiguity, the film is no longer really exciting. The only danger is that sometimes a sea creature suddenly attacks the people from the darkness. This makes the film reminiscent of the film 47 Meters Down. They also copy moments from other films such as Jaws, Jurassic Park or Deep Blue Sea, so that this second Meg film loses a lot of its originality.Jason Statham does deliver good and appropriate acting as the main role of the film, but he was better in the first film and has actually done better acting in many other roles. Shuya Sophia Cai now also delivers good acting work as an older actress, but she deserves to act in better films. The other returning cast members also portray their characters well, but were also better in the first film. Of the new cast members, Jing Wu gives the best acting as Shuya Sophia Cai's uncle her character. The further, new cast members play more bland villains or else are more new prey for the Megalodons and the other sea creatures.","40 out of 95 found this helpful.

Noses aside, the movie is fanciful, but most of the soon-to-be-eaten actors play really annoying characters so we begin to feel a secret schadenfreude as each meet their grisly end. This is accompanied by an equally secret thankful admiration for the monsters of the deep as they rid the seas of annoying pests.Hundreds of bullets from other human enemies never hit our stars, and all the action belongs in a theme park.It's really just a 3 star movie with revolutionary and incredibley important noses.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

That's not a nice way to talk about Jason Statham.Meg 2 Director Ben Wheatley makes Jason Statham face off against not one but several giant, prehistoric sharks this time around.Naturally the only other talent to reprise their roles are those who didn't become shark faeces in ""The Meg"".This doesn't leave many cast from the original apart from Kiwi Cliff Curtis as ""Mac"".Shuya Sophia Cai is back as Meiying (who was cute as a child, but just downright annoying as a stowaway, smart mouthed teenager).And Page Kennedy as the token African American with the token moniker ""DJ"" returns.Of course in the interests of diversity there is Jing Wu who's a poor man's cross between Jet Li and Jackie Chan.Unfortunately he's neither funny nor gets to show off his martial arts skills.The producers should never have entrusted a Billericay Dickie like Ben with the directing duties for this sequel.In this outing we see a theme park along the lines of Jurassic Park and plenty of underwater shots in the 25,000 foot deep trench.They use Hi-Tech Submarines to navigate to the murky depths.Just ask the passengers of the Titanic Submarine how that ends...oh that's right you can't.In fact, the first hour of this film has very little Meg action.""Jaws"" got away with that in the Summer of 1975, but it's not going to cut it in 2023 with an estimated budget of $130 million dollars.The whole film feels like it was only made to serve an Asian market.There were so many subtitles I thought I was watching ""Parasite"", difference being this ""Meg"" movie has only picked up one award.I'd love to forgive ""Meg 2: The Trench"" for using so much bad science, but I've seen ""Oppenheimer"" this year, which made this movie look like ""Dumb & Dumber To"".That's right!The dumbest one from that franchise, not the original.Just wait till you hear how you pressurise a human body at 25,000 feet below sea level, it's stupidly hilarious.Warner Bros. Has a lot riding on the second film in this franchise (most of it on Jet Ski stunts) and were much looser with budgetary restrictions.However it wasn't money well spent.It doesn't even fall into the ""it's so bad, it's good"" category.It's just bad, with a few redeemable scenes, which you probably saw in the movies trailer.It only gets a 4 from me.#1 For somehow enticing bald, tiny, action man Jason Statham to come back as ""Jonas"".#2 The Megs (plural)
#3 ""Pippin"" is back, and,
# 4 Higher kill count
It's not much better than ""5 Headed Shark Attack""...it's a real thing, a TV Movie made in 2017.I wanted to like this movie, because the first one was so much fun.It should a terrifying shark movie, instead it's downright laughable.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

The first movie I ever saw was Jaws, and have been a sucker for any fin flick ever since.Shark movies are hard to do well. Jaws is obviously the gold standard, and then there's everything else. Deep Blue Sea was pretty good, if a bit brainless. Open Water was awesome, but not rewatchable. All these flicks have one think in common, in that the sharks have to have an active role in the plot, either contributing to the terror or having some element of personality.The first Meg movie understood this. Meg 2 reduces them to glorified extras. There's no depth to them. They are neither scary, nor to the seem to possess any sort of intelligence. They simply show up at predictable plot beats, eat nameless actors, and then submerge back into the depths.That's it. That's the movie.Statham is a bland version of Statham's Jonas Taylor character. There are so many attempts at witty banter and humor, all of which falls flat. The only chuckle I had in the film was realizing that the little dog in the movie (yes, the same little dog from the first movie is back) is named Pippet. A deep cut reference to the name of the wood-stick-chasing dog from the original Jaws.There are no stakes. No suspense. Even the attempted homage to Sam Jackson's surprise death in Deep Blue Sea, fails to register a jump scare.None of the plot points from the second book exist. They mash in some elements of the third book into this flick, but even then those plot points are stripped of any significance.Other than names and the fact that Mega are sharks, there's nothing of the books to be found in this movie. A generous 4-star (out of 19) review. Skip it.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

The script is actually decent if you look beyond the horrible editing, performance, pacing, production design, character motives... I take it back, the story is terrible.Wu Jing is a good actor, but that's only true when he's speaking Chinese. Whenever he speaks English, he can't act, and he can't speak. His accent is so bad that I simply cannot take any scene seriously when English is in his mouth. Ironically, his lines in Chinese are actually very well-written (I'm Chinese), but the translation is so bland it sucks out all the joy of it. So when he's speaking Chinese and doing a great job, regular audience don't get it fully, and when he's speaking English, audience just fully don't get it.Jason Statham also did quite a terrible job, but his badness is diluted but Wu Jing's accent. Always that tough guy look, tone, stance from Fast and Furious, as main character aura glows throughout the movie above his big bald stupid head. Also, not sure if it's because he's too short or the actress who plays Meiyin grew too fast, whenever they share a scene they look like they about to kiss each other. The little bow fixing, flirty glances, awkward hugs... I'm almost dug a hole all the way to wherever Fun Island is with my toe at the end of the film, and the process is not fun at all.Bad film, so bad it makes me wanna watch the first one again. The fight between Meg and giant octopus was alright though.","20 out of 44 found this helpful.

The movie is plodding and poorly made, allowing the giant shark to take a backseat to an evil underwater drilling operation. Jason Statham's performance as Jonas, the deep-sea diver employee of the Zhang Institute, is visibly bored. The sequel reveals that the research facility has even kept one in captivity to continue studying it. Jiuming, the head of the institute, is even convinced that he can train the megalodon, but everything goes wrong when it escapes. The movie is not just a shark-escape-attack movie, but it is not as simple as it could be. The film ""The Trench"" by Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, and Dean Georgaris focuses on a fugitive meg who escapes while the crew is focused on something else. Instead of focusing on the fugitive meg, the script sends Jonas and his crew deep into the ocean to the trench that megalodons have called home for centuries. They discover other megalodons and evil humans mining the trench for resources. Jonas and his team stumble upon an illegal operation in the middle of the ocean, leading to their vessels being destroyed. The sequence where they are forced to walk the ocean floor to a facility is poorly executed, with few personality-less characters getting chomped or blown up. Meiying (Sophia Cai) saves most of the faux tension. Jonas, Jiuming, Meiying, and a few others eventually make it back above the surface, fleeing the facility overrun with soldiers. They head to a resort called Fun Island, where they finally have a little fun, but it's far too little and far too late. The sequel to the deep-sea monster attack movie The Meg 2 is a dinosaur-shaped dud, despite the Stath-v-megalodon interaction and numerous shots of gigantic, battle-scarred fins. The Meg 2 steals from other pictures (think Jurassic Shark) and throws extra creatures into the mix, including multiple megalodons, ocean-dwelling fish-lizard-creatures, an unheralded tentacled monster, and a rapacious forces of consumerism represented by a silky-voiced villain. The screenplay loses the essential purity of the ""man v shark"" premise of the original and finds itself fighting a battle on multiple fronts. Wheatley's writing is ill-served by delivering OTT action but lacks the punchy, cynical humour and crackling dialogue of Free Fire. The main issue is the complete chemistry vacuum between the cast, who appear to be delivering their lines in isolation, oblivious to the other actors who are sharing the screen at any given time. The franchise needs to be buried at the bottom of the Atlantic for a couple of decades, along with some illegally dumped nuclear waste, perhaps then it might finally mutate into something entertaining. Jason Statham returns as Jonas Taylor in Meg 2, but the film fails to provide enough background on his past aquatic cryptozoology adventures. The absence of Li Bingbing's character Suyin Zhang leads to the replacement of Suyin's brother Jiuming as Statham's buddy. This lack of romantic tension deflates Meg 2, as Statham falls back into his previous action-hero stereotypes. Sophia Cai returns as Suyin's daughter Meiying Zhang, but the film's nameless companions and the imbalance between deep terrors and B-movie ambitions are superficial.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

At best I was hoping for some mindless fun, but the film largely fails to deliver even this.Mostly this is because, like most monster movies, it gets too bogged down with uninteresting human melodrama. All of the sub plots and character interactions just feel so bland and uninspired, and dilute the main attraction of the film, which is of course the big shark action. As a result I actually think this film has a criminal lack of Meg action, and this made the whole thing lacking in tension slightly.As mentioned, the human side of things is lacking, and this is mostly due to the abundance of cliches, be it the characters themselves, the writing, or the performances. It's all just so generic and formulaic that it becomes a chore to even listen to the dialogue by the end of the film.At nearly 2 hours the film is far too long, and its pacing suffers slightly as a result. I really don't think a film with this premise should have you checking your watch.To give this film some credit, there are some pretty exciting sequences, but they are just too few and far between. The whole thing just needed more tension, more pace, and less distracting human drama.Meg 2: The Trench is a bit of a disappointment. I was hoping for some mindless fun, but it is just too frustrating to really deliver much enjoyment.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

There's some decent, super silly stuff in the last act that ought to be fun in its own schlocky way, but it's far too little far too late. By the time you get to what you came for, the feature has bombarded you with a boring and barely-there plot that lacks any sense of danger or escalation (despite a number of deaths). Worse still, it doesn't really spend all that much time on its titular beast(s) - or, rather, it doesn't give them enough attention (they're just sort of... there?). The flick just feels as though it's been cobbled together with the least amount of effort and passion possible. It's genuinely dull no matter what's happening. I can't believe this is directed by Ben Wheatley, who - for all his faults - usually at least has a distinct vision. It's one of the - if not the - worst movies I've seen all year. I'd say it was meg(a) disappointing, but I didn't think it would be any good in the first place.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

What convinced me to go was the preview, i.e, the food chain scene, which was copied from Jurassic Park. The walking underwater scene was way too long. However, what gets me is the octopus in the movie. We all know that there's going to be a fight between the octopus and the Meg. But when it happens it is so short and quite frankly a dud! Why is it when film makers have scenes like this, they always cut it short. ALWAYS! I was expecting a serious battle between the two and it was totally insignificant. In fact, you really don't know who won. Simply awful! Could've been cut out altogether. It reminded. Me of Godzilla King of the Monsters. Fans want to see those battles, but directors cut them out. Cut out that stupid dog. Did we really have to be inundated with the amphibious creatures throughout. We want creature fights in movies like this.

I'm Karen, a proud Texan at the ripe age of 56, and I just had to share my thoughts on ""Meg 2."" Y'all, let me tell you, this film is nothing short of amazing; it's as cool as a Texas breeze on a hot summer day! It's safe to say that this is hands down the best movie I've seen since the unforgettable ""Titanic.""""Meg 2"" took me on a heart-pounding journey beneath the waves, and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The underwater world they've created is truly mesmerizing, with jaw-dropping visuals that made me feel like I was diving alongside the characters. The action sequences were so intense that they had my heart racing faster than a bull at a rodeo.What's even better is that this film isn't just for us grown-ups; my kids were absolutely captivated by it too! It's a rare gem that manages to strike a chord with different generations. The storyline was engaging and kept all of us hooked, young and old alike.And speaking of greetings from Texas, yee-haw indeed! I couldn't help but feel a swell of pride as a Texan watching this movie. The spirit of adventure and tenacity displayed by the characters resonated with that classic Lone Star state attitude.So, whether you're a seasoned moviegoer or just looking for a film that the whole family can enjoy, ""Meg 2"" is an absolute must-see. Grab your popcorn and buckle up for a wild underwater ride that'll leave you talking long after the credits roll. Here's to more movies like this that unite generations and deliver unforgettable cinematic experiences. Until next time, y'all! ü§†üé¨üåäWarmest regards from the heart of Texas (TX),
Karen.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

Its a fairly enjoyable movie but when you have giant sharks and monsters eating and killing peoples left and right and there is basically no blood, no gore, water as clear as it can be, it totally kill my ""suspension of disbelief"".That being out of the way ... This movie is kinda different from the first. They already know about the Trench, the Megs and everything. So they kinda blend a lot of different stuff to make a hodge podge of a movie. You have Jason Statham doing action scenes like fist fights, wich he didn't from what i recall in the first. You have some tension scenes. And finally the movie at some point just become one of those monster movies where plenty of peoples dies and you just enjoy (but without much blood as i mentioned).Since i saw it in theatre some of the scenes looked cool on the big screens. Don't get me wrong, its really one of those ""gotta turn your brain off"" movie and really do not try to find logic in some of the situations, but if you do this, you should had a good time. I REALLY wish tough an UNCUT version would release on bluray, altough i doubt adding THAT MUCH blood and gore (to match what happen) would be possible without the movie looking weird as it was made to be PG-13.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

You can tear this apart bit by bit and on almost any point this film is silly and pretty bad. However the movie also know this, and does not try to be anything else. The acting is solid, and the production value is pretty good. At the end of the day, if you have absolutely nothing else to do this is not so bad, it is even kinda fun at times.First of, you cannot take this for serious. If you sit down and watch this and immediately start complaining, seriously? I mean, look at the name of the movie and the movie poster and the trailer, what did you expect? Secondly this is not the worst C-movie you have ever seen. Sure it is laughable and almost cliche but also a bit entertaining. I can see myself having a few beers and a pizza late at night watching this just for passing time.My main issue with this movie is not the production value or the silliness, or big CGi sharks. All those things I can forgive. As said this movie know what it is, and for what it is its not so bad. What I cannot forgive is the cliches - an evil corporation using big enormous sharks for shadowy stuff? Oh, that is original... And the message seem to be that capitalism is bad and we should not allow executives to come near water. Very tiresome.I give this a generous 4/10. This is a pretty bad movie, but it is a watchable bad movie so if you have nothing else to do, why not? You can definitely do worse.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

All of the creatures were over the top as is everything else in this movie. Jonah has turned into a eco warrior and he's running around beating people up fighting pollution so he's basically a brooding Captain Planet. Most of the crew from the first is back minus Ruby Rose and Bingbing. There's a few other new additions, but the biggest is Wu Jing who is a huge star in China so this movie is going to crush it in China and pretty sure that's the only reason he's in this. He just feels like when another actor replaces the original actor of a longtime character like in the show Spartacus. There is winks and nods at other shark movies like Deep Blue Sea and Jaws the Revenge. I didn't like not having Rose and Bingbing back and my other issue was it's like two movies in one. The beginning is save the planet from people to suddenly having to save the planet from monsters. The first half slogs, but the last half goes completely bonkers.If you liked the first one then you'll like this one.

I just mainly got lost on wondering these type of things and snoozed the rest of the movie. It's bad, it doesn't deliver, it's boring.

But this isn't a Megalodon movie. Under the Sea is a movie about smuggling. Although it is Meg 2, we see Megaladon towards the end of the movie. This spoiled the fun of the movie. Megaladon scenes were very few. It was good as an action, but the fight scenes were overexposed. Especially Jason Statham. Cgi was sometimes good, sometimes very bad. It was fun to watch as a popcorn movie. There are some scenes, i fell asleep... Although I enjoyed watching it in the cinema in general, I think it's a bad movie. I think it would be better if there were more Megaladon scenes, if it was a bit of a scientific movie rather than an action movie. But this movie is also a book adaptation.","17 out of 44 found this helpful.

Add in environmental messaging about evil mining operations and humorous conversations about parenting, and you get a green sequel that doesn't have the same bit as the first film.The film was directed by Ben Wheatly. Writing credits go to Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, and Dean Georgaris.THINGS I LIKED:If you like Jason Statham as I do, you'll get a kick out of this movie. He also worked as one of the Executive Producers of the film. He's great a comedy, drama, and, of course, action. If you liked the first Meg movie, this is more of the same schtick...and a lot of fun.Other cast members include Jing Wu, Shuya Sophia Cai, Page Kennedy, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Sienna Guillory, Cliff Curtis, and Skyler Samuels. Everyone does a great job.Like the first Meg movie, there is a large Chinese influence. I've been to China many times on business trips and love the country and its people. One of my sons even married a lovely girl from Hong Kong! I now have a half-Chinese grandson who is ridiculously adorable.Impressive set pieces.For a creature feature, we see plenty of crazy action.The movie, thankfully, doesn't take itself too seriously. The trailer clearly showed us this would be a goofy, summer, popcorn movie.If you enjoy watching mean-spirited, stupid people die, this film is for you.Some of the VFX are great, while others aren't so great.The scenarios are ridiculous, but no one will ever say this movie isn't creative!In addition to an even bigger Meg, than we saw in the first film, we see sharks, more Megs, and a bunch of creepy, crawly monsters that fight dirty.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:You can't fault people for their heavy Chinese accents, yet some people probably will.Apparently, Page Kennedy, one of the actors in the film who happily collected his paycheck stated, ""This is some dumb a$$ shiX. Mark my words.""
British director Ben Wheatley is known for his horror movies such as Free Fire, In The Earth, and Kill List. Fans of the horror genre are disappointed that this movie doesn't have enough blood and gore. I'm totally fine without all of that!Sometimes, it's hard to tell exactly what's happening in the dark scenes and when creatures are all over the place attacking humans.I hate shaky cam.It's outlandish.The villains are easily unlikeable and just silly.TIPS FOR PARENTS:In the first scene, we see dangerous, prehistoric creatures fight and devour each other.Lots of destruction.People are in perilous situations
A lot of people die.People violently fight other people and creatures with various weapons.Blood and gore.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Thus, appealing to nobody.He's silly, basically. Let him be silly.On the one hand, I totally understand the need to cater to a broader clientele (especially with productions burdened by a larger price tag - so as to recoup the hefty budgets given, turn a profit & increase the value of share holder's stock etc. Capitalism, baby) & consequently, why executives put so much pressure on creators to bend their visions, ever so slightly (during all stages of development; appeasing those who dare not wish to see studios taking risks with their money - preferring safe investments, subsidised with cash from their pockets)... But we also mustn't forget that filmmaking is - after all - an art form (constantly fraught with risk - which has to be taken for any possibility of thriving) & for example, if one commissions a piece of artwork from a particular person (renowned for possessing a certain, signature style of which they're known for), then in theory, one must also accept that they should be permitted the creative freedom to express themselves authentically (in that way), without corporate shills constantly breathing down their necks with disapproval.Therefore, we can all agree (?) for instance, it would be clearly illogical to purchase an iconic piece by Rembrandt & then berate the painting for not emulating the works of Picasso; they're two entirely different entities, whose outlooks were defined by separate lifestyles & thus, bore very individualistic fruit - in terms of how they captured perceptions of reality (& communicated them) at the time.The efficacy of what was conjured will forever remain subjective (in stirring emotions or articulating the point apparently intended); after all, art is meant to provoke debate & stimulate discussion... Nevertheless, both are valid in their own right & (not to labour a point) if one specific approach is selected, then it should be respected, specifically.The same can be said here; so afraid of failure are those behind the scenes, their inability to allow originality, experimentalism & recalcitrance (deviating little from the formulaic, cut & paste template used for a usual blockbuster) stymies the project's chances of succeeding on its own terms - ironically bringing about the very outcome sought to be avoided; a bitter-sweet, self-fulfilling prophecy, as it were & a mistake repeated again & again & again, noticeably at Warner Bros.Subsequently, Ben Wheatley's held back by a visible obligation to be what he's wanted to be (by others in higher positions of power around him), not who he actually is, himself. Granted, his identity occasionally shines through the banality of the generic blockbuster filmmaking he's consigned to undertake - & I appreciated those glimmers, irrespective of how few & far between they seemed... But those fleeting moments of brilliance aren't enough to compensate for the rest of it, unfortunately.Hence, I left the cinema, dissatisfied.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sadly the screen was quite small. The opening sequence was pretty great and some incredible scenery shots were beautiful but ultimately it didn't need to be seen in 3D unfortunately..
I will say, on its own two feet, this film was great. It did this in a completely unexpected way to me. From the trailers I was all geared up for ridiculousness just this side of Sharknado, and I was happy with that!!However! It turned out to be so much more. I don't mean to say this movie rips off anything. I'd only say parts were familiar simply because they came before. The movie itself retains it's uniqueness.For me it belongs alongside Leviathan, Jurassic Park, Alien (or maybe Aliens), Pitch Black, Deep Rising and of course Jaws.It manages to be about the people not the megs. Not bigger more glorious deaths. Though it has those.Like the aforementioned films it draws you in and makes you care. So the 'beat the clock' moments are really intense... And not everyone works out for the heroes. In fact when one or two does, you get comfortable and then BAM!, one doesn't. But not in a gimmicky way. It really works. I was never taken out of the story.Also, like the aforementioned movies, the humor is natural. Not necessarily realistic every time I suppose but it never undermined the moment or the movie
The men made mistakes but were strong, competent, take charge and caring characters.The women were strong competent characters who were human and made mistakes.I... REALLY enjoyed this film. Definitely going to be a purchase. I'm ready for a 3rd. I genuinely don't believe it can be better than this one, but that's ok.","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

Which is what it was meant to be, and it doesn't fail to deliver on that part. And this is a rear sequal that improves upon the first. The Action is cranked up, the tension is cranked up, and so is the humouras characters, goofy as anything no less. But believe it or not, this movie has more good then bad. Starting of with the Characters.Characters,They are way more goofy this time, and sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's not. Like for example, when an army of soldiers try to attack them, the scene has some tension but also uses humour as a destraction, this is a good thing as they use a clever technique to get out of the situation. And for me it worked. However, this is a bad thing at times as there's not enough Character development here. To make you route for the characters, so it's kind of difficult. And if your looking for a movie with less goofy characters and a better overall story, then just watch Jaws or Deep Blue sea. The new auditions here are fine, but in execution they don't work. And large proportions of that is down to the lack of development and traits they may or could have sustained throughout some of the movie, but sadly it lacks here. And there also here for comic relief, atleast it felt like that. So it sort of looses it's tension In that respect, again it does suit (no pun intended) works with the overall story/Movie. Now onto the Plot.Plot,Has an interesting start, which is on the trailer. But it's got some vastly good ideas, because it's got Dinosaurs, and time sequence that takes place 65M years before. And the Dinosaur sequence starts of with tension, and keeps it up. And then the T-Rex comes, and is loud and let's out a gasply terrifying roar. And now that's the moment the tension drops for the suspenseful part. And is such a beutiful scene, and that's when the Credits roll up and we are now greeted with the present day, and it all comes naturally, it's not all in your face, and there's no Music, which is a good thing, for the same reason. It's a quick action-Packed start, still manages to not be to overbearing and in your face, which will keep you away from possible neusia, as it's not over stuffed.Talking about the present day, as the small Dinosaurs, and the 2 other Megs has come out of the Trench. The team, in overly equipped armour built suites go to investigate the Mariana trench. And are conflicted with facing the biggest Meg. Which does lack tension, granted the scene is amusing and entertaining. But the armour suites detract from what the original had, and that was having no protection, and only a smart and clever way to figure out how to get out of it. And then the second act takes place. On a cruise ship. Where they are captured by the Army. But break free easily, and have a clever way to get out. No Spoilers. And that's when the third act takes place on an island. The Name of the island is so dumb, its hillarious. But one thing the movie does well is managing to balance out the lighter and darker tones, which majority of the time works well respectfully, probably 85%. As I said it does lack some development and can lack the tension. But mostly does work. Now Moving onto the Action.Action/Effects,The Colours on the movie is a delight, so much colour and attention to detail is quite incredible really. The slick tone really elevates the action sequences. And the Dinosaurs really are well designed, lots of detail and are well integrated with the plot, and actually have some great moments, like when they get to take down the greedy Army men. Those scenes were well shot, well paced, and had the tension to keep it interesting. The Characters don't have much personality, and are thin of any traits, but do have some moments to shine. Like when Octopus shows up, and Mi Ling is trapped, one of the team members saves her. Statham shows us a clever side and has to think of interesting ways to kill of the Megladons. And the tension and the humour which can get annoying is also cranked up in the final act.The end scene wasn't very good, it felt rushed. And didn't end in a good place, but overall it's a Fun film that gets WAY to much hate. It's meant to be dumb, and it's meant to be fun. And it is. And it doesn't fail to Entertain, which is it's main focus and job. That offers a few laughs here and there. Now time for my Verdict.Verdict,6.5/10 Fairly good. Recency Bias when I watched the first one I put 7, but I think overtime it's a 6.Meg=6/10, Meg 2:The Trench 6.5/10Overall rating for the sequal=12.5/20 NOT Bad!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The baddies are the work of an inside job and add the ocean's trench and you can see where this is headed. Good thing they got Jason to save the day because he's pretty much the last action hero in movies today.Still, it wasn't bad and I did enjoy the action packed third act.

Really, they may have tried to put too much in one film, or not made it long enough in my opinion.It's an easy film to watch and turn off your mind; I would ignore the negative reviewers if you just want to use your imagination. The plot holes are rather insignificant.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was left with rolling my eyes through half of the movie - it was predictable and too much.There weren't any plotwists, only one which was obvious. It felt like there were 15 different producers who added their ideas in one movie.

One of the few smart decisions this film makes is to really focus on his relationship with Shuya Sophia Cai which remains really endearing.Despite his previous work Ben Wheatley has made a Meg sequel more voiceless and bloodless than the original. He also struggles with the huge leap in budget from his usual work with choppy action and underwater sequences where it's hard to tell who's still alive.On the other hand, his film is more knowingly stupid than its predecessor and the prehistoric opening gets it started on the right foot. There's a few knowing needle drops that work and the third act essentially saves the film from being a truly awful missed opportunity.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I love how scientifically accurate this movie is, megalodons that are known to be extinct because the water temperatures got too cold it for it too survive, so what did this movie do? Put the meg in an underwater sea cloud below the Mariana Trench, the Meg would not have been able to survive temperatures below 12 degrees Celsius so what a good idea it would be to put this prehistoric shark below the coldest part of the ocean. The trench can reach temperatures from 4 - 1 degrees Celsius which the Meg wouldn't be able to survive already but to put it underneath this, therefore the water being colder, why would the megaladon be living in the coldest part of the sea? And the only thing preventing it from coming to warmer water is a thin sea cloud that it only escaped from once a ship went through it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The question of course is what qualifies them to do reviews in the first place and nine times out of ten its nothing. They do not seem to be a fan of cinema but they want to be celebs in their own right by pushing out unqualified reviews or wasting peoples time with ""reaction"" videos. So far so dumb.One such reviewer couple, male and female claimed that nothing happens in the first hour. They must have fallen asleep as we have deaths, explosions, chases and punch ups, all within the first few mins and it doesn't let up. This couple then claimed that the movie should have been like the closing action sequence all the way through the movie because ""that is what they came for"". Such a clueless viewpoint just shows the mentality of these YouTube reviewers. It seems some people expected Jason to be punching a giant CGI shark for two hours. Oh dear. The other complaint doing the round is there are no sharks until the final act, no true either, nor is it true that if you have seen the trailer you have seen all of the action scenes. Make me think these reviewers are simply repeating each others lies about this. The fact is there is more action and better story in this film, while the previous one was more like Jaws, this is its own movie. And Ben Wheatleys' background in horror is self evident because what this movie has over the previous one are far more satisfying death scenes. Just about everyone and everything that dies does so in a manner that brings a warm glow.Its obvious that this is doing well at the box office through word of mouth, just goes to show that these YouTube characters seem to be screaming into the void. Very few people are listening to their opinions and those that do seem to have them over ridden by people they know who have seen this. I would recommend this as a big screen experience, the first one did what it said on the tin, this time you are gonna need a bigger tin to fit it all in.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A MEGa Mashup of Movie Genres In One Absurdly Fun Package","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9237570/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","4 August 2023","LIKES:Fast Fun:
-I went in knowing what this movie was going to be and I wasn't disappointed that the pace of the film was on point.-Pedal to the medal, ridiculous speed that seldom stops moving in the chaotic brew of prehistoric beats.-You'll have little time to reset before the next incident occurs and for those seeking mindless thrills, this movie's pace does extraordinarily well with that.-And it really adds to the chaos if I'm being honest.The Visuals To A Point:
-The movie is using its budget well to bring these ancient beasts to life and the definition for the most part is great.-Animation is the solid point, fluid, anatomical, and feeling a bit more in tune with natural movements compared to the lower budget
-And the environments they generate are fantastic in regards to where we play, especially in the titular trench when we are down there.-To say they truly added the Hollywood spectacle of action meets monster is an understatement and this movie almost gloats for how much they did to make this film emerge from the depths.The Acting:
-It's no Oscar performance, but the team delivers a high caliber Sci-Fi movie performance compared to a lot of the media.-Curtis reprises his usual role. He's snippy, serious, a figure head that knows how to roll with these productions and fit well. A great ballast point that works with his crew.-Wu is a nice addition to the film. A tad complex at the beginning, but then turns his action and comedy roots for the second part of the film that somehow really works in the cheesy fun angle.-And Statham is Statham. You don't get much variety, but what you get is consistency and that perfect cheese factor. Dry, blunt, action oriented, with enough vulnerability to give his character more.It's really a perfect center for all the crew put together, with a chemistry that feels very much like this genre expects to be delivered: fun, loyal, and quite competent.The First Part:
-It might be a bit jumbled at the start, but the first act of the film held some potential for a new direction of the movie.-Jonas and his crew are once more in a world that they don't want to be in, and what they discover and explore in the trench accomplishes something the first one didn't.-The movie has elements of horror with its campiness, crafting a nightmarish world that like 2020's Underwater, works to convey the pressures of the deep.-Add some elements of Deep Impact, the Abyss, and Deep Blue Sea and you have this combination that works to be discomforting, but fun as the first leg of the story opens up.-It's probably the component that is the best balanced for me in terms of quality and 'quality' alongside visuals for 3-D to make good with.The Sound:
-I know most don't care about this, but the sound may be about a third of the reason this movie has the ""bite"" it does.-Science fiction films require some techniques to make the world even more immersive and Meg 2 does not shy away from giving your ears as much of an experience as your eyes.-Immense roars of the denizens of the deep are the start, alongside the breaths, screams, and cries of the humans that engage with them.-While the second part of the film is all about chaotic crunching, crashing, and all other sounds you associate when it comes to a movie like say, Godzilla.-It's loud and obnoxious, but in a film like this, almost a staple when it comes to the carnage at hand with these beasts.The Comedy:
-The movie's highest point for me is the comedy and how they balance it.-Meg 2 is just going to be a hilarious movie at how ridiculous the concept is and how loose they play with the physics. There are actually jokes bashing itself for just how crazy the theories are.-And when you throw in the ""extra acting"" factor, the movie is again that stupidity and ignorance that fans of the genre love when it comes to these over the top films.-The real brilliance though comes in two or three factors for me and more so how though ever present, is not as obnoxious as other movies tend to do.-One: Nostalgia and references of the past being used to joke about how absurd the film is now and how idiotic they were.-Two: The banter and sarcasm are well balanced and fun. Stupid? Absolutely. But the acting and the expectations of the genre welcome it and I laughed at the dialogue a lot ,probably more than I should have.-Three: The Character DJ, Page Kennedy, was my favorite character. He was competent, he evolved, he was stupid, but he was fun. Kennedy took great lines and made it his own, that though a bit in your face, were timed, balanced, and held a point.-This may be the biggest fun and quality of life in the movie and probably the reason I had as much fun as I did.DISLIKES:
Predictable:
-No surprise, these movies have been done to death and don't hold much surprises for people like me.-The movie lays out what it's going to do, pretty much sets up who won't make it, and how they are going to. So to lack surprise is a dig for me and something this movie could have done better with.The Opening Scene/Scenes:
-Meg 2's trailer is pretty much almost the entire opening sequence, at least the TV spot.-However, outside of technology show off, it's purpose is pretty much flat, pointless, and dare I say a waste of time to the story or even the relevance.-Even the next scene holds very little outside of a Statham stunt show, which comes later and more relevant, but tries to hastily set up what's been going on the past six years since the last film.-I think there were better ways to do this with more relevance, but... it's short lived and lost to the rest of the film that most aren't going to care.The Pace In Terms of Suspense:
-That first part of the movie I told you about held so much promise for a return to the more serious Science Fiction films.-It set that out well, until nearing the end of it, where the pace sort of amped up how many people go out in this film.-Movies like Underwater and Deep Blue Sea, with similar tones, played around with survival a bit more, and I had hoped for something similar given how this film started.-Once this point happens, the pace and handling of characters is kind of loose and loses this element, something I wish had been held on more to add that little engagement factor I like.The Absurdity Gets A Little Out Of Hand:
-The critics calling the whole thing a bloated mess are correct to a point, but that's what I expected going into this film.-However, the movie does sometimes take it a tad too far that does dip the quality of the film, though escapists and super fans do appreciate it.-No spoilers, but at time the carnage gets a little much, and seeing angles of people getting swallowed whole gets a tad boring, flat, and silly.-Other times, how idiotic many of the people are is a bit much, really only acting as more encouragement for mindless chaos and comedy that works with the cheesy humor, but again goes a tad too much.-And then to sort of change up the consistency and competency of the beasts, well the pace got a bit ahead of itself to wrap up in two hours.The CGI effects:
-The movie has improved on some levels, but I can't say it's the most realistic thing I've seen.-For one thing, I know they could do it, as we've seen the impossible brought to life with the technology of the modern era. And while I didn't need everything to look like what they did with LOTR, original Jurassic Park, etc.... a little more work could have helped.-I know, that's part of the genre, we've seen this so many times. But given the budget and advancements since then, I guess I would have pushed for a little more to just sort of stand out other than an impressive submerged world.THE VERDICT:
Meg 2: The Trench is a film that many are calling right, just a big, loud, messy film that is so off the wall cheesy and silly that you wonder how it exists. But.... The movie is fun and a big bout of escaping the real world for just that mindless fun that original Sci-Fi channel did so well in the 90s and 2000s. It uses the theater well, alongside the 3-D visuals, making it a theater worthy film for guys like me just in how everything comes together for the experience. While the acting is not Barbie and Oppenheimer level, it's fun and quality for this movie that met expectations and made it fun to go on the ride. And given the pace of the film, that fun is magnified in order to take the comedy written into the film, to massive proportions that I think is the best part of this film. It has fun with itself, gives you this cornball adventure with survival, and makes it a point they recognize how stupid it all sounds. Of course it does have problems in terms of an overall movie rating that some might not like. There are pointless scenes that showboat the computer effects, it gets out of hand like most films and runs too far with the absurdity, and the pace ends up tearing up some of the building moments to meet the time limits. The transition from the tense first part to the over the top second part can also be a bit of a jump, but if you can deflect that and know it was going this direction, you'll be fine. Attempting to factor all of this in, I give the movie the following scores:Action/Adventure/Horror: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

The movie boldly asks us to suspend disbelief as it presents Jonas, our intrepid hero, with a seemingly improbable feat: surviving 500 atmospheres of crushing deep-sea pressure. However, it's not just because he's portrayed by Jason Statham; the film's logic hinges on a clever twist. In this aquatic world, unlike in the airy realm above, water doesn't yield to pressure; hence, all Jonas needs to do is replace the air in his lungs with water - a seemingly simple solution that adds an extra layer of zany charm to the narrative.This level of absurdity would spell disaster for a more earnest cinematic endeavor, but 'The Meg 2: The Trench' embraces it with gusto, proudly wearing its ludicrousness as a badge of honor. Remarkably, the audience not only accepts this audacious approach but wholeheartedly embraces it, fully aware that they've invested their hard-earned money for a spectacle of CGI shark mayhem, and boy, do they get it in spades.In this sequel, the stakes are even higher with the introduction of not one, not two, but three Megs, and as a special treat, a Kraken is thrown into the mix as a bonus monster. But hold on, there's more! Deep within the titular trench, a place where creatures have evolved in isolation for countless millennia with no contact with the terrestrial world, we're introduced to four-legged amphibians that can casually amble about on land and breathe as though it's a walk in the park. Because, well, why not? What truly matters is that there's a relentless onslaught of sea monsters attacking from every conceivable direction, whether it's on land or beneath the waves.For those curious about the storyline, Jonas naturally makes his return, but the love interest from the first installment has met a tragic fate, leaving him in the role of a surrogate father to her daughter, Meiying, played by the spirited Shuya Sophia Cai. It's a move straight out of the contemporary filmmaking playbook - the 'family' card, an easy ploy employed by many modern movies to connect with audiences. Meiying, as expected, embodies the archetype of the precocious movie kid who defies Jonas's guidance at every turn, often placing herself in perilous situations. Yet, in the spirit of delivering a thrilling and enjoyable cinematic experience, this film ensures that the adorable youngster always manages to come through unscathed. With only a few exceptions, the victims here are typically unsavory characters whose unfortunate fate as shark bait doesn't exactly leave us shedding tears.Introducing a fresh face to the mix, we meet Meiying's uncle, Jiuming Zhang, portrayed by Jing Wu. He presides over a remarkable underwater facility and has a peculiar companion in the form of a Megalodon named Haiqi. Zhang's nurturing approach involves clicker-training this colossal sea creature, akin to taming a puppy-a narrative element reminiscent of Chekov's Gun, a detail that the film momentarily appears to misplace but later reclaims with a surprising twist near the climax. This unexpected turn almost serves as a dramatic payoff, adding an intriguing layer to the story.Regarding the marauding sea creatures, the CGI work may appear somewhat rough around the edges, with that characteristic glossy, almost surreal appearance. However, given that the entire film essentially embraces a live-action cartoon aesthetic, these visual quirks are hardly a deal-breaker. One commendable aspect is the distinct look of the massive Alpha Meg, whose weathered hide bears a tapestry of scars reminiscent of Moby Dick. It's as if the scars narrate a history of battles, a testament to age, resilience, and power. Although it doesn't exactly imbue the Meg with a personality, it does render him iconic, and one can't help but wish for a more personalized showdown between him and Jonas-the two resilient alpha males hurtling toward a confrontation where only one will emerge victorious.Perhaps such depth was too much to expect, but at least Haiqi, the pet Meg, assumes a pivotal albeit enigmatic role in the climax. Is she merely following her predatory instincts, or has she forged a connection with Zhang? The script's Chekov's Gun moment leaves us genuinely uncertain about the outcome. However, rest assured, the narrative ties up as neatly as sashimi in a fish market ravaged by a hurricane, which is about as tidy as one can hope for in a film with such a staggering, uncountable body count.The lingering question on our minds is whether 'Meg 3' will take the concept of clicker-training to new extremes, potentially crafting a scenario reminiscent of 'Jurassic World,' wherein a disciplined pack of Megalodons could serve as a team of aquatic attack dogs. It might sound utterly absurd, but let's not forget that embracing the ridiculousness is precisely what made 'The Meg 2' such a delightful surprise.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

While not quite as strong as the first film (which I personally loved) it's still a mostly solid sequel.The opening and set-up work nicely, followed by some creepy trench exploration that's possibly the most horror-esque sequence throughout both of the Meg films. The movie slows down a little during its second act, however, and the monster action takes a backseat for a fairly uninteresting action/eco-terrorist plot... but Meg 2 is mostly saved by going full throttle once again in the finale, with plenty of sharky, tentacly, lizardy, Jason Stathamy goodness to go around.All in all, Meg 2 is probably a fairly strong 7/10, if you enjoy these kinds of popcorn movies. I hope they keep making these, or at least round things off with a third instalment.

In 'Meg 2: The Trench,' we get taken on another ridiculous ride in the South China Sea with perennial badass Jason Statham as the oceanic explorer Jonas Taylor and his motley crew.This has everything you don't need in a movie - fake-looking CGI sharks, hundreds of near-misses/buzzer beaters, poorly-timed jokes, plot holes, bad acting and more. Granted, 'Meg 2' was never going to be a good film, but it's surprising how it feels like two completely different movies in one. The first half, while far from great, is at least interesting given the emphasis is not solely on the film's namesake (and feels like a slightly better version of that Kristen Stewart movie from a few years ago). But once things hit the halfway point, everything quite literally jumps the shark.Unfortunately for all of us, 'Meg 2' did alright at the box office, which means we'll probably be seeing a continuation of this saga at sea.

This worried me a little, because what I liked the most about the Meg (2018), was its goal to stay out of Sharknado territory (a made-for-TV film from 2013, about tornados, containing sharks) and try to teeter closer to Jaws (1975), type-of-quality territory, instead. The first film managed to do that, but landed slightly between Jaws 2 (1978) and Jaws 3-D (1983). Anyway, I liked the Meg (2018). The plot in Meg 2: The Trench (2023), establishes, that the film takes place in current day, 2023. In this 2023, our team of divers, with their very futuristic-looking equipment, head to the bottom of the sea, this time, to 25,000 feet, to test out the equipment. They also, after just five years, have a pet megalodon. More on that later.Completely opposite to the first film, this time, Jason Statham's seasoned diver, Jonas Taylor, jumps right into action, rather enthusiastically, for this test run. He wasn't that excited, nor enthusiastic, to get into things in the first film. In the Meg 2: The Trench (2023), Taylor and the gang, have to deal, with multiple megs, a giant octopus, lizard-like Snappers (which are pulled, right out of science-fiction) and a group of bad-guys, who hijack the diver's home base and strand Taylor and crew, on the bottom of the ocean. When I saw the Meg (2018), I was bad, with preparing for the movie, didn't do my homework and found out, before seeing this movie, that the Meg movies, are based off of a group of novels, by a guy named, Steve Alten. I guess, he is the modern-day version of Clive Cussler, with the added touch of dinosaurs. So, knowing that, helps set the narrative more for these films and explains a lot.In Meg 2: The Trench (2023), I wasn't expecting a classically-designed bad-guy (Sergio Peris-Mencheta as Montes), with aspirations of nefarious goals, leading a group of mercenaries and not worried about wrecking the world. I just thought Meg 2: The Trench (2023), would just contain more sea monsters and dangers of the deep. This was a problem though, because I felt Montes, was one of the clumsiest, laziest, idiot-like, bad-guys, I've seen in a while. In this film, if you look closely, he doesn't accomplish anything. Taylor has no problem, tossing this guy around. It was kind of laughable to watch the Montes character in this film. I mean, really, the closest thing to a human bad-guy in the last film, was Rainn Wilson's, greedy, billionaire businessman, Jack Morris. But, he actually is the best character in that film and one you love to hate. His presence is missed in this film. He also was responsible for some of the best lines and comedy-relief moments from the last film. In this film, the comedy one-liners were dispersed throughout, with the rest of the cast. Rainn Wilson was missed. I know, it's impossible. How about a twin brother? Just kidding.Along with Statham, other returning champs come back for the second film, such as, Page Kennedy as DJ and Cliff Curtis as Mac. They get to try the jokes out and even though, they couldn't match Rainn Wilson level, they still were good enough. Both guys, especially Curtis, are pretty good actors. One of the problems with Meg 2: The Trench (2023), was the pet megalodon sub-plot. So, I am being a little facetious here, when I say, ""pet megalodon"". It's actually their captive, baby megalodon, who can be, slightly controlled by audio clicks, produced by scientist-diver, Jiuming Zhang (Wu Jing). This ""relationship"", which wasn't silly at all, just ended up being a useless part of the story. I kept forgetting about the ""good"" megalodon. I did like Wu Jing's character though. A nice touch to this film, was the return of Pippin, the dog, which is a great homage to Jaws (1975). Pippin had a hilarious moment in Meg (2018). My fear about Meg 2: The Trench (2023), didn't happen, too much. The comedy usage was about the same, with, maybe, a little more comedy in this one, but that helped dampen the slow start-up, in the beginning of the film. The first film, just flowed, a little bit better. No pun intended.6.1 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I gave it a 2 or 3 stars because I actually don't even think there's anything the actors could do to save the script so the acting isn't even the worse part.What I expected and what it was...
I didn't expect this to be scary but at least have some jump scares and a bit of excitement and some cohesive story however I found myself fast forwarding through most of the first half's dialogue because it was that boring. The action scenes are pretty bad with overdone Cgi making it hard to even follow what is happening in the scene. I actually kept forgetting some scenes were supposed to be under water as it didn't resemble water at all, it looked more like bad space scenes.Another issue was the way the actors were so unaffected by things, like when their friends and family are possibly dead the rest of the crew acts so matter of fact that it leaves the viewer not caring either.It's a good movie to keep on while doing house work since there's only a couple ok scenes and the storyline is pretty dumb.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie barely avoids becoming a big, unwatchable mess.Even so, not using Li Bingbing was inexplicably DUMB.

Jonas & his research team come across multiple deadly creatures, while exploring the extreme depths of the ocean, while also dealing with a sinister mining operation.Meg 2: The Trench is just about passable. Director Ben Wheatley has unsuccessfully taken over the reins from The Meg(2018) director, Jon Turtelaub. This film is not even half as entertaining as its predecessor. The first half of the movie is a proper snooze fest. There's barely any action set pieces or the titular prehistoric shark, with an unnecessary environmental conservation subplot thrown in. The second half of the film makes up for it though. It's supremely fun with mind-blowing action set pieces & lots of guffaw-inducing moments. The 3D is worth it finally, after that tedious first half. Jason Statham is spectacular as Jonas Taylor. Jing Wu is superb as Jiuming Zhang. Shuya Sophia Kai is fantastic as Meiying. Cliff Curtis is awesome as Mac. Page Kennedy is hysterical as DJ. Sergio Peris-Mencheta is good as Montes. Skyler Samuels is perfect as Jess. Melissanthi Mahut is awesome as Rigas. Sienna Guillory is amazing as Driscoll. The supporting cast is memorable. Meg 2: The Trench is not a must watch in theatres or at home, because of its subpar story.

And not bigger and better than ever. Several megalodons threaten a Chinese billionaire, Jason Statham and his crew from the last movie but unfortunately poor CGI makes the action sequences with sea creature seem cartoonish and not at all threatening. The story is functional based on the deep sea novel, The Trench, but the narrative set ups are basically there to create shark encounters where you wonder who's going to live or die. There is an even a nod (a rip-off?) of Jurassic Park with stubby land dinosaurs too. Either way the creatures look like CGI creatures and don't really move like animals do in real life.Statham is decent as always in these flicks and the supporting cast is likeable enough including Jing Wu as the billionaire and Shuya Sophia Cai as his niece. But a likeable cast isn't enough to carry this film when the ridiculous action sequences strain credibility, especially Statham flexing superhero strength in the final climatic moment.

The second half is slightly better, but still not up to what you'd expect these days.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The dialogue, acting, pacing and general story are all a generic bore. The title creature is barely in the film at all! The last 5 or 10 minutes are really the only portion worth watching, and even then, it's hardly worth the wait, (though if the rest of the film was better, it would add to its impact or entertainment value).Jason Statham simply has no juicy writing to chew on, so apart from some over the top action sequences, he's pretty much wasted.Billed as a comedy, there's no real trace of any humour, apart from the occasional groanworthy remark.The villains are strictly cardboard too.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Those familiar with Ben Wheatley's signature flair from films like ""Kill List"" and ""In the Earth"" might be taken aback by the sheer audacity and thrill he brings to ""Meg 2: The Trench."" Unlike his previous venture, ""Rebecca,"" Wheatley dives deep, and not just into the ocean's abyss.Jason Statham, reprising his role as Jonas, the deep-sea diver from the Zhang Institute, brings an energy that's hard to miss. While the first film introduced us to the prehistoric terror, the Megalodon, this sequel takes a twist. Jiuming, played by the ever-versatile Wu Jing, believes he can tame the beast. But as fate would have it, chaos ensues, and not just from the giant shark.Rather than a mere chase, Wheatley takes us on a journey to the megalodon's home, the trench. But the real surprise? An unexpected human adversary lurking in the shadows, exploiting the ocean's treasures. The sequences, especially one involving a treacherous walk on the ocean floor, are executed with a finesse that only Wheatley can deliver.Amidst the chaos, the bond between Jonas and Meiying (Sophia Cai) stands out, offering a touch of humanity in a world of monsters. And just when you think the film might be losing its bite, Wheatley throws in a twist, bringing the action right to a tourist hotspot. The climax is a spectacle, a testament to Wheatley's ability to blend horror, action, and dark humor seamlessly.However, what truly stands out is Wheatley's refusal to conform. While the narrative might seem familiar, his execution is anything but. It's not just about the shark or the hero saving the day; it's about the journey, the thrill, and the unexpected turns.In a world where imagination sets the limit, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" proves that there's no boundary to cinematic brilliance. Dive in, the waters are just right.Enjo the film for what it is.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

If you expect something like Jaws you will be very disappointed. In this film, the sharks play almost a marginal role. It seems like the director thought that Megalodon sharks aren't scary enough so let's throw in some dinosaurs, a giant octopus and terrorists on top of that. That will make the movie sufficiently exhilarating, or not. It's like they decided to mix Jaws with Jurassic Park and Mission Impossible. The result is an action movie where a lot of things happen simultaneously, but where there is lack of story and character development. What basically drives the plot are the special effects. But there is nothing new in that department. We have already seen computer animated sharks and monsters in various film before (for the last 20 years or so). The characters are stereotypes to say the least. Like in any action movie there are good guys and bad guys fighting each other and once in a while a Megalodon shark pops up on the screen. For me this was an unrealistic and boring film that deserves the lowest possible rating.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The script is not good, but many movies don't have to have a good script in order to be a fun movie. These movies have other things that hold your attention and provide a cheer factor to round out your enjoyment.The plot is over-complicated. It's been a few weeks since I've seen it, but I forgot about the plot while I was actively watching it. There's too many characters, and not enough good lines to make any of them stand out other than Jason Stratham who brings charisma that he doesn't need to try at. The main draw is the sharks. For the first half of the movie you wade patiently you wait for them to show up and have to sit through some okay plotting and ridiculous scenes, the most ""fun"" being Stratham surviving bare-skinned at 25,000 feet. It's at this point that only some incredible shark action can save the movie, but what we get is very boring action that seems only a third finished. The other two-thirds, gore and interesting action set pieces, were left on the production's PG-13 budget floor.Meg 2 is not devoid of certain fun. It's watchable, but I would never recommend it to be watched. There's plenty of other movies that are the same as this one, but do everything better. If it were bloody and slipped in R rated material throughout, then you could at least have fun with it, but the direction it chose to go ultimately made it a forgettable movie that no one could be proud of.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

Jonas is asked to board the Mana One's new high tech underwater research facility, but this time, he is surprised to see that the scientists are doing research directly on a female Meg named Haiqi who freely swims around its waters. Also on board are some familiar faces: Mac (Cliff Curtis), DJ (Page Kennedy) and the now teenage Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai) who have all been assisting Meiying's uncle Jiuming (Jing Wu) train Haiqi. Notable additions to the cast are analyst Jess (Skyler Samuels), and wealthy financier Hillary Driscoll (Sienna Guilroy).Jonas and his colleagues obviously haven't learnt their lesson about going down to the Mariana Trench and through the thermocline, as they decide to explore it yet again, this time in submersibles that are eerily similar to the ill-fated OceanGate one that imploded in June 2023. Whilst down there, they encounter 2 Megs, an enormous male alpha and a slightly smaller (but still quite large) male. Little do they know; it is mating season and their friendly pet Haiqi has escaped captivity so she can have some fun with the boys (wink wink). Tragedy occurs on the sea floor, leaving Jonas' group no choice but to abandon their vehicles in search of safety. Luckily there is an illegal mining operation in a station not far that the group can aim to seek shelter in. The group's efforts are foiled by bad guy Montes (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and his team of mercenaries who plan to kill Jonas and his remaining crew in order to keep their mining plans a secret. When the groups are finally able to reach the surface and find a heavily populated island, the Megs follow them (along with some other deep-sea hitchhikers), resulting in chaos.This film is silly, and it really leans into that. Comparisons could be made between it and terrible sci fi channel shark films like the Sharknado franchise and the more recent and similar The Black Demon (2023), but thankfully, what sets this apart is its amazing graphics and CGI. Instead of using awful stock footage and replaying video of sharks swimming from multiple angles, this film's big budget is put to good use. The water effects are extremely realistic, and the texture and overall look of its prehistoric creatures was akin to those of Jurassic Park. The giant octopus' CGI was less successful though, but I understand that it would have been a challenge to animate it with what it did.I loved that Jason Statham was able to show off in this film, and the fact that he did all of his own stunts was impressive, but not surprising given that he's a previous Olympic diver! There were some fun Easter eggs too, like the little dog Pippin and its owner from the first film having a cameo, but it was a bit strange that it wasn't pointed out at all (I mean, what are the chances of a woman and her dog encountering Megalodons twice in the span of 5 years? Talk about a coincidence!)There was a lot about this film that frustrated me, and although it was a fantasy film, the level of realism was almost laughable. Some examples of this were how characters were able to be over 20,000 meters underwater and not feel the effects of its temperature or pressure, and there are even scenes where no diving gear was used. Now I'm no diving expert but even I know that's impossible. I also hated how there were several 'at the last second' moments throughout the film, from oxygen almost running out, to doors closing just in time and bombs going off just as every one of the main cast is safe. There were too many of these moments to count, but after two or three i started to roll my eyes.Sadly, almost everything was spoilt in the trailer for me, so there were no surprises. I felt like the eventual villain was obvious from the start, and I could have done without several unnecessary characters including Montes. Guilroy and Samuels' acting skills belonged in a sci fi channel low budget shark movie, and not in this multi-million dollar blockbuster. Neither of them was successful in their character, and although Statham played his character well, the script was weak with some atrocious dialogue. There was one scene where a character notes that something is worth a billion dollars, and Statham responds with ""A billion with a B?"" C'mon man...Ultimately, Meg 2: The Trench was more of an action spy thriller than a horror film like its predecessor, and it sidelined the Megs to be secondary characters in order to focus on the action going on with the human characters. There was also a notable absence of blood and gore which felt like a missed opportunity to give the fans what they wanted, but I understand that it helped them achieve the MPAA rating that the film had by doing this. If there is a third film to come in the future, i say more blood, more gore and most importantly, more Megs!","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Bad CGI and the lack of attention to detail makes this a perfect way to end a franchise that could have become something great.

Great, self aware stuff. Could have been a bit crazier, gorier or more deliberate in humour or tone, but for what it was it was a good bit of schlocky fun. Meg 2: The Trench continues that trend about as well as it can, both in good and bad ways.The Trench promises plenty of Jason Statham, Shark, dinosaur and monster action. On this it absolutely delivers. The action here does feel trimmed down a little, like it was initially gorier but got edited for a fairer rating. Regardless, it's well done and thrilling and giddy stuff. Everyone in the movie seems to be completely on board with it too. They commit to the dialogue and treat it seriously, which helps the film feel more absurd and fun.The effects are fun, though not entirely convincing. The trench stuff looks great, but the scenes above or closer to the surface don't fare as well. But the style and energy of the film make up for that, and it never looks Sharknado or Scorpion King bad. It's pretty relentlessly paced too, so you're often caught up in the thrill before you see the strings.Where the film does suffer a bit is in the trench. At a certain point, while not boring, the film is absent of creature madness. And after a while you do miss them. Sure the opening and ending make up for it, it's just a bit unfortunate.In the end it certainly has the better moments, but The Meg is likely the better overall film. It's worth a watch for lovers of B Movie schlock and for those who only want what it sets out to deliver. It isn't great by any means, and certainly not for everyone. But it's very enjoyable nonetheless.","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

In The Trench, Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham) returns to the ocean to confront a significant threat - a group of sea monsters that have been unleashed from the deep!The acting in The Trench is decent, although not particularly noteworthy. Jason Statham does his usual competent job as the main character but the supporting cast doesn't leave a lasting impression. The characters themselves lack development or complexity. The story follows the formulaic structure of most monster movies without much deviation from the norm. While survival is obviously the theme, it's not explored in any way. The movie's tone is also inconsistent with moments of tension and horror mixed with cheesy one-liners and exaggerated action scenes.As for directing by Ben Wheatley, it's competent but not remarkable. The film's score is forgettable, without any standout tracks or memorable highlights. While the cinematography's adequate, some of the effects are hit or miss. Some of the sea creatures are pretty impressive, while others seem like they were taken out of a low-budget film.The editing feels a bit disjointed with certain scenes appearing rushed and others overly prolonged. The movie's pacing is uneven with moments of action followed by extended periods of explanation. And the dialogue is utterly forgettable with zero standout lines or memorable moments.The Trench is a monster movie that essentially matches the original. Although there are moments of suspense and excitement, the film falls short due to its storyline, shallow characters, and inconsistent tone. If you're a fan of the first film you might find this sequel enjoyable. But if you're seeking a substantial cinematic experience, it may leave you disappointed.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

While Wheatley delivers entertainment in spades, his offering, like its predecessor's adaptation, shares very little with the source material. It shares as much with 'The Trench' (1999) novel as the 2018 film 'MEG' did with the 1997 book 'Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror'. If you go in with questions like what happened to Jonas' ex-wife or how did Suyin die, you'll be disappointed from the outset.Cliff Curtis returns as Mac, along with Page Kennedy as DJ and little Sophia Cai as Meiying Zhang, now 14 years old. There are more extinct creatures, more megalodons, more action, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments from Statham, but particularly Wu Jing as Jiuming Zhang, Meiying's uncle, and from the rapport between Kennedy and Curtis.Sergio Peris-Mencheta shines, oozing bad guy vibes as emotional and dangerous Montes. With little screen time, Sienna Guillory is notable. The supporting cast, right down to the disposable mercenaries, do a great job.Harry Gregson-Williams returns with a fitting score along with the pop music covers, which complement the on-screen set pieces and action sequences, including giant sharks, octopuses, and extinct Snappers. Fans of the original novel will welcome the T-Rex flashback in the opening.Adaptation niggles aside, it suffers from some of the same issues that Jon Turteltaub's bumpy toned offering did: poor pacing, some clunky dialogue, and a handful of iffy CGI shots. That said, for the most part the visual effects are impressive, especially the Snapper creatures, the trench sequences and there's some sweeping cinematography from Haris Zambarloukos. Thankfully, Wheatley keeps the colour of the water as consistent as Statham's pulse pounding action scenes and cutting one-liners.Overall, don't expect the tone of 'Jaws' or Steve Alten's novels. Wheatley seamlessly takes the helm from Turteltaub, offering a more outlandish Meg versus Statham. It's bigger, fun and full of chum. Recommended.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

You have action, suspense, and some humor. Jason Statham is the diving expert who's haunted by his decision to leave his two friends to die in order to save a remnant of a submarine crew. He's now reluctantly but resolutely goes back into the ocean to save a stranded research crew which includes his ex-wife. Although he gets the job done, one crew member sacrifices himself by distracting what turns out to be the megaladon or The Meg for short. While the rescue was mostly complete, Jonas (aka Jason Statham) and the crew inadvertently allowed The Meg to come up and wreck more havoc to the southeast Asian region.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

For his part, he was believable and carried his character in typical Jason Statham fashion. The other characters were flat, one dimensional and may as well have been reading from the screen. The special effects were lackluster and not up to 2023 standards. Who puts a bright white border light around a screen? Like an edge light around your computer monitor right now. It would shine a light back towards you and only make looking at that screen that much more difficult/irritating. The dialogue was contrived. I was able to predict several of the quips written into the script. I won't buy the blueray/digital code because I doubt I'd ever enjoy watching it twice when the first time was boring. That and It's pure chinese propaganda and is a film that caters to china. I've no problem with a country making a film for the domestic market but by the same brush stroke, I'm not part of that domestic market so it isn't for me, even with an English speaking actor.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

They changed the settings a little bit, not just dwelling in the ocean but created some beasts that can be incorporated in different environment.

And I had definitely been looking forward to watching the 2023 sequel ""Meg 2: The Trench"".Writers Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber and Dean Georgaris put together a storyline and script that was a worthy enough follow-up to the 2018 movie. Sure, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" was by no means rocket science, nor was it a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in any way. Nay, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" is pure and simply a popcorn movie; you lean back in the seat, munch the popcorn and enjoy the action on the screen without adding realism to the movie experience.The movie has a good cast ensemble, with taking into consideration the premise of the type of movie that it is. With Jason Statham in the leading role, you sort of know what kind of movie you're getting into; and he does deliver exactly that, for better or worse. It was also nice to see the likes of Cliff Curtis and Jing Wu in the movie. Actually, the entire cast ensemble put on good performances. Sure, you're not in for an evening of Shakespearian theater here, but you get what you would expect from a movie such as ""Meg 2: The Trench"".Visually then ""Meg 2: The Trench"" was good. The megalodons look cool and rather real, as did the other creatures. And for a movie such as this, then having proper and good special effects is a make or break thing, and luckily they had the budget for proper special effects and CGI effects, and the people working on those really came through. I was rather impressed with the visuals in the movie.I have to admit that the other creatures the writers put into the storyline was something I could have been without; the megalodons were more than enough. And truth be told, it sort of made the movie unnecessarily more cheesy and campy than it had to be with those additional added creatures. However, I did enjoy the intro of the movie with the Cretaceous period, it was actually a nice enough thing.""Meg 2: The Trench"" was an enjoyable and entertaining popcorn movie for sure, though it wasn't really fully as entertaining as the 2018 movie ""The Meg"", but it was a close contender.My rating of director Ben Wheatley's 2023 movie ""Meg 2: The Trench"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

When the least interesting aspect of your creature feature are the creature elements, that's how you know you've royally messed up. Frankly, when there were dramatic scenes involving the underwater industrial espionage, it all felt rather thrilling at points. Astonishingly, this is when it was able to keep my attention and managed to be somewhat cool, particularly when they were traversing the deepest depths of the ocean floor (fairly intense stuff). I didn't get deeply engaged in that side of the story, but it was more tolerable than the slog-fest of monster-action sequences that were (unfortunately) about to ensue. I liked the gorgeous macaw that those bad guys had aboard their cargo ship in the beginning of the film (that was a pleasant surprise). As shallow as this comes off sounding (bad pun intended), it was real nice to once again see that at least some eye-candy for the male-gaze was thrown into the third act, even if it was only for a few brief shots (that upside was very much appreciated). And finally, it's always a treat seeing everyone's favourite gruff macho Cockney (Jason Statham) be the leading man in another action role. There's all the praise this movie is getting from me (I was really reaching to find these good points).NEGATIVES;I know that a lot of big, bombastic, action-oriented Hollywood flicks nowadays are badly put together with their choppy editing, but jeez Louise... were they taking the Mickey, or what?! I swear, it really felt like the cinematographer was hopped up on about 50 cans of red bull and the editors had ADHD, because you genuinely can't tell what's happening onscreen during any of the action scenes involving the sea creatures (call that hyperbole if you want, but it's an apt description). Did they think this was supposed to be on the same level of insanity as Statham's high-octane Crank movies, or what? Plus, they must've edited these scenes with a weed-whacking garden strimmer (then piled them all into a blender, just for good measure). There are so many quick cuts with fast edits in these kinds of moments, it all leaves you feeling nauseated, to a certain extent (the camera operator seriously needed to calm the heck down and chill out). I'm not ashamed to admit that whenever the effects-heavy action scenes just started to amp up to headache-inducing levels, I truly had to close my eyes for the duration of these manic sequences, especially the climax when a giant octopus rocks up at a holiday resort (as seen in the trailers, so it's not a spoiler). I didn't do this out of fearing seeing blood/gore (of which there was none), but because those hectic scenes were literally unwatchable (no joke). The action scenes in the original movie were adequately well-made compared to this flounder of a follow up.CONCLUSION;If you're super into cheesy monster B-movies that're nothing but fun popcorn entertainment, this'll (probably, maybe) leave you feeling nauseated and give you a headache as a result of watching its incomprehensible creature chaos. If you're someone who's a fan of quasi-serious spy-esque espionage thrillers (sort of accommodating a James Bond vibe), then I'll bet all the absurdly goofy monster nonsense is just going to put you off seeing this entirely. So ultimately, what you basically have is a commercialised big-budget summer movie that's made for no one because it doesn't know what audience it's trying to appease/appeal to. Like the old saying goes; ""if you try way too hard to please everyone, then you'll end up pleasing no one at all."" Even people that were perfectly satisfied with the first one will most likely be disappointed by this muddled sequel and won't enjoy it as much (this actually made me miss the first Meg).","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

The story starts and all of a sudden I am in the middle of it already. Why waste time even building up the plot. Jason S should be more selective with his projects or he is going to use up his hard earned goodwill and end up doing B movies like some of his contemporaries.

i understand why people may not like this film, but i genuinely loved it. My favourite guilty place is shark movies, and this one has to be on par as my favourite. It has a refreshing mixture between shark action, plot and development. The whole film isn't the usual ""stranded and surrounded by sharks"" and it adds texture through the change in sets and (predictable but well foreshadowed) twist(s). I especially enjoyed the mixed use of the shark being clearly seen versus not, depending on if we (as the viewer) are meant to be experiencing the plot as the characters themselves would have.An/ i've never read the actual book this is based off of so i cannot say whether this is accurate to the book but i enjoy the concept - as an exaggerated for consumption style of plot.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

This ""sequel-just-so-we-can-say-we-made-a-sequel"" wastes too much time focusing on half-baked nonsense about bad guys engaged in illegal mining 'way at the bottom of the trench where the Megs live. It's never explained who they are or what exactly their game is, but It doesn't matter anyway, because we don't care about them -- we wanna see GIANT PREHISTORIC SHARKS!""The Trench"" is peopled with cookie cutter characters whose interpersonal relationships are simply not convincing. The fatherly role Jonas (Jason Statham) plays to Meiying (Sophia Cai) is potentially appealing, but the cast, and the plot are so diluted with extraneous characters and stories that their relationship is never developed beyond standard father-daughter sitcom banter. Presumably, he had a deeper relationship with the lady scientist that he was friendly with in the first film, but nothing is said about that except that she's dead now, and he's apparently guardian of her daughter. Oh, and Meiying's annoying uncle (Jing Wu) is in the picture now.Most of the Megalodon action is saved for the latter part of the movie, when everything goes nuts and other prehistoric sea creatures emerge to help perpetuate the ridiculousness. The comedy kicks into high gear at this point, too, probably in an attempt to lighten things up in the midst of the death and destruction, but it just adds more ridiculousness.Now, there's good-ridiculous, and there's bad-ridiculous. ""The Meg"" was good-ridiculous; ""Meg 2"" is bad-ridiculous. Save some time, just watch the trailer.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

The VFX are mediocre and the creature designs are uninspired. The script is just terrible, and most of the characters have no character. The parts that are funny are only funny because they're embarrassingly bad. You laugh at it, not with it.I assume the dialogue is as bad as it is because it's calculated to occupy the common middle ground between Chinese and American child audiences. Utterly witless, when it could have been knowingly dumb and funny.How anyone can make a film about a giant shark without any gore AT ALL beggars belief. I guess the problem is that this film has to get past the brutal censorship of the Chinese Government, and at the same time appeal to as many people as humanly possible. In that exciting artistic environment, an almost unwatchable film has been churned out.Finally, as a fan of director Ben Wheatley's Kill List, Sightseers and A Field In England, I'm saddened to see the decline of a once-exciting talent. His last decent film was High Rise 8 years ago, and since then his output has gone down the drain, culminating in this crud. What a sell out. Surely he must have read the script before he agreed to this? I can only assume his early films were special because of his collaborators.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

But at the same time, there are a lot of things to be criticized.In the movie, I praised the performance of Statham and Peris-Mencheta, action scenes, direction, visual and sound effects, cinematography, and ending, which may set up for a sequel in the future.But what I critized in Meg 2: The Trench is the story because there is no innovation in it when we want to compare it to the first movie. Also, when the person watches this movie, they feel that it would have been better if the movie was R rated because the nature of the story its elements require that. From my point of view, the movie failed to take full advantage of its premise because of that.But these flaws won't prevent me from giving a fair score to Meg 2: The Trench because at the end, it was an enjoyable movie to watch. That is why regarding the score, I give Meg 2: The Trench 6 out of 10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The crew is back but missing the very beautiful Li Bingbing this time as she is apparently dead now. The humans are still exploring the trench where the megs are found even though a meg followed them back through it in the first movie. Anyway outside of them not being able to leave the place alone and megs seemingly unable to follow them through it anymore they have a captive meg as well. Outside of that well it's just more greedy humans after rare earth metals.Casting wise well that also got worse since Li Bingbing is no longer in the movie being dead and all and they just added a bunch of random new people in the film. Also the acting performances where kinda bland but overall it's alright.VFX and SFX is probably the best part with the trench life and environment looking pretty cool. Though the megs just didn't feel as great as they did last movie. Also the size of the megs in the trench to when they were eating people just felt like it changed.Overall a 6/10, Felt lacking in story and the cast was okay but the effects weren't terrible and watching people get eaten is always fun so can't go wrong there especially when it's like 20 people being chowed a time.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is the perfect example of all of that. The movie has at least 7 plot holes from what I counted. It really is a terrible movie.

The sequel sees Statham return to the fray, this time facing off against even bigger and more dangerous sharks.The film has some good points. The CGI sharks are impressive, and the action sequences are well-choreographed. Statham is also good in the lead role, and he brings a lot of charisma to the film.However, the film also has some flaws. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, and the characters are one-dimensional. The film also drags in places, and it's overlong at two hours.Overall, Meg 2: The Trench is a middling sequel that doesn't quite live up to the original. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. If you're a fan of the first film, you'll probably enjoy this one, but if you're not, you can probably skip it.Here are some of the specific things I liked and disliked about the film:Liked:The CGI sharks are impressive. They look realistic and believable, and they're a lot of fun to watch.The action sequences are well-choreographed. They're exciting and suspenseful, and they keep the viewer engaged.Jason Statham is good in the lead role. He brings a lot of charisma and humor to the film, and he makes the character likable and relatable.Disliked:The plot is predictable and unoriginal. It's basically the same plot as the first film, just with bigger sharks.The characters are one-dimensional. They're not very well-developed, and they're mostly just there to serve the plot.The film drags in places. It's overlong at two hours, and it could have been tightened up a bit.Overall, I would give Meg 2: The Trench a 3 out of 10. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. If you're a fan of the first film, you'll probably enjoy this one, but if you're not, you can probably skip it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story is about a bunch of scientists who outsmart Megs while facing threats from their enemies. The writing was really bland and offered the same cliched story that we have seen in many other movies similar to this. The writing was not interesting at all and did not grab interest right from the beginning. The characters were poorly written and their characterization was in a good vs. Bad form with a much more cliched and watered-down form. The screenplay was as predictable as it could get. Right from the start, we could figure out what the ending could be and the ending is worse than what the audience could expect. The conflict was familiar and the screenplay made it more predictable for the audience and has them bored throughout the movie. The direction was boring and did not make an impactful experience for the audience to watch. As the movie progressed, the direction was far left behind, leaving the plot as boring as it was. The performances were decent and were up to par, the actors acted on point as they should have. The technical aspects were great, especially the CGI. The CGI looked really good on screen and haven't looked like they were fake at all.

There were a few dragging and slow-paced scenes, but there was also drama, suspense and a few scares. The second half dived more into the sharks' rampage and the actors' quest to survive and save others.

You watch it for the jump scares, gore and of course, the giant sharks!What struck me about the structure of the plot is that the first and second halves seemed almost like two different movies. The first half was rather dark, slow moving and borderline boring. I was afraid it wouldn't hold my attention. But the second half was bright, action-packed, and brimming with cheap thrills and cheesy comedy. I really enjoyed it, and I jumped and handful of times. And seeing it in 3D made it even more jumpier.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I wasn't expecting anything out of this film. I had seen the previous one released in 2018 and was hoping this one to be even better.But I was proven wrong yet again. Hollywood lacks talented directors with ""vision"". Just one name: James Cameron for his work on two movies Aliens(1986) and The Abyss(1989). These two movies showcased what an tremendous imagination he had. And both the scripts were his own.Back to this one: the plot is about a research team led by Jonas Taylor(Jason Statham) who stumble upon a secret and illegal mining operation. The rest of the movie deals with tension between the two factions along with the ever present threat of the prehistoric sharks.Verdict: pure CGI fest. No real special or make-up effects. In Jaws the shark was animatronic - not here though...Perhaps if Spielberg and James Cameron had both worked on this project, who knows, it might have turned out good.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Only to discover another corporation is drilling and opened a drift to which more Megs rise up in the ocean surface and amongst other giant sea creatures.It is an entertaining sequel. It is fun. It does have its action sequences that will make this sequel worth watching. Especially making this sequel fresh by having other sea creatures like a giant octopus or dino like creatures that walk on land.The acting is a bit dull. Jason Statham delivers the action role. The rest of the cast is forgettable with there performances. The script also fall flat with its characters and story.The visual effects are also okay. The direction could be better handled with the underwater action sequence with Jonas and a group walking on the surface on the bottom of the ocean while they are being chased by the creatures. The action was confusing. Dark lighting and poorly put together. The climax is pretty entertaining as the fight is on an island with three megs and octopus and others as Jonas and his crew fight back.It tries to be a summer blockbuster. Does feel a little thin and empty compared to the first film. Still entertaining.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Writing horrible, acting mediocre at best, graphics average, but directing well let's just say it's non-present.The director Ben Wheatley has really lost grasp of what The Meg is about, it's a film about a giant shark who terrorise everything in its path. You know a film is bad when not even the stellar Jason Statham himself cannot save the film.The best way to describe this film is it has identity crisis. It begins with a Transporter type theme, then it switches to The Martian vibe before it goes full throttle on Alzheimer's disease and actually losses track of what type of film it was supposed to be.The audience loved the first one because it's a simple story about hunting a giant shark. This is a simple instinct that people can relate to. Sadly the same cannot be said about part 2 in this franchise building universe. All I pray for is if there is to be The Meg 3 then please bring back Jon Turteltaub.Verdict: watch it if you literally have nothing else to do and want some mind numbing entertainment. That plus it's always good to see Jason Statham in action. 3/10 for me.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Alas, the sequel again starring Jason Statham exemplifies everything wrong with filmmaking today. Convoluted plot, poor CGI, zero character development and an assault on the senses whipping a camera around at 100 mph calling it action. Plus an overlong running time. This sequel was such a disappointment. Statham does his best but even he cannot save this mess of a film. I mentioned in the first Meg no Statham fighting scenes. Guess what...within the first 4 minutes we have a Statham fighting scene. The Meg shouldn't be about that. The film lacks tension or cohesion and ultimately is very very poor.

This could have been a blockbuster if done right.The evil characters are not written well and are very shallow and cliche however one does get the satisfaction of seeing them meet their deserved endings. I can't criticize the acting because the lines are too badly written to give the actors any leeway to show off their talent.The movie is overflowing with scientific inaccuracies, implausable saves (which would have been plausable if the pacing wasn't so fast), and impossible movement of creatures from point A to B in minutes, which some people can forgive and others might not even notice so that definitely removes it from 10 category.

Unfortunately, this is a lame sequel. And that is not to say that the first movie was outstanding - that was a very average movie.The plot and the writing in this movie was extremely lazy and juvenile. For a movie entitled Meg, there was unfortunately not much of Megs to be seen for the majority of the movie. It was more of a deep sea crime show with a ridiculous plot. The dialogue from start to finish was so shallow and cliche, that one wonders if it was written by a bunch of high schoolers or some AI software.The characters regularly make the dumbest decisions, and the shootout scenes are so unbelievably contrived that you have to roll your eyes. The black character who provides the comedy for the movies, has been transformed from being very ineffective in the first movie, to some sort of special forces operator in this movie, and we are just supposed to believe that. In fact, he kills many highly trained mercenaries WHILE cracking jokes.Besides all the reasons NOT to watch this movie listed above, the one positive is its 'appearance"" of a big budget movie - with its large sets and decent CGI.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jason Statham is still attached to the oceanographic concern from the last film & resides in an oil rig cum research station where the son of the previous industrialist, played by action star Wu Jing, now use the Trench (which separates ancient megs & their ilk below it) as an area of research but during an expedition they come upon some miners illegally drilling in their purview who quickly set off explosives to hide their tracks causing the researchers to race to a seafloor lab before the creatures among them soon attack them en masse. We then learn the miners are employees of Jing's partner, Sienna Guillory, hoping to get as much precious ore from the area (estimated to be worth in the billions) w/the added mayhem of the Trench being pierced letting all manner of animals (including some Megs) to escape to the surface & wreak havoc on the area setting its sights on Fun Island which is packed to the gills w/splashing tourists. Not as fun as its predecessor which was a well made piece of B movie fluff, this entry gives us a lot more plot (Statham & his crew making a perilous walk towards the sea lab is enough for one film) w/director Ben Wheatley (Free Fire/Rebecca) letting the silliness overwhelm the extended animal siege during the last third.

Seriously though, this movie actually seems like a dream, in the sense that one absurd thing happens after the other. Don't get me wrong, unlike many people, I REALLY enjoyed the first film. I thought it was great popcorn fun. This film, however is all over the place. Since it is a Chinese co-production, perhaps it works better for Chinese sensibilities, I don't know. It also had too many Chinese dialogs with very fast subtitles (not everyone reads fast, you know?) Technically it also feels cheaper than the previous film, specially with the CGI. That underwater walk, which by the way was a total ripoff from Underwater (2020), was also poorly made. You could see the actors were not really underwater. One other major problem was the lack of humor, which the first film had in the right measure. They tried, I know they did, but none of it was funny, AT ALL. It was just ridiculous. It should be noted that this was no fault of any of the actors, who in my opinion were all good. Some of the characters were too clich√©d, specially some of the villains, but that was the writers and the director's fault. So if by any chance any of the producers of this film is reading this, please, if you decide to make Meg 3, this is what you should do: Hire the director and the writers of the first film and explain that this film was just Meiying's dream, which would be an excellent justification to bring back the beautiful Bingbing Li back.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The camera angles are excellent.And virtually no swearing in the script.Just superb.Its an absolute wild ride. Top marks.Think Poseidon Adventure meets Die Hard meets The Abyss meets Jurassic Park.This is easily one of the best action adventure films I have seen in a long time. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but I'm a 50 year old male and I loved it ! I recommended to all my mates with teenagers.Statham did an awesome job too just quietly with his many years of experience in front of the camera. I was never a big fan, but wow; terrific stuff.

The film is set in China, but it is directed by an American and features a mostly American cast. This results in a film that feels neither Chinese nor American. It is simply a bland and uninspired cultural mashup.Another problem with the film is its plot. The plot is simple and predictable, and it is full of holes. The film's characters are also one-dimensional and underdeveloped.The film's action sequences are also disappointing. They are poorly choreographed and unexciting.

But the first book was awesome the second book was even better and the third book is my favorite although it's not quite as good. Book four is all right book five and six are terrible but I was so excited when I heard they were finally making a movie out of it and I hope that they would take it serious. Jonas Taylor is such a complex character with a lot of PTSD and could have been played by an actor that is an antihero that shows all of his trauma but instead they decided to make a ridiculous Blockbuster half comedy. The first one was absolutely nothing like the book and although I wasn't expecting it to be the same because it never is with the novels, it was almost nothing like it besides a couple of names. This movie had at least a little bit more from the book. Although it's just as ridiculous. I don't understand how they spend so much money and the CGI can be so bad. I mean it's just absolutely awful. Nothing moves naturally. Jason Statham is definitely the best part of these movies and that's not saying much. He is one of the most horribly miscast characters I've ever seen in any movie. It's not that I don't like him but as Jonas Taylor he is nothing like the character in The book. The best thing they could have done with this novel series is turn it into a two or three season miniseries. Six to eight episodes per season. It really could have allowed them to tell the whole story and dive into the characters. Hopefully someday the story will be told right cuz the movies sure as heck don't do it. I mean it was better than the first one and it was worth watching I guess but I suggest not reading the book before seeing either one of these because it will ruin it. But I do suggest reading the books after and definitely listen to the audiobooks because the voices that they do for all the multiple characters are amazing. And it's much better than any of these movies will ever do.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

As does parts of the film being dual language which is odd though apparently due to the financing of the film being largely Chinese.But worse, most of the effect sequences are choppily edited, to the point where its difficult to work out what is supposed to be happening or what you are seeing. All the underwater scenes aren't really convincing at all. The film is better when it stays above ground, just. Awkward for a film about underwater creatures though.None of the cast have any chemistry at all, sometimes it feels like they are using a rehearsal of a scene rather than a scene when the actors know they are being filmed or in shot - often the cast are looking off in other directions or looking plain disinterested. Again, this is especially in the underwater effects scenes.Its a longish film too and I struggled to watch the whole thing. I don't remember the first Meg film being particularly great but as a silly entertainment movie it was at least watchable and seemed professionally made.Biggest mystery to me of this film was that this was directed by this director who usually makes good films.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

This time, it is three Megalodons, but the sharks are actually not the biggest problem in the movie, they come more at the last 40 minutes or so, but our main issue is to stop something else... Not a monster, by the way, but I won't spoil. So I think the Shark scenes where exciting to watch, a lot of action, cool boat scenes, and I enjoyed the submarine scenes too, when they were under water, something that we can also see in the trailers. Shark fun was only fun the last 40 minutes, actually, because the first one hour was kind of boring, some fun sometimes, but it hadn't so much potential as I thought it might be. They could work on the dialogues, they were very weak. The acting was weak too, so the sharks made its job to give this movie a higher rating. The character perspective was showed badly, too. I liked Jonas as the main character, he was mentally strong and he was focused to escape the sharks. But from the other side of the characters, they looked like they didn't care about that three giant sharks are hunting them, what made me annoyed because they should worry about three big Megalodons. But I think the moral of protecting the sea from dangers is a very good moral, the whole ocean protection team that they showed in the movie was needed, and we can learn that hurting the ocean is bad. The second moral about that sharks are dangerous is also true, you have to be careful when you are under water, but of course, this sharks was way more extreme than normal sharks. The entertainment was good, good shark scenes, cool underwater scenes, but sometimes it was boring and lost their potential. Could work on the acting and dialogues, but it was not the biggest thing you actually cared about in the movie. If you like shark movies then I think this is a ok movie to watch.

They are paid to talk bad about a movie and most may not have even watched the movie. The movie was great, watch for yourself and judge for yourself.

The movie is drawn out and the editing for the whole first half makes it hard to see what is happening. The dialogue is really quite bad and the plot id as run of the mill as it gets. The movie picks up after an hour and has some truly fun over the top scenes which ultimately make it worth seeing. They thought they by adding more megs it would somehow make it bigger and better but alas that was not the case. It's not a ""bad"" movie per se, it just feels like they rushed production and went ahead before they had a worthy script.

It also builds on the plot line of the first one and as such should have been a solid one. Unfortunately, that was not delivered. It plays out like two separate movies. We have the first part which is good, there is tension, nice environments, spooky, holds your attention, and the science is somewhat conceivably possible. I figured that was going to be the movie. If you remember DEEP BLUE SEA that one did it good. It kept the theme throughout and stayed true to itself.Here about halfway in they give up and toss in everything. Characters become horrible, sampling jaws, sampling jurassic park and so forth. The movie devolves into badly filmed and set up mindless action scenes that look so fake you know what will happen. Oh statham is on a jet ski. I know what will happen now, we only saw that horrible unrealistically insulting CGI stunt 5 times already; yes here it is, for the 6th time. Cool. Not.It becomes so bad it is boring because it so stupid. So absolutely irrationally stupid.

The first approximately 60% of the running time takes place underwater and is basically a rehash of the first movie. It's beyond boring. The last approximately 40% of the running time take place above water and shamelessly steals the ideas of previous success films such as ""Piranha 3D"", ""Jaws"", and even ""Sharknado"". It's not boring, but hopelessly derivative. Oh, and for some reason, director Ben Wheatley also thinks it's necessary to rip-off ""Jurassic World"" and puts his shark-movie full of dinosaurs.Alright, I'll confess: I am extra harsh and negative in this review. But, in my defense, my family and I were also deeply disappointed and frustrated when we walked out at the cinema. All we wanted was to be entertained! Nobody expects a convoluted drama or a suspenseful thriller when going to ""The Meg 2"", but the intelligence level of this flick is downright insulting. The supposedly grand and grotesque action sequences are lame, Statham's devotion for his stepdaughter (?) is totally implausible, the humorous interactions between Cliff Curtis & Page Kennedy feel fake and forced, and - most of all - there nearly isn't enough exaggeratedly oversized shark action.Ben Wheatley is the worst and most illogical choice to direct this. Although I personally think his acclaimed movies (""Sightseers"", ""Free Fire"", ...) are terribly overrated, they are completely different in terms of style and content. Perhaps Wheatley aspired quick and easy Hollywood fame by directing a blockbuster that is nearly impossible to mess up. Well, congratulations, you messed up after all.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Eventually, it was just an average movie and definitely, not what I had imagined. The plot of the sequel was very interesting and mysterious, even though it was similar to the first movie. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, but it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters were kinda interesting, well-developed and likeable. The filming locations of the movie were mainly, underwater and on the surface of the sea. Also, the casting was just nice and their acting was descent. Gladly, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic shark attacks. Sadly, the killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most kills were done off-screen. Meg's appearance was terrifying and the CGI effects were very well edited. The opening scene was probably the best part of the movie, it was definitely unpredictable and very promising. The ending scene was definitely predictable, adventurous and it was just fine. Overall, ""Meg 2: The Trench"" was just an average sequel and kinda intense, but not very funny. Last but not least, I would probably recommend it to my friends.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

More gruesome for sure, and somehow rated PG compared to 14A. Just because it's more doesn't mean it's better. I found the visuals went downhill compared to the first film. The scenarios as cool as they were, were too unrealistic for my enjoyment. It tried to be funny, and it wasn't most of the time (even tried to force it and it didn't sit right).I did enjoy the story. I thought it had a cool premise. Character development was good between the two films for returning characters, and I enjoyed the new one introduced. The megs didn't feel like the focal point, but they still added to the story along with the new antagonists that sort of lacked true cruel intentions. Pacing was good. My heart definitely had its moments of racing, and my body was feeling the groove of some action scenes.Lastly, despite my hopes that they'll settle on only two ""Meg"" movies. I fear a third instalment may come. Nothing is truly hinted at a third, but one line in particular put the thought in my head.Overall, entertaining movie to be sure, but if you're gunning for better realism maybe lower your expectations. There were a lot of kids in my screening. Don't think any of them really reacted poorly to punctures, things exploding, or death. Two hours worked in its favour. The timeline flowed and didn't really get me bored. My recommendation is wait for a cheap night, or until it release on home video.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and as always.... Enjoy the show!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Is this a horror story of huge, evil sea (and then land) bugs? Perhaps the plot wanted to trap us with a Chinese thriller of perfidious betrayals? Is it possible that it is an explicit denunciation showing how stupid adults are, and that only children have brains? Do we dare to venture that what all this is really about is a surreal comedy with ridiculous jokes and grotesque gags?

That was never the goal of the film. The goal was to create a fun, enjoyable summer film in which rules and realism are practically absent. And in my opinion the objective was successfully achieved.There are flaws: the first part tends to take itself a little too seriously, and the CGI is horrible for 3 quarters of the film (but since I expected it it didn't bother me that much). But in a film of this type these are minor errors, what matters is that it is a damn entertaining film, full of action and breathtaking moments, with an absolutely badass Jason Statham in everything he does and a Fast & Furious-style Family which I ended up loving.And honestly I feel highly satisfied. Sometimes you really need films like these.

The deep ocean was explored, unveiling some undiscovered places, and a monstrous shark emerged-everyone is familiar with the rest of the story.In the initial part, everyone was taken by surprise, including the shark itself, as it struggled to determine its location. Unfortunately, this time around, the movie went way overboard, reaching a level of complete ridiculousness that was difficult to endure. Initially, the sharks seemed rather organized and strategically planned, but then the makers of the movie inexplicably introduced dogs, crocodiles, and other unsightly creatures, making the film even more absurd to watch.To the esteemed creators of this movie, it's important to always provide a plausible backstory for a monster, which seems to be missing here. Darwin's theories might not be the most fitting source of inspiration; it's advisable not to follow them blindly.Nevertheless, the movie isn't worth watching, even if no other options are available. It's best to give this one a big-time pass and focus on other alternatives.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","An Average But Fun Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9248521/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2023","One of the more popular monster films in previous years has its sequel Meg 2: The Trench and yesterday I had the chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is years after the events of the first film, the group of scientists look to explore more of the ocean and this leads to the ire of many different enemies.Main Character
Jason Statham is back to reprise his role as Jonas Taylor and he gives a very similar performance to the one he gave in the first film. He is pretty stoic with a deadpan humour but there hasn't seemed to have been too much character progression between the two films. Statham works in this role but it isn't the most interesting character ever.Supporting Characters
Jing Wu plays Jiuming and he may be my favourite character in this film. He is just filled with so much enthusiasm and excitement during the film, I liked his chemistry with the other characters and he was a real star here for me.Shuya Sophia Cal reprises her role as Meiying. I didn't talk about her in my last review but she was an okay child actor, but she is slightly older here and I thought she was much better. She has good chemistry with the other actors and I think this could be the start of a longer successful career for her.Cliff Curtis reprises his role from the first film and gets way more to do here and you can tell he is having so much fun in this film. He is very entertaining and is clearly a great part of this film and I am glad there was more for him to do here.Page Kennedy reprises his role as DJ and I found him really annoying in the first film but he was really funny in this film. He has learnt from the experiences of the first film and it leads to some really funny sequences. Just in general, this group of characters together is way more entertaining then the people that was in the first film.Story
I criticised the story of the first film but at least that story was pretty simple and focused on The Meg. This film is all over the place and tries to focus on way too much, it does the worst thing a film this can do, it takes itself seriously. The film is at its best when it is just silly but whoever decided on these plot points missed a lot of that.Script
The script was funnier then the first film. The last half of the film had me laughing pretty consistently and everything was so over the top that it just worked. The drama is hammered onto the first half of the film especially and it just does not work, even though I enjoyed the performances, it was hard to truly care about what was going on.Style
The style of the film is more mixed this time, the film looks great. The film spends more time exploring the ocean so is forced to use more CGI and I think the majority of it looks really great. The action scenes are fun and the last 20/30 mins of the film were the absurd action that I wanted. But the pacing was just off, the first half of the film was a bit boring and dull and then the 2nd half was ridiculously fast paced and it made the film feel a bit unbalanced.Overall
Overall, Meg 2: The Trench is an average film. It is similar to its predecessor that if you want to watch a film that sees a lot of crazy action and funny one liners then this is the film for you but as a film it really isn't that great.Rating - 5/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I hope that they speed up the next movie so wee don' t have to wait 2 hours to se the end of that movie. But , still a fun movie and worth to watch again if you don't have anny thing otherwise to do that day. IF you can take that presure on that depth were they going next time.

As someone who found the first installment watchable, this sequel felt like a considerable step backward. To be honest, I even contemplated not watching it until the end.One of the aspects that stood out to me was the noticeable shift in tone and pacing. The first movie managed to strike a balance between suspense and action, creating an enjoyable aquatic thriller. In contrast, The Meg 2 seemed to lean heavily towards over-the-top action sequences, often at the expense of character development and plot depth. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to outdo the original, resulting in a somewhat chaotic narrative.Another point worth mentioning is the cultural aspect. It's evident that this film was made with a different target audience in mind, China, and this may explain the disconnect for Western viewers. While the first movie had a broader appeal, this sequel seemed to cater more to a specific taste, which might not align with what Western audiences typically look for in entertainment.In conclusion, The Meg 2 failed to capture the essence that made its predecessor enjoyable. It's a reminder that cultural differences in entertainment preferences can have a significant impact on how a film is received. While it had some visually appealing moments, the sequel's departure from the balanced formula of the first film left much to be desired. If you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, you might still find moments to enjoy, but for most viewers, it falls short of expectations.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's just embarrassing and sad.A total waste of time.There's never any blood shown, not even a drop, which means those big sharks pretty much gobble people - they got teeth, but apparently those are designed to chew threw metal and wood structures, and boats that are in the way. That, they like to eat somehow.. Entire wood piers, that's like biscuits for them.There's a guy who managed to tame a shark, and that shark escapes... for what ? Is it going to be useful (i was hoping, because that's the only original idea in the film).

Then the shark jumped Statham. There was a point when Statham is saying shoot me; I honestly believe Jason wanted to be killed to get out of this pile of Jurassic Sharktopuss.This movie could teach them anything or two about sucking. I mean, you take one of the scariest natural predators, show us the peak of it's existence, and somehow make it suck mire than Jaws 3 and 4. It's like the movie is a star collapsing in upon itself and taking the one bright Statham, with it.Jaws had us scared of the water still in the late 90s. Shark week gets everyone excited. Ik trying to say, sharks are amazing and we known what they can do. But apparently nobody decided to teach the people who wrote this movie. I read the book the first movie was based on, way back in the early 2000 around the time it was written. I can't really remember much about it, and yet it was so much better than anything this movie attempts.You have to feel bad for Jason. The man has had a pretty amazing career of solid folks to inspire fans to rewatch. I didn't realize he was dying, completely broke, and needed the money for a life saving operation. I hope he pulls thru.There's a point when the call he has no problem making 4 times in the first movie, suddenly he won't do it for this guy who got shoe horned into the story because nobody with sense wanted to come back. We never hear about the brother in the last film. Suddenly he is this important expositional tool. Nobody learned anything from the last movie, and I'm fact, suffered serious brain trauma because they are considerably more dumb.Monster mash movies doit have a history of solid story. Sure most the Jaws movies are forgotten. They are still more believable than this. The first movie had us able to suspend our disbelief to a way this prehistoric creature survived. Ok, I could buy it no problem.They decided to make something that was impossible to believe at any point. Deep Blue Seas 2 and 3 sucked too, but this? This is like that, but big budget enough to go to theaters.The whole point of a Meg wouod be shark earring stuff. Put us in the water with it and let's go. It's clearly from the HBO parent company because most the beginning of the movie when the shark action is happening, we can see as well as that amazing battle in Game if Thrones season 8. You know the battle. It was so amazing you guys, like you've never seen anything like it. Nobody has because why show in a movie.The stupid rat dog and idiot lady make a surprise cameo. Like that was what anyone wanted. There is a moment where someone tells another grown adult that he needs to just imagine he is doing cosplay. If you are that much of a loser, there is no way you would be part of a team going down below the trench again. Apparently we got these COD Advanced Warfare exo frame suits that make it easy to go chill in the most mythical, secluded areas in history.Yeah, it's cool we get the giant squid, because the 80s gave us that too. Hard to get excited about it tho, when everything is shake your head stupid. So the sharks you door get to see. There's this new creature from the beginning that is some dino hybrid that can go on land and water. Doesn't look anything like anything. The things remind me of the og Yoshi in the crapfest Mario movie from my childhood. I still believed that was more realistic than these small plot devices. We have 3 megs we barely get to see, but let's be scared of these water raptors.All the conflict in the movie is human on human. Yes we know, humans suck. Given every opportunity to be horrible, they will be. So let's focus on that, even in the face of absolute impossible to believe situations. People die but you can't see how it even know who it is. It's ok, they weren't likeable anyway the crew is full of people you'd be fine seeing eaten. The only problem is we don't get to see it happen. Jason was apparently super angry he spent a movie fighting something he couldn't actually fight. Now he has to remind people he was in talks to be Bond before, but that ship is forgotten, and lost in the triangle. I like marital arts and love those movies. I don't want a shark movie to see Statham try to be 00 Green-peace.My head hurts from eyes rolling.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now, that impressive feat is worth the additional and overly generous star.I honestly don't want to spend too much time writing this review. Lord knows I just wasted 2 of my hours on this disaster.Nothing works in this movie. Not the humor, dialogue, believability or surprises. It's predictable and not even a so-bad-it's-good vibe. It's not even a good homage to the MUCH BETTER 80/90s Sharksploitation films. And worse, it's just dull.Honestly, I have almost completely forgotten the original I saw only once 5 years ago in 4 days. I think I was overly generous with my 3/10-star rating I gave the first one and I was about to give this the same, but I just couldn't think of a redeeming quality. It DOES earn that extra star because I didn't hate life through it. It was just a chore to watch and I couldn't wait for the nightmare to be over.To sum up the synopsis: Jason Statham, his daughter from The Lost World, her shark-whisperer uncle, LL Cool J reprising his Deep Blue Sea character and other throwaway comic reliefs must battle Die Hard henchmen who follow a cartoon villain so bad even Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom would've rejected her. There's a half-thought-out environmental message, but then again, everything's half-though-out here.Oh, and sharks do what they do best: attack a climatic tacked-on water resort. Admittedly, there was ONE cool scene here: Shark-Cam - the view from within the shark as it gobbled down cardboard characters.This just ended up making me miss those deep-sea movies of the late 80s, such as Leviathan, DeepStar Six and The Abyss. Whatever flaws they had, they were still 10x better than this unfunny joke.I wouldn't recommend either Meg. UNLESS, you like those Sharknado/ Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus movies. Then this might seem like a masterpiece to you.***Final Thoughts: One of the worst parts of this movie was the screen ratio. Not sure if this was the streaming service's fault or whoever's, but the only way to see everything on screen, all objects, but mostly the humans, were stretched thin, much like the old Godzilla movies. I tried all settings to fix this so people's heads went back to normal, but with each change it lost a bit of the visuals. And even with the ""best"" setting, it still cut off some of the movie. That didn't help this already-disaster.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

They can be an enjoyable distraction, but they are typically just mindless shlock. Throw in Jason Statham spouting one-liners and you could have a fun time. But this movie even fails to jump over that low bar.Simply put, there is too much going on in this movie. They have 3 giant sharks, a kraken, some dinosaurs they refer to as ""land sharks"" and some Captain Planet villains to tie everything together.The movie could have been two separate films, there is one half that is ""The Trench"" and the other half is ""Meg 2"". Once they get to ""Fun Island"" that is when ""Meg 2"" begins with some crazy giant shark action. Before that we have a lot of deep sea exploring and Statham taking care of a kid.The story is all over the place. The heroes feel too invincible to have it feel perilous. Of course, the science doesn't work, but even by their own rules there's no consistency.

Many movies he saved with is presence but this one he can't. The script is the worst ever, the CGI is from 20 years ago and the acting is cardboard like. With Meg1 you could feel the fear of the people for the monster, this time it's all light heartedness. The Meg is a pet you can train. The crushing depth of the deep ocean? Neeeeh, literally a walk in the park. The disaster with the Titan showed how extremely dangerous the pressure is, the tiniest mistake can cause an implosion, vapourizing the occupants in seconds. But here? No problem, suit up and step outside. Even a depth of 300m would cause a diver to be crushed and his whole body pushed inside his helmet. Can you imagine the danger? I wished I would have felt the danger in this movie, but it's a movie for kids at the most (and they probably hate it as well).

The storyline follows a research facility who has a megalodon and new underwater vessels that's allow them to go deeper than humans have ever been in the ocean. The old team gets back together to test the vessel and encounter some underhanded black market dealings in the process. Meanwhile the megalodon escapes making the underwater adventure more interesting.This movie is directed by Ben Wheatley (A Field in England) and stars Jason Stratham (Italian Job), Jing Wu (SPL), Sophia Cai (The Meg), Cliff Curtis (Training Day), Sergio Peris-Mencheta (Snowfall) and Page Kennedy (SWAT).This is bad in every way you expect. The storyline and dialogue is painful. The CGI is top notch, but this movie didn't know if it wanted to be Jurassic Park, Jaws, Deep Rising or MacGyver. The fight scenes are well choreographed but over the top and the action scenes were horrendous. For having such great CGI the kill scenes are even disappointing. It's too bad because Jason Stratham and Jing Wu in a film should be way better.Overall, this is a commercial horror film that relies on an overuse of CGI and ridiculous plot points/scenarios for entertainment value. I would score this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it.","2 out of 23 found this helpful.

Everything felt really rushed, the underlying story was barely there and the ""bad guys"" were just terrible caricatures. Overall the acting was bad, it was clear the actors were all pretty much phoning it in (even Statham, whom I love). Some, however, stood out as particularly terrible - the wealthy benefactor (Driscoll) has to be the girlfriend of one of the producers because wow, she cannot act to save her life, same with Jess - just awful. Most of them sounded like they were just reading the script without any effort at all to act. Part of the fun of the first Meg are the comedic moments, unfortunately whoever wrote the script was trying to recreate that and just went completely overboard with jokes so dumb and predictable they pretty much all fall flat.I was really hoping to like Meg 2 as much as I enjoyed Meg but there just was very little to like about it.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

That's always a sign of a bad movie.The casting is good, Jason Statham in the movie, that usually guarantees good entertainment, but here even he doesn't help, because the script is bad.The director did his best, but even he can't do better with a script like this. Movie companies make these lukewarm PG-13 movies thinking it will attract audiences, but in most cases it turns viewers away.Not every movie can be lukewarm and watered down, this one was supposed to be a movie for adults and ended up being for no one.I personally gave up going to the cinema when I saw that it was just another PG-13 movie. Luckily, I watched it for free, so I just wasted some time, but that's a shame too, because time is precious.The CGI is not convincing, it would be better if they made an animated version of the film and that's it.There are some funny moments in the movie, but too few. A movie that is seen once and forgotten, it should have been more brutal.Some movies at least stretch the boundaries of the rating, so some PG-13 movies actually slip through with some scenes that belong more in R-rated movies. They didn't even try it here, the film looks like a cartoon.Do yourself a favour, skip this PG-13 cartoon.","2 out of 28 found this helpful.

The film is hijacked by other creatures, for no apparent reason whatsoever.The main characters cannot be killed no matter what they do.

And there is probably the crucial point, a typical creation of this origin. Completely imitated, badly copied, penetrating every market, nothing of its own, high-quality at first glance, quickly exposed as cheap and inferior. ""The products are slowly getting better"" - no, they are not! In terms of film, it will stay that way, China is not Hong Kong and vice versa. But watch out, zeitgeist too, the yellow peril now has the confidence to dare not to dub the parts in local language but to subtitle them. So the days of walking bent over and not looking each other in the eye seem to be long gone, unfortunately.Technically, what is shown, see previously explained, is a kind of high-budget Asylum production. And here's a kind of fun fact: Meg 2, as you can read, has a budget of 185 million dollars. No, I kid you not, but the producers were apparently given it at / by one or more places.Other findings:
Annoying-child factor present, but even poop gets messed up, that plays less and less of a role as it progresses.Jason Statham is not a man of honour.The shark factor for shark fans is no longer tangible due to the grotesque alienation of all necessary criteria.Hardly useful for trash fans either, takes itself seriously, wannabe blockbuster that is.","1 out of 15 found this helpful.

If you watched the first movie, which was released almost four years ago, you know exactly what to except from this one; that of course if you remember something from the insulting script and lazy ass Screenwriters.This time and as a direct continue to first movie's plot, the one the Jonas (Jason) loved died, without mention it too much and now he is responsible for her teenage daughter and her uncle - both Chinese and both will help to sell tickets at the east side of the globe.And then the movie begins and it has a shark. And then goes two third of it for a road trip in the bottom of the ocean. They walk, they talk and they fight a boring and generic antagonist characters which are made to get the shark even meaner.After making you go to sleep out of boredom the movie tries to wake his audience with dumb shark action scenes and why not through some other pre-historic and unrelated historic monster just because they can? They clearly saved money for visual effect and screen writing, so why not get wild?Bottom line is that this one is even stupider then the first and shows somewhere the depth of Statham's professional crisis.

While the first film had its share of entertaining shark action, this installment takes it to a whole new level. The movie is a relentless barrage of over-the-top shark encounters and improbable scenarios, leaving little room for plot or character development.The characters, including Jason Statham's Jonas Taylor, seem to have lost any sense of depth they might have had in the first movie. They're now just there to provide quippy one-liners and serve as shark bait. The dialogue is filled with clich√©s and cringe-worthy moments that make you wonder if the scriptwriters even tried.The plot, or lack thereof, is a thinly veiled excuse to showcase bigger, badder sharks and more jaw-dropping stunts. It's as if the filmmakers threw logic out to sea and embraced the absurdity of it all. You'll find yourself questioning the laws of physics and biology more than once.Despite its mindlessness, ""Meg 2"" manages to deliver some spectacular visual effects and heart-pounding action sequences. If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment and can suspend all disbelief, you might find some enjoyment in this oceanic adventure. However, if you're looking for a movie with substance or a coherent story, you'll be sorely disappointed. In the end, ""Meg 2"" is a guilty pleasure for those who can appreciate its sheer silliness.","1 out of 25 found this helpful.

There's such a thing as dumb fun, but Meg 2 is just plain dumb. The first half of the movie is unrealistic, yet watchable and even exciting at times.As for the latter half of the film... well, they just stopped trying. As the film turned into the Sci-Fi Channel cheese-fest I expected the first film to be, I lost interest. I hung in there to the ending that never felt like it would come.I suppose the writers and director thought all the comedy would make up for the sheer ridiculousness of it all, but it would have had to be a lot funnier than it actually was. Silly doesn't mean funny. The only bright spot of all the madness is Jing Wu. He seemed like he was genuinely having so much fun. His fun, likable character somewhat saved the moments he was on screen. As for everyone else, let's just say I don't think this movie was good for anyone's acting career.Directer Ben Wheatley should be embarrassed. The sheer laziness and sloppiness on display is agitating. If it were a Sharknado sequel, then it would have delivered on expectations, but people expected more out of this sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

On the note of the returning cast, though, I was a bit saddened to see Suyin disposed of so carelessly...It was almost like they were trying to make one movie out of two movies worth of plot. Like, I feel like they could have easily made a full movie out of the 'rogue mining operation' plot from the start of the movie, then left us with a cliffhanger leading into the second half. OR maybe make a slightly longer movie with everything from this movie but a bit less squashed in?If they'd given the movie a little more runtime and room to breathe, it might have even lived up to the 'legacy' of the first, and been just as fun to watch.

One of the better features here is the enhanced sense of connection here with the original. Furthering the idea of exploring the trench using more advanced technology to pierce beneath the protective layer preventing them from escaping, the enhanced technology to do this and remain connected to the institute that holds the other shark in captivity has a lot to like here. Moreso, the family drama that was a major part of the original with how he was raising his daughter that's another carryover from the film has some great storyline choices to be had here. As well, there's quite a lot of spectacle-filled action here to really keep the pace high. As this utilizes the high-end technology present to get there, the sequences involving the training sessions in the tank, the initial dive into the trench where they get trapped by the other crew, and the subsequent race to get to a piece of secured mining facility while being attacked by the fish down there including the sharks are all generally impressive sequences. Filled with some fantastic effects-work on not just the sharks but also the locations for each setting that includes some fantastic stunts and escapes, these scenes give this some solid action scenes. This leads nicely into the wild finale where the full-bore attempt at unleashing the sharks and the other creature along with them brings sheer full-throttle action. Consisting of tons of battles both on land and sea battling the creatures throughout the resort, this brings about the kind of high-energy spectacle-driven sequences that are quite thrilling producing the scenes of the group taking out everything they can while trying to avoid the forces trying to stop them. It's break-neck enough to be enjoyable and keeps including a logical series of obstacles being presented that are all fun enough to give this one a lot to like about it. There are a few minor drawbacks to be had with this one. One of the biggest issues is the need for a completely underwhelming and unnecessary subplot about the terrorist group being involved in stealing the equipment used to explore the area. The use of such a team is wholly unrealistic and makes no sense with a laughably illogical and unrealistic, their existence turns the middle of the film into a thrilling if unnecessary shoot-em-up Action movie and highlights the other issue here in quite a drastic decrease in shark action since this whole concept has to be fleshed out. These issues manage to bring this one down somewhat.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

It starts with a T-Rex getting eaten and the most unlikely needle drop of Queen's 'Under Pressure', as Jonas breaks out of a shipping container on a cargo ship in the middle of the sea. Something dodgy is going on of course and it's not long before he's kicking bad guys. Truth be told, story isn't especially important here, to the point you don't need to have seen the first film to follow what's happening here. The people Jonas is working with are exploring the oceans, specifically an area ominously named The Trench, where giant dinosaur era fish called megladons rule. Jiuming Zhang (Jing Wu) is the boss of operations and thinks he can train megladons... Jonas disagrees. They have a megladon captive, one raised from a baby, but it's a baby no more and doesn't want to be locked up. That's the least of their concerns though as they dive into The Trench and find that they're not the only ones playing in the water. Where it's thin on plot, it makes up for in action, dramatic OTT dialogue and The Stath's cold hard stare. Things obviously go pear shaped and when things go wrong underwater, bad things happen. The Meg relied just on the spectacle of a big fish though. This tries to add meat to the bones with some double crossing humans chasing money, obviously. It doesn't really work and all peters out anyway in the final act as director Ben Wheatley seems to just decide upon dialing everything up to eleventy stupid. This isn't as good as the first film and that's saying something, it's riddled with holes and gets bogged down needlessly, but you're not watching a film like this for clever plot twists and philosophical narrative. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, there's lots of explosions, fights, peril, CGI monsters and it is fun to watch. Let's hope there's no Meg 3 though.","0 out of 11 found this helpful.

Meg 2: The Trench further expands the experience by bringing not one, but more megalodons and other sea creatures of prehistoric origin hidden in the depths of the ocean. The world is a vast place and many undiscovered species lie hidden, so the film offers us a glimpse into the possibility that some prehistoric creatures still roam the deep oceans. Jason Statham returns again and to be honest, he is one of the most essential elements of the film and his fight against the ocean creatures that pose a threat has become the most essential of this saga. It's the great British action star that makes this movie worth giving a shot. The special effects and action sequences are the most enjoyable. The movie has some humorous moments and there are script holes. It actually feels like a SyFy Channel movie, but that's what makes it quite enjoyable. It is a film that manages to offer a good amount of entertainment without the need to take it too seriously. Meg 2: The Trench is a sea monster show that does not seek to be a great movie, but to offer entertainment to the viewer. My final rating for this movie is 8/10.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Well, we have seen several times that this is not always the case. Despite the fact that Statham is an interesting actor, to which charisma contributes, this still does not save a bad film. A few effects and angry fish just aren't enough to make a bad movie a good one. The story is absolutely hilarious. At one point you'll wonder if everyone in the story is stupid or what. Then there are the ""action"" scenes. One of these is presented in the picture with which the film is advertised. A shark that overturns a small ship stops with its foot. Anyway, movies today are crap, no doubt about that. Thankfully, this world has Nolan, but his masterpieces are not made as fast as every true art. Meg is a joke. I give it 3 stars because of Statham and the fact people tried to make a movie.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's based on the 1999 novel The Trench by Steve Alten. It is s sequel to 2018's The Meg. It was written by Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber (The Meg, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Red 1/2, Whiteout, My Spy, and Battleship) with Dean Georgaris (Paycheck, The Manchurian Candidate, Bluff City Law, Quantum Leap, and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider 2). It was produced by lead actor Jason Statham (Expend4bles, Fast and Furious presents: Hobbs and Shaw, Viva La Madness, and Operation Fortune). The budget was $139 million and it grossed $395 million worldwide at the box office!!!!Five years after the previous events, Jonas Taylor (played by: Jason Statham from The Expendables franchise, The Transporter franchise, Crank 1/2, Fast and Furious franchise, Mechanic 1/2, Wrath of Man, Death Race, and Snatch) has been involved in fighting environmental crimes while also helping Mana One in exploring a further deep part of the Mariana Trench where the Megalodon had been found. Jonas has been raising teenager Meiying (played by: Shuya Sophia Cai from The Meg and Somewhere only we Know) alongside her uncle Jiuming Zhang (played by: Jing Wu from The Wandering Earth 1/2, Wolf Warrior 1/2, and Ride On), who acquired his father's company alongside financier Hillary Driscoll (played by: Sienna Guillory from Love Actually, Eragon, Resident Evil franchise, and Inkheart). Mana One has also been studying an 80 ft (24 m) female Meg called Haiqi, who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan. Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench, with Meiying stowing away to see the trench for the first time. Fellow Meg survivors DJ (played by: Page Kennedy from The Meg, S. W. A. T, and FML) and Mac (played by: Cliff Curtis from The Meg, Sunshine, Avatar: The Way of Water, Blow, Push, Training Day, and Bringing out the Dead) observe the group from the Mana One. Jonas and his team discover an illegal mining operation in a station captained by the mercenary Montes (played by: Sergio Peris-Mencheta from Resident Evil: Afterlife, Rambo: Last Blood, Snowfall, and Life Itself), who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes causes problems with Jonas plus his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities.The crew with the help of fellow Mana One analyst Jess (played by: Skyler Samuels from The Gifted, Scream Queens, and American Horror Story) and security officer Rigas (played by: Melissanthi Mahut from The Other Me, Assassin's Creed games, and The Sandman) discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged which forces the crew to use exosuits to walk towards the station in the creature-filled trench. As the crew surfaces, they discover the rupture from earlier which leads to several of the creatures, including the three Megs, a swarm of lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus escaping the trench and reaching the surface. The monsters are now out in the public and they are ready to feast. Everyone now must fight for their survival!!!!The Meg 2: The Trench is a little odd, it's basically two different films put together as one. The first half here doesn't really feel like a Meg feature at all but second half is exactly what you would expect from a sequel from the franchise. I know that they changed several things from the original source material for this follow up. I personally didn't mind them taking a different approach for the beginning here. It had a solid set up for all the characters. Action superstar Jason Statham in his element here, this is his bread and butter when it comes to cinema. The Meg 2 brings back several characters from the original which will make fans happy but it also adds multiple new cast members for The Trench. This one definitely got a mixed reaction on it's release but it performed great at the box office so who knows what future this franchise has. The original movie was much better but The Trench was still decent especially the second half which was a blast. They amped up everything at the end here. It's currently streaming on HBO Max so give it a shot!!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this movie, to be more precise, is like taking a shark and turning it into a Fast and Furious version of Godzilla. I kid you not, the most unbelievable thing about the whole film is that humans actually win. It's practically a masterpiece of human arrogance. Still loving how the director nails those unexpected shots perfectly. The writers really know how to put the massive Megalodon and us puny humans in scenes where the odds are totally against us. Jason Statham's action fits the audience's taste too, even though he's all swagger and bravado when facing these monstrous creatures, giving us some epic showdowns.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

In this place, Haiqui, a female megalodon that the director of the center intends to train, is kept imprisoned. Technological advances are evident, and now the team of marine ecologists can embark towards the unknown depths of the sea, however when the underwater expedition begins, Haiqui escapes.

As the deep-sea scientific team encounter the largest ferocious marine prehistoric predator that has ever existed - the Megalodon and in its own way wreaking havoc. Get ready for the ultimate adrenaline rush this summer in ""Meg 2: The Trench"" !. Dive into uncharted waters with Jason Statham and global action icon Wu Jing as they lead a daring research team on an exploratory dive into the deepest depths of the ocean! Immerse yourself in the most electrifying cinematic experience of the year with ""Meg 2: The Trench"" - where the depths of the ocean are matched only by the heights of sheer, unstoppable excitement !. New Meg. Old Chum. Back for seconds. There is always another one. Terror has never run this deep...Fear runs deep.You already know that this movie is about a prehistoric mega-shark rising from the depths and terrorizing the scientists crew. An inferior and literally larger-than-life thrill ride that supersizes the 2018 blockbuster and takes the action to higher heights and even greater depths with multiple massive Megs and so much more. It's a so-so action monster monster movie with a creepy creation of tension , thrills , terror and lots of bloody attacks. The released prehistoric man-eating Megalodon that joins with others of the same species deliver the goods, as the swimmers become their next meal while the scientists must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food. Here our heroes and heroines pitted against colossal Megs, gigantic octopus, huge toothy monitors and relentless environmental plunderers, our heroes must outrun, outsmart, and outswim their merciless predators in a pulse-pounding race against time. This is a peculiar rip-off to classic Jaws (1975) by Steven Spielberg and Piranha (1978) by Joe Dante, taking parts here and there of these films . Stars Jason Statham giving his ordinary acting as a two-fisted veteran deep-sea rescue diver must confront his fears and risk his own life and the lives of everyone trapped below. If you liked Jason Statham in the first The Meg movie, you will enjoy this follow-up with the iconic actor doing his thing, and facing more monsters than ever.

Sad...so sad...., although the story may be quite good, but how everything executed was total disaster. I know that I could not expect much, but this was way below my expectation. Meg 1 was entertaining, some ridiculous scene here and there were acceptable, but the Meg-2 was not just ridiculous but it just did not entertaining at all. Bad Jokes, bad dialogue, no sense of emotion, the movie seems does not trying to give anything to the audience except just people moving around on the screen... wow... just wooooowwww...

It's like Jurassic park meets jaws meets King Kong meets Godzilla. And it's got a littler bit of everything including science fiction (heavy on the fiction), suspense, drama, and comedy. There is a lot going on all at once, adding to the action and suspense. Just when you think one problem is solved, Jonas and crew have fifty more hurdles to climb.

This is certain one of those. Unfortunately, it didn't do it very well. The cast looked as if it had been recruited by an equal ops personal officer desperate to ensure that it was truly representative, though of course it still had the male macho lead ultimately triumphing over a very large fish. The story was banal in the extreme, the shock/horror content almost non-existent, and the fish not really very scary at all except for a few scenes right towards the end. There just wasn't enough megalodon and too many irrelevant sub-plots adding little or nothing to the narrative. There were lots of in-your-face graphics, but it is really lacked any sense of suspense and build-up to scenes, so became more of an action hero movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yes, The Meg was big and stupid, but I am pretty sure it was not bad. It was good at being stupid, making sure the audience was having fun the whole way. And it was an awesome celebration of the shark movie as a subgenre to boot!The Meg 2 is much harder to love. I went into it with the same expectations I had for the first Meg, and came away incredibly disappointed. First and foremost, nearly everything that happens in this film is entirely inexplicable. Secondly, no, this does not mean the movie is freewheeling and fun, as it still pretends to have a plot and wastes a lot of your time doing so, even when literally nothing adds up. At least the laugh out loud bad dialogue will keep you occupied.Third, and possibly most importantly for your enjoyment of the movie, almost everything that happens in the titular trench is worth fast forwarding. It's dark, hard to see, shaky cam, adr nonsense. Characters die and you will only notice moments later when a shoehorned line of dialogue confirms your suspicion that something just happened. All the creativity that could have been used to create a cool Subnautica inspired setpiece went into... something else instead.The problem with The Meg 2 is that for every moment of goodbad enjoyment it gives you, it makes you trudge through three moments of pain and drudgery. The Meg 2 is a beer that can only make you hung over, but never drunk. Here's hoping The Meg 3 still happens after this lurking pool turd ruined everybody's day.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's August, which is typically the slowest summer month at the box office. Since there isn't much coming out in theaters this month, we have to be pretty generous with those flicks we are willing to let entertain us. I'm not embarrassed to say that I have been looking forward to the sequel to The Meg, which came out it 2018. Let's pretend it's still Shark Week and enjoy the Meg 2: The Trench.Meg 2: The Trench takes place five years after the events of the The Meg. Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) has been fighting environmental crimes and continuing to be involved in the exploration of the Mariana Trench, where the Megalodons lurk. Taylor has also been involved in raising Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai), who's mother has passed away in the interim. Meiying's uncle, Jiuming (Jing Wu), has created a super-suit that allows people to travel into the depths of the trench to further explore the creatures below. Throw in some more pre-historic sea dwellers, some nefarious corporate overlords, and environmental jargon, and you've got a sequel to the original giant shark creature-feature. Chum-chomping hijinks ensue.Yes, I was looking forward to the ridiculousness that would be the sequel to The Meg, but I was disappointed by the direction of Meg 2: The Trench. The first hour of this flick is pretty boring. There is a lot of set-up of a new plot focused on environmentalism and corruption, and the Megalodon is only a vague specter in the background. These pre-historic sharks are supposed to be terrorizing the people populating this movie, but it takes too long to get to any of that. Moreover, the characters make very dumb decisions, especially the very annoying, Meiying. Teenagers are typically annoying in these disaster movies, but Meiying takes the cake. Then, the visual effects look bad as well. The underwater scenes are too dark, and the rest of it looks no better than a Sharknado sequel. This movie has to have a bigger budget than Sharknado!?!?!Statham does his best. He has that deadpan, action hero energy that we expect. He's fun despite how dumb most of this movie is. If Statham wasn't in this movie, it would have been a real slog. I'll also shout out Page Kennedy, who plays DJ, an engineer with Jiuming's company, Mana One. Although he's a fairly stereotypical black character in these disaster action movies, Kennedy is very funny. He has some of the best lines and some surprising action acumen. When Kennedy is on screen, you can expect at least a slight chuckle, which is better than the nothing that the rest of the movie is giving.Ultimately, Meg 2: The Trench is not the exciting sequel I was expecting. It has a boring environmentalism plot that isn't really important to the overall film. There is too much delay getting to the Megalodon and the action sequences. The acting and effects are no better than what you'd see in Sharknado. Except for Jason Statham and Page Kennedy, there really isn't much positive here. Am I being to harsh? I don't know. I can only give this one popped kernel and say only watch on streaming if bored.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

Jason Statham is back with a whole pod (or whatever the collective noun is) of giant prehistoric sharks. There's a subplot involving a rogue mining outfit who are mainly there as shark-bait.The first MEG just about got by on novelty value, despite blatantly rehashing the PIRANHAS franchise, which in its day was a mash-up of the JAWS compendium. The island resort finale in MEG 2 is a rehash too far, seriously stale. Jason, bless, tries to put some meat on the bare-bones script, but this role enhances his pension fund rather than his reputation.Stephen Spielberg's original 1975 JAWS had moments of high tension and shock-horror despite the plasticky-looking shark. There is no adrenaline rush in MEG 2 - and the CGI monsters sometimes look a bit plastic. Victims tend to be swallowed whole, often by the boatload, rather than bitten in half, so even the horror element is diluted.A major disappointment. Correction - a minor disappointment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If the answer is yes then this might not be the film for you.The first Meg film was something of a sleeper hit, suggesting people quite like watching giant sharks. The marketing for this film suggests the studio know people quite like giant sharks but they don't seem to have passed that information along to the people actually making the film since, after a brief introduction, the megs (and the cool giant octopus from the trailer) are mostly relagated to final part of the movie.Instead what you get is a series of bland, human focused, action set pieces. There's some dimly lit plodding through the titular trench, like a less good version of 2020's Underwater. Then there's some guys with guns running around a research station like a really crap Die Hard. Even the creature focused final act focuses as much on some dog sized land lizards (evolution has left them with legs despite millions of years confined to life underwater) giving the impression of a lame Jurassic Park.To be fair Jason Statham at least looks like he is having fun, especially when he gets to play around on jetski. He is joined by Wu Jing (basically the Chinese Jason Statgam) who is also enjoying himself despite the limited script. In fact all the cast do pretty well with what they are given.With the previous film taking a large bite out if the Chinese box office, The Trench doubles down on appealing to the same market. In addition to the casting the story is very China friendly, the bad guys are comically evil capitalists and while The Stath gets to kick ass it's teamwork that ultimately wins the day. Some people seem to really hate it when a big movie aims for an audience outside North America but personally I enjoy the slightly different flavour and it certainly is not the main issue here. That remains the lack of OTT fun.The Meg 2 is in on its own joke it just doesn't tell it loud enough.5 paddling puppies out of 10.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

Now with more Megs.There's something in the plot about villains mining a resource, stealing advanced technology and more investigation of the Trench,, but it is all quickly set aside for Monstrous creatures and our lead characters running for their lives.Frankly, this movie is SO dumb it stops being fun at one point.Constantly asking myself ""but why!?"" at most developments and constant unintelligent decisions from almost everyone involved made me want to stop watching. It is a spectacle, though!! And I can see why some might appreciating the last 40 minutes for the nonsense it brings to the screen. But aside from the well made sets and technological apparatuses (and overall look), I don't think I enjoyed anything in particular. The dialogue, action scenes, ""jokes"", characters and core story all leave a lot to be desired.Even if you like Statham, he doesn't shine as brightly. I do appreciate the scarce tense moments and the ""realistic"" stakes and constant deaths, but boy did I not like this.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

blown up, torn up, imploding up
All with the bestest of CGI.I got to say,
Jason Statham - is an all out action actor. He's so good and so corny and so good and so corny he's can do no wrong.He cuts the cheese like no other cheese cutter.Just a lovable magnificent performance. He's the Big Cheese that's the glue.Wu King - Kooky serious
Page Kennedy - Jive and relatable
Shuya Sophie Cai - Annoying and irritating teenThe direction by Ben Wheatley is first class.This is a reptile action adventure and He never lets you forget who the star of this film is. The reptiles. It's an all out Mammoth Reptilian Festival.Gnashing their teeth, dragging off their kills, using their brains.The writing team of Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Dean Georgaris has just enough of truth, backstory, comedy, suspense to not get too much stuck in a heady spin, or weighed down.A One Two punch of quick basic facts and then straight to the reptile-extravaganza.Brilliant move.The second theme is clever too.Finally, it's exciting and good cheese. Did I say foolish fun?You can actually take a break and come back and still have more to see!It's for everybody in the family.Sure it's a B film, but what a Great First Class Cheesey B film it is.

Ben Wheatlry puts his own dark stamp on the film, many of the scenes where people are eaten alive are genuinely scary and horrifying rather than just comical for adults anyway.. Plenty of chuckles but the laughter will die in your throat at times. The darkness will likely go over the heads of younger viewers or maybe they'll gleefully enjoy those deaths anyway. All sorts of creatures, not just Mrgs get loose, a giant octopus provides great fun as do lizards which act like Komodo dragons on speed as they chase and devour people. Some great underwater action as well, submersibles battling megs and weaving through rockfalls, also treks in exosuits along the trench bottom fighting the ferocious fishes. Jason Stratham shows how well he can react under pressure. We also get betrayals and a cute little dog. Well worth watching.

It wasn't Sharknado, or a Troma film or anything like that.It's like Jurassic Park/World but in the ocean.

This modern-day JAWS is packed with non-stop action under and above water throughout the whole film. It's Jurassic Park at Sea World. This film is a sequel, but it doesn't matter if you saw the first film, it completely stands on its own, yet if you have seen the first one, this one has WAY more action, they bring back a few of characters, they kill some off and you'll get a few extra laughs that will fly over some heads. To ALL the ladies out there, in Barbie, we men got Margot Robbie, in this film, you get Jason Statham. The movie is a typical fast-food action thrill ride that will have you wondering why you had to pay for the whole seat, when you will only need the edge.","3 out of 22 found this helpful.

The sea life is colorful yet dangerous. During their research they learn about the betrayal among their team. Meanwhile, the trench is breeched, and many dangerous creatures escape.Predator and prey relationships are established in the killer opening scene. Three Megs, a giant octopus, Mini-megalodons, that look like dogs who can swim and walk on land, and fighting between Statham's team and the traitors, provides all the nonstop action.Statham does an exceptional job playing the hero, as he wants to keep his team safe. Especially Meiying, who he takes care of since her mom is no longer around. His action scenes are spectacular as well, he makes bombs, gets into gun fights, and battles three Meg's on a Jet Ski, which is all very intense. Shuya Sophia Cai plays Meiying, a determined 14 year old. She just wants to prove herself as a scientist, that's why she sneaks onto the submarine. Jonas obviously isn't happy about this, but since they get stranded at the bottom of the ocean, there's not much anyone can do about it.The cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos was incredible. The way the scenes were shot, adds intensity and intrigue, which leaves the audience on the edge of their seat. Zambarloukos attached a camera to Statham's Jet Ski and just added the shark in later, that's some good teamwork. In addition, Statham also performed his own stunts, which is impressive. The designs of all the different creatures, is very creative. Meg 2: The Trench is an action packed sequel, waiting for thrill seekers to go see it in theaters.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was actually a better film than the first one and I was very impressed with Jason Statham's acting in such a caring and protective role where he was pure of heart and conviction while still smart and adept as always. It was thrilling to see him tackle a megalodon shark in the way he did and I was also really impressed by the entire crew.There were some refreshingly funny comedic scenes and the use of a .50 caliber in impractical but effective ways. I was both on the edge of my seat and laughing my head off on the random and truly never knew what to expect next.There were even a few jump scares that caught me entirely off guard but were welcome thrillers to offset some of the more serious moments. It had heartwarming love and connection at the core of everything.Still, the story pushed forward to also give emphasis to the importance of respecting nature and mankind's obsession with greed constantly getting in the way of coexistence with the other entities that share our space.

Then again it was pretty stupid in parts but overall a pretty decent film.The underwater stuff was interesting. The villain was an imbecile I was glad to finally see die. The kid was annoying. The sharks were menacing. I think it ticks all the boxes.Plenty of action, great CGI unless they were real sharks and they trained them really well. I found this to be entirely watchable. So many movies are truly so bad as to be unbearable viewing. This was a good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie was a mix between some perfectly timed comedy, heart pounding action, and terrifying ocean creatures.Love these ridiculous movies so much, I don't care what anyone says. The cast really make these movies fabulous. They really go all in and they bring what could be a mediocre movie into an amzing one! Also, the music choices are also topnotch.I really wish I could have seen this in theaters, I bet it was even more amazing on a big screen! I really hope all the cast come back for another movie, I would see it in a heartbeat. One can hope!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Compare to the first Meg this is Wayyyy Better","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9350171/?ref_=tt_urv","burungbirdz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur170980066/?ref_=tt_urv","30 September 2023","The first Meg was too cheesy, bad script, lots of bad acting and overall boring for me but This Meg 2 is way way better upgrades of acting, scripts, storyline, action and its much more make sense compared to Fast and furious ridiculous action scene if i may say so. So Meg 2 is worth it as entertainment. Hopefully Meg 3 will be more entertaining and much more fun, good job Meg 2 love it so much. Megs is for me means Mega Shark although from wikipedia it means megalodon but its okay for me thinking it means megashak right? Okay hope its more then 600 words, because i just write this praise Meg 2 as its way better than the first one.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","I liked this better than the first","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9411556/?ref_=tt_urv","theprestonator-37584","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68856279/?ref_=tt_urv","2 November 2023","I liked this one better than the first because there is more of a story and not just a big bad Meg. The action was great in this one as well. The storyline isn't spectacular but it's not meant to be. It's one of those movies that's a good popcorn movie. I didn't see it in theaters so it's probably better in theaters. But I still enjoyed it. Jason Statham is a great actor. I hope we get a third movie. The one thing I didn't like was just like the Jurassic World movies, the Megalodon is in captivity for research purposes. I don't like when franchises do this. Overall a solid movie and i recommend if you want a time killer.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Silly, fantastical, monster mayhem. Storyline is limited which is always enjoyable in a monster movie. This could be the US's Godzilla. Megalodon's and kraken's, oh my! If you love the kaiju genre you must give this a watch. Statham is wonderful as the deadpan hero. If he dives into this character type he could become a mega-star version of Bruce Campbell. The tongue and cheek humor is very entertaining but I'm here for the monster fights. Conspiracy, violence, and KAIJU!!!!!!!! What more could you ask for?This adaptation of Steven Alten's novels sets the stage for kaiju American-style! I'm here for it!!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Movie was fun didn't got boring at any point
It didn't required to watch frist part of the movie so it becomes more comfortable to watch
Not so complicated or too much scientific pretty basic and simple story
Some points movie fall back were 1. Its frist half movie gave very less screen time to the meg itself but was pretty much worth it as it builts the story
2. There were no tragic truns as frist part so movie became bit less thrilling
But over all it does its job perfectly movie makes you laugh and also curious at some points
No problem with vfx or cgi
Music is also well done
Highly recommend and also a fun movie to watch and chill.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Whatever happened to Ben Wheatley?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9269525/?ref_=tt_urv","searchanddestroy-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17559480/?ref_=tt_urv","19 August 2023","I won't speak about this movie for what it really is. If it would have been made by an unknown yes man, a bootlicker director seeking recognition from big studio executives - bankers, lawyers from Wall Street who know NOTHING about art nor movie quality, but only stock market and gross, gross and...guss what? GROSS. If this huge garbage trash has been made by such a film maker from nowhere, or even from a huge crap maker such as Roland Emmerich or his ""double"" Michael Bay, I would not have been shocked. But this director Ben Wheatley was, so far, a film maker with his own style, horror movies with some kind of personal touch, very weird but interesting. Small budgets most of the time, very worth discovering.... So what was my surprise and my disappointment to find out that he made this sh.... So that's my question, what happened to Ben Wheatley?....Imagine Ridley Scott, Steven Spileberg or Marty Scorcese directing FAST AND FURIOUS.... You would not speak about the genuine film quality - or not - but aboout your SHOCK. Am I right?","0 out of 11 found this helpful.

"","","I wasn't expecting much, but yikes.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9535587/?ref_=tt_urv","savvypatachonica","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8733980/?ref_=tt_urv","1 January 2024","The first one was really quite bad, but at least seemed self aware of its mindless creature feature nature. It still had the occasional jump scare and silly ""so bad, it's funny"" moments. This sequel has absolutely nothing going for it. I'm being generous with a 2/10. It was boring nonsense from beginning to end. Terrible performances across the board, worse than terrible writing with wall to wall cringe worthy dialogue... I get what they were going for trying to pack in other scary creatures but meh. Lame execution and didn't care enough about any single character to respond to what crazy thing was eating who.Maybe the stupid ""Chomp On This"" hip hop credits song would have been funny if any part of the movie had been remotely entertaining. Instead, it made it even worse because the confident tone of it only works if any part of the film had been successful and satisfying.Do not waste your time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
